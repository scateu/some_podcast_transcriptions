A date which will live

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
It's hardcore history

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
The blitz Edition

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
I'm very interested

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
In pain

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,992
Not a masochistic Carissa District way

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,296
I'm interested in pain and suffering

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,856
For much the same reason that

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
Virtually All of You Are

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,488
Look at the entertainment you consume

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,352
Take out all of the physical and mental pain and suffering what do you have left

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
It's a source of Art and always has been

20
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Because it's

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
Speaks to us on a human level

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
Does it matter how many things are different

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
With human beings Through the Ages and how much the culture changes us

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
How much the technology makes us different from our forebears

25
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
We can all understand pain

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
I think about it a lot

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,816
I say that I'm interested in the extremes of The Human Experience what does that mean

28
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
Sometimes I break it down I think it just means pain

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Mental and physical

30
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,848
You start to wonder about being so interested in that by James Baldwin the writer

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Wonderfully I thought when he pointed out that this connects us to each other

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Any road quote

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,392
You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
But then you read

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most with a very things that connected me with all the people who were

36
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
Oral I've never been alive

37
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
And quote

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
It's such a strange thing this pain right this

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Evolutionary

40
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,944
Adaptation that's probably saved more human lives than anything fear and pain together especially

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
The same time

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Think of the loophole

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,136
I think it's a loophole that I wouldn't want to fight say that it's an evolutionary feature

44
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Think of the

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,048
Loophole that the infliction of pain the ability to turn your own senses against U2

46
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
Hurt you

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Think about what a huge role that's played in history

48
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,568
Going from a place where the pain is so useful to tell you you just put your hand on a hot stove

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,664
To a place where somebody else can put your hand on a hot stove

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
To hurt you deliberately for one reason or another then all of a sudden

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
Those sensors that keep you safe

52
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Are the very

53
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
Weapon used to hurt you

54
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,512
To torment you and to compel you to do things against your will

55
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Strange thing this

56
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Sense

57
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,776
My reaction to other people's pain and suffering fascinating to isn't it

58
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
You can sort of run the gamut

59
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Anywhere from

60
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Empathy and sympathy

61
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Two kind of

62
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
Amusement or enjoyment

63
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Or

64
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
Maybe even you could say emotional voyeurism

65
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
But in our defense

66
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
Most of the time the kind of

67
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Pain and suffering we're enjoying is

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Back pain

69
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,520
Theatrical pain storytelling pain Hollywood pain and suffering

70
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
And no one getting hurt for real

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
But

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
The more real something seems

73
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,856
The more emotionally intense it can be and that can be more satisfied

74
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
My kids have been watching

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Live performances of plays on television and they make a big deal about how it's live and in front of you in more real that way

76
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
And I thought what if they did

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Action

78
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,335
Films or maybe not even the action film just the trailers the promos that run

79
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,431
Before the movie that you go to see assuming you still go to see movies

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
What is a

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,831
Did a live performance in front of an audience of that in a real car crashes

82
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Real bullets in the real guns

83
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
What would be a horror show wouldn't it

84
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
I think they go quickly off-script is the bodies piled up at

85
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
No person in there

86
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,983
Decent sensibilities would go to watch people killed in public for entertainment

87
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
But of course we all know

88
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
The people have done that

89
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
Which is the normal behavior

90
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,551
The one that says oh my God torturing and killing people in public for entertainment is barbaric

91
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
For the people that say

92
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,743
As someone from a time. Where this was common and approved of behavior might say

93
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Hey wait a minute

94
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
You just put a thin veil

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
Between what you like

96
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
And what we like

97
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
We both like the same thing

98
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
He just like yours to be faked

99
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,199
Whatever part of the brain is enjoying it maybe the same part is being titillated one way or the other

100
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
I'd like to warn those who might be squeamish

101
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,975
But this particular story is going to be very graphic indeed even by our standards

102
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
But the fact

103
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
That we need to issue such a warning

104
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
Because we might be too sensitive about this

105
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
Is it self fascinating

106
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Because once upon a time there were people

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
Who would appreciate a warning also about this kind of stuff at the warning that they wanted was the one that it was going to happen

108
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
So they made sure they got there and didn't miss the live version

109
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
And in fact for a lot of them

110
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
So that they can get the jump on the high ticket prices that we're going to be charged for the rooms close enough for you to actually Witness

111
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Smell see and hear

112
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Tortures and executions done live

113
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
There's a lot of fascinating things about us I think

114
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
In the story I want to talk about today but it all revolves around

115
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
The question of pain one way or the other end in the lot of the stories that we talked about the pain is everywhere in the

116
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
StoryBots

117
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Interspersed

118
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,439
And melded together with the topic in this story it is Center Stage

119
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
Once Upon a Time

120
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Not that long ago

121
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,215
Human beings went to public executions were torture was a huge part of the event

122
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
In order to watch and enjoy it

123
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
What the heck is that

124
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,247
Well we never promised answer is around here cuz there's no one qualified to give them

125
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,391
Questions about what this might say about us either today or back then

126
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Or

127
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
In perpetuity

128
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Pretty fascinating to but as I said

129
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
Not for the squeamish and if you want the people who can't handle this good for you

130
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Some of us

131
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
Are still fascinated by this

132
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Reasons

133
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
That I like to think are

134
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,199
High-minded and educational interesting I hope it's just not a

135
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Historical voyeuristic

136
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,927
Trip through time to do the equivalent of virtually sitting in the seat next to that

137
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,047
Spectator at the Roman Colosseum where he watches people devoured by lions

138
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
One of the things I have to keep reminding myself

139
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
Is that if I were born in a different place

140
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,079
In different time if you took a baby as I've always said from now in a time machine back to

141
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
This Roman era for example

142
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
You or your kid might be sitting down next to the guy eating the equivalent to popcorn while you watched wild beasts of

143
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
Flower people for your pleasure

144
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,463
It's obvious isn't it that there's a huge cultural influence on what's going on here

145
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,303
What's not obvious maybe at least not to me

146
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,399
Is which direction the cultural influences operating

147
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,055
Is it bloodthirsty times like the era of the Roman games in the Colosseum and whatnot

148
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Creating

149
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
Bloodthirsty human beings that like this stuff or is it

150
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Catering to

151
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
An innate need I mean this question gets

152
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Really deep when you ask

153
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
What's the default human setting

154
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,439
Or whether or not you enjoy watching others pain and suffering For Your Entertainment

155
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
Because the really uncomfortable question is to say that yes cultural influences are playing a huge role in whether or not people like this stuff

156
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
It's modern-day culture

157
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
Just making that stuff not as popular that used to be in other words

158
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,407
The default setting of humankind is to enjoy the stuff in the Roman Colosseum and it's only modern

159
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Enlightened

160
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Thinking and rationality and empathy with other human beings that is

161
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Sort of blunted that natural enjoyment

162
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
As we said a minute ago

163
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,279
The people from another time. Might argue if we started wagging are finger what they enjoyed

164
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
That we both enjoy the same thing

165
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
We just like our version to be fake

166
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
The human equivalent of that little

167
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Disclaimer you get at some movies where they'll point out that no animals were actually injured in the making of This film

168
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,735
Well these days we feel the same way about people that have for quite some time no people were actually injured in the making

169
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
This piece of entertainment

170
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
But there are people who are purists

171
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
It would say wash

172
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
I don't go in for that kind of fakery

173
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Make my

174
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
Torture violence and what not real

175
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
I'm not even sure

176
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
That that's true to be honest

177
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Depends on

178
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
You know what side of the bed I woke up

179
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
In the morning I'll senecal I'm feeling but

180
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
It does occur to me from time to time

181
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,735
But it's an untested unproven sort of an assertion that we in the modern develop

182
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,599
Enlightened posted like the world that we like our violence fake when were the

183
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,719
When were the public ever given the equivalent of a blind taste test on this

184
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,143
If we released two movies very similar to each other on the opening Blockbuster Summer movie Seasons first day

185
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
And they have to compete head-to-head

186
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,799
And one is a traditional full of movie Magic in the actors all get-out

187
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,359
You know just doing fine so the film

188
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
Has to go head-to-head against a groundbreaking new piece of performance art

189
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,855
It is so unusual that several of your favorite actor did not survive the production of this film everything you see and it is real

190
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Who do you think wins

191
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,327
You know after one week of ticket-buying you know how many people go to one film over the other what are the reviews

192
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
But I bet it's a hit

193
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
That would be weird when it is hard to imagine

194
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,847
So what if we imagine something that's just as weird but you could see it happening

195
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Imagine some tin-plated

196
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
Dictator in some poor impoverished countries already executing

197
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,111
Everyone he thinks is a criminal anyway probably publicly to

198
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
How is own people and keep his regime afloat

199
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
What if he just decided listen

200
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
There's a demand for this I could treat it like

201
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
One of those restaurants that serves endangered species on the menu where people would pay $10,000 a plate just to taste something

202
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
That you never tasted before no one will ever taste again

203
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
How many people have seen a public execution we did they pay to go

204
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Be interesting to think about list

205
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
Famous celebrities that might sign up for something like that just to say they went

206
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Selfie from the

207
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Live execution

208
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,159
I'd be interested just from the human experiment and data research soda

209
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
View of course

210
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,071
If the guy just inflated dictator decided to do it all Pay-Per-View globally

211
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
Esl

212
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
5995 get to see the execution will be some preliminaries with staging this for entertainment

213
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,895
Fire Winnie Stacy's big boxing tournaments righteous are you going to have opening acts

214
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,527
Walkout fighting is a whole bunch of things that go into keeping the public happy enough to want to buy this again

215
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
We don't get to be the dictator even of a chain plated

216
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
In a little country somewhere else without having a few

217
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
And bits of understanding how to play the crowd

218
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
I'd be very interested the day after

219
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Something like that occurred

220
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,239
To look at the statistics of which countries which regions which peoples

221
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,895
Body to the pay-per-view more or less when did be interesting to see which country shunned it or hardly bought at all

222
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Which is which countries

223
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
Really bought more than their share

224
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
I think that would be some interesting human data

225
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,927
Then I suppose we would have to hope that something like that when the numbers didn't show up

226
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
But they didn't show it was some sort of hit

227
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
Can you imagine how that would

228
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,655
Blow open the door to incentivizing any number of cash-starved tin-plated dictators

229
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
To Elbow their way into the

230
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,543
Lucrative in a virtual execution tourism Market

231
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:40,223
But even if something like that happened there is a layer of emotional protection mean you're not there

232
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Just like there's a layer of emotional protection

233
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Between you know a live 5995 pay-per-view execution and what a lot of people look at online right now

234
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
You can go see

235
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,095
Historic footage of assassination attempts and executions heck you can go watch

236
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
Some of the Nazis hung for their war crimes not the

237
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Big people in Orangeburg that there were lots of other

238
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,103
A punishment down the line and some of them are online and I don't think you were statist if you view it not at all

239
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
There's something different is it that happened a long time ago

240
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,087
There's some Detachment and it being a two-dimensional image maybe even a black-and-white certainly grainy whatever

241
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Takes you

242
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
More and more away from the scene and there's

243
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,767
You said yourself this is like watching a boxing match 35 years ago

244
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,375
I know the outcome and no one's hurting right now so somebody got hurt in that fight it's long over

245
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
But if you're watching it live it's not

246
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Let me just contemplate for a minute the idea of watching an execution live I mean if the laws change where you live in all of us

247
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
This became possible and they were going to have one

248
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
In the nearest good-sized city near you

249
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
How many of your friends and neighbors do you think would show up to watch

250
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Do you think there be a difference between

251
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
You know people who make a lot of money and people who don't make alot of money people have one religious Faith or people have no religious Faith or another

252
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
You see what I'm saying would be interesting to see

253
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Who showed up and why just has a

254
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Mass Humanity psychological experiment

255
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Would you go

256
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
If you did

257
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
What do you think would be the motivation curiosity

258
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Or

259
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
The idea that listen this isn't some stage thing like

260
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,879
You binge-watch on TV Anything could happen right you don't know what's going to go on one of these things

261
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,511
And if it was weird the first time that it happened how long

262
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
Do you think how many of these things would it take before people became comfortable with

263
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
If they ever became come

264
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
People with it

265
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,519
Let me blow your mind for a minute if you don't already know about

266
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
This

267
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Let's talk about an execution

268
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
That occurred

269
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,479
Not in the Middle Ages although you would think it was from there when you hear it

270
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Execution occurred in Paris

271
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,391
Not all that long ago as a matter of fact to give you an idea of context

272
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,231
George Washington is a full grown adult and is already

273
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,815
Been through a war and commanded troops in battle for the British

274
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
It involves a guy who tried to kill the king of France in

275
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
B1750

276
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
And in March 1757

277
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
He was going to pay for that crime

278
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
And hundreds of

279
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Thousands of people

280
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Flocked into Paris

281
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
To make sure they had a chance to see it

282
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
And according to historian Paul Friedland

283
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
The people of Paris

284
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Love

285
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Execution

286
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,487
He said that he italicized the word love

287
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
He had said that the

288
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Sovereign like all Sovereign throughout the history of the world that want to tell their people to stay in line that they were hoping that these

289
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
Public executions would terrify the population and

290
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,383
You know enhance the political sovereignty of the ruler but as Friedland points out

291
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
That's not always why the people were there and that's not always what they got out of it he says in the preface to his book

292
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
Seeing Justice Done

293
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Quote

294
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
But I hope to make clear in this book however

295
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Spectators of executions in early modern France did not tend to see the penal spectacle as a manifest

296
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
Station of political sovereignty

297
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Neither were they terrified

298
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
In fact I loved attending execution

299
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
From the 16th to the middle of the 18th century

300
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Public executions in France

301
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,455
Extraordinarily popular with Spectators from all social class

302
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
Many of whom were so desperate to watch that they rented out windows overlooking the place of execution at exorbitant

303
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Dim sum

304
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,279
Or staked out Prime viewing spots near the scaffold run nearby rooftops off and days in advance

305
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
And quote

306
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
And what was the mood of this crowd that

307
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
Stormed into Paris that day to watch this event

308
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Friedland wrightson

309
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
Please excuse my traditional mangling of the French language when I

310
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Disgusting

311
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
Traditional execution site in Paris

312
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Quote

313
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
Every credible primary source give the impression that the people who own the plaza to grab that day

314
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Could barely contain their excitement

315
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Is the Fateful hour near

316
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
Terror could not have been further from their minds

317
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
Unless of course we count the terror of missing even a minute of the spectacular show that was about to take place

318
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
And quote

319
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
He then talks about

320
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
A guy

321
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Colette

322
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,895
Is his name would like to go to these executions

323
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
And how he showed up

324
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,807
Quote on that special day he arrived bright and early to see the show

325
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Friedland rights

326
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,183
And brought along with in the 18th century equivalent of movie popcorn

327
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Now quoting from

328
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Galette

329
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279

Quote

331
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
I showed up at 7 in the morning

332
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:49,471
And found a good many of the windows of the rooms on the graph already filled with Spectators of both sexes

333
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,847
I was placed by Madame Superior The Establishment had a window on the first floor

334
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,431
And I had as companions and curiosity three gentlemen

335
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
I added my little store of Provisions to theirs and around noon We Dine together with a fineapple

336
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Appetite

337
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
And quote

338
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Ladies and gentlemen

339
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,047
Batman 2 describing an 18th century version of a tailgate party

340
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:21,215
And it will be hours before the event itself takes place he people are partying it up in anticipation of this

341
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Guide event

342
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
And this giant event

343
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Is gruesome

344
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Any extreme

345
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
And what were these people so excited to watch

346
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Well

347
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
The most

348
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,391
Spectacular and that's the words of many different people not me

349
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,023
Execution of that age and it was spectacular cuz it was unusual cuz they hadn't done one of these

350
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,607
Really nasty ones in a while so everyone wanted to see it

351
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
What's so nasty about it

352
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
Well it was published ahead of time what was going to happen to this guy

353
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,079
He notices so that people would know what they were coming to watch

354
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,199
And so they would know exactly what happened to people who tried to

355
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
Sticking knife between the Kings ribs

356
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,391
The Prisoner was sentenced to have big chunks of his flesh torn out of his breasts

357
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Arms thighs and calves

358
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
His right hand

359
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
Which is held the knife this is very symbolic

360
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,167
What's to be burned it said by fire and sulfur

361
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,519
And then all the places where he had the flesh torn out of his

362
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Body would have and I'm quoting here

363
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,687
Molten lead boiling oil burning resin

364
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
Wax and sulfur melted together

365
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
Poured right into the womb

366
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,511
And then his body was to be dismembered by four horses

367
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
Can we gain this Bears some

368
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,727
Delving down into what we're talking about here in this is gruesome but I'm sorry but

369
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
This is juxtapositioning

370
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
What weird

371
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,919
Seeing here with these human beings who want to go watch it

372
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
And the more horrible it is

373
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
For many of us the harder it is to understand the desire to be there

374
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Involved in the process

375
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
But an enormous crowd of people turned out to do just that

376
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
And a very famous book called discipline and Punishment

377
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,520
The officer of the watch this executions account was reprinted

378
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
This is a primary source

379
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Pairs with

380
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
The crowd saw

381
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Quote

382
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,344
The sulfur was lit but the flame was so poor that only the top speed of the hand was burnt and that

383
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Only slightly

384
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
Denny executioner his sleeves rolled up

385
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Took steel pincers

386
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
What you been especially made for the occasion

387
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
And which were about a foot-and-a-half long

388
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
And pulled first at the calf of the right leg

389
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
When is the thigh

390
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
And from there

391
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
At 2 fleshy parts of the right arm

392
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Then at the breast

393
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,712
There was strong sturdy fellow this executioner found it so difficult to tear away the pieces of Flesh

394
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
But he said about the same spot two or three times

395
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Twisting the pincers that he did so

396
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,464
Emily took away form did each part of wound about the size of a 6 lb Crown piece

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
After these pairings with the pincers

398
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
Damian Who Cried Out profusely the without swearing The Source says

399
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
Raise his head and looked at himself

400
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
The same executioner dipped in Iron spoon in the pot containing the boiling potion Witchiepoo

401
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Poured liberally overreach wound

402
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
At each torment

403
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,040
He cried out as the Damned in hell are supposed to cry out

404
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
And now he's saying what The Condemned is screaming

405
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
Pardon my God pardon Lord

406
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Despite all the pain The Source says

407
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,840
He raised his head from time to time and looked at himself boldly

408
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
And quote

409
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,752
Some have theorized that this condemned victim was mentally ill

410
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
And that

411
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
He committed this crime and then paid this punishment and these days would have been seen as psychologically unbalanced

412
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
The fact

413
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:22,880
That the crowd could watch all this though and not be made psychologically unbalanced is interesting

414
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,232
The AC control in the Hanging Tree

415
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Points out

416
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,608
That you do not have a bunch of people watching

417
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Those proceedings we just described

418
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,728
Vomiting or anything

419
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
How many people could come back

420
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,896
From our time period now be placed in the crowd to watch this thing live

421
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
And not vomit

422
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
It's strange to think of something that seems like an

423
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,088
Automatic uncontrollable response

424
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
Being something that's actually

425
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,768
In a culturally influenced by control points out that crying is laughing is what you find

426
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
You know I'm using is I mean all these things that may seem to be

427
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,704
Hardwired into what are cultural distinctions including whether or not you vomit

428
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,800
While watching a horrible torture execution or maybe

429
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Whether or not you like it

430
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Storing Garrett G Fagan

431
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Recants the Great

432
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Rake

433
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Casanova who is there

434
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
And walk Casanova was appalled

435
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
He looked at other people

436
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,672
And not only weren't the Apollo they were liking it

437
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
He says this is fake and writing quote

438
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,400
Casanova who considered the spectacle quote and offense against our common humanity and quote

439
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,216
Reports that he several times closed his eyes

440
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
And blocked his ears to the atrocity

441
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,408
But that his companions were riveted by the spectacle and never once diverted their gaze

442
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,528
They felt no compassion for Danielle and they said due to the enormity of his crime

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,344
Casanova's friend to redis

444
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,464
Even had surreptitious sex with one of the women while the ghastly execution proceeded

445
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Other eyewitnesses describe members of the crowd especially the ladies watching with detached disinterest

446
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Reven chattering and laughing

447
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
And quote

448
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:19,104
I should point out that this was a particularly extra nasty execution

449
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
The these people enjoyed

450
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
Because The Executioner's really didn't know what they were doing

451
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,808
Been done one of these executions in a while

452
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
And when things didn't go as planned they had to improvise for example when they were trying to tear this person apart with four

453
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
Horses pulling in different directions

454
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
He didn't tear apart

455
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
They had to work

456
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:45,984
You know by cutting the joints and seeing if that would help with that didn't help the head to start pulling the limbs in different directions

457
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
And people

458
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,408
Would have considered this because they were looking for novelty and the unexpected perhaps

459
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
An added

460
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
The reason this is so interesting

461
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,368
Is how many of us could have gone

462
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
I seen that

463
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
What's different about us

464
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,048
And people only a couple hundred years ago

465
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,376
Who has I said didn't just go and watch this and endure it

466
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,216
Let's sacrifice and paid a lot for the privilege

467
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,824
Are we the more normal example of

468
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
People on the default setting when it comes to watching

469
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Other people suffering

470
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
Or they

471
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
Or maybe that's too cut-and-dried a distinction

472
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Maybe it depends

473
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,744
On who's the pain and suffering is being experienced by

474
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
What if the person

475
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,424
Who is providing the entertainment the person being torn apart the hapless victim

476
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Is not in fact

477
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
So hapless

478
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,616
And maybe has a lot of victims themselves every what if you are doing this to a horrible

479
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Murderous dictator

480
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
You think you're bad people from history

481
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
I always throw Hitler in there because he sort of my quintessential example but you can fill in the blanks write you have some terrible terrible person

482
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,744
Go Saddam Hussein maybe in a rock and let the Shiites in Iraq

483
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Watching being torn limb to limb

484
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
Does that take an attitude which if it was anyone else you would be horrified that you were enjoying watching this

485
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Spectacle because it's that

486
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,800
Demonic individual

487
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
You going to enjoy every last shriek

488
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
Now the actual idea

489
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
For this

490
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,808
Talk today this discussion came to me

491
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,136
After re-reading a book that's very interesting it's the

492
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
It's a book about the diary of

493
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
An executioner

494
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Lived in the

495
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
In 15 1600 in that.

496
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
And it was fascinating because

497
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,288
It reminds us that there are multiple shall we say

498
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Viewpoint

499
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:03,712
In all of these Affairs that we were just discussing these tortures terrible execution will obviously

500
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,064
We've been focusing on the audience the people that would like to watch this stuff and isn't that sick

501
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
Or

502
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
Maybe not depending on what

503
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Really

504
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Human

505
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
But there are other angles

506
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
They're just as fascinating that book on the Executioner

507
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,864
It was fascinating to think about the person tasks

508
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,936
Would you doing this I was bad as it is to watch it

509
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
What about the person who molested

510
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
Carry out the actual things

511
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,384
The modern sensibilities would suggest even watching should make you sick

512
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,736
So that became

513
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,088
The Germ of an idea to look at this for multiple Vantage points because you have

514
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
The crowd

515
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
The Executioner and of course the vantage point

516
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Of the victim

517
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
If you want to

518
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,912
Wonder about what goes on in the minds of people in extreme situations

519
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
What is it like to mount that scaffold

520
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
Haven't had plenty of time to think about what you're about to face

521
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Get up there and look out

522
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,736
A crowd of thousands of people that have come to watch you go through with your about to go through

523
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
And then begin to go through it

524
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Bit by bit

525
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Sometimes

526
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
For hours on end

527
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
If you want the understatement of the century there's a quote attributed to

528
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Robert Francois

529
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:31,520
As he's let out to go begin his ordeal that would take hours and end up with him in pieces

530
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
He just said

531
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
Rumor Has It Anyway

532
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
It's going to be a hard day

533
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,344
I wonder if there was a way to add up all the people in human history

534
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,416
The found themselves in that same position that

535
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
It's going to be a hard day

536
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,560
So the position execution victims since the dawn of time

537
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
I wonder how many of those people there were

538
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,008
I mean public executions have pretty much been going on since history has been

539
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
Written down right we all understand

540
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
But it's not

541
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,920
Ubiquitous it's not everywhere all the time but my goodness

542
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
You know the amount of

543
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Cultures over the arrows that utilize public executions

544
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
He is far more common than not

545
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,720
As we said earlier it's an obvious purpose for the state doesn't it

546
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
It's a message

547
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
And the Assyrians

548
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,728
In one of the earliest people to carve this message in stone showing what they did to people who broke their

549
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
Biggest laws

550
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,616
That's a way of making sure that even if you weren't there to watch it live you can still get the message

551
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,992
Herodotus the so-called father of History so that's how far back we're going here

552
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
Tells the story which may or may not be true

553
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,880
That one of the early Kings of Persia can't Pisces II

554
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Force the Nobles of Egypt

555
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:59,584
To convene in a public place to watch 2000 of their children killed in front of them

556
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
That's not for entertainment value because you can't imagine a more horrifying seeing if that were true right away

557
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
What is that sound like

558
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,920
But it sends a message doesn't it from the ruler Persian all the people in Egypt

559
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Interstate Concord

560
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
Or this will happen again

561
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,952
The Chinese having been around essentially forever is a civilization also

562
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,280
Very familiar with the use of public executions

563
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
As a tool of

564
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,376
Of enforcing state power and sovereignty

565
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
And they've been around so long they've been able to

566
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Live through many different eras

567
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Where are the ideas of legal reform and capital punishment will change

568
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
Some more liberal some quite Draconian indeed

569
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
The Chinese are one of the very early civilizations

570
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
To attempt to deal with crime

571
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
In a way that sometimes comes into Vogue

572
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
This idea that

573
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,976
What if you just punished every little teeny crime in the most severe way

574
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,536
Wouldn't that just deter everything

575
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Moron that later

576
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,472
In the new world of course there are plenty of examples the Aztecs with their

577
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
Tearing of the beating heart out of the sacrificial victims were there war captives or not

578
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
In the northeast of the United States famously other tribes there used to torture people to death in the tri would gather round and

579
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Take part in it including

580
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
Allegedly children to

581
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
In the Warrior wood

582
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,536
You know who is being tortured or the woman who is being tortured or what have you would defiantly

583
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
You know

584
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,888
Resist the torture is me could go on for days

585
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216
All these things someone who probably point out

586
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
Have a religious element to the

587
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,384
There's a huge ritual involve so maybe it's not so much

588
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,456
You know that these humans are getting a kick out of watching this thing

589
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,344
There are other deeper questions involve which is true but one wonders how much it alleviates

590
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,720
The fact that people may have been having a good time watching this you can't tell for example

591
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,304
You look back on the Assyrian reliefs the carvings were they show

592
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
But they are impaling their victims on Stakes

593
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,984
You can't tell if there's a crowd there and there be no way to tell if they were having a good time

594
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
You first start seeing that phenomenon

595
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
In Rome

596
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Bright

597
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Famously

598
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
At the gladiatorial games

599
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,088
And people showing up the way you would go

600
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
To a pro wrestling match today

601
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
If the wrestlers were fully armed

602
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,328
And left a lot of dead people at the end of the show on the ground

603
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
And animals by the way

604
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,240
This is where you clearly can see because the records are so good

605
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
And the

606
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
Connection between enjoyment

607
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
And horrific

608
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Torture and

609
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Suffering

610
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Is so obvious

611
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,832
Mean you can write it off 900 different ways but at the end of the day

612
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,416
These people are enjoying themselves and going to Great Lengths

613
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
To make sure they don't miss

614
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
In these horrific

615
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,376
Murderous encounters that will play out in front of them in real time

616
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
So let's look at Rome for a minute

617
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,128
As part of an evolution or maybe you could call it like you don't really like to grasp history

618
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
If you had a wonderful graph like a stock market graph for periods in time we're human beings overtly wanted to

619
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
You do this more for whatever reason including

620
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
A culture that might really encourage it

621
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
The Roman gladiatorial game era

622
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,840
Maybe the high watermark in history on that graph because it's hard to find anything

623
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
White so

624
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Brazen

625
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
About the commercialization

626
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Marketing

627
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
And

628
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
Staging

629
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
Of

630
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Torture and death

631
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
As a spectator event

632
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
When it's fascinated people for a long time

633
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
I mean cuz it's so obviously an interesting question about

634
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
Humanity and Human Nature

635
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
Rome's Arenas and the violence that was perpetrated in them in the

636
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
The almost modern marketing of

637
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:25,056
The understanding of what the customer wanted and how things should be advertised in the order that it is

638
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
When should happening

639
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
As I said a minute ago stage

640
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,224
And also many of the modern media

641
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:37,088
So the Dynamics were also implied the need to continually for example

642
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,696
Provide new and novel and more inventive and grandeur

643
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
Spectacles to keep the people coming back

644
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
And there's all sorts of theories on how this developing

645
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:56,032
There's this linear progression from in a very early Roman things and then layer-by-layer new things get added three

646
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,592
Example when Rome becomes Morgan Empire

647
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,176
It starts conquering more far-flung places you begin to see

648
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,016
The importation of exotic animals from strange locale

649
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,136
And this becomes part of the van right when an animal show the local arena

650
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,720
And the people can come and look at the animals but somehow that turned into

651
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:20,864
People can come and look at the animals kill each other and have men kill the animals that animals kill the men in

652
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,960
Listen to the scale of what we're talking about this becoming eventually

653
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,288
And bear in mind this idea that once upon a time

654
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,432
It'll probably advertising that you had a giraffe and a monkey and an elephant might be enough to bring the people into the seats

655
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
But eventually you got to go

656
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Two extremes

657
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
Will Durant writing a long time ago

658
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Says quote

659
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,560
The simplest event in the amphitheater was an exhibition of exotic animal

660
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
Gathered from All the known world

661
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Elephants

662
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,448
Lions tigers crocodile

663
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Hippopotami lynxes

664
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Apes

665
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Panthers

666
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Boars

667
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Bears

668
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Wolves

669
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Giraffes

670
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Ostriches

671
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Leopard

672
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
Antelopes and rare birds were kept in the Zoological Gardens of Emperors and Richmond

673
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
And we're trained to skillful exploits

674
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
Or marry prank

675
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
Apes were taught to ride dogs

676
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
Drive chariot

677
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
We're acting plays

678
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
Bulls let boys dance on their backs

679
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,984
Sea lions were conditioned to bark an answer to their individual names

680
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Elephants

681
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Dance to symbols

682
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Struck by other elephants

683
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
Where they walked on a rope

684
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
Or sat down to table

685
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,456
Or Rhodes Greek or Latin letters

686
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
And quote

687
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,088
Sounds like something you take your kid to at this point doesn't it

688
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Durant then continue

689
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Quote

690
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,512
Animals might be merely paraded in brighter humorous costume

691
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,096
Usually however they were made to fight one another

692
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Or with men

693
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,448
Where they were hunted to death with arrows and javelins

694
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,800
In one day under Nero 400 tigers

695
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Fought with balls and elephant

696
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,944
On another day under Caligula 400 bears were slain

697
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,296
At the dedication of the Colosseum 5000 animals died

698
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,392
Is the animals wish to compromise

699
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
Meaning not fight each other

700
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,536
They were stung to combat by lashes darts and Hot Irons

701
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,888
Claudius made a division of the praetorian Guard fight Panthers

702
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,984
Nero made them fight 400 bears and 300 lions

703
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
And quote

704
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
Now let's just stop for a minute and think about this

705
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,040
Can you imagine what that looks like we talked about some of the greatest show men in the modern era and the

706
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
Sorts of exploits they pulled off

707
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,952
Who's the promoter that comes up with the idea of let's have

708
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,072
Hundreds of the royal guard fight hundreds of lions

709
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
And what does that look like

710
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Here's the thing though

711
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
We might do a movie

712
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Today

713
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
With the concept of a war between

714
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,408
Human armies in Lion Army 300 praetorian guard against 300 lions

715
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:20,576
But it involves a lot of CGI and stuff like that when did a lot of Graphics maybe your computer and all that the Romans

716
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,208
Don't mess with any that they didn't have the ability obviously but at the same time you know maybe they didn't like their

717
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,792
Wild crazy fantasy stories fake

718
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Do you want to see human armies against

719
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
Lion armies don't turn it into a Lord of the Rings movie

720
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Do it live

721
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
On the stage in front of an audience

722
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
It's an absolutely

723
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
Crazy seem to imagine though isn't it

724
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
No matter how you break it down

725
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
That is so weird

726
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
Would you watch it if it were on

727
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904
Available from some video site right now

728
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Would you watch it live

729
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Now here's the thing

730
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,936
That falls in the weird category to me more than it falls into the

731
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Terrific stuff

732
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:15,104
Well that's a terrible thing to say but but I mean in terms of just raw human cruelty

733
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,200
There's almost a sporting element to the other if you really sort of sick

734
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
The Lions might win

735
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
For the people might win the mean

736
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,928
In one of the injector stand about the Roman too many if you've course already do is they will bet on anything

737
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,096
And just because we're pointing out the really Bloodsport aspect of what they loved they loved it all

738
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,192
Horse races chariot races sporting events that were bloodless I mean all of it

739
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,848
And a good day at one of the Arenas like one of the good ones in Rome rooms like the New York City in the Broadway of

740
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
Of these sorts of shows bigger better and

741
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,504
All the highest caliber performers are in Rome

742
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
The other Arenas are some of the Off-Broadway people

743
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
But a full good day at a place like the Forum involves all sorts of stuff with the violence be

744
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,864
Being just one element in a good promoter and somebody staging this thing the right way knows how to make

745
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Some performances Maybe by your favorite singers with some good stuff in between some religious messages here or there for the kid

746
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,336
What's a whole bunch of stuff and if you were really good

747
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,480
Lunch time at lunch time you run down to the bottom of the Coliseum and everybody would get lunch at the same time but of course you know

748
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,088
You still got to have something for the people who are coming back with their lunch a little early you can't have

749
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Nothing on stay so that was when

750
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,488
You know the pure executions would often take place

751
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Lunch time

752
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,912
The Roman writer say they're usually less people in the stands but because of the empty seats

753
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Those people

754
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:49,824
You don't have more of a chance or so the influence the way things went naked yell stuff out and

755
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,479
People would do what they said sometimes another words to please the crowd if you had some person that you were slowly

756
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,319
Putting to death in front of the people that have come out of the food quarterly

757
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,207
And they had a good suggestion you do it for him write anything to keep their folks happy and coming back next week

758
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,815
And once again you can't help but sit there and go

759
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Who else ever did that

760
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
Some of these histories I've been reading make it plain that

761
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:23,103
You're normally and I tend to fall into this category to you think everything has happened before somewhere

762
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,687
In history right there's nothing new Under the Sun is the old saying goes

763
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
But you'd be hard-pressed to find

764
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Any widespread

765
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,647
Similarity anywhere else to what the Romans were doing

766
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:41,535
In these games except for these territories that the Romans took over and spread the Games 2

767
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
One of the

768
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:48,703
Interesting arguments used against those who suggest that this is a particularly Roman thing

769
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,775
Is how popular these games were

770
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:57,151
When they sprouted up in places that have never had them before in the locals found that they like them

771
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
Quite a lot to

772
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
But this

773
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,599
Ability to actually control what was done to the victim

774
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:10,463
The giving the mob essentially the people with the loudest voices are the highest paying customers

775
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
The right

776
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,815
To control the action is like a god-like power

777
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
Think about

778
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
The virtual reality video game

779
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,263
Element that I just been added to a real

780
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,311
Situation in real time

781
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
It's registering Gary Chief egg and rice

782
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Lights quote

783
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,223
The execution phase of Arena spectacles

784
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,039
Cannot have been anything other than viscerally brutal

785
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,831
This was sheer murder

786
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
The disposal of what was considered human garbage

787
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,207
While the Roman writer

788
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Seneca

789
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,815
Was repelled by what he saw during the lunch time break

790
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:51,679
He recorded various comments that the people shouted out is The Butchery proceeded

791
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
They demanded various types of action

792
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,591
Seneca adds a further noteworthy detail often-overlooked

793
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
All of this happened when the arena was practically empty

794
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,271
Pure Butchery apparently was not to everyone's taste

795
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
And quote

796
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,135
Eden points out that Seneca trying to make a point about how we know

797
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,951
Crowds are bad for your morals and attend

798
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,535
Go down to the lowest common denominator essentially in a crowd

799
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
But then he says quote

800
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,191
Seneca's account reveal something of the spectators mental state

801
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
During execution

802
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,383
Their ability to direct the course of action on the sand would have strengthened an already formidable sense of him

803
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Empowerment

804
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Indeed the ultimate sense of empowerment

805
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
Over life and death itself

806
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,623
This was one of the clearest manifestations of the crowd as Domini

807
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
Lords of the Arena

808
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,255
The crowd nearly called out its wishes to see them enacted

809
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
And quote

810
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,887
It's at this point I had to take three steps back for a sec

811
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
That is such a wickedly weird

812
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Concept

813
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
If you think about it I mean if you really go

814
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,359
What the heck was that like

815
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
To have a person

816
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
Walking to the arena

817
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,039
Is Dermatology Kyle describes the missing you naked or nearly naked

818
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,831
With a placard eater

819
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,135
Held with them around their neck

820
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Explaining what their crimes are in their sentence

821
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
Is and then tying them to a

822
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Steak

823
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
Or he says

824
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Alternatively

825
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
Just leaving them in the arena alone unarmed

826
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
To face the Fate

827
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
Davis sentenced fate that they're supposed to face but as

828
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Astorian

829
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Garrett G Fagan pointed out

830
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:39,967
It might be open to interpretation depending with the crowd one that you want to burn somebody there's fire there you want

831
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,783
Rip pieces of the map Arthur's implements available

832
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,647
You want to pour something hot molten metal of some sort on then we got some right here

833
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
As I said before I am fascinated by the extremes of

834
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
The Human Experience

835
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
And I'm not sure

836
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,447
There's anything far greater in terms of extremes and being a condemned

837
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
Imprisoner is going to die

838
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
The execution

839
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
If you had a scale of like

840
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,015
Easiest way to be executed and hardest way to be executed I think these days we do it about as easily

841
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,087
As we can make it Lethal Injections and stuff like that

842
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,231
Our sensibilities are different than the sensibilities of these earlier eras

843
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Where

844
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,583
People dying execution wasn't

845
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
The goal

846
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
It was a byproduct

847
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,287
Did the goal goal was the suffering and in the case of Rome the suffering wasn't just to pay for the crime

848
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
It was to entertain the crowd

849
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
I'm hard-pressed to find a situation

850
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,783
In terms of being executed and putting yourself in the position of the condemned

851
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
It would frighten or scare me or drive me out of my mind as I thought about what was going to happen as much as

852
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
The situation

853
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
You know in the Roman Arena

854
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
But this may be personality Bass

855
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,215
Can you go to some of these other cultures the Japanese thought about every way that they can

856
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,799
Possibly kill convicts and prisoners and people they don't like for example

857
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,591
Maybe they'll boil you

858
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,455
Does it help if you know that's what they're going to do tomorrow morning you're going to get boiled

859
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
It was a history I was reading

860
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Connected to this and I'm going from memory here

861
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,951
But they've been talking about someone who's going to be beheaded in the morning and then the question was how does one prepare

862
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Hair themselves

863
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
For that

864
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
The night before

865
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
What's going through your head

866
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,703
What are the mental and physical preparations I mean it's not the kind of thing that most people

867
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
Throughout history have had to think about right although

868
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,407
We all know is I think I said earlier if you added up all the people throughout history that have been in this position it's a sizable number

869
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
If you're someone like

870
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Yourstruly though

871
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,647
And someone says you have a choice between knowing what they're going to do to you tomorrow or not knowing what they're going to do tomorrow

872
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Banality wants to know

873
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,719
For whatever reason

874
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:05,375
So for me the idea that you could go into this Arena ostensibly to be lit on fire and burned to death but

875
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,215
But you know if the crowd has a better idea we may go with that that would frighten me more

876
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,543
Then having someone's everything to tear you apart tomorrow with Tom

877
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
At least I can sort of mentally

878
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
Prepare myself how would someone

879
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Prepare themselves to be beheaded in the morning

880
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,503
It would sure help to know that that's what was coming at least

881
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,319
Is my personality is sort of organized

882
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,439
Now what might they do to you

883
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Well

884
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:36,095
The sky's the limit in terms of the inventiveness of man of try to figure out ways

885
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,143
Not just ways to

886
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
You know add a little

887
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,287
Variety to the situation but ways that would even

888
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Entertain the crowd

889
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
If you go down the list of things

890
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,015
Crucifixions on their butt crucifixion slow

891
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
So they often would combine

892
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
Donald G Kyle says

893
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,695
Crucifixion with some other punishment that they like

894
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
Fire was used a lot they like fire in the arena

895
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
But you know and it surprised me to actually read this I didn't know this

896
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,519
The Kyle says that the number one way people died in the arena

897
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,823
Do to Beast

898
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
In a wild animal

899
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,223
And while I knew that that was big in the arena I had no idea

900
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,783
But it might be the number one cause of

901
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
Death to the people they were dragging out of there

902
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,695
I dunno and Kyle has something in his notes about it where he says

903
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,999
That there was quite an emphasis

904
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,047
On finding these animals

905
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:44,447
For the arena by the way just like there was a big emphasis on finding the people for the Arena 2

906
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,847
It's very strange to think about this but here in the New Media world we always talk about needing content

907
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,639
To keep the audience satisfied will

908
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
If you think about it that way and they did

909
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
The content that was needed

910
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,111
At these games and not just the ones that wrong but all the Off-Broadway areas to

911
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Worthy

912
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
People

913
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,487
Who's going to die in the arena while we got some slaves and

914
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
This is actually true they have

915
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,887
New accounts where they try to figure out okay we got some slaves from this Uprising in

916
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
Are you there

917
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:21,311
Okay let's parcel them out they need them for games here they needed for games here I mean literally it is providing content for these shows

918
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:26,431
And as I said there's other things that the show the performers in magicians and jugglers all kinds of fun things

919
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
But if you were to look at the

920
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,295
Posters that they put up all over the city announcing

921
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
But these are coming

922
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
The violent parts are often

923
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
What are the main events

924
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,767
And in terms of animals to get back to the Beast

925
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Question

926
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,583
Kyle says that they wanted

927
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,983
Real wild ones I didn't want anything raised in captivity they didn't want anything that have been in captivity very long because

928
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,383
After all if you're selling we have a lot of wild Lions on your little posters all around your City to get people to come to the show

929
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,783
You don't want them to get there and find out that the Lions don't do much cuz they just waiting for you to throw their typical meat lunch to them

930
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,367
You want something that's going to go after these people you've tied to the crosses

931
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
And I should point out

932
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,255
But I don't want to go there because there's a lot of controversy

933
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,559
At the how far you can take

934
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
What was going on in the arena because there's accounts that

935
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
May or may not

936
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,239
Try to overhype some of this stuff

937
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,311
But there are stuff and it again I don't want to get into it

938
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
I mean there's stuff about women are going to come in here and be forcibly raped by Bulls before their

939
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:36,319
Put to death any whether or not these things happen the thought that that would even be thrown out there

940
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,159
Buy some inventive mind is something that people would like to see

941
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Is extremely disturbing

942
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
For modern person

943
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,863
And this is perhaps a sexist way of thinking but I think it's ingrained in some of us

944
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
The idea of watching women die in the arena

945
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:56,031
Is more upsetting than watching the men but it didn't seem to bother the crowd at all

946
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,199
Watching women ripped apart by Beast was going to be just as fun as watching Men ripped apart by bees

947
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
It's hard

948
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,647
For we modern people to get our minds around this especially since to me this is so different than say the Gladiator fights

949
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
Which maybe we could conceive to something

950
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
It's

951
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,583
A much more push to the edge version of things we already like

952
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
Ever been to a big boxing fight

953
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,447
In Las Vegas or something

954
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
I mean this is a violent sporting event

955
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:32,383
The buzz amongst the crowd and there's almost nothing I've ever experienced like it you think yourself well

956
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:39,295
Listen to It's very barbaric but you could see the same sort of interplay going on in terms of whatever parts of our brain are being

957
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Stimulated

958
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,391
It's boxing

959
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Plus

960
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,975
It's pro wrestling with weapons for real

961
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
And

962
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
As all sporting events

963
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,959
You don't know who's going to win training may come into it coaching strategy tactics I mean sports fans could get into something like

964
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
I got you bet on it I could see it

965
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,079
To me these executions that were different

966
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,455
And even if most of the crowd didn't go in for The Butchery

967
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
Like a professor Fagan had said

968
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
Certainly a number of people did

969
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,159
I'm reminded of another quote by Seneca

970
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,511
Talking about the games and it was like a throwaway line but it was something about how

971
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,095
He was insinuating you couldn't allow even a dull moment

972
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
Between acts in a call so that the crowd or something could be affected called for some throat-cutting in the meaning

973
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
In time so that they wouldn't get bored

974
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,919
Again throwaway line but the horrific nice of the actual imagery if you imagine it

975
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Is sobering

976
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Why did the Romans like it

977
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
And how did they just

978
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
I don't think you seem like

979
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
The most logical follow-up questions

980
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,791
The why they liked it part we're going to continue to talk about cuz it's really sort of the focus here

981
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,631
I mean the obvious things that come to mind right away is curiosity

982
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:02,239
But any of these Seneca and you came for all the other stuff

983
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,823
And you just got grossed out by the violence probably not but maybe

984
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,919
Or maybe you're curious you want to see what this looks like

985
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
One of the other

986
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
Things that's talked about in events like these is even if you've been to many of them before this is not scripted Conte

987
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
This is like a live sporting event in the sense that you don't want to DVR it and hear what happened later you have to be there cuz

988
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,839
Something weird could happen and sometimes.

989
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
This curiosity

990
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
There is sheer sadism and sadism the weird thing I think in my opinion until

991
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,895
Totally non-academic an unqualified but

992
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
But doesn't it seem like some of the tendencies

993
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,087
They're more unusual on an individual level become more common on a crowd level so whereas it might be

994
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,927
Rather rare to meet someone who's a sadist in a crowd of people

995
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
As a crowd of people I think we're more sadistic

996
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts Maybe

997
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
Got a Thang

998
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,703
I guess for how the Romans Justified this cuz let's remember

999
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:09,823
By our modern standards they are harsh and brutal and strict even in this. Where it's at

1000
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,871
Off their High these to be stricter there

1001
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,431
Loosening up a little by our standards they're still very strong

1002
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:20,575
The Romans were into things like Lavo and reason and all these sorts of deals

1003
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
How did they look at this kind of stuff

1004
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695
And say to themselves well listen this serves a good purpose

1005
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
The swell Hotel

1006
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,047
Our old friend riding many decades ago will Durant

1007
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
But it's a nice succinct

1008
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Description

1009
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Quote

1010
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,959
Most Romans defended the gladiatorial games on the ground

1011
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,287
That the victims had been condemned to death for serious crime

1012
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,127
That the sufferings they endured acted as a deterrent to others

1013
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,479
That the courage with which the doomed men were trained to face wounds and death

1014
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,295
Inspired the people to Spartan virtues

1015
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:57,183
And that the frequent site of blood and battle a custom Romans to the demands of sacrifices of War

1016
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
And quote

1017
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
He then

1018
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,583
Mentioned several famous Roman writers and how they basically supported

1019
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,631
The idea of the games

1020
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,447
And then get to Cicero

1021
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
The lawyer writer

1022
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,799
The one-time console

1023
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
Famous at the end of the Republican.

1024
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
And even though Cicero

1025
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,503
Would make comments approving of the games sometimes

1026
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,575
He also said this which is a pretty

1027
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,439
Humanist sort of thing for a Roman writer to put pen to paper about

1028
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,767
Durant says about Cicero in the games quote

1029
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,327
Cicero was revolted by the slaughter

1030
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Quote

1031
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:42,751
This is Cicero what entertainment can possibly arise to a refined and human eyes spirit

1032
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,103
From seeing the noble Beast struck to the Heart by its merciless Hunter

1033
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,479
For one of our own week species cruelly mangled by an animal of far greater strength

1034
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
And quote

1035
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
As we said earlier trying to figure out

1036
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
Why the people in Rome enjoyed this

1037
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
These violent

1038
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
Entertainments is something that's been interesting to people for a very long time and Crosses into that Territory between a couple of distant

1039
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Ones like

1040
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Psychology and history

1041
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,959
Has so many variables that it's not surprising

1042
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
But you don't have

1043
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,335
Widespread agreement on what this is I mean people arguing

1044
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,687
The prevailing Theory tends to change every decade or so

1045
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,783
There are some commonalities the things you run into

1046
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,111
I generally most of the time and the number one

1047
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,671
Commonality something it won't surprise any of us

1048
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,463
When we ask how

1049
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,863
These ancient people could watch other human being treated this way it's easy if you don't consider them to be human

1050
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,703
And the dehumanization of the victims here

1051
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Is Obby

1052
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
Samina

1053
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
Everyone you'll read points out

1054
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,383
The vast majority of these people who are dying in the arena

1055
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,943
Are slaves one way or the other

1056
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
They may not have been slaves their whole life if you capture somebody on the battlefield to make them prisoners they can be slaves the next day

1057
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,463
A lot of these people who died in the arena by the way workout

1058
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
Prisoners

1059
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
Sometimes made to fight

1060
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
Other prisoners

1061
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,863
For the enjoyment of the crowd

1062
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:18,751
Going to let the idea that we expect some sort of empathy and sympathy from the crowd

1063
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,591
Might be flawed if the crowd sees these people as

1064
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,407
Well with the Nazis would have called the intervention right

1065
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:31,807
These are subhumans these are slaves are people with no rights and their people that are widely reviled in the society especially

1066
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,903
Actually the ones at the lowest level especially the ones that have broken Roman law

1067
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,719
We said earlier

1068
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,511
How many people would be

1069
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,143
Appalled at the idea of watching some horrific torture execution today

1070
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,263
And how many would change their mind if you said yes but it's this horrible dictator is a Hitler

1071
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,615
Or Saddam Hussein or somebody we're doing two how many people would go out well in that case Count Me In

1072
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,175
Well for a lot of the Roman crowd

1073
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,711
I was reading stuff

1074
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,551
By several different authors Kyle among them who are suggesting that

1075
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,135
You know a big part of the Roman desire to watch this stuff comes

1076
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,951
From seeing the victims in a similar light to that

1077
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,255
Right they're deserving of this

1078
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
Therefore

1079
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,143
You know why not get a little bit of enjoyment from their death while at the same time making it so horrible

1080
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,959
That other people who might think of doing this or just waited

1081
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
Now before we leave

1082
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,103
The Roman example

1083
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,175
There's one element it's worth bringing up

1084
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Because it's a

1085
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
What's an estuary if you will have to cross over

1086
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
Between

1087
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,599
The modern

1088
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Violent entertainment

1089
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
And the ancient entertaining violence

1090
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,535
It has to do with something to some historians call

1091
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
The Fatal charade

1092
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,679
The Fatal charade is something that you can easily

1093
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,471
Imagine developing

1094
00:59:53,983 --> 01:00:00,127
Because you need to have more novel a new things to bring in the crowds and remember at the Coliseum they were having

1095
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:04,223
Naval battles take place for the crowd with water

1096
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,039
The spectacles are amazing so you can imagine how

1097
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:12,671
The Dynamics of it all mean that you know these grown unimaginable proportions a little bit like history

1098
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,207
Got to become 6 hours long

1099
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
How do you spell charades

1100
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:20,095
Involved using The Condemned criminals

1101
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
In

1102
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Play

1103
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Comedy

1104
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:27,519
Dramarama anything like addressing the Muppets characters putting in assets up

1105
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,055
And having them reenact

1106
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,151
What went on in the story but the stories they pick are often homicidal

1107
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,759
Anaval maimings and so what they did then was they did it for real

1108
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
You said earlier what if you

1109
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
Made one of those

1110
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,559
Previews they show the movie theater for an action film that use real bullets and had real people get really hurt

1111
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
And what would that be like

1112
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,655
Maybe like these

1113
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,215
In a fatal charades in Rome

1114
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,567
Astorian Donald G Kyle in his notes

1115
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,127
Quoting several other historians

1116
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
Wrote about the Fatal charade

1117
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Quote

1118
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,367
The combination of theater and execution in the amphitheater was not theater proper

1119
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,415
But rather bartsch says

1120
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,999
A violation of the theatrical by the actual

1121
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Or rather

1122
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,559
A conflation of the two

1123
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,887
Not a representation but a replication

1124
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
As she notes

1125
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,495
The actual death in the charades

1126
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,055
Fulfilled the requirements of both the plot

1127
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,335
And the penal code

1128
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
And quote

1129
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
That's a crazy line

1130
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
That the deaths

1131
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
In these fatal plays

1132
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
Met the needs of both the plot

1133
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
And the penal code

1134
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
That it wasn't a

1135
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
Representation like a movie would be today

1136
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
It was a replication

1137
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
Like doing

1138
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,263
A story on the Manson family murders

1139
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,615
But re-enacting them rather than replicating them on film

1140
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,735
And what makes it so different as it's right in your face

1141
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
There's no doubt

1142
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:19,647
The people are really enjoying this where is in all the other situations that come to mind

1143
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,487
That would involve other ancient peoples that you can find

1144
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,791
It's so hard to disentangle

1145
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
The religion

1146
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,863
From the ritual

1147
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
And

1148
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:33,983
You know the lack of sources to tell you specifically the people were having a good time

1149
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,847
To figure out as we said whether or not the Aztecs are enjoying watching the ceremony involve

1150
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
Human soccer

1151
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,431
Or whether it's all part of some giant

1152
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
In a religious ritual

1153
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,575
That sort of overlays the entire question that explains it in a way that's a lot less

1154
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,671
Denigrating towards the human species than the simplistic

1155
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,999
You know attitude of well they're having a good time watching

1156
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
Penis person suffering.

1157
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
The Roman exam

1158
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Is the most

1159
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
I can find

1160
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,495
That forces you to look into a mirror

1161
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,591
And if you're trying to make the case that human beings are inherently good

1162
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,151
Inherently empathetic and inherently

1163
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,503
With a sense of Brotherhood and Sisterhood toward their fellow man

1164
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
You know you have to hold this is

1165
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
Exhibit a and say well then

1166
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
How do you explain this

1167
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,559
So then of course the question arises

1168
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,095
Briefly

1169
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,167
And not without controversy

1170
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,263
If these things were so popular why the heck did they disappear

1171
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,663
And the answers of course are less simplistic and more argued about than they used to be

1172
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,479
I still think most of the historians

1173
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
That you'll look at

1174
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Will

1175
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,599
Acknowledge that there's a role in the

1176
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
Change and Sensibility shall we call them

1177
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
Between a

1178
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,791
Minority Christian Roman one that was increasing in

1179
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,631
Importance in that Society Wright the ethics were changing

1180
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,447
And the views on things like the

1181
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,567
Arena and how moral something like that was what we're also changing now let's be honest

1182
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,663
Even if it wasn't for ethical reasons connected to their faith

1183
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:22,783
You could understand why Christians might think the game suck to me look at how many Christians went there and

1184
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
In these Arenas her

1185
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,647
Well let's be honest there countrymens entertainment

1186
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,927
In many cases

1187
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,791
There's an interesting Twist on this by the way this idea that

1188
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:37,375
Christianity may have helped kill the games but it hasn't

1189
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,471
Anything to do with a growth in refinement of sensibilities and all that

1190
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
It has to do with

1191
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Maybe

1192
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
You can call it 8

1193
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
Scheduling golf

1194
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
I mean for example

1195
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,223
The games themselves were

1196
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,295
Happening a couple of times a year like many Olympics

1197
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,623
And that just happens to be the time when you had

1198
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
You know some of the more serious

1199
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Holiday.

1200
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
4

1201
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
Christians

1202
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
And so maybe we're talking

1203
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,095
Got something here that has to do with a quest

1204
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
Scheduling conflicts as I said

1205
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,983
Leading to a reduction in consumer demand Maybe

1206
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,151
There's another theory that these things that only existed as long as they had because the emperors

1207
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Gave

1208
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,479
Them all the support because it helped

1209
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
The whole bread and circuses thing will these are the circus is right they play a role for the emperor they play at mystical roll the can

1210
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
Connect the emperor to the subject, there's a whole lot of theories about this

1211
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:40,095
Once it stops doing that to the same degree there's no reason for the emperor to go to those great expenses and all that other trouble

1212
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
Have a nice Cherry race and call it good

1213
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
I should point out to the

1214
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:52,127
Are these Roman tradition where they have these games these go way back in their history and actually evolved other Italian people like

1215
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:58,527
Stand lights in a truck engine and people who would have sometimes at funerals and whatnot these duels and Duels are not.

1216
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
Baton

1217
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
Common throughout history

1218
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:06,719
He was just Roman as we said layering we talked about the animals with layered on all the different levels of

1219
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Performance

1220
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
And attraction and

1221
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,119
I mean these things as we said we're like a variety show

1222
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,191
With the violence as sort of the headliner Act

1223
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
But I read that they didn't die out all at once in that

1224
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
Even quite a bit of time later after Emperor's and whatnot had tried to get rid of them they were still popping up here or there

1225
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
So

1226
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,087
Maybe not quite getting the ratings that used to get

1227
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,671
But still bopping around you know the Off-Broadway circuit and

1228
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,999
In a pulling into locals every now and then for a little

1229
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
Nigori equivalent

1230
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,095
Old fashioned dinner theater

1231
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:44,863
Maybe

1232
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,703
Now this worry program dealing with

1233
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
Executions

1234
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
Criminal law

1235
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,663
Criminal justice or the penal system or anything like that there be a lot of examples to go into

1236
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,503
Where you're seeing public executions all over the world all the time it's just

1237
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
Is depressingly

1238
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Familiar

1239
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:10,975
But what you don't have is the kind of evidence that Rome provided of what the mentality of the crowd watching was

1240
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:16,351
I know where else do you really see such raw enjoyment for example

1241
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
It's very possible that those Japanese

1242
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
People

1243
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
Living nearby would it be

1244
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,519
Person to convict being boiled to death

1245
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,359
Happen if you did that might be unusual and you might want to go watching so

1246
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,479
Are you pick up a few friends and you go get some food you go down to the beach to have some fun

1247
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:37,855
Certainly might have happened in my cynical way of looking at things sometimes I imagine it probably did but I don't have the written sources

1248
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
In English

1249
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
To prove it

1250
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,231
The next place that I can prove it

1251
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
Or at least make it

1252
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,559
Logical case with some evidence

1253
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,631
Is a lot nearer to our own time than Rome was

1254
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,191
Perhaps a little bit more of an indictment

1255
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
It's one thing to try to say

1256
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,567
At those ancient people living thousands of years ago

1257
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,895
We're almost a different species from us but it's much harder to claim that

1258
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:06,015
When you're talking about a time. Say as we said when George Washington is a young adults

1259
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,343

Labeled in your high school history textbook says the enlightenment of the Age of Reason

1283
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,191
Those kinds of executions don't sound very light

1284
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,215
Do they

1285
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,031
And they were passing away during this era

1286
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,847
Her bunch of interesting reasons but the reason

1287
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,663
That we can use it to examine our question of

1288
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
Yunnan people

1289
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
And violence

1290
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,039
And the extremes of The Human Experience as we get these

Explosion in store

1293
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Starting at around

1294
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
The 16th century

1295
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,975
Japan 1500 to 1800

1296
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,535
You can really see this

1297
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,375
This entire question from multiple viewpoints in ways you've never been able to

1298
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,215
And I think that's why if you buy

1299
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:34,079
Reading material in English on this subject it is inordinately concentrated

1300
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:38,687
On the period from 1500 to the early 1800s sanding Western Europe

1301
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
Because the sources

1302
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Plaintiff

1303
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,807
And from multiple viewpoints take for example

1304
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
One of the most interest

1305
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,391
There is nothing

1306
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,183
From the Roman era

1307
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,023
They gives you the perspective of the person whose job it was

1308
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
To execute people

1309
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,655
What the guy who had to do all these horrible things to The Condemned

1310
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
Think right

1311
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
Would know

1312
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
But we have

1313
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,079
The equivalent of a diary kept

1314
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,663
By an executioner in Germany in the 16th century

1315
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,759
How amazing is it to have that point of view to add

1316
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,575
To try to three dimension lies this

1317
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
And what about

1318
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
The Condemned

1319
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,487
Themselves again nothing from the Roman Arena on how that poor

1320
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,815
Individual felt before they went through what they went through

1321
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,679
But in the air were talking about The Condemned could speak sometime

1322
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
And what they said

1323
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:37,311
Was written down and transmitted and then of course we have an audience

1324
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,943
That you can examine now from multiple viewpoints over multiple Century in multiple countries

1325
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
So if you want to examine this fascination with

1326
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,879
The spectacular Ade of death in people's interest in it

1327
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,463
This is perhaps the best laboratory we can work within

1328
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,535
Because there's a lot of data to synthesize now

1329
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,119
The problem in talking about this is there is a lot of variation

1330
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,423
Region region

1331
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
Arrinera

1332
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,799
And so any generalize statements are bound to be false in some way so I hope

1333
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
I can count on your Indulgence on this

1334
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:11,871
Try to

1335
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,455
Get us to where we have to be to have a discussion about this we're going to General

1336
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
But if you want to understand

1337
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
What happened that allowed

1338
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Modern people

1339
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:27,743
You know from the Louis XIV era of the Enlightenment to go to these torture executions and enjoy themselves

1340
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,815
You have to kind of understand how it got that way we have to have some contacts

1341
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,167
There's a bridge to maybe take us backward

1342
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
For some

1343
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
I was thinking of

1344
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
4

1345
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,335
That a couple of rulers

1346
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,127
News during George Washington's life

1347
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
Implement

1348
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
But they were secret reform

1349
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
We just kind of Interest

1350
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
For example

1351
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,623
Frederick the great of Prussia was considered one of the Enlightenment rulers

1352
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,207
A guy who didn't just

1353
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,279
I read people like Voltaire the famous

1354
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Enlightenment thinkers

1355
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
He was a pen pal

1356
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
One of these people that implemented changes that

1357
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,215
Part of all this stuff that

1358
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,263
Broadly call the enlightened

1359
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
The Age of Reason

1360
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
And one of the things that

1361
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
Frederick the great tables were formed the Legal Sea

1362
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
In the 1740s

1363
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
Now we did away with a couple of

1364
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,783
Medieval type

1365
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:28,927
Executions I mean I think he got rid of burning for example couldn't burn somebody alive anymore I think

1366
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
But I know

1367
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
But he kept

1368
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Stuff like

1369
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,791
Breaking with the wheel

1370
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,631
But his Secret order his reform dictated

1371
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,983
That the person who was going to be subjected to this ordeal

1372
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
Be strangled beforehand

1373
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,639
That's not the interesting part per se

1374
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
The interesting part is that Frederick

1375
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,015
Mandated that this strangling be done in such a way

1376
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
Did the crowd would know it

1377
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,879
As far as the crowd was concerned

1378
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,183
They were still watching a person being

1379
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,279
Broken apart in the most horrific medieval fashion possible

1380
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,559
But Frederick

1381
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
Any Executioner's would know

1382
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,655
But the person actually felt no pain

1383
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,447
What's going on there

1384
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,543
And before we think of it as an isolated exam

1385
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,079
Maria Theresa

1386
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,895
The Habsburg Empire a couple decades

1387
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,479
Later issued a similar sort of order and her point

1388
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,503
Was that listen

1389
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,039
The person is dead anyway

1390
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
That's what we're really doing here

1391
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Here trying to

1392
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,439
You deprive that person of his life why

1393
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
Heater prolong the stop

1394
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
But then why keep the string

1395
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
Angling Secret

1396
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Texas

1397
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,911
To the rationale Behind These

1398
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
Spectacular

1399
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,239
Public executions from this

1400
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,543
Bizarrely modern era

1401
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
Why do they do them at all

1402
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
The point of all this was to create a

1403
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Shockingly Freight

1404
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
Prospective

1405
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,343
A deterrent warning

1406
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,439
And for the purposes of

1407
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
The warning

1408
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:13,631
It really wouldn't matter whether or not The Condemned was actually feeling the pain that the audience thought they

1409
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
They were feeling

1410
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:20,287
The most important part of the equation was that the audience did indeed think they were feeling

1411
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:24,127
The pain and suffering and when you consider with the really nasty

1412
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,431
Executions that a guy in

1413
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:29,503
Frederick the Great's time would have had available to him

1414
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,879
They're frightfully need I mean burning for those of you who find that particularly horrible

1415
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,439
Others might choose it was a personal

1416
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
Question

1417
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,279
As their most horrible most to be avoided

1418
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
Potential execution method

1419
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
Breaking on the Wheel

1420
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,191
He mentioned a little early what the heck is breaking on the Wheel

1421
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,751
Storing Garrett Fagan

1422
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,055
As a horrific description

1423
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
When you can see after you hear it

1424
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,783
Why strangling somebody ahead of time would have been an act of considerable Mercy he writes quote

1425
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,623
Particularly unpleasant was Wheeling

1426
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,671
Also called braiding

1427
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,975
Or breaking on the wheel in France

1428
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,535
Or breaking with the wheel in Germany

1429
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
The procedure he writes

1430
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
Took many forms

1431
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:21,983
And was employed in numerous countries across the European continent and in foreign colonies

1432
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,519
The usual method

1433
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,823
Was for the victim to be tied to a scaffold

1434
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,175
Board laid out on the ground with wooden struts to raise the limb

1435
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
And a wagon wheel

1436
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,783
Or a hammer iron bar or club

1437
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,063
Used to break them

1438
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,647
Special execution Wheels were manufactured

1439
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,719
With projecting flanges for atom-smashing power

1440
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Alternatively

1441
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,839
Victims to be run over repeatedly by heavy wagons

1442
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
The traditional

1443
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
The word means

1444
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,679
End of the ceremony

1445
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:56,799
What's for The Condemned to have their ruined limbs threaded through the spokes of another Wagon Wheel

1446
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,663
The braiding part of the action which was then hoisted on the pole for display

1447
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,479
They are the victim if not dead already

1448
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Could linger for days

1449
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,671
Hey heroin eyewitness account from a 1607 execution reports how the victim was transformed

1450
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,743
Quote into a sort of huge screaming puppet

1451
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,047
Writhing in rivulets of blood

1452
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
A puppet with four tentacles

1453
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,679
Like a sea monster of raw slimy and shapeless flesh

1454
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,983
Mixed with the splinters of smashed bone

1455
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
And quote

1456
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,335
This takes us back

1457
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:35,199
To the reasons for the spectacular punishment the justifications and

1458
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,759
When you go back to how it all started

1459
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,831
The water becomes very muddy indeed

1460
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
For example

1461
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,159
Remember us wondering about

1462
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,719
Many other peoples in history and whether or not

1463
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:53,119
The fact that there are heavy religious overtones the what's going on whether or not that means you can determine if they were there

1464
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,935
Cuz they wanted to see the violence and meet at the Aztec crowd

1465
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,239
Is witnessing the human sacrifice ceremony

1466
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,519
Is this fun

1467
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,335
Or is this a form of piety right

1468
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,407
Hard to tell the waters are very muddy

1469
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,455
In the Europe

1470
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,783
Proceeding. We're talking about here the same thing is true

1471
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,671
And big disclaimer that's not to say that there aren't religious overtones in the

1472
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,463
Roman arena there were

1473
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:23,583
And that's not to say there aren't religious overtones at Robert Francois Damien's execution there were

1474
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:31,007
But it's pretty obvious from those two examples that it's not the number one thing in Rome the number one thing is the amusement of the crowd

1475
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,359
Endymion case the number one thing is demonstrating the authority of the state

1476
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,711
The fact that people are enjoying watching the authority of the state being demonstrated

1477
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
That's a different question that's more human

1478
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,319
In the period that leads up though

1479
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,135
To these relatively secular

1480
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:51,487
Pursuits in the mid 1700 do you have very religious execution

1481
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
So once again

1482
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,095
Is the crowd there for fun

1483
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,887
Or is this something

1484
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,655
Larger

1485
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,239
We compared the Roman Arena

1486
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
To a kind of

1487
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,335
Theater sword

1488
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,919
Theater where the violence was real

1489
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,503
But maybe touching some of the same parts of your mind

1490
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,831
Or psyche that enjoys watching the fake version now

1491
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,183
Entertainment as I said was the goal though

1492
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:26,047
Pride what's the what's the what's the form of execution here that will be most novel and interesting to watch

1493
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,095
In the case of the executions

1494
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,655
In the Europe of the Middle Ages

1495
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
The ones that are the

1496
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,263
Precursors to be later examples we've been going over

1497
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
These are also

1498
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
Like a form of theater

1499
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,639
But it's more like a morality

1500
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:41,919
Fashion

1501
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,967
One of these

1502
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,551
Message oriented displays when there's going to be

1503
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
A lot of drama

1504
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,903
Is going to be quite a bit of horrific viola

1505
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:58,815
But if it all goes off the way these executions in the Middle Ages were supposed to go off in a lot of these

1506
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Cases

1507
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,399
Again exceptions exist and there are

1508
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Local variations

1509
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:07,263
It would be a happy ending at the end

1510
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,823
The person who suffered the most

1511
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
Pain and violence during the experience

1512
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,151
Will find themselves

1513
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
If they conduct themselves properly of course

1514
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
In heaven

1515
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
God in the saint

1516
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,599
In the crowd

1517
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,415
Will it X if these historians are to be believed

1518
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
Seem almost jealous of

1519
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
Just out of curiosity

1520
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,911
What would have to happen what would it take

1521
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
To make you

1522
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Jealous

1523
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
Or envious

1524
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,383
Someone who is just indoor DeLong

1525
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
Drawn out

1526
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,503
Painful public torture execution

1527
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,855
I don't remember

1528
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
Ever seeing eniac

1529
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,951
Counts from the Roman era of people

1530
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,743
Spectators in the arena

1531
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,535
Feeling a whole lot of

1532
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:07,935
Envy for the person being eaten by wild animals as part of their in death sentence in front of them

1533
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,799
Now if you had told me I had overlooked something I wouldn't be surprised

1534
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,384
If you'd said that there were accounts of the Christian martyrs

1535
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:20,992
Wood witnessed their Brethren dying in the arena and wish that they could

1536
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,552
That happened to them too I wouldn't be surprised

1537
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,928
You see accounts like this all over the world at various times very

1538
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,464
Devout people

1539
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,048
Who have a completely different set of logical priority

1540
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,632
When's that are not based on here and now

1541
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:41,984
What are focused more on a long term for ever afterwards venue

1542
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:48,384
It changes your rational calculation right if you're much more worried about

1543
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
An eternity in heaven

1544
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,480
Rather than the momentary

1545
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:57,344
In a logical pros and cons that way into the situation you might be facing here

1546
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
Now fast-forward

1547
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,720
A few centuries and as we all know

1548
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,328
Did Christians go from A persecuted sect in Rome 2 running the joint

1549
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
When it comes to Western Europe

1550
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:13,984
I'm on the Western Roman Empire goes away and leaves all the successor States and its wake

1551
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,056
The vast majority of Christian in the ones that aren't will be

1552
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
This is the

1553
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
How do you spell to say if you go from ugly lady antiquity

1554
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,224
2

1555
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,272
The Age of Reason begins

1556
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
This is Europe at its most

1557
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
Intense

1558
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,928
Religiosity right there their most fervent

1559
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,000
This is the area where

1560
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:41,120
And it encompasses the Crusades and encompasses all the religious wars that happened because of

1561
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:45,728
The Schism between another Protestants in the Catholic to me there's a lot that go into this

1562
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,848
And a ton of people will Diamond witches inquisitions it's all during this era

1563
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,920
There's a line and I'm going from memory that

1564
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,712
I once read a historian said

1565
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
That they said in this era

1566
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,320
The most vicious procedures

1567
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
Inflicted

1568
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
On devout Christian

1569
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,696
I even more devout

1570
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Christian

1571
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
You have near Universal

1572
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,840
Catholicism in these country

1573
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Freeze until the

1574
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,656
The great schism with Martin Luther

1575
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,936
Their enclaves

1576
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
Jews

1577
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:21,056
There's actually a lot of folks in some places and there's a bunch of heretical Christian sects

1578
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
Whether Christian or not of courses

1579
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,176
Is the main issue that are being wiped out and persecuted

1580
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,992
But there's a worldview now in place

1581
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Bright

1582
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:34,112
A reality that in some ways is like our own

1583
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,160
If you drop an apple

1584
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,256
Gravity does what gravity does right it does now it did then

1585
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
But there are other elements of reality

1586
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
That are believed

1587
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,704
To be a hundred percent valid by almost everybody

1588
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
The influences everything

1589
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
Take for example

1590
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,616
The near unanimity of the idea

1591
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
But there is a heaven

1592
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:03,040
Hell and a god watching over everything and that everything is divinely ordained

1593
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,112
Now we have people of course we believe

1594
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
That today

1595
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:11,232
But it's one of many different belief systems out there in fact

1596
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,096
One of the great things about living in a free society and a free part of the world

1597
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,984
Is it you're free to pick and choose your own reality either within limits I mean you still have to ignore

1598
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Gravity

1599
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,544
But otherwise

1600
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,824
I mean you can

1601
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
Treated like a

1602
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,432
In a buffet if you will take I'm going to take a little bit of it

1603
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
Eastern mysticism

1604
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Mix it with

1605
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,904
Catholic doctor in at a little bit of you know hard science and some UFO ology cuz I like that

1606
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,952
Pause Massage Envy

1607
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
21st

1608
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
Century

1609
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,304
In philosophical smoothie if you want

1610
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,888
But I think we have to recognize that that the freedom

1611
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,704
That did not exist in most times and Mo's place

1612
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Is there are

1613
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Course

1614
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,568
Terrorism places where did by and large

1615
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,128
The belief system with a lot more constrained

1616
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,664
Both legally

1617
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,480
And obviously in terms of

1618
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
Religion and faith

1619
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:09,856
But also because of the old garbage in garbage out

1620
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,952
Element of what were the people even being exposed to take for example

1621
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,792
An illiterate person in the middle of Europe in oh I don't know we'll say

1622
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,096
The 10th century

1623
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,144
What do you know you know

1624
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,192
Probably the religious texts

1625
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,008
That will read to you by somebody else

1626
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,824
And anything you personally experienced

1627
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:35,456
Well that's going to limit your world you right there and if there's 100% belief in the religious texts

1628
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,016
And everyone else feels the same way

1629
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
Will that help

1630
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
Playing

1631
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,160
The accounts of some of the executions that have come down to us

1632
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,184
From this era

1633
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
Which artist Bazaar

1634
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,768
As anything I've ever seen

1635
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:53,120
But without the face explanation it doesn't make any sense

1636
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,704
So first of all when we talk about

1637
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,008
Executions in the Middle Ages

1638
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
What do we mean

1639
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,128
Astoria Paul Friedland

1640
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,296
Point out by the way that there are far fewer resources and accounts of execution from this era than you would think considering Symphony

1641
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:17,440
In terms of torture and execution montavon mutilations during this time. Right

1642
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,488
Very eye for an eye

1643
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,072
And you can lose a hand if you receive lot of that kind of stuff

1644
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,120
In his book The Lure of the Arena

1645
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,168
Is reindeer Chief Pagan rites quote

1646
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,728
Passing Beyond antiquity

1647
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,056
Our sources for the Dark Age punitive practices are not good

1648
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:39,712
What's rotten Middle Ages in Continental Europe it is clear that many forms of aggravated execution in public

1649
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,992
Torture were employed

1650
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,784
Including burning

1651
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,600
Boiling alive in oil feet first

1652
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,136
Decapitation

1653
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,184
Burial alive

1654
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:55,072
Drawing and quartering branding flogging and miscellaneous forms of Mutilation

1655
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,632
For those guilty of multiple offenses

1656
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,936
Cumulative punishment could be applied

1657
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,728
I'd is stipulated by the court

1658
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:06,080
In this way lethal and non-lethal punishments were often combined

1659
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,896
So that torture preceded execution

1660
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,968
Or mutilation of the body was carried out postmortem

1661
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,784
Desoxyn Spiegel

1662
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,904
He continues and illuminated German legal code of 12:20 to 12:35

1663
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
80

1664
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Shows beheading

1665
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,488
Hanging

1666
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,584
Hacking the birching and shearing of women tied to a stake

1667
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
And mutilation

1668
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,448
It is not evident from the Saxon Spiegel however

1669
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,752
But these punishments attracted crowds

1670
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,312
But there is no reason to think that they did not

1671
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
And quote

1672
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,176
If he's executions in the Middle Ages

1673
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,528
And the Renaissance dd&d draw crowds and I don't see why they wouldn't

1674
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,576
Are the crowds there for

1675
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:52,928
What was the draw expect to have happened what did they hope to have happen

1676
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,512
This is why we should have set up their religious stuff

1677
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,048
Up till now because

1678
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,120
That's what twists in the unique way because

1679
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
If I told you that the legal system wanted

1680
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,728
An exemplary deterrent

1681
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
2

1682
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:13,408
Going to deter people from committing crimes and that's why they hung up bodies and pieces of bodies and heads on Stakes at the bridge

1683
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,456
Bridges and all that that would surprise you with it

1684
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,784
Injustice is always headed to turn two-factor

1685
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,832
And we've been a lot of theories about that this

1686
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,880
Nothing new in that in that question

1687
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,720
Is the religious side that to the modern mind is harder to understand

1688
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,024
What if you went to this execution

1689
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,560
Instead of feeling

1690
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:33,376
The mindset of stereotype in our minds

1691
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,936
Of how these executions go with the crowd

1692
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:41,824
Providence cheering and throwing refuse and heaping abuse on The Condemned they make it our way to the

1693
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
Apple

1694
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,896
Gallows

1695
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,432
Ravenstone

1696
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,552
And then when they're up there just about to die the crowded during at them in all this and while this didn't happen

1697
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,088
The source of State depends on

1698
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,928
What the bad person did and how they comported themselves during the whole process but

1699
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,512
More often than not in this. We're talking about right now

1700
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,792
The crowd felt

1701
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,328
The connection

1702
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,864
To The Condemned

1703
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,912
Compassion

1704
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
And if the whole thing went off well

1705
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,288
The historians often described

1706
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,360
This is being a spiritually

1707
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,968
Moving event one of them use the word maybe two of them use the word

1708
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,992
Potentially

1709
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,016
Beautiful

1710
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,088
Now let's remind ourselves for a second

1711
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,904
But what this beautiful event might be

1712
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,976
And then ask ourselves again

1713
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
What it would take

1714
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
For you

1715
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
Over me

1716
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,352
To watch this live

1717
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,144
And describe it afterwards

1718
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,680
Is beautiful

1719
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,544
So in his book rituals of Retribution historian Richard Evans

1720
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
Recounts

1721
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,152
The tale of an Englishman named John Taylor

1722
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,480
Who lived in the early 1600s and did a little traveling

1723
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
And wrote about what he saw

1724
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,808
One of the things he saw

1725
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:02,464
Is while he was visiting the contents he got to see one of those executions that they weren't doing much where he was from anymore in England.

1726
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,488
I said earlier I think

1727
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,792
English of a penchant for hanging

1728
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,840
That we'll talk about in a little bit but

1729
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,936
It didn't mean I didn't do other things that just meant it was a little bit more unusual sewing

1730
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,984
John Taylor goes to

1731
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:20,384
You know the continent and sees an opportunity to go to an execution where they're breaking someone with the wheel

1732
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,504
He describes it in his language from that time. This way

1733
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,528
Quote

1734
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,344
Monday the 19th of August

1735
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,392
About the hour of 12 at noon

1736
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
The people of the town in great multitude

1737
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,744
To the place of execution

1738
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,304
We just half a mile English meaning distance

1739
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,376
Without the gates built more like a sconce than a Gala

1740
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,752
Griswold Inn ditched about with a drawbridge and the Prisoner came on foot

1741
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,288
With a Divine with him

1742
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,824
Being a priest a religious

1743
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:50,848
Figure

1744
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,408
All the way exhorting him to repentance

1745
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,968
And because death should not terrify him

1746
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,808
They are giving him any Rouses into Rouses of wine and beer

1747
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
British the custom there

1748
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,392
To make such poor wretches drunk

1749
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,720
Whereby they may be senseless either of God's mercy

1750
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
For their own misery

1751
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,304
But being prayed for by others

1752
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,864
They themselves me directions lutely

1753
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,912
Or to be feared desperate

1754
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,448
And quote

1755
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:22,848
Then Taylor describes the execution which would have been maybe unusual for him to seize his quote

1756
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,224
The Prisoner mounted on a mound of Earth built high on purpose that the people without

1757
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,552
Macy the execution a quarter of a mile roundabout

1758
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,600
Four of The Hangman's men

1759
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,160
Takes each of them a small halter

1760
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:39,232
And by the hands and the feet they hold the prisoners

1761
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:42,304
Extended all the broad laying on his back

1762
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:47,168
Veni Arch hangman or the master of this Mighty business

1763
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
Took up a wheel

1764
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,520
Much about the bigness of one of the four wheels of a coach

1765
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
And 1st

1766
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,104
Having put off his doublet his hat

1767
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,176
And being in his shirt as if he meant to play at tennis

1768
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
He took up the wheel

1769
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,992
And set it on the edge

1770
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,832
And turned it with one hand like a top or a whirligig

1771
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,880
And then you took it by the spokes

1772
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,184
It looked it up with a mighty stroke

1773
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,256
He beat one of the poor wretches legs in pieces

1774
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,792
The bones I mean

1775
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,096
Witchy roared grievously

1776
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:20,448
Then after a little pause he breaks the other leg in the same manner

1777
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,496
And consequently breaks his arm

1778
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:26,848
And then he stroke for five main blows on his breast

1779
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,664
And burst all his belt in chest and shivers

1780
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,968
Last week he smelled his neck

1781
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,992
And missing

1782
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,552
Burst his chin and jaw autom amex

1783
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,856
Lenny took the broken mangled corpse

1784
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
And spread it on the Wheel

1785
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,304
And thrust a great poster pile into the neighbor hold of the wheel and then fix the post into the Earth some

1786
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
Being in height above the ground

1787
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,656
Some 10 or 12 foot

1788
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:55,520
And there the carcass must lie until it be consumed by all-consuming time

1789
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,056
Or ravening foul

1790
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:58,848
And quote

1791
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,944
This was part of the exemplary deterrence

1792
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,736
And the idea of the. Right

1793
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,296
You not only have to have the execution be like this

1794
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,368
But you have to have pieces of the body lying around to remind people

1795
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:15,488
You got to put them in gibbets in cages and you got to cut him up in pieces and put the pieces in different places

1796
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,864
And you got to leave the people who died on The Gallows hang in there till they fall off by themselves

1797
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,656
As an example to others

1798
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,752
So now considering

1799
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,544
This englishman's

1800
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:33,920
Description of this rather unusual execution by his standards

1801
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,760
If you had witnessed it live you think you would have

1802
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
Called it

1803
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Beautiful

1804
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:45,184
Would have been some Sublime spiritual experience for you

1805
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
I said earlier

1806
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:52,096
Some of the stuff so he's executions are so bizarre if you don't have the faith element

1807
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:55,936
You can't even get your mind around it's hard enough to get your mind around it with the faith element

1808
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,544
Freeland gives another example in his book and I would quote it

1809
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,384
From the original Source accepted there's too much Latin in it it's hard to follow

1810
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,432
But essentially it talks about

1811
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,992
One of these breaking on the wheels that happens

1812
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,064
In the original source is talking about how

1813
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
As the

1814
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,720
Condemned is being killed you know it is if they're being broken on the Wheel

1815
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
They are

1816
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,816
Singing or shouting religious verses

1817
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,632
And the crowd is picking up

1818
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:32,032
You know where The Condemned leaves off so he'll do the first verse deal do the second in unison he'll do the third they'll do the fourth it's

1819
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Call

1820
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,336
And response

1821
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
While he's being killed

1822
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,920
What's more

1823
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:42,272
According to this Source he's talking to the guy who's killing in the Executioner

1824
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,320
And I guess the only way to put it is he's

1825
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:47,648
Making requests right tell the crowd I want the next verse in Latin

1826
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,928
Then all this kind of stuff

1827
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
Completely bizarre to the modern mind

1828
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:58,144
But as Friedman says this is the kind of thing that the people

1829
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,728
In that era would have seen as potentially beautiful

1830
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:08,640
A wonderful lesson for the kids write a morality lesson here here's what can happen to you if you go wrong but if you continue to

1831
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
Believe in God and you sincerely seek

1832
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:14,272
Redemption through repentance you too can make it to Heaven I mean

1833
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,064
There is all

1834
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:20,160
There's an element of Faith involved here that's understandable

1835
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
The modern people of faith

1836
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,512
But because this isn't modern

1837
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,792
Feh this is a

1838
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,864
Medieval version of Italy Renaissance version of it

1839
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,400
The part that's hard to understand

1840
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,960
Did the people in the crowd very well may have seen

1841
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,520
The violence being done to the malefactors

1842
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
Body

1843
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
As necessary

1844
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,664
To get to the Heavenly goal and if that's the case

1845
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,992
What was being done to that malefactors body

1846
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,784
Was it good thing

1847
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,576
And because it was being done

1848
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,880
Someone soul is going to be saved

1849
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,928
And if you actually watch that

1850
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:59,072
I did pretty good crazy entertaining show with a good message at the end and a feel-good

1851
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:03,936
Minnesota an attitude when you get home you're all run out the emotions have been totally in play

1852
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,496
I mean I guess what I'm saying is there's an entertainment

1853
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
That isn't there

1854
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,568
At the same time

1855
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,920
It is so formalizar when you read the rules by me to have it written down.

1856
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,528
You know who stands where and what the formations in line is supposed to be who comes first and

1857
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
This is a celebration of

1858
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,648
Both religious and secular Authority

1859
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,976
But it's so ritualize would be hard to make a case

1860
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
Edit anything but that

1861
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:34,912
So if you say people are enjoying what they're seeing and they go home glad they came and there's a huge draw for the next execution

1862
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,960
I don't think there's any arguing about that

1863
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,312
But it's not the same thing as what's going on in the Roman arena is it

1864
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Friedland

1865
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
Says quote

1866
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:51,296
Prior to the middle of the 16th century those who attended executions I will resist calling them spectators

1867
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:56,160
Did so largely out of a sincere desire to participate in the ceremony

1868
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,720
That held profound personal meaning for them

1869
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:02,560
And not because they wanted to talk from a distance at the suffering of others

1870
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,096
These were less

1871
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:07,936
Spectacles he writes in the way that we understand the word today

1872
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
Then they were rituals

1873
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:14,080
In which those who attended saw themselves as full participants rather than onlookers

1874
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,224
When asked was usually the case The Condemned participated fully in the ritual of repentance

1875
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,296
Seeking forgiveness from Divine and Earthly authorities

1876
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:26,112
Witnesses usually Bridge the physical distance

1877
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,392
Between themselves

1878
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,440
And the patient meaning The Condemned

1879
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,720
Through prayers

1880
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000
Tears and empathy

1881
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:39,168
The public transformation of The Condemned criminal into a repentant sinner enable the entire community.

1882
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:44,288
Undergo a kind of feeling that may be experienced as profoundly beautiful and uplifting

1883
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
And quote

1884
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:52,480
Don't also had a lot of other ritual important elements to it

1885
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
The key though as

1886
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:57,600
Historian Richard Evans points out the whole affair

1887
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:03,232
Requires an absolute consensus on the part of everyone involved executioner

1888
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,792
State authorities condemned audience

1889
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,888
That there is the possibility of an afterlife

1890
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
Evans rights quote

1891
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,544
Eternal life was indeed what the malefactor sought

1892
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,128
And with the ritual meaning of execution was designed to provide

1893
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:25,248
Almost without exception The Condemned gave the impression of being penitent Christian

1894
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,528
Who went straight to heaven

1895
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,320
After making a quote and quote

1896
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,088
Good day

1897
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
It was a sacred ritual

1898
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:36,256
It depended on the acceptance of all concerned of the possibility of an afterlife

1899
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,816
The good death of the malefactor

1900
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,120
Purge the community of its blood guilt

1901
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,400
I'm canceled out

1902
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,680
The bad death

1903
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:50,080
The sudden unprepared and bereft of the opportunity to make peace with God in the world of the malefactors murder

1904
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:50,848
Victim

1905
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,968
Assured the community that the spirit of the executed would not return to haunt the survivors

1906
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,320
Asthma so often believed to be the case with the Restless Souls of the suddenly Departed

1907
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:03,136
He guaranteed the Peace of society

1908
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,440
By ensuring a grateful Corp

1909
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,792
And it reassured those would witnessed it that they have done a good deed

1910
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:14,912
They paved the way to eternal life for a soul seemingly Beyond Redemption

1911
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
And quote

1912
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,824
There's a certain irony isn't there that modern people

1913
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,640
Instantly recognized in a situation like this

1914
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,944
That Europe in its most

1915
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:31,040
Religiously Fanatic. In its history

1916
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,344
Are treating their Outkast

1917
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,624
Malefactors

1918
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
And lawbreakers

1919
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:42,304
In exactly the same fashion as the individual at the center of their religion was treated

1920
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,376
Jesus Christ of course perhaps the most famous

1921
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
Victim

1922
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
Of a hideous

1923
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Public

1924
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,240
Torture execution

1925
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
On a cross by the way

1926
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,408
Which is just how some of these European execution victims were killed two

1927
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,968
By their Christian Executioner's

1928
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
And while historians point out that sometimes the crowd could make the connection between the similarities between the

1929
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:11,744
Condemned having to make their way to the scaffold and Jesus having to make his way

1930
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,816
Enough to where he was going to be nailed to the cross

1931
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,912
No one seems to make the next obvious connection which is wait a minute

1932
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,752
If our Saviour died in one of these hideous public torture executions

1933
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,312
Should we really be doing this to other people

1934
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,408
Nonetheless this is kind of what makes history fun

1935
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,456
And we as people interesting

1936
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,784
You just can't make this stuff up

1937
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,160
So I think it's pretty fair to say

1938
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:46,304
That while we won't give the people in this era a get-out-of-jail-free card to totally be absolved

1939
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:51,936
From the charge that they might have been going to these Affairs for you know she or entertainment and enjoyment

1940
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:56,032
We will say that like all those other cases we mentioned you know the northeastern

1941
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:01,920
Native American tribes for example we don't know the water is too muddy to say cuz there's obviously ritual

1942
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,968
And religious elements involved

1943
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,344
It's only when you strip away those Elliman

1944
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:15,232
That may be the potential get-out-of-jail-free card religious

1945
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,024
Side of this

1946
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
Ceases to protect

1947
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
The society from charges

1948
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,680
That they're just watching this stuff to get a kick out of it

1949
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:30,592
And the reasons by the way that this will happen over the period for about 1500 to 1800 R complex

1950
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:34,432
They're arguing about they're also interwoven so it's very difficult to say

1951
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:40,832
You have to pay a lot of attention to this element what's going on because it's hard to quantify how much that matters compared to some other element is going on

1952
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
And how they interact

1953
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
Take for example one of the theories

1954
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,952
Which I love I love this thing because it

1955
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,304
There's an element with it just touches some hardcore history little nerve of mine

1956
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,352
One of the ideas behind

1957
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:58,752
How these executions go from these religious experiences with a crowd of The Condemned are working together to get a soul to heaven

1958
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,336
More theories on how this changes Friedland

1959
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
Subscribe to this I guess I think

1960
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
And that's at the Lutheran

1961
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,992
Change this a bit

1962
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,576
You know there's this great schism right we all understand the Protestant

1963
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:17,696
Reformation the big revolution Martin Luther kicks off and by the way the Protestants as it is

1964
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,536
Overall entity didn't seem to have a problem with executions

1965
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,560
Luther

1966
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,608
Was quoted as saying was famous quote.

1967
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,192
The hands of the Executioner the hands of God or something like that

1968
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,568
But when these Lutheran's begin to be early on executed as Heretics

1969
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,616
They're a curiosity for the crowd

1970
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,688
And one of the reasons they were curiosity

1971
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
Friedland another's right is that

1972
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,040
They will go to the execution

1973
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,064
Happy

1974
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Glad handing

1975
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,392
Patient and ready

1976
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
And

1977
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:54,560
The thing about them that's so difficult is that when the the confessors are dealing with them or the priests are dealing with them with your throat

1978
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,120
You're dealing with them or the crowd is trying to deal with them

1979
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:00,448
There's almost a like who's out christening huella

1980
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,520
You can call them Heretics all you want but when they're

1981
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,800
Screaming

1982
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,640
In pain during the execution there screaming out the name of Jesus Christ

1983
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,760
What are we saying earlier that vine I like

1984
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:19,392
During this. The most horrible procedures were done on devout Christians by even more devout Christians

1985
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,952
The Freeland and others point out that

1986
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,768
This may have short-circuited

1987
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,352
This entire ritual we talked about earlier right the one

1988
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:33,984
Whereas on Peter sparenberg says he says this requires the cooperation of The Condemned for it to work right

1989
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,544
Are you go home after watching one of these events feeling

1990
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,824
Satisfied

1991
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:43,200
And like you did a good thing and like all is right in the world everything has to go as planned but what if the criminals

1992
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,760
As you would have seen them these Heretics

1993
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
What is they don't repent

1994
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,856
What if they don't say they were wrong

1995
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,160
What if they don't play the role

1996
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:58,304
That they're supposed to play well it doesn't number of thing but the one thing it certainly does as pointed out over and over by several different people

1997
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,352
Is it short-circuits the script

1998
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,192
The one thing these events don't have a lot of

1999
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:09,568
Is uncertainty at the very formalized Affair we just described these executions in the Middle Ages and afterwards

2000
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,664
The fact that these Lutheran's could do anything

2001
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:16,480
Adds an element of uncertainty

2002
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:22,112
Are they going to recant their faith right before they're about to be burned alive

2003
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,160
Sometimes they did sometimes he didn't

2004
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,696
It creates a

2005
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,488
Level of uncertainty

2006
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,072
It is not that dissimilar pardon me for saying so

2007
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
To a sporting event

2008
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:34,656
When you don't know the outcome

2009
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,240
Freedom quotes historian David Nichols

2010
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,616
Who said that people were quote drawn to the burning of Heretics by curiosity

2011
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:48,480
They were Novelties and people wish to see how this new kind of criminal face death

2012
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
And quote

2013
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,064
Apparently this

2014
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,856
Curiosity about

2015
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,160
Protestant Heritage won't last very long

2016
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,208
But some historians think that this

2017
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:04,864
Plays a role in breaking down the barriers if you will separating people were going to these things for ritual reasons

2018
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,168
People are going to these things for spectacles

2019
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:14,848
Now that said before there's disagreement on a lot of this stuff a lot of the question we're getting into now you will find the app

2020
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,128
Experts I've noticed

2021
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:20,224
Disagree not that this is a factor but how much weight you give each fact

2022
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,552
You're so we just mentioned the Curiosity factor with Protestants Heretics

2023
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,832
Import news.

2024
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
Different people disagree

2025
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,464
There are other elements in play here

2026
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,512
That should be mentioned that are interesting that are

2027
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,536
Part of the

2028
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,328
Reality of the times if you will

2029
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,912
How about the fact that this is the. Where people really start

2030
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,448
Examining

2031
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,728
And

2032
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,264
Medically

2033
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,824
Dissecting human bodies

2034
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:53,504
So it'll be like a theater sometimes they'll open up a person and they'll be a crowd watching from above of disinterested science

2035
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:58,624
Who will see y'all at the ligaments work and there is the aorta I needed that kind of stuff

2036
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,928
And they get these bodies by the way

2037
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
Usually from execution victims

2038
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
And it's

2039
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:10,656
Considered to be one of the parts of the sentence that the judge wants to make it extra bad he'll say not only are going to break you on the Wheel

2040
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,984
But afterwards we're going to give you to the doctors to

2041
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,056
It was called anatomize you'll be an atomizer

2042
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:24,736
Now you and me we may say who cares we're already dead but you're talkin about people have a very different belief system and being an atomizer

2043
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,040
Is not only something that might mess you up

2044
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,576
In heaven question

2045
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,368
It's darn

2046
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Shameful

2047
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:38,560
And another thing you'll notice of these executions were modern people will go away. Who cares it's part of shame in the

2048
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:43,168
Individual and maybe their family and certainly anyone who might want to do what they did

2049
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:48,544
The by far the greatest amount of agreement you will see when you read from

2050
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,872
Years ago to now the experts on the subject of

2051
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,688
And these kinds of executions and what's involved

2052
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,736
The elephant in the living room is state power

2053
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,760
State Authority

2054
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:03,392
You mentioned earlier and if you look at the fall of the Western Roman Empire

2055
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:08,256
And the development of states in the history of all that afterwards you famously will get to the

2056
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:15,168
Treaty of Westphalia in the 17th century where they will talk about the nation-state being the highest form of four

2057
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,960
Political organization all that kind of stuff

2058
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,800
It's during this period that these nation-states these budding

2059
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:27,456
Infant nation-states are beginning to create the sort of bureaucracy and power and all that stuff that we associate with them

2060
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,760
Now the number one thing you have to do by the way

2061
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,320
We secure a monopoly of force

2062
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,112
You can't run

2063
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:40,512
A modern nation-state and have a bunch of War Lords and Barons and other people able to have their own private armies and

2064
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
Messing with you

2065
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:46,656
Job one get rid of them and there's only one Authority and they're in the Capitol you begin to get these

2066
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,448
The so-called absolutist

2067
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,008
States of the earth Louis XIV era

2068
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:56,640
There's a lot of reason this is important as I may be the number one most important part

2069
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:01,248
Let's start with the fact that it's the main reason you can't follow the story chronologically

2070
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,064
Because depending on how advanced

2071
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,392
The authority of the state is in any given region

2072
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:12,000
The execution procedures and all that stuff will be at different phases so for example

2073
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,280
Places like London

2074
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,328
A country like England

2075
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:18,144
Which establishes a monopoly of force

2076
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,728
A relatively early compared to the rest of the states in Europe

2077
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,056
You will see the executions take on a different form

2078
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:29,920
You will see the goal of the state being different you will see the reaction of the crowd watching differently

2079
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,736
Paris will do something similar

2080
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:35,808
But you could go out in the Hinterlands go to some small

2081
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,368
Place in Bavaria Maybe

2082
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:44,768
And you'll find it a long time after they stop doing the whole religious connection with The Condemned and all that

2083
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:48,864
Hiding places like London and Paris they're still doing it in the Backwoods of Bavaria

2084
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,680
So this is all happening at different time

2085
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
Noesis we said

2086
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,360
You lose the get-out-of-jail-free card when your ritual turns into a spectacle

2087
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,896
How much do you blame

2088
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:04,736
The power of the state for this well let's understand what they do right

2089
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,040
They begin to have a problem

2090
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,856
With the religious side of this whole deal

2091
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:13,440
Because the state's interest in these public executions

2092
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:18,304
Is four things to be as absolutely horrifying as possible to the crowd to send a message

2093
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,608
Write this is deterrence at work

2094
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,680
But what if through

2095
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:27,008
All those religious ceremonies that we've been talking about

2096
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:32,128
The religious side of things turns this Condemned criminal who the public should hate

2097
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,248
And be repelled by and not admire at all with that turns them into and almost fainted figure

2098
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,088
She began to see these complain to me if there is going hey

2099
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,880
We can't have this right

2100
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:45,184
We don't want the crowd

2101
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
To feel

2102
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,280
In any certain admiration we want them to feel

2103
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,608
Scoring for the speakers of the begin to have problems with

2104
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:56,192
What they want out of these executions conflicting with what the religious

2105
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
Side of the

2106
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,520
Budding nation-state

2107
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
With the execution

2108
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,616
The goals of the clergy and the state Aurora.

2109
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,224
Just by the way

2110
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:14,624
Correspond to the same. Where a bunch of the Elites in these most civilized society

2111
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:21,024
He's right here in London or Paris or what not the really civilized Elites are not so religious as they

2112
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,048
They used to be

2113
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:26,144
Again it would be stupid to say that they're not religious compared to now

2114
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,704
But compared to the so-called unit

2115
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Superstitious

2116
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,008
High water mark

2117
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
The Dark Ages

2118
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,824
The darkest we now know but you know

2119
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,592
I mean

2120
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:39,456
This is a whole different animal these rationalist of the budding pre Enlightenment era

2121
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
And they're often the ones

2122
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:44,576
Who are pushing this idea that hey these religious people

2123
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:50,976
Are screwing up the goal of this thing we just to make these criminals the worst people on Earth and you never want to be one

2124
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,584
Historian Richard Evans in rituals of Retribution

2125
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,376
Writes about this new

2126
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:03,776
So I've been lighting Montera that's budding and let's not pretend that it's budding among the rank-and-file in the population it's Buddy

2127
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,848
Cream of the inteligencia

2128
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,872
They have an infant

2129
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,896
Here's what

2130
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,176
Women's rights quote

2131
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:17,344
The new rationalistic concentration on public punishment is a theatrical demonstration designed to make the

2132
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,136
The Publican w**** the criminal

2133
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
Was part

2134
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,928
In other words

2135
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,720
Have a broader concentration

2136
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:25,792
Only educated in deterrent function of punishment

2137
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:29,120
It is easy to see that this concept of penal policy

2138
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:33,216
Ran counter to the religious and crypto materialist rituals

2139
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:37,568
Which played such a major part in capital punishment in the early modern period

2140
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:42,432
And which before the 18th century were accepted in the elite as well as popular culture

2141
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
And quote

2142
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:49,600
So this is an example of one of the arguments being made by someone Evans

2143
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:52,928
Identifies as one of the rationalists pamphleteers

2144
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,464
Of his day

2145
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,512
Listen to the arguments against

2146
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,328
The religious side of this hole

2147
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,656
What do we call it earlier Sublime beautiful experience

2148
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,496
Evan says quote

2149
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:13,408
The purpose of the public execution Thunder the rationalist pamphleteer was being completely undermined by this

2150
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
Contradiction

2151
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,736
It was unfortunately true he declared

2152
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:17,504
According to

2153
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,296
Pamphleteer from that era

2154
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:25,696
Set the rebel is not motivated by the desire to hear something good and that's be moved and uplifted

2155
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,744
Amelie by the wish to see something new

2156
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,792
Ella satisfy his curiosity

2157
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:33,120
Even on many occasions at the cost of human feelings

2158
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:40,288
The ultimate purpose of public punishment is largely frustrated if the malefactor dies in circumstances that arouse

2159
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,848
The kind of admiration and respect

2160
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:45,152
Infanticidal woman

2161
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,456
Clothing adorned purely and white

2162
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:53,856
Going joyfully to her spiritual wedding accompanied by the preacher is a very dangerous site for other people

2163
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:55,648
Call in the conduct of their daily life

2164
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,952
I'm a murderer he continues

2165
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:04,352
Going to his death accompanied by the size prayers and admonitions of the preacher and by the singing of inspire

2166
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,888
Hiring funeral hymns

2167
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,680
Open has the deleterious effect

2168
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:12,800
Of causing Weeknd Melancholy Nature's to desire for themselves a form of Extinction

2169
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
Which is they think

2170
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:20,224
Allows them to meet their end more peacefully indeed more joyfully they're on their deathbed after a lengthy illness

2171
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,504
And quote

2172
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:29,440
Evans then point out that this doesn't mean that these people thought The Condemned should have no religious consolation but that he should occur in private

2173
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,536
Will heal their souls privately but don't let it

2174
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,096
Soften the crowds attitude toward them in other words

2175
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:38,656
The idea that this should be something

2176
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:41,216
Were you see this person

2177
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:45,568
As going off to some wonderful destination in part because you are sending them there

2178
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,896
That screws up the whole reason the state wants this guy dead

2179
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,432
Woman dead

2180
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,504
Now there are other things

2181
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,064
They get thrown into the mix as reasons why

2182
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:01,184
The attitudes of the spectators change from ritualistic to voyeuristic

2183
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,232
Take broadsheet

2184
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,048
For example in the rise of broadsheets

2185
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,376
Huaraches by the way a term still used

2186
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,680
For the oversized newspapers today

2187
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,984
It was a kind of newspaper I guess you could

2188
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:18,080
Say a booklet of pamphlet sometimes it was just one big piece of paper

2189
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:24,224
But think about something that looked like Ben Franklin did it on his home printing press and that's not a bad mental

2190
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:31,904
Often times it was mostly illustrations because you know who knows how many people in the audience could actual

2191
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,672
Read

2192
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:39,584
The text would often explain what was in the pictures and sometimes it almost look like a comic book where you would see several different panels

2193
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,144
Showing events in chronological order

2194
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:48,800
When these things first started to appear either late 1500 maybe maybe even earlier

2195
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:55,456
What they were showing was often sold of a cautionary tale a moralistic cautionary tales

2196
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,224
First

2197
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:59,552
Pain in the comic book shows the person being born

2198
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,320
Everything looks

2199
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
Great

2200
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:05,440
And then the next painting shows the person that adolescents and still going good everything's right

2201
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,488
And in the third pain lady shows the

2202
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,280
Pivotal moment in their life

2203
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,048
When you decide to

2204
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,584
Killing Rob this person

2205
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,448
The next pain shows to being judged by the authorities and expand shows the being executed

2206
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
The last pain maybe just shows them

2207
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,288
You know hanging on a

2208
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,616
Deserted Gallows while the buzzards you know

2209
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,152
Circle above

2210
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,480
Of course the message to be absorbed by the

2211
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,784
Little kitties at night when you show it to them is

2212
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,856
You know I stay on the straight and narrow or this could happen to you

2213
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:38,720
Overtime these broadsheets begin to become more

2214
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,768
Let's just say lascivious

2215
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,304
Salacious

2216
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,632
Mushroom or something we would recognize today in fact

2217
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,960
If you said tabloid ask

2218
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,752
That might not be too far

2219
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:55,104
Off the mark this coincides with a. And again there's a chicken in an egg albumin

2220
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:59,200
How much is this is encouraged by the broadsheets and how much of it is

2221
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:02,016
In what societies doing in the broadsheets are just

2222
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,552
You're playing into the trend of it

2223
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
An increased interest in

2224
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,112
Crime

2225
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,416
Punishments

2226
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
And

2227
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:12,256
We would say today gossip I just read one

2228
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:17,632
History were the historian was saying that one of the Prime things language has been used for since language

2229
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,168
Began was gossiping

2230
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,216
Depending on how you

2231
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,008
Define that term but

2232
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,824
But in a sense these broadsheets

2233
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,104
It's began showing

2234
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:34,016
Real things when they were talk about these executions which kind of help with the drawer right the people knew that these were real events but then

2235
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,808
The people doing the broadsheets

2236
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
Wood

2237
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:43,232
Embellish them and dramatize them they make the crimes more salacious and they usually be about unspeakable

2238
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,048
Cool things with your course if you're gossiping the best thing to speaker

2239
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,328
And they would

2240
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:51,168
Then in lurid detail your talk about the execution

2241
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:56,032
And there would be a lot of focus on the dramatic last moment the climactic

2242
01:55:56,544 --> 01:56:00,384
You know last speech maybe from The Gallows or the Ravenstone

2243
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:08,576
Paul Friedland talked about one of these famous people think about son of a Matt drudge of their day just knowing exactly what sort of

2244
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,136
What the mood of the public really was

2245
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:15,232
Signifying right what buttons do you have to push to release a lot of these broadsheets

2246
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,512
And he says

2247
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:20,096
The titillating short stories had subjects like

2248
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,376
Murderer

2249
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Incest

2250
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:25,472
Parricide rape sodomy

2251
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,496
And sorcery

2252
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,592
No confirmation yet that one of the most called hardcore history

2253
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,176
But you begin to see

2254
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:36,224
A change in what the people want

2255
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:40,832
And it's difficult to untangle how much of that is because the people were changing

2256
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:47,232
And how much of the fact that the people were changing was due to the fact that they were reading more of these broadsheets and it was interesting the more

2257
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:51,584
Good morning True Crime and what was going on in these people who were dying on The Gallows and

2258
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,608
As one

2259
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:54,400
Historian said it was a tragic

2260
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,424
Spectacle

2261
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:58,240
But these people were selling these broadsheet publishers

2262
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:05,664
But it helped change the focus and some unquantifiable way from a religious oriented ritual

2263
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,968
To something that was much more based on

2264
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,504
Curiosity

2265
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,552
And salaciousness

2266
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
And maybe even

2267
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:20,512
Voyeuristic enjoyment of somebody else's suffering in this is where we get to the next and he's broadsheets

2268
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,352
We're existing at the same time and were intertwined with these people

2269
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:28,192
Who like to go to the executions now for Less religious

2270
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,472
More fun

2271
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:37,152
Historian Paul Friedland says that he was in the 16th century that you first saw the beginnings of these people who would show up

2272
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,944
What are the executions more for

2273
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Fun

2274
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:45,088
Baby funds not the right where they they were almost like a rarefied group of hobbyist

2275
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:48,416
It seems like for a while till it became a mass thing

2276
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:54,816
You know these people used to be in on it years before the trend started in August to see these guys all the time an Executor Khan

2277
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:57,632
These cuties people start to purchase

2278
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:00,192
You know select seats so that they could be

2279
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:03,264
At the execution but not right down in the mosh pit

2280
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:06,336
If I Freeland says that to those folks

2281
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:12,992
The people ride around the scaffold or the Ravenstone to The Gallows those people are actually characters in The Great tragic

2282
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,016
Spectacle 2

2283
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,808
Do you want to be able to

2284
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,648
Take the whole scene in from a really good Vantage Point preferably

2285
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:22,976
Elevated preferably with cocktail server Bowl end

2286
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,000
Snacks

2287
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:28,608
Freeland call these people penal voyeurs

2288
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:31,424
Lawyers of the penal system in action

2289
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,704
And he says

2290
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,496
That they are

2291
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:35,776
Perhaps analogous

2292
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:42,688
The same in a similar way to these people who are now enjoying the broadsheets as they get more and more pop life you know 19

2293
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,480
50s comic book e

2294
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,296
Salacious mean this is like steam pulp

2295
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,320
Maybe you could say

2296
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:52,160
And if there is a connection between the two perhaps maybe one helps

2297
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,440
Create the demand

2298
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:58,048
Well they got it right you read a few broadsheet than you think. Maybe I should see one of these things live

2299
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,096
Prelim rights quote

2300
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,496
In many respects we might think of rosettes readers hemans friends while they were set maybe the Matt drudge of his

2301
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,288
Day in terms of broadsheets

2302
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:12,896
We might think of rough sex readers as analogous to the new penal voyeurs

2303
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:16,224
Who are gathering in Windows overlooking the scaffold

2304
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,552
And precisely the time when he was writing his tragic stories

2305
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:26,208
Recette tragic realism made readers feel as if they were almost there at the scene of the execution

2306
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,560
What was the relative freedom to experience their emotions as if they weren't

2307
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:33,888
To forget themselves in SOB with the light in private

2308
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,704
In a way he writes

2309
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,824
The new penal voyeurs experienced a similar sense of being almost there

2310
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,920
From behind their windows at a considerable distance from the scaffold

2311
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:50,016
They can gaze out at the real-life drama unfolding beneath them

2312
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,808
And they could take it all in

2313
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,856
The suffering of the patient

2314
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,904
The Compassion of the crowd

2315
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,976
As if they were all characters in a magnificent spectacle

2316
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,536
To which they themselves were not participants

2317
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,816
The spectators

2318
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,632
They were beginning in other words

2319
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:12,032
To process the execution scenes played out before them almost as if they were watching one of Pierre corneille

2320
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:16,896
Neil's tragic heroes or heroines deliver a monologue prior to execution

2321
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:20,736
Peeking in on the most intimate moments of another person's life

2322
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,504
And death

2323
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:26,624
Outside the traditional framework of participation and compassion

2324
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,696
They were free to feel a sense of tragic Delight

2325
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,744
We're free to feel nothing at all

2326
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,864
For them the crowd gathered around the scaffold have become a kind of Greek chorus

2327
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:41,472
Reacting to the suffering of The Condemned and expressing The Compassion that they

2328
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,544
Seated up above the windows no longer felt

2329
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
And quote

2330
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:52,736
Now I'm relying on a small number of sources he was smaller than I like because believe it or not there's not a lot

2331
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:56,576
Especially in the stuff we're talking about here but I think friedland's wonderful

2332
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,856
Facebook is wonderful

2333
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,160
And he tries to get his mind around

2334
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:04,768
These really interesting questions he does as good of a job as any I've ever read on the subject

2335
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:08,864
He helps us understand this transition which is difficult because

2336
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:14,752
As we said earlier the transitions will happen at different times in different places you can't follow this chronologically

2337
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:22,432
And that's true is Need for any of these in a great so-called periods of history in your history books the Renaissance the enlightenment

2338
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:26,016
The Renaissance comes to Italy a lot earlier than it comes to

2339
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:26,784
England

2340
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
Right

2341
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,832
So we all understand

2342
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:33,952
Changing sensibilities changing cultural attitudes changing ways of life all this stuff

2343
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,744
Happens much more slowly

2344
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:39,072
Then sometimes the histories make it out to be we don't change we people like

2345
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,608
Light switching on a light bulb ride

2346
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,680
But in this era were talking about here

2347
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:47,776
There's an interesting little twist to it all you know someone wants told me

2348
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:50,336
When we were talking about how many listeners

2349
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
Someone had

2350
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,640
For their show

2351
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:57,248
And he said it's not always how many people are listening sometimes it's who those people are

2352
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,368
Well what if you manage to create a religion

2353
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,928
And you convert

2354
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,208
One person

2355
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
In another country

2356
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:11,584
But that person is the absolute ruler of that country

2357
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,656
How many individuals is that worth

2358
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,728
This day in age in our modern

2359
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:20,032
Democracies all around the world you got a co-op

2360
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:24,128
A significant chunk of the population for any big movement in any direction

2361
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,432
What if you just had to convert one person

2362
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:29,248
We mentioned Frederick the great earlier

2363
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,832
The ruler of Prussia so often associated with the enlightenment

2364
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:39,744
This is a guy who for all intents and purposes has done what a lot of other things around history of done convert to a new relay

2365
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,120
Religion and then sort of impose that on his country with his religion for lack of a better word

2366
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,400
He's reason

2367
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:53,312
And the Age of Enlightenment values I mean is we said earlier this was not a guy who was just reading Voltaire he was corresponding with

2368
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,336
Vim as a penpal

2369
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:57,920
He was all in his will

2370
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:59,712
The Enlightenment ideas

2371
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,552
And he wanted to create a country that represented this right that didn't have

2372
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:09,952
Torture is Barbara's torture executions going on all the time I mean one of the first things he did when he took the throne and got rid of the penalty of

2373
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,744
Burning sodomites

2374
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
Those of you

2375
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,096
Frederick the great fans on

2376
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,376
Understand that there might be some interest

2377
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,400
Irony there

2378
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:26,336
He also would eliminate execution for a ton of crimes mean you no longer cut the thieves hands off of me he's doing these are all

2379
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,616
Things that

2380
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:34,016
And he can do by himself as the ruler you don't have to convince a whole lot of people in the country that this is the way to go you can just do it

2381
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:37,600
And in Reading Richard Evans is

2382
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:39,904
Book on this fabulous book on the subject

2383
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:42,720
It's fascinating to note that in this era

2384
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:46,048
If you were going to have for example a less

2385
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:52,448
Medieval like I'm sorry that historians are cringing every time I use that word I mean it as an adjective of horrible torture

2386
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:55,520
Who is barbaric sort of system in a more enlightened age

2387
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:59,104
Reform was going to have to come from the absolute rulers because

2388
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:05,504
It doesn't sound like the people they ruled over had a lot of trouble with it at all they were enjoying it they were snapping up the broadsheet

2389
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:09,856
They were still going in large numbers and more and more people reviewing it doesn't event

2390
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:17,280
So if you'd actually told your people listen we're going to get rid of this breaking on the wheel thing they might have been upset about it if you actually said

2391
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:19,072
Said something like we're going to

2392
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:25,472
Strangle them first they don't feel any pain but don't worry we're still going to go through with the execution they wouldn't like that either this is how you

2393
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,752
Explain the idea

2394
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,800
Find secret strangling

2395
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:31,104
Why did Frederick the Great

2396
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:37,760
Tell his authorities to kill the execution victim before they went through the horrible execution but

2397
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,296
Make sure that the crowd didn't see it

2398
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,088
Because the crowd wanted to see it

2399
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,904
Why did Frederick the great care at all

2400
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,256
This is a little bit more interesting

2401
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,560
As I said this is

2402
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,584
Maybe

2403
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:54,656
A person whose illegitimate convert thinking

2404
02:04:55,168 --> 02:05:00,544
And why must this person suffer any more than is necessary and this gets to the whole idea behind the enlightened

2405
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
Write this

2406
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,616
This change in viewing things

2407
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:05,664
In such religious terms

2408
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,224
And you start to see a very modern isn't it

2409
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,272
A focus more on life

2410
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,808
Here and Now

2411
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:18,208
And not as much of an emphasis on the Hereafter for example we said earlier that in the earlier eras to punish

2412
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:22,304
Chinese executions was often viewed as the pain and suffering you went through

2413
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:25,120
The death was the byproduct

2414
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:29,472
People like Frederick the greater from a much more modern era where they look at the

2415
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,264
Punishment in the execution

2416
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:36,128
As being the deprivation of any more life or you don't get to live anymore your life ends now

2417
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,408
That's your punishment

2418
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
If that's the case

2419
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,016
Why don't you cut your head off why do we have to go through all the rigmarole

2420
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:45,088
Oh yeah because we need to send a message to the

2421
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:45,856
Krowd

2422
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,648
So strangle that guy

2423
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:48,416
But don't tell him

2424
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,232
Fascinate

2425
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,560
But why listen to me and we can have a next

2426
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:56,352
Mike Richard Evans explain it to us

2427
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,936
He quotes the law code that Frederick is working on

2428
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:07,360
Which enunciate this new rational is the way of viewing things like the penal system and says that these executions in the point of them

2429
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,128
Annie's quote

2430
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:12,480
Not to torment the criminal but rather to make a frightful example of him

2431
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,784
In order to arouse repugnance in other

2432
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:15,808
And quote

2433
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,112
And then

2434
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,136
Batman says

2435
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:19,904
About that

2436
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:20,928
Quote

2437
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:25,792
Nothing could express more clearly the monarchs understanding of the purpose of punishment

2438
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:30,912
It did not matter in the least the malefactor was actually dead when the sentence was carried out

2439
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,240
Where did it deliberate deception was being played on the public

2440
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,056
The rationalistic Frederick II

2441
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,872
The execution was a kind of pedagogical theater

2442
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:44,224
Drawing its purposes and its methods from the model of broke tragedy

2443
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:49,856
Its purpose was not to inflict suffering but you deter by making an example of the offender

2444
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:53,952
And it had to awaken feelings of revulsion in the onlooker

2445
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:57,792
Anything that seemed likely to frustrate this purpose was to be avoided

2446
02:06:58,048 --> 02:07:02,912
This included the infliction of pain to such a degree that the sympathy of the crowd by bia vote

2447
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:09,824
Apart from this obvious political purpose it is also important to note that Frederick did in the end considered a text

2448
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,640
Excessive suffering was if possible to be avoided

2449
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:17,248
The degree of pain with to be calculated precisely in rational terms

2450
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:18,784
And quote

2451
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:20,832
I love

2452
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:23,904
That this chapter in Evans book is entitled

2453
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,952
A rational degree of pain

2454
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,584
In other words these Enlightenment rulers had no problem at all

2455
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,912
With inflicting a ton of pain on people and suffering

2456
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:38,240
But only if it could be justified as practically useful

2457
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:45,920
This may look horrible to us today but it was a huge improvement over the previous conditions

2458
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:51,552
Another huge Improvement and other Enlightenment execution reform

2459
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:55,392
It doesn't seem like such a huge Improvement to our modern years

2460
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,952
Was the increasing

2461
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,232
Use of

2462
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:01,024
Decapitation

2463
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,816
As an execution method

2464
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:05,888
Used to be something in most of these countries

2465
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:11,008
It was reserved for the nobility back in the old days cuz it's considered to be an easy death when you think about the

2466
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:11,776
The alternatives

2467
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:16,640
Well over this are right in the more Progressive European Continental

2468
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,408
All states

2469
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,688
The

2470
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:20,992
Practice of beheading the victim becomes

2471
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:21,760
More

2472
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:27,136
Common and you see more and more people that wouldn't have qualified for it half a century before

2473
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,160
Being

2474
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:30,976
Either with a sword or an axe

2475
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:33,024
Cutting too at the neck

2476
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,840
And before you think about this is

2477
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:39,424
Just the most gruesome thing you can think of let's point out

2478
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,984
But when you think about your options what would you choose

2479
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:52,224
As long as everything goes well execution by the swords pretty quick right take it over

2480
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,296
Breaking on the wheel taking over strangulation death

2481
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,112
At The Gallows I mean what would you rather have right

2482
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,904
Of course the problem is

2483
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,184
That little phrase

2484
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
Executed well

2485
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:07,072
This requires some skill

2486
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:13,984
On the part of the execution or a skill which is only sometimes there are those of you out there who actually practice with a C

2487
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:14,752
Sword

2488
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,776
Know that

2489
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:16,800
Actually

2490
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,824
Cutting something

2491
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,872
Efficiently is not as easy as it looks

2492
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:21,920
There's some skill

2493
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:27,040
And hopefully you want to be relatively sober when carrying out the app

2494
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,856
And sometimes neither of those things

2495
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:32,160
Can be present at an execution

2496
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:34,720
And then you have something really nasty

2497
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
In front of you

2498
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:39,072
But here's the thing if you want the crowd

2499
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,144
Once again this is part of the attraction now

2500
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:47,264
You don't know how this is going to go even this has its own draw

2501
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:53,152
Because there's a lot of gossip and how these things go I mean you can go look at the French history where they're talking about

2502
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:56,224
In letters to each other these decapitations

2503
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,784
And the ones that don't go well or extra

2504
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
Gossipy

2505
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:03,904
More interesting little bit more juicy pardon

2506
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,928
Adjectives Arrow

2507
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,048
Another thing that has become somewhat of a draw to the crowd

2508
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:14,912
Is the fact that the way The Condemned person behaves right before they die

2509
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,960
Not as predictable as it used to be

2510
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,496
Remember

2511
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:21,056
There was a metaphysical carrot

2512
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:23,616
Involved here that helped Ensure

2513
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,664
Did The Condemned criminal

2514
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:30,272
Would play their part in this ritual this script is sort of a fair right there

2515
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:32,064
Penitent Christian for example

2516
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:34,624
Undergoing the good death

2517
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,672
But what if they weren't

2518
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:40,000
Pennington what if they weren't even acting like they were Christian

2519
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,560
What if they were complaining about the authorities

2520
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:45,632
What if they were abusing the religious figures that were there

2521
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,168
What is they were

2522
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:50,752
Clowning around for the crowd to get the crowds

2523
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,544
Approval

2524
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,896
And what if they were just going to their death like Clint Eastwood

2525
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:59,712
Absolutely fearless and cool

2526
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,016
And the crowd looked at them

2527
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,296
And

2528
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,320
Thought it was

2529
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:06,624
Awesome

2530
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,440
Badass

2531
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,232
I mean

2532
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,256
None of that

2533
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,536
Is

2534
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,328
What the enlightenment

2535
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,608
Rulers who are

2536
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,912
Orchestrating these new specs

2537
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,216
Nicole's that's not what they're trying to achieve

2538
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:22,752
I remember

2539
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:27,360
These are people that are a lot more concerned than people from the earlier era

2540
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,640
About effectiveness

2541
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,456
Can you take away

2542
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:33,248
This idea that the

2543
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,552
Person is going to go right to heaven

2544
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,952
And if this is all a religious ritual and their souls going to be saying everything's going to be wonderful afterwards if they cooperate

2545
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:45,792
You take away a big reason for them to cooperate

2546
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,376
Add to that the fact that most of these again more progress

2547
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:51,168
I say that because there was always

2548
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,496
Nasty activities continuing back in the backwood

2549
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:58,336
The places that are leading the edge of the satellite in Madera

2550
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:02,688
They're not torturing people much anymore either which was the other thing you could do

2551
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:04,736
If The Condemned criminal wasn't

2552
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,784
In the following the proper script right

2553
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:10,112
Apollo the scripture will take you back and you know tripaneer offer

2554
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:12,672
Take another pinch out of your skin with the glowing hot

2555
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:16,256
Tong's but if you're not doing blowing hot tongs anymore

2556
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:20,608
And if the person doesn't think they're going straight to heaven as long as they cooperate

2557
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:23,680
I don't cooperate as much the other thing that happens

2558
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:25,728
Is the people who are

2559
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:29,568
Absolutely out of their minds terrified

2560
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,360
I'm more of a problem to

2561
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:36,224
And that's not good if your Enlightenment ruler trying to send a message to the crowd

2562
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,552
Because when they see terrified people who is one author said

2563
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:44,928
Clearly understand the implications of both what they have done

2564
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:47,232
And what they're about to have done to them

2565
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,792
The crowd tends to become more sympathetic

2566
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,840
Annies Enlightenment rulers want

2567
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,168
You do not want the crowd sympathizing

2568
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:58,240
Or going to the side of the condemned

2569
02:12:58,496 --> 02:12:59,520
That's a complete

2570
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,568
Slap in the face

2571
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:05,408
In what the whole point of these executions were right but if you have a poor

2572
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:07,712
Woman convicted of infanticide

2573
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:13,088
Who no longer be sure that she's going to heaven and has no one telling her that that's everything that's going to happen

2574
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,136
A person who make beats

2575
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
Falling Up

2576
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:19,488
Heart as they're executing her emotionally

2577
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:20,768
I mean

2578
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:24,352
The crowd can be vicious and want to see blood

2579
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:27,936
But part of why they're going for this event

2580
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:31,008
Is it it is an amazing human drama

2581
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:33,312
It's not just watching people

2582
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,592
Be killed

2583
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:40,736
It's watching everything as we quoted from the Freeland piece of me in the most intimate moments of someone's life and death

2584
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:43,808
And you having an emotional

2585
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:49,696
High and low roller coaster rides throughout this whole thing is Again part of the attraction what will you ever find

2586
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,232
It is this deep

2587
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,512
And real

And when you have collected your audience

2604

Just at the moment when their minds are wrecked with expectation

2605
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:44,480
Let it be reported to the state criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining Square

2606
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,504
In the moment

2607
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,600
The Emptiness of the theater would demonstrate the comparative weakness

2608
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:51,136

2609

The Triumph of

2614
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,472
True sympathy I mean isn't this

2615
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,032
What we asked earlier if you made two films

Pain and suffering that we normally do in our movies in another show the real thing with real bullets real guns real

2618
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:18,784
What used to say

2619
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,088
Might depend on

2620
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:26,976
The specific individual in question right are you the kind of person that would go see a movie or movie be

2621
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:30,560
Remind me of Charles dickens's explanation

2622
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:35,424
Why people go to these public executions and what they get out of it he said

2623
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,728
It is in our secret nature

2624
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,056
To have a dark and Dreadful interest in the subject

2625
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:45,408
I need that sort of rings true least to my sensibilities

2626
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:48,480
Makes you wonder what else is in our

2627
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:49,760
Secret nature

2628
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:52,064
Are we all

2629
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:59,232
In a wired the same way do we all have that secret nature or some people different than other some people choose the real violence movie

2630
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:02,048
Others would never think of going to that they want to go see

2631
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:03,584
The imitative

2632
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:05,376
Because after all

2633
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:06,656
It provides

2634
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:11,520
A buffer that allows you to enjoy violence where if you knew it was real You couldn't possibly have fun

2635
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,336
Knowing that that person was suffering

2636
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,920
Did your thing to me that for other human beings

2637
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:21,504
That's exactly what makes it more exciting and worth watching

2638
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,880
Then they pretend stop right people really are suffering the Triumph is Burke said of real sympathy

2639
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:33,792
Now both Charles Dickens in Edinburgh are specifically referring to the English

2640
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:39,424
Xperia it's not really British yet although often times when you say English in this. Includes whales

2641
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:42,496
This is one of the most

2642
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:44,544
Intensely studied

2643
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:49,664
Versions of the public execution experience when we have these questions

2644
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:53,504
And you are reading in the English language

2645
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,832
The majority of the sources you're going to have are from England and it's

2646
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:04,000
Use the whole thing because the English experience is somewhat different than the continent for example we mentioned earlier a penchant for hanging

2647
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,400
As we all know right hanging has been around since before recorded history

2648
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:16,032
Maybe the cheapest the dirtiest way to execute somebody you can think of right

2649
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,872
No muss no fuss as long as you don't care about the suffering of the victim

2650
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:23,712
It's about as easy as you can get it's also sort of banal

2651
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:26,272
From a spectacle standpoint

2652
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:28,576
You know if you were actually crafting this for the

2653
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:32,672
You know the spectacle itself you'd say hanging really come on

2654
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,952
Where is the

2655
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:38,304
The English we should point out

2656
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:44,960
I pretty much enjoyed most every type of execution at one time or another they take a backseat to no one

2657
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:45,984
One on the continent

2658
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:48,032
And during various reins

2659
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:52,384
They would boil you they bring it in love to burn Heretics but then who doesn't

2660
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:54,688
Journeys R Us

2661
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:59,296
But the English experience has really color the whole

2662
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:03,648
Your question of public executions in the way the crowd behaves

2663
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,232
It's colored all of us in English speaking countries cuz the predominant

2664
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,792
Amount of evidence comes from England

2665
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:11,584
Colors

2666
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,656
Experience in other ways because the English are

2667
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,960
Ahead of their time I guess you can say

2668
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:21,312
In terms of the development of things that influences the public

2669
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,336
Execution so

2670
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:24,640
If you're one of those historians that wants to make

2671
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,176
State Authority

2672
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:29,504
Number one reason for these executions being the way they are

2673
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,040
Or the English r

2674
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:36,416
Ahead of most of the rest of the world and state formation modern Post westphalian State formation

2675
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,696
Right to their head of the game on

2676
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:39,232
Do you see the trends

2677
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,768
Showing up earlier there

2678
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:49,216
If you want to talk about the religious ritual side of the executions and how when that was eliminated because the absolute

2679
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:49,984
Just rulers

2680
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:52,544
Didn't think it was helping them deter crime

2681
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,312
Again

2682
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:57,152
The English were ahead of the game on that one too if for no other reason than

2683
02:18:57,408 --> 02:19:03,040
And unlike the absolutist regimes of the. On the continent in England it's not an absolutist Virginia

2684
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,880
You have a king but you have Parliament that mean it's all pretty

2685
02:19:07,136 --> 02:19:07,648
Famous Riley

2686
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:14,048
English system different than the continent but interesting lead a whole group of historians will say well that's why the

2687
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,840
English execution situation so different

2688
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,632
How is it different

2689
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:18,656
Well

2690
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:25,056
Certainly it fits The Stereotype that we often think of all these executions a lot more because the stereotype itself is of the

2691
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:27,104
English experience the whole Carnival Atmos

2692
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:27,872
Sphere

2693
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:29,408
At the public execution

2694
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,200
Very English

2695
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:32,992
The

2696
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:39,392
Bravado and the almost a joking nature that some of the condemned will show with the crowd

2697
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:41,184
You're the famous line

2698
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:46,816
If they would make the executions go through a very long soda procession on the way to the execution spot

2699
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:50,400
And they were bars on the way and one of the execution victims famous Leanna

2700
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:56,800
Go to the bar and get the drink or has it brought out them says I'll pay you on the way back and you're the crowd loves that right a little bravado on the way to

2701
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:57,568
Your death

2702
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:05,760
The English example is also unusual because they go through one of these periods where they sort of Troy

2703
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:09,088
Try to deter crime the way we talked about at the very beginning of the story

2704
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,880
But in certain areas the

2705
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:13,952
Legal system will get it through their head that the best way to

2706
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:18,304
Deter crime is to have maximum penalties for even minuscule cry

2707
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:19,328
Lots of

2708
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,656
There's a whole Chinese dynasty for example these other areas where

2709
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,448
And you steal something you're gone

2710
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,984
Any little crime you're gone

2711
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:29,312
In England is known now as the bloody code

2712
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:36,736
Which was a series of legal measures very class oriented by the way very skewed against the lower classes

2713
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:38,784
It started making

2714
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:41,344
Almost anything you can think of

2715
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,136
At least on the law books

2716
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:44,672
Punishable by Death

2717
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:47,744
You pickpocket somebody

2718
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,280
4 more than 12

2719
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:53,120
Pence twelve pence nothing right 12 Pence of value boom

2720
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:54,400
Eligible for the death penalty

2721
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:59,520
You wore disguise in the forest boom eligible for the death penalty

2722
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:01,568
How many got to beat like crazy

2723
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,432
I mean if you go and look at the law codes

2724
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:09,760
In England in the 1650s there

2725
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:11,808
Probably half a hundred

2726
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,112
Offenses that can get you the death penalty

2727
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:19,488
How do you write it in this is an era not that far from the Middle Ages and been on 50 things or what and I'll get you the death penalty

2728
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,072
Amir Century later

2729
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:25,376
It's like 200

2730
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:28,192
Offenses will get you the death

2731
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:31,520
And as I said many of them very small to very famous.

2732
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:33,312
In English History

2733
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,104
Now we should point out

2734
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:37,920
That there's lots of Pardons and

2735
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:46,112
Acts of mercy and all these things that the ruler in the church and whatnot can provide so that a lot of these people sentenced to death don't

2736
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,392
I'm actually go to The Gallows

2737
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,952
About a 35000

2738
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:51,744
Death sentences

2739
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:54,560
BAC control says

2740
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:56,864
Only 7000 executions happened

2741
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:59,424
But the executions were often

2742
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:04,288
Have people very much like the poor people who came to watch the execution

2743
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:07,872
And the crimes they were being killed for

2744
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:11,456
We're things that many in the crowd didn't consider all that bad

2745
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:14,528
You take a woman who starved her child

2746
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:17,856
And bring her up on the Gallows in England as

2747
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:19,136
Did happen

2748
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:23,232
And the women in the crowd will yell and scream horrible things at the red

2749
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:27,072
Did you bring a little petty pickpocket

2750
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,864
Or somebody who is Maybe

2751
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:32,704
Poaching the king's deer in the forest or something like that up there

2752
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,776
And then they make a jaunty Brave speech and maybe talk to her

2753
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:38,848
Pretty girl in the audience right before their executed

2754
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:41,408
And the crowd could find themselves very much

2755
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:42,944
On the side of the condemned

2756
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:45,760
Wow

2757
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:50,624
It's hard to imagine some of the more absolutist machines in Europe putting up with say

2758
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,160
Anti-government

2759
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,000
Screens on The Gallows from there condemned

2760
02:22:56,256 --> 02:23:00,864
Criminals in England gatrell says they have a long-standing custom of allowing

2761
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,656
The Condemned to say some stuff

2762
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:05,472
Before they die even if it gets the dishes

2763
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:10,336
Letter said earlier the English usually like to hang

2764
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:11,872
They're condemned criminals

2765
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:16,736
And while this might seem like a more merciful sentence than some of the things we've been talking about

2766
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:19,808
Going on in Germany in the Netherlands and France and places like that

2767
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,112
Good trail reminds us that

2768
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:23,648
You know it's not as

2769
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:28,256
Sweet and nice as you may think I mean if you're thinking of judicial hangings today

2770
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:30,304
Those should be called neck

2771
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,840
Would be a more

2772
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:32,864
Accurate

2773
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:33,632
Because they're

2774
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:37,216
Scientifically designed in most cases

2775
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:38,496
To break the neck

2776
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,544
Of the execution victim

2777
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,592
Which is theoretically quick

2778
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:44,640
And theoretically painless

2779
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:47,968
Before the modern era though

2780
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:52,832
If somebody's neck broke that was a side byproduct that wasn't the goal

2781
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:54,624
They were often using ropes that

2782
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:56,672
12 in Long

2783
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:58,208
I'm turning people off

2784
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:58,976
Lottery

2785
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:01,024
That's not neck-breaking

2786
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:03,328
That's good old-fashioned strangulation

2787
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,632
And gatrell reminds us

2788
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:10,496
That they are much nastier than the thin veneer of respectability

2789
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:15,360
It is often used with euphemisms another ways to disguise the horribleness of it

2790
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:18,944
He says when you when you get right back down to Basics you were talking about

2791
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:20,736
He says the choking

2792
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:23,040
And the pissing and the screaming

2793
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,344
And that is often hidden in the sources

2794
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:28,672
The people who went and watched it live

2795
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:31,488
You damn well what they were saying and getting as

2796
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:35,584
He also points out and just blew my mind when I read it I'm going to quote it verbatim

2797
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:37,376
He said quote

2798
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:44,032
Late eighteenth and early nineteenth century English people were very familiar with the grimy business of hanging

2799
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:46,592
This is so large a social fact

2800
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:49,152
Separating that era from our own

2801
02:24:49,408 --> 02:24:52,992
That although it is not the most obvious way of defining modern times

2802
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,528
It must be one of them

2803
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:55,552
And quote

2804
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,088
In other words

2805
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:00,928
Defining modern times if you want to look at it that way

2806
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,232
It's the age where we are not

2807
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,256
Familiar

2808
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:06,048
With public executions

2809
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,376
Where the idea

2810
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:12,704
But you might see a human body hanging

2811
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:14,752
Somewhere near you

2812
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:18,592
And not think of that as something out of the ordinary

2813
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:22,432
Is what separates modern times from shall we say

2814
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,456
Early modern

2815
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,224
X

2816
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,784
I will say

2817
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,624
That the English rationale the way that the English defend

2818
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:33,696
Their massive amount of executions compared to

2819
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:39,072
Places like Prussia and the Netherlands that are starting to really really really decline their execution

2820
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,120
Is the English do it in sort of

2821
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:43,936
We Americans would say with a liberty argument

2822
02:25:44,448 --> 02:25:49,056
They claim that the only way to deter crime in their system

2823
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:52,128
Is by making sure that if they catch you

2824
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:56,992
You will receive maximum punishment because the chances of catching you are tiny

2825
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:00,832
Because the English do not want to live in a police state

2826
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:03,392
History palfrey lucente frenchify

2827
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:08,000
Police state like those absolutist regimes in the price you pay

2828
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:11,584
We're not having that surveillance to deter crime in advance

2829
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:15,168
Is allowing that they're going to be that crime

2830
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:17,216
But if the authorities catch you

2831
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,752
You will receive a

2832
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:20,032
Enormous penis

2833
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:23,360
And it supposed to have

2834
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:27,456
Just like the executions on the European continent a deterrent effect

2835
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:30,272
As a famous Axiom from the time

2836
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
Said

2837
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:34,880
In Britain that men are not hanged for stealing horses

2838
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:37,440
But that horses may not be stolen

2839
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
Bright

2840
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:45,376
Control quotes in minister of parliament writing in the middle 1800s

2841
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:50,496
Who said that the question was not quote one of softening the heart

2842
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:53,568
Or saving the souls of murderers

2843
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:56,640
Butter preventing the Queen's subjects from being murdered

2844
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:57,920
And quote

2845
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,248
And he also points out

2846
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:03,040
The hanging isn't

2847
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:05,344
Something that was chosen because

2848
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:08,928
It's particularly easy necessarily even though it is

2849
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:15,584
But because it was particularly appalling in terms of sending a message he says no one who lived in

2850
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,376
That era was under the illusion

2851
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:20,448
The hanging was anything other than a horrible way to die

2852
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:25,056
It's also a very dishonorable way to die

2853
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:27,616
And this is not the sort of things

2854
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:33,760
That we would pay much attention to when we look back we're focused on the pain in the suffering of the actual execution are

2855
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,088
But if you could bring back someone from that era

2856
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,160
And watch one of these executions on television

2857
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:41,696
Together

2858
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:45,024
They would notice things that maybe we wouldn't

2859
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:48,096
And they would be able to determine whether or not the

2860
02:27:48,864 --> 02:27:50,400
The court that sentence this

2861
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:52,192
Malefactor had considered

2862
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:58,848
You know that they should be extra harsh or extra lenient I mean for example where they dragged into the scaffold to The Gallows or

2863
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:00,384
The Ravenstone

2864
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,688
In a freshly skinned

2865
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,712
Ox-hide

2866
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,016
They were it's more dishonorable

2867
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:08,064
Is a whole bunch of

2868
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:12,672
Things that we would call symbolic today that don't matter much to off that would have been

2869
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:16,768
To some of these people more important than the fact that they were dying

2870
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:20,352
I was fascinated to read some of these things where

2871
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:22,400
Yeah they're really trying to

2872
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:27,264
Alter their sentence these people who are being sentenced to who committed these crimes one way or the other

2873
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:33,152
But you're not trying to get out of dying either they're trying to die in a more honorable way

2874
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:38,784
Where they're trying to reduce the number of dishonorable things that have to happen to them on the way to their death

2875
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:41,344
Once again

2876
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:46,720
Hard for us to understand today cuz their status in their society means nothing to us of course

2877
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:55,680
A shame and dishonor plays its role in the state's effort to use these Affairs to deter other pee

2878
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:59,264
People from committing these crimes right in that sense the people in England

2879
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:02,848
We'd better be called British somewhere in the middle of the story

2880
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:04,640
Are not in any way different

2881
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:11,296
Then their neighbors on the continent during this time. And in fact not very different from you know people conducting next week

2882
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:15,392
Fusions all throughout history I mean isn't that the overwhelming reason you do them

2883
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:16,928
Naughty

2884
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:20,768
Only but it's right stop people from committing those kind of crimes

2885
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,840
But of course as we said

2886
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:27,936
You everyone in Europe during this time. In the West End during this era where

2887
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:34,336
The ritual side of things the religious side of things soda fading more into the background leaving people that are more concerned with effective

2888
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:36,384
Deterrence is what you're after

2889
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:40,224
Amor Amor the public intellectuals in these countries start asking

2890
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,016
Legitimate questions about

2891
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,808
Well is that what we're getting

2892
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:49,696
Are we getting determined effects for these horrible spectacular executions in there was a lively debate

2893
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:53,024
You would think that exhibit a

2894
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:59,936
For anyone making the argument these executions were tutoring people would be the fact that the audience is enjoying themselves

2895
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:00,704
Right there not

2896
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:04,800
Terrified and awed by the Majesty of the Law & Justice

2897
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:11,200
You're more likely to be worried that they didn't pack enough snacks in case the pregame festivities for this little event run long

2898
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:18,624
She got this disconnect between what you're after what you're getting and then you have this third big elephant in the living room and we've already

2899
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,672
Alluded to this earlier it's

2900
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,744
Sometimes just called the change in Sensibility

2901
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:29,376
As with everything in this happens at different times in different places and there's a trickle-down

2902
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:34,496
Will start sometimes

2903
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:39,104
Other times it will become some of the litterick Latin to be a trickle-down overtime

2904
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:42,176
Some of these changes and sensibilities will never reach

2905
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,200
The lowest class

2906
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:43,968
The people

2907
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:50,368
I'm trying to explain the so-called change and sensibilities is as difficult as trying to explain something like

2908
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:51,904
Why did the 1960s happen

2909
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:53,440
Right I mean it's going to be

2910
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:54,720
Is zeitgeist

2911
02:30:54,976 --> 02:30:57,280
As sometimes reality can be referred to

2912
02:30:57,536 --> 02:31:03,680
And playing into the Zeitgeist going to be all different kinds of friends and forces and whatnot I mean to just give you one little teeny strand

2913
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:05,216
As an example of how

2914
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:09,824
How many things are playing in with the growth of the popularity of novels

2915
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,616
In this period from about 1500

2916
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:15,200
People reading more these things

2917
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:19,040
With characters and storylines designed to get them to

2918
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:20,064
Feel

2919
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:22,368
And be sensitive and care

2920
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:25,696
And have empathy for the people in the story right

2921
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:33,632
I read one historian who suggested that there's a cause and effects paying back and forth between the culture in these novels but then Essentia

2922
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:35,424
Actually they were training

2923
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:36,704
People

2924
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:42,848
To have empathy now again who's reading novels in these societies right the literate people to begin with so

2925
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:46,176
It's not a broad-based change in sensibilities

2926
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:48,736
What is the change in sensibilities amongst

2927
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:51,296
Shall we call the class of people

2928
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:53,344
The most folk want to emulate

2929
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,136
Many of these countries

2930
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:57,440
You now have middle-class people

2931
02:31:57,696 --> 02:32:01,280
And a certain amount of Mobility that didn't exist in

2932
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:03,072
In the classes before

2933
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:08,960
And one of the ways you Associated yourself with the better classes to emulate their attitudes

2934
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:10,752
And if they were starting to think

2935
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:13,056
The public executions were Goshen

2936
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:15,360
And if there was something inhuman about them

2937
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:16,640
And barbaric

2938
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:19,712
Well then those are the kinds of attitudes that began to

2939
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:23,552
You infuse your class overtime right as I said the trickle-down effect

2940
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:24,832
Now here's the thing

2941
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:28,928
Why would these executions be considered

2942
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:35,328
Anything other than great entertainment wasn't at these hobbyist from the upper classes that were first going and enjoying them spectacles to be

2943
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:36,096
Begin with

2944
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:38,912
Well here's the way

2945
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:40,960
Astoria Paul Friedland explains it

2946
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:47,616
You brought brushing when you talk about the intellectuals of the Enlightenment because there were different opinions from the intellectual

2947
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:48,640
Rules of the Enlightenment

2948
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:50,688
But one of them was that man

2949
02:32:50,944 --> 02:32:52,224
For lack of a better word

2950
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:53,760
Is basically good

2951
02:32:54,272 --> 02:32:57,088
And it would basically sympathetic and basically empathetic

2952
02:32:57,344 --> 02:33:02,720
And if you're in a situation where a lot of people aren't that way than they've got screws loose right there the outline

2953
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:08,608
That's not normal human behavior that's abnormal human behavior the problem isn't that when these people are writing this

2954
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,192
That's the way their societies are behaving Paul Friedman rights quote

2955
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:14,752
The growing public fascination with

2956
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:17,056
And curiosity about executions

2957
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:20,384
We're on a collision course with contemporary piano Theory

2958
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:24,736
Which regarded exemplary deterrence is the very reason for punishment

2959
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,760
I change the French

2960
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:27,552
He continues

2961
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:33,952
Quote while the new penal voyeurism was still restricted to the relatively privileged members of society

2962
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:38,816
You seem to take notice of the discrepancy between the intent of the punishment

2963
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:41,888
And the way in which it was being perceived by The Spectator

2964
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:45,728
What is this new way of watching made its way down the social ladder

2965
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:48,032
Alarm Bells were sounded

2966
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,312
And quote

2967
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,360
He then points out the

2968
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:55,456
The praying and weeping crowds from the religious ritual era

2969
02:33:55,712 --> 02:34:00,320
It probably never really been terrified by executions the way the state wanted

2970
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,344
This was

2971
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:02,368
Kind of getting

2972
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,672
Ctrl e then points out

2973
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:09,792
But there's a third element involved this elephant in the living room this Revolution and Sensibility

2974
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:10,816
She said quote

2975
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:15,680
At the same time another cultural crisis was looming on the horizon

2976
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:18,496
Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries

2977
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:22,848
A revolution and sensibilities would sweep over both sides of the channel

2978
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:27,712
Human beings would be reimagined as naturally benevolent and compassionate

2979
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,528
The eager anticipation of amateurs

2980
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:33,856
To watch executions as if they were a dramatic performance

2981
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:35,392
For perhaps even worse

2982
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:37,696
The callous indifference of those in the windows

2983
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,744
Who watched and felt nothing

2984
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,328
Would be difficult to square with the new view of human nature

2985
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:45,120
As instinctively compassionate

2986
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:46,912
And quote

2987
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:49,984
He then goes on to say

2988
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,824
Did you have this growing conflict between Spectators desperate

2989
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,128
To watch people die on the scaffold

2990
02:34:56,384 --> 02:35:01,760
Penal theory that is built around the idea that people won't be able to watch that kind of thing without being terrified

2991
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:07,904
And he said the culture of sensibility that insist that people can't watch this stuff without being horrified

2992
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:10,464
Because if they are horrified

2993
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,000
The kind of inhuman

2994
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,864
The reactions of the crowds

2995
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,400
A lot of these cases

2996
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:20,704
Vexing Boethiah

2997
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,728
Authorities

2998
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:24,032
And a lot of the intellectual class

2999
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:26,592
It would not reacting the way that they were supposed to

3000
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:31,200
Not as the target audience for these spectacles of Justice

3001
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:35,040
Not as human beings watching cruelty to other human being

3002
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:38,880
I read in one of the things I was researching to this program

3003
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:45,536
An account where they were talking about watching somebody burning alive in front of you today

3004
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:48,608
And they said it's impossible for most people

3005
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:53,984
To watch something like that up close without feeling almost physical pain themselves

3006
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,800
And then it's not a mental respond

3007
02:35:57,056 --> 02:36:00,896
It's not like you actually process it all its instantaneous

3008
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:05,248
That's right you almost feel the physical pain for the person who suffering in front of you

3009
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:10,368
Just like a drama saying about people not vomiting at the horrible executions

3010
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:14,720
A people like Damian right there not vomiting we would today in large numbers why

3011
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:18,560
It's not a process thing it's something that's so ingrained in US

3012
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:21,632
Did it justice become physical somehow the

3013
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:27,264
Does the cultural Elements by Cantrell said that you cry based on what your culture tells you you should be crying at

3014
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:30,336
In the fact that you couldn't watch somebody burning alive today

3015
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:35,968
Without feeling physical pain and somebody before this Revolution and sensibilities happened

3016
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:36,992
Could

3017
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:39,296
Is an interesting difference in US isn't it

3018
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,368
I still can't

3019
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,904
Make myself believe

3020
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,720
That we're not empathetic creatures may just be

3021
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:53,376
Discriminatory and pathetic creatures I mean if you're watching someone broken on the wheel you may or may not care about

3022
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:54,912
Bottom if it's your child

3023
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:59,264
I think you're going to feel every blow as if it's happening to you personally

3024
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:02,336
Maybe you feel that way if it was your first cousin

3025
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:06,432
Maybe you feel that way if it was your second cousin twice removed your neighbor from down the street

3026
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,224
But maybe it's some point

3027
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:13,088
You no longer feel quite the same you're not quite feeling the blows like it's your own child

3028
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:16,672
As we said about the Roman Arena how did these Romans watch these people

3029
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:22,304
In a massacred in front of them in horribly painful ways and enjoyed they didn't see them as human Maybe

3030
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:28,448
I just laid it's a Christian to visit to that not human not the same not my kid

3031
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:32,544
I said earlier that I want to do this from

3032
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,568
A couple of different hang

3033
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:40,736
Simply taking that approach seems to be a perfect example of something we do in the post

3034
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:45,856
Revolution and sensibilities age that maybe would not have been such an obvious way to do it before

3035
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:47,904
It's an effort to try to

3036
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:51,488
Walk a mile in the moccasins of the people in this story write

3037
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,584
An effort to gain a little empathy for what they were going through a little sympathy

3038
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:58,400
It's kind of strange because of course

3039
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:03,520
And there are so many different things how would you be able to gain any real empathy

3040
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:06,080
And some of these questions have no answers but

3041
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:10,176
There's something human in this that wants to ask them anyway I mean take for example

3042
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:12,224
Trying to have a little empathy

3043
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,784
With someone who's going to get their head cut off

3044
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:16,576
I asked you

3045
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:19,392
How would anybody know what that felt

3046
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:23,488
Doesn't keep us from wondering though does it

3047
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:27,584
I imagine you'd Wonder a hell of a lot more in a lot more intensely

3048
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:29,632
If this be heading that we're

3049
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:31,936
Theorizing about what about to happen

3050
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:32,960
To you

3051
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:36,032
If it's me

3052
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,336
I have to break this entire

3053
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:40,640
Experience down into two halves

3054
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:42,688
The obvious have

3055
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:47,552
What's it like walking up to that scaffold and dealing with the execution

3056
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,368
But then there's a whole other half

3057
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:54,720
Which is easy to forget about when we're just discussing this order from a high-minded

3058
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,256
Now

3059
02:38:56,768 --> 02:38:59,584
What's it like to live with this hanging over your head

3060
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,608
4 days

3061
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:01,632
4 weeks

3062
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:03,936
Iran account by app

3063
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:04,704
Boxing trainer

3064
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,008
Famous guy who said the minute the fight was signed

3065
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:09,056
Is boxer instantly started Living with

3066
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:11,360
The fear no matter how tough and strong and

3067
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:17,760
Badass Leeward of their opponent any live with it every night they would wake up in a cold sweat and ever dream about

3068
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:18,784
Just up all the time

3069
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:20,832
What's it like living instead of

3070
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:23,904
Knowing you're going to face Joe Louis on the 25th of August

3071
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,208
You're going to get your head cut off on the

3072
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:27,232
25th of August

3073
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:32,352
You got to believe that there were people that actually seen some writings

3074
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:39,776
The Condemned or basically just over it by this point they're doing this is prolonging the agony let's just get the whole thing over with

3075
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:42,336
Prolonging the agony is part of the whole deal

3076
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:46,176
When we make a transition by the way from

3077
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:52,064
From the religious figure sincerely trying to save the soul to an Era where

3078
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:58,464
The authorities are looking at the religious figures in the much less devout way and seeing them as just another way to break down the condemned

3079
02:39:58,720 --> 02:39:59,232
Bright

3080
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,584
This whole situation breaks people down so I can Lodge

3081
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:04,608
Doesn't it

3082
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,888
What's worse

3083
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:09,216
Horrific agonies you put yourself

3084
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:10,752
Through mentally before

3085
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,544
The event or the event itself

3086
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:14,336
Depends on what

3087
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,104
Going to happen to you

3088
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:15,872
You right

3089
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:18,432
In your head if you're thinking you got off easy

3090
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:24,576
That breaking on the wheel charge that you could have been convicted of has been commuted to a nice honorable quick

3091
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:29,184
Decapitation I'm sure in your head you're thinking of the stories were you for those things

3092
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,208
Things go wrong right

3093
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:32,256
Take the one

3094
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:36,352
The. Joel Harrington in his book The faithful executioner accounts

3095
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,400
A woman in Nuremberg

3096
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:43,264
Convicted of infanticide this is as you will know already probably by listening to me

3097
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:46,848
Pretty pretty common charge in this era

3098
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:48,384
I'm sure today we would

3099
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,176
Chalk a bunch of that up

3100
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:51,968
Postpartum depression

3101
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:53,248
Nonetheless

3102
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:56,064
Lot of women going to their deaths in this era

3103
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:57,600
For killing their newborns

3104
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:01,440
Woman named Margarita boeglin

3105
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:05,792
In 1641 an extremely beautiful person of 19 years

3106
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:07,840
She's describing the sources

3107
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:10,912
Most to be decapitated

3108
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:13,472
She was sat in the chair

3109
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:16,800
She was made ready by The Executioner's

3110
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,336
Assistance

3111
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,616
Make sure that the neck is

3112
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:21,152
Get exposed in the right area

3113
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:27,552
And in this particular kind of execution By The Sword you swing it like a baseball bat more than you swing it like a chopping

3114
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:28,576
Instrument

3115
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,880
Do you want a nice level swing

3116
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:33,184
And you didn't always get

3117
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:33,952
1

3118
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:38,048
According to 1 Chronicle reprinted by Harrington

3119
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,328
Quote

3120
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:45,728
This poor child was very ill and weak so that she had to be carried and brought to the Gallows or Ravenstone

3121
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:50,336
How much is sat down on the chair Meister Valentin he's the Executioner

3122
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
By the way

3123
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:52,384
Circled around her

3124
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,432
Like a calf around a Manger

3125
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:55,968
And with the sword

3126
02:41:56,224 --> 02:42:00,576
Struck a span of wood in a piece of skin as big as a coin from her head

3127
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:02,368
Knocking her under the chair

3128
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:08,512
And since he hadn't heard her body and since she fell so bravely the crowd asked that she be released

3129
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:12,352
No such luck though Harrington says

3130
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:17,472
In from underneath the chair he says the victim now wounded

3131
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:20,288
Cried out this 19 year old girl

3132
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:24,384
Quote Oh help me for God's sake what she said often and repeated

3133
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:28,992
Then The Executioner's assistant grabbed her and set her back on the chair

3134
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:31,808
Whereupon the Executioner delivered a second blow

3135
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:35,136
And this time hacked in the neck behind her head

3136
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:37,696
At what she however fell from the chair

3137
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:41,792
Still alive again shouting God have mercy

3138
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:45,376
After this the hangman hacked and cut her head on the ground

3139
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:46,912
And quote

3140
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:50,240
There's another account

3141
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:52,288
In another book of a hangman in

3142
02:42:53,312 --> 02:42:55,104
Greeting hangman in northern France

3143
02:42:55,616 --> 02:42:58,944
The required more than 20 blows of the sword

3144
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,224
To cut off the head

3145
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:01,248
Of his bick

3146
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,296
I'm a

3147
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:04,320
Four Swordsmen

3148
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,856
That might even be a

3149
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:07,648
Generous description

3150
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:09,696
But I can't imagine taking

3151
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:11,488
20 Strokes of the sword

3152
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,816
Wrapped in human neck

3153
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:21,728
It should be pointed out that legally most of the time these executions were allowed three strikes it's a little late

3154
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,264
All right three strikes and you're out

3155
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,336
And help meant the crowd to pick up stones and throw them at you

3156
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:29,664
Not legally of course the king never said what you can kill my executioner

3157
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:31,200
He doesn't do in three Strokes

3158
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:34,016
You know there's an Unwritten rules to baseball and

3159
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,576
Decapitations in this era to

3160
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:43,488
And even if you sat there and wondered about how quickly a decapitation went if it went well

3161
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,536
Maybe you would worry that it might not

3162
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,352
Unless if it did go well

3163
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:49,888
Wouldn't you choose

3164
02:43:50,144 --> 02:43:51,936
This method if it were

3165
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:55,264
You up to you although there are different ones right I mean as we said earlier

3166
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:56,800
I think you know if you're going to go through

3167
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:59,104
An execution during this era

3168
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:04,480
You know what is your choice of method of dying because there's no Lethal Injections

3169
02:44:05,248 --> 02:44:06,784
I don't need a whole lot of accounts of

3170
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,368
Hemlock drinking since Socrates back in ancient Athens

3171
02:44:11,136 --> 02:44:13,184
And believe it or not we modern people

3172
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,976
Obviously think of shooting is a

3173
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:16,000
Potential

3174
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:18,048
Method to get out of this

3175
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:20,096
Relatively painlessly

3176
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:23,168
And yet that seems to be something that was confined to

3177
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:24,448
How soldierwood

3178
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:27,776
To be treated rather than someone in civilian life you don't hear a lot of shootings

3179
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:30,080
As a civilian form of execution

3180
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:31,872
When is Sarah starts though

3181
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:32,896
It's coming

3182
02:44:33,152 --> 02:44:36,480
Ricky cuz it starts off with sort of the biblical approach

3183
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:41,600
Two execution methods write us with an eye for an eye Mosaic law kind of thing

3184
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:48,256
And so for example of a murderer in the latter part of the Middle Ages maybe into the Renaissance

3185
02:44:48,512 --> 02:44:51,072
With a hammer he might be executed

3186
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:54,400
You don't want to scaffold by an executioner holding a hammer

3187
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:59,008
I've heard all different kinds of accounts what what the ritual was in there

3188
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:04,640
Religious elements to it but it even goes back to pre-christian Superstition canceling out the evil of the deed

3189
02:45:04,896 --> 02:45:07,712
You hit your murder victim with a hammer that we hit you with

3190
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:08,480
With one

3191
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:12,064
And even when the era of actually dispatching people that way

3192
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,856
You know starting to go away

3193
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:18,976
In some places usually once again outside the big cities when you get to the superstitions Countryside

3194
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:23,072
They would still include the eye for an eye thing even if it was only symbolic

3195
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:25,632
So we might strangle the person

3196
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:27,936
Who was the hammer murderer

3197
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:31,520
But then after they were dead hit him with a hammer few times as what you know

3198
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:32,544
Symbolic Act

3199
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:39,456
So the ways in which people were killed in this early. Though often mirrored what they did if you were an arsonist a burn you

3200
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:42,272
They drowned a lot of people for a lot of crime scene

3201
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:46,880
Drowning believe it or not an actual form of execution widely practiced during this era

3202
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:53,024
And you decapitate you break you on the wheel any number of things

3203
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:53,792
Right

3204
02:45:55,584 --> 02:45:57,120
The other thing that could happen to you

3205
02:45:57,376 --> 02:46:01,472
Course is it they could do damage to you on the way to being executed

3206
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:08,383
So if just dying isn't enough for you in this early. You might be tortured on the way to death and one of the ways that was pretty popular

3207
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:10,943
Involve those famous red-hot tongs

3208
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:14,783
We alluded to them earlier I think it's got giant pincers

3209
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:16,063
That are glowing

3210
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:17,343
Orange

3211
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:20,927
And then what they do is they take what we're called usually nips

3212
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:21,695
Out of you

3213
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:27,071
They would take the glowing pincers take it to a piece of skin maybe your breasts maybe your arm

3214
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:29,631
And take him and burn and rip a chunk out

3215
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:31,679
More than three nips

3216
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:32,703
I ready

3217
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:34,239
Considered to be fatal

3218
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:36,799
And nobody wanted to give anybody more than

3219
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:42,175
The goal was to have someone suffering not to have them die before they died where they

3220
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:43,711
We're supposed to win the way they were suppose

3221
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:44,479
I'm still

3222
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:51,391
But there's broadsheets and carvings in artwork showing the Executioner riding in the cart with the victim

3223
02:46:51,903 --> 02:46:56,767
You know giving him the prescribed court-mandated number of nips on the way to the

3224
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:57,791
Scaffold

3225
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:02,911
Facebook seeing Justice Done starring Paul Friedland

3226
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:08,031
Quotes a primary source someone who witnessed one of these executions this one in December

3227
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:09,567
1558

3228
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:10,847
Involving

3229
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:13,663
The pre-execution nastiness

3230
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:14,687
Furosemide

3231
02:47:14,943 --> 02:47:17,503
Psychologically torture you as you thought about it

3232
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:19,807
4 days or maybe weeks

3233
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:21,087
Ahead of time

3234
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:22,367
He writes

3235
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,135
Quote

3236
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:24,927
The guilty party

3237
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:26,719
After having made a full confession

3238
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:28,255
Was condemned to be

3239
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:29,279
Executed

3240
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:33,375
After the reading of the Judgment the Executioner had him getting into a cart

3241
02:47:33,631 --> 02:47:36,703
And he was placed on the knees of The Executioner's wife

3242
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:39,519
The Executioner then began to torture him

3243
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:44,383
With red hot pincers until they reach the house of the cannon who he had murdered

3244
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:47,967
They're the Executioner cut off both his hands

3245
02:47:48,223 --> 02:47:49,503
Upon A chopping block

3246
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:52,063
That have been placed for this purpose on the cart

3247
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:54,623
The Executioner's wife blindfolded him

3248
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:56,671
And her husband cut off a hand

3249
02:47:56,927 --> 02:47:58,207
She would place the stump

3250
02:47:58,463 --> 02:48:02,047
From which a spurt of blood was escaping into a kind of cone

3251
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:05,119
Witches solidly tied up to stop the hemorrhaging

3252
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:10,495
He was then led to the core debayle where he was decapitated and cut up into four pieces

3253
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:14,079
Which were then hung from olive trees outside the city walls

3254
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:15,103
And quote

3255
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:22,783
Now again one of the ritualize aspects of this that was also popular in the earlier. What can go

3256
02:48:23,039 --> 02:48:24,575
Go to the scene of the crime

3257
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:28,927
To carry out the act of Justice right so we cut this guy's hands off

3258
02:48:29,183 --> 02:48:32,255
Outside the home of the person those hand killed

3259
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:40,191
This is another aspect that may have kept the size of the crowds down at earlier executions because there was no set spot

3260
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:41,727
For the right if you had to have them

3261
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:46,847
At important ritualize places connected to the crime itself they were in different spots all the time

3262
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:53,247
Once you have a raven stone or a Gallows that's in the same place all the time probably in a pretty high traffic

3263
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,015
Bigspot

3264
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:56,831
Well then everybody knows where the execution is going to be

3265
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:58,879
Usaw corresponding growth in

3266
02:48:59,135 --> 02:48:59,647
Crowd size

3267
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:06,303
In fact historian Richard Evans says crowd sizes showing up these public X

3268
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:09,375
Executions in Germany will continue to rise

3269
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:12,191
And will be at their very highest when the practice

3270
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:13,471
Is done away with

3271
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:16,031
You never really lost its draw

3272
02:49:16,543 --> 02:49:17,823
And it's draw

3273
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:19,615
Once you know you start getting

3274
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:24,479
The numbers of real reason you don't have a lot of the information before this. Is it wasn't recorded

3275
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:26,271
Once you start getting the numbers

3276
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:28,831
It's already a lot of people showing up to these

3277
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:34,975
Garrett Fagan says that win

3278
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:39,583
The sources begin to pay attention he says to The Spectators in the 18th century

3279
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:43,167
The crowds emerge as substantial to enormous

3280
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:50,079
Evans and rituals of Retribution right specifically about the German experience quote

3281
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:54,175
Although contemporary estimates must be taken with a pinch of salt

3282
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:57,759
It is clear that the crowds at these events were frequently very large

3283
02:49:58,271 --> 02:50:04,415
It was said that 20,000 people attended an execution in the thuringia in town of Klingon in 1788

3284
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:05,439
For example

3285
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:08,255
And the same number the last public burning

3286
02:50:08,511 --> 02:50:10,303
Eldon eisenach in 1804

3287
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:16,959
Welding 1771 the night before the execution of Matthias klostermeyer the town of Munich

3288
02:50:17,215 --> 02:50:17,727
Nick was

3289
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:20,543
Now he's quoting a primary source from that era

3290
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:21,311
Quote

3291
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:26,687
Already so filled with Outsiders that they could barely be accommodated anymore in private houses

3292
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:33,599
That's the next day's Dawn had scarcely broken when a wave of people came flooding through all the streets and alleys

3293
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:37,439
And while one part of the crowd pressed onto the town hall

3294
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:41,279
The other hastened over the Danube Ridge to the place of execution

3295
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:43,839
Where the mass is Multiplied more and more

3296
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:46,143
Evans continues quote

3297
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:49,983
In the Saxon capital of Dresden at the execution of the Bandit

3298
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:55,615
Lips tullian in four of his companions in crime on the 8th of March 1715

3299
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:57,407
More than 20000 people

3300
02:50:57,663 --> 02:51:03,807
144 carriages and some 300 horses looked on according to a contemporary report

3301
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:07,391
On the 19th of February 1807

3302
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:09,439
Now quoting from a contemporary report

3303
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:15,839
Thousands of Spectators surrounded the high Market in Vienna where The Condemned man got onto the wag

3304
02:51:16,095 --> 02:51:17,631
With the two preachers

3305
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:19,679
Thousands of people filled the streets

3306
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:21,727
And many thousands of spectators

3307
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:24,287
Turn around in a circle at the place of execution

3308
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:29,151
Eden quotes a person who remembered

3309
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:35,551
The entire population turned out in the town he was from during an execution in the streets and houses away from

3310
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:38,879
From the execution Square were completely devoid of life

3311
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:42,719
Victor gatrell says that in

3312
02:51:43,231 --> 02:51:48,095
England London you could sometimes have crowds of 100000 people or more

3313
02:51:49,375 --> 02:51:51,679
Let's remember all these numbers come from

3314
02:51:52,191 --> 02:51:56,287
Times and places where the populations were a lot smaller than they are now

3315
02:51:57,055 --> 02:52:00,127
Some of these towns that had 20000 people show up for

3316
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:04,735
Executions may not have had 20000 people living in the nearby vicinity

3317
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:07,807
And this was an ERA when it was a lot harder to get from place

3318
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:11,903
Play some 20000 people showing up at a village execution is a lot of people

3319
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:15,743
100000 people showing up to an execution in London

3320
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:18,815
Is a large execution even though that's a big city

3321
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:20,607
After all

3322
02:52:21,375 --> 02:52:23,167
100000 people is a large

3323
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:26,495
Spectator crowd at a major sporting event now

3324
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:30,847
With population transportation and everything up to Modern standards

3325
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:34,687
So good luck finding anything

3326
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:37,759
The Drew is many people in this time.

3327
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:39,807
Aziz executions did

3328
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:43,135
As large as some of the battles of the.

3329
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:51,839
Another reason this plays into walking a mile in the moccasins of The Condemned here

3330
02:52:52,351 --> 02:52:55,423
Is because they literally sometimes had to do that

3331
02:52:56,191 --> 02:52:57,471
On the way to the x

3332
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:58,239
Execution site

3333
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:01,311
Conditions were different everywhere

3334
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:06,175
But a lot of the more famous sites there were long for sessions that took you

3335
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:08,479
You know to the place where you were going to die

3336
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:11,039
And there were a lot of people

3337
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:13,855
Who viewed you and screamed at you

3338
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:17,695
Or supported you as the case may be along the way

3339
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:18,719
In fact

3340
02:53:19,487 --> 02:53:25,631
It's probably not too much of a conjecture to wonder if The Condemned person had ever seen a crowd as large as the

3341
02:53:25,887 --> 02:53:27,679
The one that shows up to watch them die

3342
02:53:31,263 --> 02:53:31,775
The

3343
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:34,335
Place where you're dying May determine

3344
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:39,455
And how the crowd reacts the time. May also and of course the nature of your crime

3345
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:41,759
Sometimes they were

3346
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:46,111
All over you in a terrible way making your experience that much worse

3347
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:50,207
Sometimes they were sort of in your Camp praying for you hoping for you

3348
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:56,607
Or maybe just a little bit sympathetic it in the later. To your roguish courage that you're showing on the scaffold or whatever it might be

3349
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:01,215
It's interesting to note that when they will finally do away with the

3350
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:05,823
In a public execution hear some of the people who were critical of that said that your

3351
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:12,223
Depriving The Condemned of the of the only support they have in this moment where they're going to die right to cry

3352
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:14,271
Crowds on their side but sometimes it's not

3353
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:15,807
There's a lot of stories about

3354
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:20,927
Especially you know the crowd in England could be particularly nasty if they didn't like you

3355
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:24,767
And things thrown in an epic that's her old and all kinds of things

3356
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:28,351
Think about how much that plays into the experience though

3357
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:33,215
Of the terribleness of it if you're The Condemned having to see all these people

3358
02:54:33,471 --> 02:54:37,567
I just your your senses absolutely must have been overwhelmed

3359
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:40,639
By the amount of sensory input coming your way

3360
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:43,199
There's several accounts where

3361
02:54:43,711 --> 02:54:49,087
The I really just figured you were writing these accounts say that The Condemned all along the procession

3362
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:51,903
Kept her eyes focused a couple of inches from their face

3363
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:53,183
Add a crucifix

3364
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:59,327
Fix it was being held out going to just kind of trying to tunnel vision this thing and not think about another thing about the not thinking about it

3365
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,863
If you're trying to walk

3366
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:04,959
A mile in the other man's moccasins or woman's moccasins as the case may be

3367
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:06,495
Is it that person

3368
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:08,031
Sober

3369
02:55:09,311 --> 02:55:12,895
And if it was your situation you were dealing with here would you be

3370
02:55:14,687 --> 02:55:19,807
Earlier we quoted that British Observer who watched a breaking on the wheel in Germany are breaking with the wheel

3371
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:25,183
And he was critical of the idea that these people wouldn't go to The Gallows

3372
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:27,487
Ravenstone is we said

3373
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:34,143
So intoxicated that they really didn't know what was going on that it kept them from making their most important last piece

3374
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:39,263
So what have we got in the world in the whole thing what you want to kind of have your wits about you when you do that cuz it's really important

3375
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:42,335
He mentioned that the crowds would have took that job

3376
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:45,407
For him so that maybe The Condemned could be out of it

3377
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:49,503
In in many of these different areas that are chronicled

3378
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:50,527
There are

3379
02:55:51,039 --> 02:55:53,087
Shall we call them alcohol

3380
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:59,487
Injection opportunities along the way and some of its built into the ritual right some of these places

3381
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:05,375
These Bars along the famous execution router known for any stop here you bring the condemned in here and he gets

3382
02:56:05,887 --> 02:56:07,167
A glass of wine from Austin

3383
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:07,935
It's gentle

3384
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:11,007
Contribution to the public do it or whatever it might be

3385
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:17,663
Cottrell points out over and over how many of these people going to the Gallows were

3386
02:56:18,175 --> 02:56:18,687
Dead drop

3387
02:56:18,943 --> 02:56:20,991
Practically now here's the thing again

3388
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:23,551
Who wants to broad-brush cuz let's say

3389
02:56:23,807 --> 02:56:27,391
You're going to be beheaded on the continent one of those

3390
02:56:27,647 --> 02:56:30,719
Lucky people who get the decapitation is your sentence

3391
02:56:31,231 --> 02:56:37,375
You don't want to be drunk I would think I mean you might want to be so you don't know what's going on but if you don't know what's going on you

3392
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:38,143
Might move

3393
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:44,287
The number one reason that people didn't have successful decapitations is cuz they moved

3394
02:56:45,055 --> 02:56:47,871
So you don't want to be swaying around drunkenly

3395
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:51,711
Having who knows maybe a slightly drunken executioner trying to

3396
02:56:51,967 --> 02:56:52,991
Figure out how to

3397
02:56:53,503 --> 02:56:54,783
Time the wobble

3398
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:57,855
What

3399
02:56:58,111 --> 02:57:02,207
Experience might be when The Condemned finally reaches the scaffold looks out

3400
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:03,487
Cease that crowd

3401
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:07,583
Look at a fear of public speaking imagine what that's like

3402
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:08,351
Although some of these

3403
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:11,935
People in the places that let them speak would speak their usually be

3404
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:18,335
Awesome religious stuff that would go on the scaffold and during the ritual religious. Quite a bit sometimes

3405
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:21,919
And then the execution with command

3406
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:24,991
Do you feel

3407
02:57:25,759 --> 02:57:30,623
Anything in a decapitation that goes off well do you have any Consciousness at all

3408
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:31,647
The tablet

3409
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:37,023
Why do people feel right about this is a famous and I'm sure totally discredited so don't even bother

3410
02:57:37,535 --> 02:57:40,351
I'll say it's probably just credited at the outside of people

3411
02:57:40,863 --> 02:57:45,471
Some men are doctors during the time. Working in the era when the guillotine was in

3412
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:47,775
Heavy use you know that Blade the drops

3413
02:57:49,055 --> 02:57:50,079
Mechanically separated

3414
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:52,127
Head from their body

3415
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:58,015
They have some I guess if I'm going to remember you're had some discussions with The Condemned basically saying listen

3416
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:59,039
Bridges experiment

3417
02:57:59,295 --> 02:57:59,807
Your dad so

3418
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:03,391
You know what you feel anything blink you know things like that

3419
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:06,463
Slapping the face of the recently

3420
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:08,767
Decapitated head and

3421
02:58:09,023 --> 02:58:10,559
Trying to get the eye to focus on them

3422
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:15,423
Let's just say it's been interesting to wonder even with the spinal cord severed

3423
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:19,263
How long any amount of Consciousness might exist I mean

3424
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:20,543
2 seconds

3425
02:58:20,799 --> 02:58:21,567
3 seconds

3426
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:22,847
No seconds

3427
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:27,711
That brings me to one of the interesting lines about hanging

3428
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:30,271
That I looked up when I was trying to figure out a cave

3429
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:32,575
If that's what decapitations like what is hanging

3430
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:38,463
And hangings weird and I want to be careful here because while I was researching and I was shocked to find

3431
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:43,071
A lot of comments from people who had relatives who would hang themselves and we're not so happy that

3432
02:58:43,327 --> 02:58:48,959
The various sites I was looking at we're giving detailed information about it I thought maybe you didn't able these horrible

3433
02:58:49,471 --> 02:58:51,007
Family tragedies in there so

3434
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:55,615
Thousand apologies in advance that's not what I'm trying to do here but when you try to get into the minds of people

3435
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:57,151
Lunch is going to go through this

3436
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:03,039
But who are going to ruminate on what it's like to go through this for a long time before they actually do

3437
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:10,207
You know what's that like an and I have to say that there is I've searched and searched I find no common agreement

3438
02:59:10,975 --> 02:59:14,047
On what it's like in terms of painful vs. Painful

3439
02:59:14,815 --> 02:59:16,095
Whole lot of different

3440
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:16,863
Accounts

3441
02:59:17,119 --> 02:59:23,263
Some of which state very painful other account saying that they were out the minute it happened let's remember something though in this. As we say

3442
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:24,031
Set earlier

3443
02:59:24,287 --> 02:59:25,567
This is not the

3444
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:29,407
Modern kind of hanging where the goal is to try

3445
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:30,943
To break the neck

3446
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:32,479
Of The Condemned person through it

3447
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:34,271
Particularly long drop

3448
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:38,879
And a jerk in a specific direction that supposed to separate the spinal cord

3449
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:41,439
Right considered to be again a quick death

3450
02:59:41,951 --> 02:59:43,999
No one's quite sure how long

3451
02:59:45,023 --> 02:59:49,375
In this era as I said earlier you would often see people hung on very short rope

3452
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:50,399
It were like

3453
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:53,215
12in long I mean if you go look at the

3454
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:53,983
Artwork

3455
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:55,263
From the.

3456
02:59:55,519 --> 03:00:00,639
It almost looks like they did it wrong like to Modern are you going with ropes not long enough they must have had to shorten it for that

3457
03:00:00,895 --> 03:00:04,223
To get it into the whole frame artistically speaking know that's how they did it

3458
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:06,783
It look like somebody basically was hanging by

3459
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:09,343
A really really 6in short rope

3460
03:00:09,855 --> 03:00:10,879
But that means you're strangled

3461
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:11,903
By Design

3462
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:15,487
And often times they would simply take you up on a ladder

3463
03:00:15,743 --> 03:00:17,023
Turn the ladder sideways

3464
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,047
Have I said

3465
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:19,327
And turn you off

3466
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:20,351
It's called

3467
03:00:20,863 --> 03:00:24,191
In England before they got all fancy with the

3468
03:00:24,447 --> 03:00:26,751
The trapdoor stuff that used to just

3469
03:00:27,007 --> 03:00:29,567
Take several people sometimes on the back of a cart

3470
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:32,383
In a hook him up to a Gallows which was often just

3471
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:33,407
A

3472
03:00:34,175 --> 03:00:35,711
Piece of woods

3473
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:38,271
Lay between two trees

3474
03:00:38,527 --> 03:00:42,111
And just drive off and leave those people as it was said dancing in the air

3475
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:46,719
Those things by the way can go bad too

3476
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:48,511
Because people would

3477
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:50,047
Other lots of stories

3478
03:00:50,303 --> 03:00:50,815
Actually about

3479
03:00:51,071 --> 03:00:54,911
Family members and Friends definitely executioner sometimes

3480
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:56,959
Having to run up and

3481
03:00:57,215 --> 03:01:00,799
You hold on and pull on the legs of their loved one

3482
03:01:01,055 --> 03:01:03,359
To try to speed this process up

3483
03:01:04,895 --> 03:01:11,039
I read several accounts are from people that all said that you get this really loud roaring in your ears

3484
03:01:11,551 --> 03:01:13,855
You're probably from the blood being constrained

3485
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:17,951
And ones who survived said that when the Rope was removed

3486
03:01:18,207 --> 03:01:23,071
You know how it feels when your foot falls asleep and it's really painful when it starts to have pins and needles

3487
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:29,471
They had that in their head and they said it was so bad you you halfway want to go back and be executed rather not have to deal with

3488
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:35,103
I'm tempted to say after the research I've done that

3489
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:39,199
The experience is heavily based on any number of variables

3490
03:01:39,711 --> 03:01:40,479
I could range

3491
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:42,527
Across a wide spectrum of

3492
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:48,927
And you were out one minute after they put the Rope around your neck to 15 minutes later you're still choking strangle

3493
03:01:49,695 --> 03:01:50,207
And

3494
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:51,743
And convulsing

3495
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:56,095
And the crowds watching that in taking note by the way this is all something we're

3496
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:57,887
You are the entertainment

3497
03:01:58,399 --> 03:01:59,679
And one wonders

3498
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:01,471
You know if you know

3499
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:03,263
For any period of time

3500
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:04,799
What's going on

3501
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:08,639
You know mean your performance as its perceived by the audience for example

3502
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:15,039
And it's like a contemporary can from the 1700 by Doctor Who's living in an area where they are executing people

3503
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:17,087
By hanging a lot so we have a lot of time

3504
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,879
You do research on this

3505
03:02:19,135 --> 03:02:22,207
And he says that there's a certain period of time with those being hanged

3506
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:23,487
No they're hanging

3507
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:31,167
Control quotes a doctor Alexander Monroe professor of anatomy Edinburgh

3508
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:33,983

Telling a guy named James Boswell vet quote

3510
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:40,127
The man who was hanged suffers a great deal

3511
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:43,199
Videos not once stupefied by the shop

3512
03:02:43,711 --> 03:02:46,015
Amana suffocated by hanging in a rope

3513
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:48,575
Justice by having his respirations.

3514
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:50,623
By having a pillow pressed on the face

3515
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:54,975
For some time after a man is thrown over he is sensible

3516
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:57,535
It is conscious that he is hanging

3517
03:02:57,791 --> 03:02:58,303
Ndk

3518
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:02,399
There are lots of accounts of the Rope

3519
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,679
Breaking

3520
03:03:04,191 --> 03:03:07,519
The malefactor falling to the ground and someone

3521
03:03:07,775 --> 03:03:10,335
Recovering and sometimes the crowd gets on their side that day

3522
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:15,455
This is like a sign from God and they should be reprieved or later on in the nonce not so religious.

3523
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:19,807
But it's not fair to try to kill somebody twice nonetheless they're often hanged again

3524
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:23,135
But they give us some story sometimes about what it was like

3525
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:26,719
You know what they perceived and again stories are variable so it

3526
03:03:26,975 --> 03:03:27,743
It's likely that it's

3527
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:34,655
Independent heavily dependent on conditions and variables like where the Rope ends up for example around your neck

3528
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:38,495
Is it around your windpipe or your carotid arteries things like

3529
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:42,591
In fact a lot of these variable

3530
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:44,383
What's the time

3531
03:03:45,151 --> 03:03:45,663
And

3532
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:48,479
We talked about where to place the news and how to position

3533
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:49,759
The Condemned

3534
03:03:50,527 --> 03:03:51,039

Trump wants out

3536
03:03:52,063 --> 03:03:53,087
Route 8 made little difference

3537
03:03:54,111 --> 03:03:57,183
And he'll mention the names of a bunch of different people that went to their death

3538
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:59,231
On The Gallows here

3539
03:04:00,511 --> 03:04:01,023
Bill also

3540
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:05,631
Caught a lot of primary sources so if you hear me say quote within the quote it's a primary source

3541
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:08,191
He writes about these precautions

3542
03:04:08,447 --> 03:04:11,775
To position the Rope well to limit the suffering quote

3543
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:14,335
These precautions did little good however

3544
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:17,151
It was a common pattern in what ensued

3545
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:21,759
As an early nineteenth-century broadside representatively declared

3546
03:04:22,015 --> 03:04:24,319
The news of one man's halter quote

3547
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:26,879
Having slipped to the back part of his neck

3548
03:04:27,135 --> 03:04:29,951
It was a full 10 minutes before he was dead and quote

3549
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:34,559
So too with the very last tyburn hanging in 1783

3550
03:04:34,815 --> 03:04:35,327
Quote

3551
03:04:35,583 --> 03:04:38,655
The news of the halter having slipped to the back part of his neck

3552
03:04:38,911 --> 03:04:42,239
It was longer than usual before he was dead and quote

3553
03:04:43,007 --> 03:04:44,031
Hatfields news

3554
03:04:44,287 --> 03:04:46,335
Slipped twice Cottrell says

3555
03:04:46,591 --> 03:04:50,943
And when he did drop it was only 18 in so his death was prolonged and noisy

3556
03:04:51,967 --> 03:04:52,735
Is

3557
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:56,575
Struggled on the end of his rope for five minutes before he was still

3558
03:04:57,087 --> 03:04:58,111
Hartley quote

3559
03:04:58,367 --> 03:04:59,647
Was much convulsed

3560
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:02,463
And struggled for 10 minutes after the drop fell

3561
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:03,487
And quote

3562
03:05:03,999 --> 03:05:08,607
The not having slipped behind his neck Governor wall in 1802

3563
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:11,167
Took 15 minutes to die in agony

3564
03:05:11,423 --> 03:05:13,215
So the hangman pulled on his legs

3565
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:20,127
In 1804 and Harold was driven to a scaffold erected in the widest part of the Old Bailey

3566
03:05:20,383 --> 03:05:22,687
The regular dropping out of commission for a while

3567
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:25,247
When the cart Drew away

3568
03:05:25,503 --> 03:05:26,527
Meaning when the cart

3569
03:05:26,783 --> 03:05:29,599
She was standing on Drew way and left her hanging

3570
03:05:29,855 --> 03:05:33,183
By her neck with nothing underneath her when the car Drew away quote

3571
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:34,975
She gave a faint scream

3572
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:39,327
And for two or three minutes after she was suspended appeared to be in great agony

3573
03:05:39,583 --> 03:05:41,887
Moving her hands up and down frequently

3574
03:05:42,143 --> 03:05:42,655
And quote

3575
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:45,215
Control continues quote

3576
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:51,615
Hanging glass go in 1824 treason James Wilson quote died with difficulty

3577
03:05:52,127 --> 03:05:53,919
And after it hung about 20 minutes

3578
03:05:54,175 --> 03:05:56,991
Blood was seen on his cap opposite the ears

3579
03:05:57,503 --> 03:06:00,063
In 1829 Thomas birmingham's rope

3580
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:01,343
Slipped and quote

3581
03:06:01,599 --> 03:06:04,415
Prolong his sufferings to a considerable extent

3582
03:06:04,671 --> 03:06:06,975
He breathed in agony for nearly 5 minutes

3583
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:11,071
Shouts and screams From the Mob cause the Executioner

3584
03:06:11,327 --> 03:06:13,887
To hang on his legs until life was extinct

3585
03:06:14,143 --> 03:06:14,655
And quote

3586
03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:19,775
And it could get wild and once again if you were in the crowd

3587
03:06:20,287 --> 03:06:24,383
Perhaps that's what keeps bringing you back you never know what's going to happen

3588
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:25,919
Control continu

3589
03:06:26,175 --> 03:06:26,687
Is quote

3590
03:06:26,943 --> 03:06:31,551
Got a 1797 hanging the scaffold platform gave way

3591
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:35,391
Precipitating clergyman and executioner to the ground

3592
03:06:35,647 --> 03:06:38,207
There was no time to hood the two prisoners

3593
03:06:38,463 --> 03:06:39,231
So they quote

3594
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:44,863
Sworn off with their distorted features exposed to the view of the distressed spectators

3595
03:06:45,375 --> 03:06:46,143
And quote

3596
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:47,935
An arsonist

3597
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:48,959
Charles White

3598
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:51,775
Struggled incessantly to escape his bond

3599
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:53,823
He kicked at the Executioner

3600
03:06:54,079 --> 03:06:56,127
And the ordinary meaning the religious faith

3601
03:06:56,895 --> 03:06:58,943
I just lodging the cap hiding his face

3602
03:06:59,455 --> 03:07:01,247
The crowd yelled in excitement

3603
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:04,319
Partly suspended destruggle still

3604
03:07:04,575 --> 03:07:06,367
Reaching the platform with his feet

3605
03:07:06,623 --> 03:07:08,671
Frida's hands and held onto the Rope

3606
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:11,743
The Executioner had to force him from the platform

3607
03:07:11,999 --> 03:07:13,023
And pulling his leg

3608
03:07:13,535 --> 03:07:14,303
Does he choke

3609
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:16,863
The crowd saw his distended tongue

3610
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:19,679
And I'm covered in distorted features and they shriek

3611
03:07:20,447 --> 03:07:21,215
And quote

3612
03:07:22,751 --> 03:07:25,823
So even though there are accounts of hangings that make it sound

3613
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:27,615
Like The Condemned

3614
03:07:27,871 --> 03:07:30,431
Seem to die almost instantly

3615
03:07:30,943 --> 03:07:34,015
And those definitely are throughout the historical record

3616
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:37,599
Obviously they have these other kinds of incidents as well

3617
03:07:40,927 --> 03:07:42,207
Then there's stuff like burn

3618
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:45,023
Which once again conjures up

3619
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:47,071
The worst of the worst

3620
03:07:47,327 --> 03:07:48,095
Terrorist groups

3621
03:07:48,351 --> 03:07:49,119
Today in the

3622
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:57,055
Deliberately medieval again as an adjective but also denoting a time. From long time ago work

3623
03:07:57,311 --> 03:07:59,103
You used to do this kind of Mosaic law stuff

3624
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:01,407
Conjures up the worst of those kinds of groups

3625
03:08:01,663 --> 03:08:04,479
It's right when you talk about burning people to death but

3626
03:08:04,991 --> 03:08:08,319
They were still doing this up until the early 1800s

3627
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:09,599
Again

3628
03:08:10,111 --> 03:08:13,183
After George Washington has died of old age

3629
03:08:14,463 --> 03:08:16,511
Women got it a lot more than men

3630
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:19,327
And it was often viewed as an alternative so

3631
03:08:19,583 --> 03:08:22,399
Whereas we started to get much more enlightened

3632
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:28,799
Breaking women on the wheel you wouldn't want to do that to a woman if you spare them the breaking on the wheel you burn them things like that

3633
03:08:31,103 --> 03:08:32,895
We mentioned earlier the

3634
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:35,455
People who were burned on witchcraft charges

3635
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:37,759
And United States that we usually hang but in Europe

3636
03:08:38,271 --> 03:08:39,295
Lots of burning

3637
03:08:39,551 --> 03:08:42,111
Some estimates as high as a hundred thousand people

3638
03:08:42,367 --> 03:08:45,951
Burned for witchcraft crimes in Germany alone

3639
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:46,719
During this

3640
03:08:46,975 --> 03:08:47,999
Broad.

3641
03:08:49,023 --> 03:08:51,071
It wasn't just women although usually was

3642
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:53,631
We can be all high and mighty about

3643
03:08:54,143 --> 03:08:58,239
You're not understanding our forebears for why they did that because we have the unique advantage of

3644
03:08:58,751 --> 03:08:59,263
Well

3645
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:00,031
Most of us

3646
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:06,431
Not believing in sorcery and Witchcraft and not thinking it's a problem in our community and not believing that they live amongst us

3647
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:10,527
And not believing that the only thing that really fixes the problem is burning them to death

3648
03:09:12,319 --> 03:09:13,087
Checkr

3649
03:09:13,599 --> 03:09:15,903
Buy us right at the door on that one

3650
03:09:17,439 --> 03:09:23,583
If we were talking about something like terrorism that we did believe in and it was a hundred percent agreement that the only way you stopped that was through burning Terror

3651
03:09:23,839 --> 03:09:26,399
Or maybe even suspected terrorist to death

3652
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:27,679
I imagine we have a future

3653
03:09:27,935 --> 03:09:28,447
Proponent to that

3654
03:09:28,703 --> 03:09:29,471
Even now

3655
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:31,519
Nonetheless what was it like

3656
03:09:32,031 --> 03:09:34,079
To go through that burning experience

3657
03:09:35,359 --> 03:09:36,895
Well that depends also

3658
03:09:37,151 --> 03:09:39,711
And there's a lot of famous ones you know Joan of Arc comes to mind

3659
03:09:39,967 --> 03:09:40,479
Right

3660
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:43,551
I read some accounts that talked about

3661
03:09:44,063 --> 03:09:46,367
The likelihood that the smoke it

3662
03:09:46,623 --> 03:09:48,671
Stealth would render a person unconscious

3663
03:09:50,207 --> 03:09:55,583
During the later. When they're still doing this into the 17 hundreds in Britain for example

3664
03:09:55,839 --> 03:10:01,983
They're doing the same version of secret strangling that they're doing in places like pressure but they're doing it

3665
03:10:02,239 --> 03:10:04,799
Openly like in one of the particularly horrific

3666
03:10:05,311 --> 03:10:07,103
More recent burnings

3667
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:10,175
They were executing a woman for killing her

3668
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:12,479
They call that petty treason by the

3669
03:10:12,991 --> 03:10:15,807
Major treason was like crimes against the state

3670
03:10:16,063 --> 03:10:17,855
Petty treason was a wife killing her husband

3671
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:19,647
Nonetheless they had the

3672
03:10:19,903 --> 03:10:21,695
Strangulation thing rigged

3673
03:10:22,207 --> 03:10:23,743
If the wood cuttings I've seen are

3674
03:10:23,999 --> 03:10:24,511
Correct

3675
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:26,047
Sort of on a chain

3676
03:10:26,303 --> 03:10:31,935
And it was around her neck on the steak and then somebody would hold this change well 15 feet away

3677
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:35,775
Away from the faggots of wood that were burning

3678
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:38,847
And strangled them just before the Flames reach them

3679
03:10:39,103 --> 03:10:41,663
But this time we were told that the chain got too hot

3680
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,967
And the guy whose job it was to strangle the

3681
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:48,063
The woman so she didn't have to suffer burning in the enlightenment.

3682
03:10:48,319 --> 03:10:49,343
In a word course you wouldn't

3683
03:10:49,599 --> 03:10:50,879
The burning will you didn't strangle

3684
03:10:52,415 --> 03:10:53,951
I had to let go with the chain

3685
03:10:54,207 --> 03:10:56,767
And everything got very old-fashioned very quickly

3686
03:10:58,303 --> 03:11:00,863
The woman's name by the way was Catherine Hayes

3687
03:11:01,119 --> 03:11:02,143
Who is burned alive

3688
03:11:02,655 --> 03:11:07,519
In London in 1726 this account comes from public executions the Nigel

3689
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:08,543
Hawthorne book

3690
03:11:09,055 --> 03:11:10,079
And he takes an account

3691
03:11:10,591 --> 03:11:15,967
Sounds like a near primary source but maybe not from the Newgate calendar sound like a newspaper

3692
03:11:16,223 --> 03:11:17,503
And it says quote

3693
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:20,063
He's received the sacrament

3694
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:23,903
How much drag on a sledge to the place appointed for her execution

3695
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:26,719
When The Wretched woman had finished her devotions

3696
03:11:26,975 --> 03:11:28,511
In pursuance of her sentence

3697
03:11:28,767 --> 03:11:30,815
An iron chain with put around your waist

3698
03:11:31,071 --> 03:11:32,863
With which she was attached to the stake

3699
03:11:33,887 --> 03:11:39,263
When women were burned for petty treason it was usual to strangle them by means of a rope

3700
03:11:39,519 --> 03:11:42,335
Passed around the neck and pulled by the Executioner

3701
03:11:42,591 --> 03:11:45,407
So that they were willfully insensible to the heat of the flame

3702
03:11:45,919 --> 03:11:47,711
But this woman literally burned alive

3703
03:11:48,223 --> 03:11:53,599
The Executioner let go of the Rope too soon and consequence of having his hand burnt by the flame

3704
03:11:54,623 --> 03:11:56,671
The Flames burn fiercely around her

3705
03:11:56,927 --> 03:11:59,231
And The Spectator beheld Catherine Hayes

3706
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:03,583
Pushing away the fagets while she rent the air with cries and Lamentations

3707
03:12:04,095 --> 03:12:09,983
Other faggets were instantly piled on her but she survived amidst the Flames for a considerable time

3708
03:12:10,239 --> 03:12:14,079
And her body was not perfectly reduced to ashes until 3 hours later

3709
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,359
And quote

3710
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:18,431
So you have this image of a person

3711
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:21,247
Struggling to kick away the burning

3712
03:12:21,759 --> 03:12:25,087
In a f****** of wood around her and they just keep piling moron

3713
03:12:25,343 --> 03:12:27,903
She doesn't sound like she's dying from smoke inhalation to me

3714
03:12:31,487 --> 03:12:34,559
And one of the things by the way that you will read about a little color here

3715
03:12:35,071 --> 03:12:38,399
In these later burnings the Executioner will sometimes hang on

3716
03:12:38,911 --> 03:12:40,959
Hello bagra pouch around the neck

3717
03:12:41,471 --> 03:12:42,495
Of the person

3718
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:44,031
Manacled to the stake

3719
03:12:44,799 --> 03:12:46,335
And that pouch contains gunpowder

3720
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:48,383
And I hope it is

3721
03:12:48,895 --> 03:12:53,759
That when things get hot enough that will explode putting you out of your misery so you don't have to be burned to death

3722
03:12:54,271 --> 03:12:56,063
And is the. Goes on your Reed

3723
03:12:56,319 --> 03:12:57,599
More more counts of

3724
03:12:57,855 --> 03:13:03,999
Like when noblemen have to be killed in a rarely but when noblemen have to be killed like that dildo be having whole bladder

3725
03:13:04,255 --> 03:13:06,047
Is filled with this gunpowder hoping for the best

3726
03:13:08,607 --> 03:13:14,751
And while that does by the way look a little like the secret strangling thing which enlightened ruler is trying to limit the suffering of The Condemned

3727
03:13:15,007 --> 03:13:16,543
There's also a practical

3728
03:13:17,311 --> 03:13:19,103
Way to look at this I mean this is insurance

3729
03:13:19,359 --> 03:13:20,127
Isn't it

3730
03:13:20,383 --> 03:13:24,991
So that you won't have another one of these incidents that gives the state of black I like some woman

3731
03:13:25,247 --> 03:13:31,391
Manacle to a post screaming to the crowd and kicking away the wood as fast as you can pile it back on that doesn't look good for

3732
03:13:32,159 --> 03:13:35,487
Little pouch in gunpowder around the neck might save us all a lot of trouble neck

3733
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:36,255
Next time

3734
03:13:38,047 --> 03:13:40,607
And one thing I don't think we have pointed out that's worth mentioning

3735
03:13:41,375 --> 03:13:44,703
Is that a lot of these people being executed are bad people

3736
03:13:45,215 --> 03:13:46,495
Who committed bad crime

3737
03:13:47,007 --> 03:13:47,775
Write things we would

3738
03:13:48,287 --> 03:13:52,639
Treat severely today murder rape robbery all those kinds of things

3739
03:13:53,919 --> 03:14:00,063
So let's not make Angels out of these people that don't deserve it although I doubt no matter how bad you are we want you burned alive

3740
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:00,831
5

3741
03:14:04,927 --> 03:14:06,463
That having been said let's remember

3742
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:10,559
That in a lot of these places England for example we mentioned already

3743
03:14:10,815 --> 03:14:13,887
They are executing people for crimes that no modern stay whenever exit

3744
03:14:14,143 --> 03:14:14,911
Do people for

3745
03:14:15,935 --> 03:14:16,447
And

3746
03:14:17,215 --> 03:14:19,263
Even with all of our modern techniques

3747
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:23,103
Justice system and everything we have going for us now we still make mistakes

3748
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:24,383
And convictions right

3749
03:14:24,895 --> 03:14:27,455
What was the failure rate like you can only imagine

3750
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:31,295
In this time. Cuz right before this time. When they're doing like

3751
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:33,599
You know trial by ordeal

3752
03:14:34,111 --> 03:14:35,647
I'm going to throw you in the river in a few hours

3753
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:40,767
Think you're innocent if you float you're guilty I mean in the world a little ways out of that. So

3754
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:43,839
Imagine a bunch of these people being executed or bad people

3755
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:45,375
Imagine a bunch of a mark

3756
03:14:47,935 --> 03:14:52,543
And if we're going to walk a mile in their moccasins and try to wonder how they must have felt don't you think

3757
03:14:53,055 --> 03:14:53,823
Afraid

3758
03:14:54,335 --> 03:14:56,127
Has to be like the most dominant

3759
03:14:56,383 --> 03:15:00,223
Emotion that's just overwhelming them psychologically breaking them

3760
03:15:03,039 --> 03:15:04,575
There were these Rogues and

3761
03:15:05,087 --> 03:15:06,623
People who went to their deaths almost

3762
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:08,671
Carefree there were some others who went

3763
03:15:09,183 --> 03:15:13,279
With an almost hinge of Madness or perhaps neither one of those people

3764
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:15,071
Has affected by fear as

3765
03:15:16,095 --> 03:15:16,607
The average

3766
03:15:16,863 --> 03:15:17,887
Joe or Jane

3767
03:15:18,911 --> 03:15:19,679
Back

3768
03:15:19,935 --> 03:15:20,703
Trailpoint out

3769
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:21,983
That

3770
03:15:22,239 --> 03:15:23,007
And almost

3771
03:15:23,775 --> 03:15:27,103
Stupefying level of fear affected most people

3772
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:28,127
He writes

3773
03:15:28,383 --> 03:15:28,895
Quote

3774
03:15:29,407 --> 03:15:31,711
Most people would Mount the scaffold

3775
03:15:31,967 --> 03:15:33,247
Now quoting primary source

3776
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:34,527
Quote

3777
03:15:35,039 --> 03:15:37,599
Trembling in a very extraordinary manner

3778
03:15:37,855 --> 03:15:40,415
Their whole frame violently convulse

3779
03:15:40,927 --> 03:15:43,999
Their minds bordering on stupid vacation

3780
03:15:44,255 --> 03:15:46,047
Having to be supported by officials

3781
03:15:46,815 --> 03:15:47,327
He continued

3782
03:15:48,095 --> 03:15:54,239
Elizabeth Godfrey hang for murder in 1807 went to the scaffold in a state of frenzy

3783
03:15:55,007 --> 03:16:00,127
Green Acre in 1837 refused the attentions of the ordinary of Newgate bravely enough

3784
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:02,175
What is the scaffold he was quote

3785
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:03,711
Totally unmanned

3786
03:16:03,967 --> 03:16:05,759
All his fortitude had left him

3787
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:07,295
He was unable to speak

3788
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:10,623
And the officer was applied to support him or he would have fallen

3789
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:11,391
End quote

3790
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:15,231
He mentioned several other examples and then continues quote

3791
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:21,631
An 18 year old girl had to be dragged to the scaffold at Bristol by half-a-dozen men in 18-49

3792
03:16:22,143 --> 03:16:24,959
The clergyman vainly asking her to walk quietly

3793
03:16:25,471 --> 03:16:26,751
My 1868

3794
03:16:27,007 --> 03:16:27,519
He writes

3795
03:16:27,775 --> 03:16:29,823
The images were seared in memory

3796
03:16:30,335 --> 03:16:30,847
Quote

3797
03:16:31,103 --> 03:16:32,639
Have fainting riches

3798
03:16:32,895 --> 03:16:38,527
Sometimes supported between warders and chaplain sometimes struggling fiercely with the Executioner

3799
03:16:38,783 --> 03:16:41,087
To plunge and shriek and kit

3800
03:16:41,343 --> 03:16:43,391
Until the lumbering dropped Falls

3801
03:16:43,903 --> 03:16:48,767
Sometimes sinking into pitiable syncope to be hanged sprawling over a chair

3802
03:16:49,791 --> 03:16:50,303
And quote

3803
03:16:52,095 --> 03:16:53,375
Cottrell says that for many

3804
03:16:53,887 --> 03:16:57,215
The fear they felt inside with betrayed by their bodies

3805
03:16:58,751 --> 03:17:04,639
Losing control of their bladder or bowels he says even Marie Antoinette had to squat on the cobblestones

3806
03:17:05,663 --> 03:17:11,807
Sr bowels gave away when she saw the cart that was going to transport her to the waiting guillotine

3807
03:17:14,879 --> 03:17:18,719
And it's not really the time or the place but there have been long debates about

3808
03:17:18,975 --> 03:17:22,303
Whether or not the culture the people in the past lived in

3809
03:17:22,559 --> 03:17:26,399
Made their fear less than ours would be today or even made there

3810
03:17:26,911 --> 03:17:30,751
Sensitivity to physical pain less than we would feel today

3811
03:17:31,263 --> 03:17:32,799
Without going too deeply into it

3812
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:35,615
Most of the more modern things that I've been reading

3813
03:17:35,871 --> 03:17:36,383
Went

3814
03:17:36,639 --> 03:17:37,919
Out of their way

3815
03:17:38,175 --> 03:17:42,783
To contradict those earlier ideas but as I said another topic for another time

3816
03:17:43,039 --> 03:17:45,599
Let's just point out that when these women for example

3817
03:17:45,855 --> 03:17:48,671
In England went to the stake to be burned to death

3818
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:53,279
The fire probably felt as hot as it would be for you or for me

3819
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:58,911
Of course there's no way to prove it and with different person to person but I imagine that

3820
03:17:59,423 --> 03:18:00,959
In these times of of

3821
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:05,567
Paralyzing fear those with extra strong religious believes might have had

3822
03:18:05,823 --> 03:18:07,359
A higher level of comfort

3823
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:09,407
The most heartbreaking

3824
03:18:09,919 --> 03:18:11,967
Primary source accounts I ran into

3825
03:18:12,223 --> 03:18:13,503
Have to do with a

3826
03:18:13,759 --> 03:18:19,135
German arsonist woman who was I assume burned because during this period they often burned arsonists

3827
03:18:19,647 --> 03:18:22,719
But she was burned I think it's a steak but

3828
03:18:22,975 --> 03:18:23,743
The source

3829
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:29,119
Chronicler whose writing this for religious purposes so understand that going into it

3830
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:30,911
Point out that as she is

3831
03:18:31,423 --> 03:18:31,935
Being

3832
03:18:32,191 --> 03:18:33,215
Executed

3833
03:18:33,727 --> 03:18:39,359
She is calling out to Jesus basically saying don't go anywhere I'll be there in a minute I'm coming I'm on my way

3834
03:18:39,615 --> 03:18:40,639
I mean here's what

3835
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:41,663
Historian Richard

3836
03:18:41,919 --> 03:18:43,711
Evans chronicling this in

3837
03:18:43,967 --> 03:18:46,015
Rituals of reprobation Rights he says quote

3838
03:18:47,039 --> 03:18:53,183
The last words of Anna to blur an arsonist executed in Spiller in Silesia on 6th November

3839
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:55,743
Number 1744 we're very similar

3840
03:18:55,999 --> 03:18:56,767
To someone else

3841
03:18:57,535 --> 03:18:58,047
Quote

3842
03:18:58,303 --> 03:19:00,095
Lord Jesus she cried

3843
03:19:00,351 --> 03:19:03,167
I'm here Lord Jesus I'm coming now

3844
03:19:03,423 --> 03:19:05,727
Lord Jesus take my soul up to heaven

3845
03:19:06,239 --> 03:19:07,007
And quote

3846
03:19:08,543 --> 03:19:10,079
You can hear can't you

3847
03:19:10,591 --> 03:19:11,103
The

3848
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:12,639
Desperation

3849
03:19:13,407 --> 03:19:16,479
Right make sure you hear me I'm coming right now

3850
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:18,271
Found myself

3851
03:19:19,039 --> 03:19:20,063
And greatly moved by

3852
03:19:22,111 --> 03:19:24,671
And I can only imagine that those

3853
03:19:25,183 --> 03:19:29,279
Of lesser faith that found themselves in the same position might have been just a little bit jealous

3854
03:19:32,607 --> 03:19:33,375
Karl Marx

3855
03:19:33,887 --> 03:19:34,655
Famous quote

3856
03:19:35,423 --> 03:19:37,983
About religion being the Opium of the masses

3857
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:43,103
Well if you're about to be burned at the stake don't you think a little opium

3858
03:19:43,615 --> 03:19:46,175
Or a lot of opium is just what the doctor ordered

3859
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,479
In fact

3860
03:19:49,247 --> 03:19:52,831
If it's me we're probably medicating from the time

3861
03:19:53,087 --> 03:19:53,855
The most

3862
03:19:54,111 --> 03:19:59,487
Insane moment in the whole Affair happens again as a modern person we would think that moment is

3863
03:19:59,743 --> 03:20:03,583
The moment when the Flames are lit right in front of you is your change of the steak

3864
03:20:04,607 --> 03:20:05,887
Are the people in this era

3865
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:08,191
If I'm reading the sources correctly

3866
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:12,287
The insane moment one that would be on their life stop 5

3867
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:15,359
You know most impactful moments in my life if they were

3868
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:21,503
Catalog in something like that at the very end you'd have to say that you know somewhere on the top 5 list is that moment

3869
03:20:22,015 --> 03:20:24,063
The Executioner actually touched me

3870
03:20:25,855 --> 03:20:27,647
Because the touch of the Executioner

3871
03:20:28,159 --> 03:20:28,927
Is an inch

3872
03:20:29,183 --> 03:20:34,303
Saying saying you have to talk about the Executioner to set up a little bit about how someone back then

3873
03:20:34,815 --> 03:20:35,583
Might have felt about

3874
03:20:37,375 --> 03:20:42,239
We've been looking at this from the point of view for a little while now the person doomed to die in this X

3875
03:20:42,495 --> 03:20:43,263
Situation really when you think

3876
03:20:44,287 --> 03:20:45,567
The star of the show

3877
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:49,151
There's another star of the show maybe call them the supporting a

3878
03:20:49,407 --> 03:20:49,919
Actor

3879
03:20:51,199 --> 03:20:52,223
And their role in this

3880
03:20:52,735 --> 03:20:54,271
If we're looking at the question of you

3881
03:20:54,527 --> 03:20:56,319
Streams of The Human Experience is

3882
03:20:56,575 --> 03:21:01,183
Just as Extreme as the person who's dying up there for the entertainment of the crowd

3883
03:21:02,463 --> 03:21:05,023
It's his job to kill them for the entertainment of the crowd

3884
03:21:05,535 --> 03:21:09,119
And whereas The Condemned only have to go through this situation once

3885
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:11,423
And then he's out of their misery

3886
03:21:12,191 --> 03:21:12,959
The person

3887
03:21:13,471 --> 03:21:18,335
On the other end of the story the best supporting actor if he does a good job in this Tale

3888
03:21:18,847 --> 03:21:24,479
Have to do it over and over again it's the way he makes a living if the way he feeds his family

3889
03:21:24,991 --> 03:21:26,527
And they have to think about it at night

3890
03:21:27,039 --> 03:21:29,599
Then you have to clean his equipment the next day I mean

3891
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:33,439
This is a psychological challenge that in modern times

3892
03:21:33,951 --> 03:21:37,535
Terrible regimes have had a hard time dealing with a mean

3893
03:21:37,791 --> 03:21:39,583
There are stories you can read about

3894
03:21:40,095 --> 03:21:44,959
The German government during the Nazi years trying to figure out how you get around the problem of

3895
03:21:45,215 --> 03:21:49,823
The people that you get to shoot all these Jews that you lying a pit with

3896
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:51,359
Army psychological problem

3897
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:54,431
There's only so much liquor you can ply someone with

3898
03:21:55,711 --> 03:21:56,735
And yet they managed

3899
03:21:57,759 --> 03:22:00,063
These Executioner's back in Europe during the day

3900
03:22:01,343 --> 03:22:04,415
And it's more difficult to do that maybe even

3901
03:22:04,927 --> 03:22:06,463
Then a modern person might think

3902
03:22:06,975 --> 03:22:09,791
Because the tendency is to think something like well

3903
03:22:10,303 --> 03:22:13,887
You wouldn't have gone into that trade if there wasn't something you liked about it

3904
03:22:14,399 --> 03:22:15,935
Either you like the job

3905
03:22:16,191 --> 03:22:19,007
Will you like the pay in the benefits and you don't mind the job

3906
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:24,383
We can think of any number of reasons why a person might choose or not choose to go into such a trade

3907
03:22:25,151 --> 03:22:28,735
The modern bias at work there though when I start to think like that

3908
03:22:29,247 --> 03:22:33,855
Is I forget that in many periods in human history people have no choice in this kind of thing

3909
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:38,207
When I was growing up it was one of the things you would say about these unfree governments

3910
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:44,095
In many parts of the world they're going to tell you what you do for a living in Americans and Western European wheat all shut it right

3911
03:22:44,863 --> 03:22:46,655
Make a basic human Freedom doesn't it

3912
03:22:47,423 --> 03:22:49,983
But in this era as in many other areas in places

3913
03:22:50,495 --> 03:22:51,263
The class

3914
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:54,079
System is not very Mobile in fact

3915
03:22:54,591 --> 03:22:56,895
What we call class in a lot of these eras

3916
03:22:57,151 --> 03:22:59,199
Would be better called casts

3917
03:23:00,223 --> 03:23:06,367
And there is no Mobility between them and you can be born into a place in society where you have limited or no

3918
03:23:06,623 --> 03:23:07,903
Choices for example

3919
03:23:08,415 --> 03:23:09,695
Was your dad

3920
03:23:10,207 --> 03:23:11,487
Is an executioner

3921
03:23:12,767 --> 03:23:15,327
Guess what you're doing for a living in all probability

3922
03:23:16,607 --> 03:23:20,703
You're going to be executing people too and if you turn out to be one of those people of us

3923
03:23:21,727 --> 03:23:22,495
Artistic

3924
03:23:22,751 --> 03:23:24,543
Sensitive disposition

3925
03:23:24,799 --> 03:23:27,615
Really not the killer kind of person

3926
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:29,663
Do you want to feed your family

3927
03:23:30,175 --> 03:23:34,271
You're going to learn the trade and figure out a way to make it work for you

3928
03:23:34,783 --> 03:23:38,367
Because the society in these areas wasn't going to let you do

3929
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:41,695
Much more than that see here's the thing right away

3930
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:47,071
That confronts our mental image are stereotypical image of the Executioner in this.

3931
03:23:47,327 --> 03:23:49,631
The hooded executioner and whatnot

3932
03:23:50,399 --> 03:23:56,543
That's more by the way something that happened in England than the continent but the reason wasn't because the Executioner

3933
03:23:56,799 --> 03:24:00,639
I wanted everyone to see their face and to be proud of the situation necessarily

3934
03:24:01,151 --> 03:24:03,967
Some of them may have chosen to obscure their features

3935
03:24:04,479 --> 03:24:09,087
But everybody else who lived in the town where the execution was happening

3936
03:24:09,599 --> 03:24:11,135
They damn well wanted to know

3937
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:13,439
Where the Executioner was

3938
03:24:13,695 --> 03:24:15,743
And they wanted him to stand out of the crowd

3939
03:24:16,255 --> 03:24:22,143
Because they didn't want to accidentally come in contact with him in any way shape or form because he was

3940
03:24:22,655 --> 03:24:24,447
As Paul Friedland rights

3941
03:24:24,959 --> 03:24:26,495
An extraordinary being

3942
03:24:27,263 --> 03:24:28,799
Both extraordinary

3943
03:24:29,055 --> 03:24:31,871
Blessed in some ways with special powers

3944
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:35,711
But also undeniably cursed with a lot of others

3945
03:24:35,967 --> 03:24:38,783
Including the ability to turn you from a

3946
03:24:39,039 --> 03:24:40,319
Honorable person

3947
03:24:40,575 --> 03:24:44,415
Into a dishonorable person in your heavily class base

3948
03:24:44,927 --> 03:24:46,207
Nae cast

3949
03:24:46,463 --> 03:24:47,487
Based almost

3950
03:24:47,743 --> 03:24:48,767
Society

3951
03:24:49,791 --> 03:24:51,071
Simply by touching you

3952
03:24:53,119 --> 03:24:55,679
And by the way this touching doesn't just mean

3953
03:24:55,935 --> 03:25:02,079
In a while they are performing their duties as executioner it means running into them even accidentally at the marketplace Avenue

3954
03:25:02,335 --> 03:25:03,103
Brush against them

3955
03:25:03,615 --> 03:25:05,151
You can be that innocuous

3956
03:25:07,199 --> 03:25:08,223
This is why

3957
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:14,623
The authorities and the citizens want the Executioner dressed at all times in clothing that clearly marks out the fact you're the

3958
03:25:14,879 --> 03:25:15,647
The Executioner

3959
03:25:15,903 --> 03:25:19,487
And some places they have to carry like special staff that are certain colors so that

3960
03:25:19,743 --> 03:25:21,279
The crowd knows wait a minute

3961
03:25:21,791 --> 03:25:25,631
There's a guy who kills and tortures for money and if I touch him even accidentally I'm just honored

3962
03:25:27,423 --> 03:25:31,007
I imagine that you in the most crowded Marketplace there must have been a nice

3963
03:25:31,519 --> 03:25:33,311
Buffer zone of no people

3964
03:25:33,823 --> 03:25:36,127
Around this guy and his close family members

3965
03:25:38,175 --> 03:25:42,271
And I have to confess the more I read about The Executioner's of this era

3966
03:25:42,527 --> 03:25:44,831
It's it's probably fair to call them the X

3967
03:25:45,087 --> 03:25:45,599
The cutioner

3968
03:25:45,855 --> 03:25:46,367
Laugh

3969
03:25:46,623 --> 03:25:48,671
Of Central and Western Europe in this era

3970
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:50,975
The more fascinated I am by them

3971
03:25:52,255 --> 03:25:53,279
That's not very much

3972
03:25:53,535 --> 03:25:54,047
On them

3973
03:25:54,559 --> 03:25:55,583
Surprising is that mites

3974
03:25:56,607 --> 03:26:00,447
To 21st century audiences and it's remark upon by some of the historians

3975
03:26:01,983 --> 03:26:03,007
Who say that the

3976
03:26:03,263 --> 03:26:08,127
Role of the Executioner was sort of downplay they were seen as more of a cog in the machine

3977
03:26:08,895 --> 03:26:09,919
As opposed to

3978
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:15,807
How do you appear more now in the histories which could be compared to say a ringmaster at a circus a deadly

3979
03:26:18,111 --> 03:26:19,135
What's the person who's

3980
03:26:20,159 --> 03:26:21,183
Orchestrating

3981
03:26:21,695 --> 03:26:23,231
Conducting the entire Spectrum

3982
03:26:23,999 --> 03:26:24,767
If it works

3983
03:26:25,023 --> 03:26:31,167
This is the person who in a place like Germany will go up to the magistrate's afterwards and hold the sword up and said my Lord you know did I do well

3984
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:32,703
You wait for his

3985
03:26:33,215 --> 03:26:37,055
You did exactly what you were supposed to do kind of response that's all formalized in

3986
03:26:37,311 --> 03:26:37,823
And everything

3987
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:40,383
But if that guy screws up

3988
03:26:40,895 --> 03:26:43,711
Will Justice get the black guy whose fault is that right

3989
03:26:44,479 --> 03:26:47,039
And before we go any farther let's understand

3990
03:26:47,551 --> 03:26:50,879
That the ramifications for screwing up an execution

3991
03:26:51,135 --> 03:26:53,183
Could be a lot worse than losing your job

3992
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:54,463
People throw stones

3993
03:26:54,719 --> 03:26:57,791
When things like that happens and executioners have been killed

3994
03:26:59,071 --> 03:27:00,095
Interesting me enough

3995
03:27:00,351 --> 03:27:01,631
One of the historians point out

3996
03:27:02,143 --> 03:27:03,423
That I read that they

3997
03:27:03,679 --> 03:27:05,983
Refrain from touching them though anyway

3998
03:27:06,239 --> 03:27:10,591
Why we're still not going to touch him even if we want to kill him or throw things at him cuz if we touch him

3999
03:27:10,847 --> 03:27:14,687
Then we get this out of right like leprosy another problem in the.

4000
03:27:15,199 --> 03:27:15,967
And it could spread

4001
03:27:16,479 --> 03:27:17,759
You don't even want to be near

4002
03:27:18,527 --> 03:27:21,599
You know somebody who could get you sick and well this is a different kind of sick

4003
03:27:22,111 --> 03:27:22,623
It's the

4004
03:27:22,879 --> 03:27:24,159
In early modern

4005
03:27:24,415 --> 03:27:26,975
Sickness known as dishonor and if you don't already have it

4006
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:28,255
You don't want to get it

4007
03:27:30,559 --> 03:27:34,399
The idea of them as extraordinary beings is fascinating to me

4008
03:27:34,911 --> 03:27:37,727
And yet when I read the historian kind of go down the list of why

4009
03:27:37,983 --> 03:27:39,263
Do they might be called

4010
03:27:39,519 --> 03:27:44,383
Different kinds of beans to teacher singing and even on a genetic level because what ends up happening is this infamy

4011
03:27:44,895 --> 03:27:46,431
But these people have

4012
03:27:46,687 --> 03:27:47,711
Make them

4013
03:27:47,967 --> 03:27:49,759
Unmarriable for example

4014
03:27:50,783 --> 03:27:56,927
So the people that they end up marrying or often women who are from families of executioners also

4015
03:27:57,439 --> 03:28:03,071
So they sort of double down the stories they on their weirdness because they don't get to live with other people either

4016
03:28:03,327 --> 03:28:05,631
They're marrying into their own kind of

4017
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:09,727
Class if you willing into distant relatives and mixing these families

4018
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:13,311
And then over Generations you get these great executioner families

4019
03:28:14,847 --> 03:28:17,663
But they're a little strange because they're a bunch of people

4020
03:28:17,919 --> 03:28:22,271
Live in this world of executioners on both sides down many generations

4021
03:28:22,783 --> 03:28:24,831
And they don't get to mingle with anyone else

4022
03:28:27,903 --> 03:28:29,695
Historian Richard Benjamin

4023
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:30,463
Points out

4024
03:28:30,719 --> 03:28:31,231
Quote

4025
03:28:32,255 --> 03:28:37,631
Because of his dishonorable occupation the Executioner lived outside the community

4026
03:28:37,887 --> 03:28:40,703
Which only served to heighten his Sinister image

4027
03:28:41,215 --> 03:28:43,263
He could only marry within his own Circle

4028
03:28:43,519 --> 03:28:45,823
So that a succession of execution was involved

4029
03:28:46,335 --> 03:28:50,175
The Executioner had to distinguish himself by wearing special clothes

4030
03:28:50,431 --> 03:28:54,015
Which generally different from his black or red Robes of office

4031
03:28:54,527 --> 03:28:58,367
Attempts to secure a special status by dress inconspicuously

4032
03:28:58,623 --> 03:29:02,207
Failed on account of the rigid dress regulations for the Executioner

4033
03:29:02,463 --> 03:29:05,279
You're a good wages and got uncomfortably

4034
03:29:05,535 --> 03:29:08,095
But he had to live outside respectable Society

4035
03:29:08,607 --> 03:29:14,495
Sit alone in a separate place in church and was required to eat and drink on his own at the end

4036
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:16,031
And quote

4037
03:29:18,335 --> 03:29:20,383
And it's affected everyone in this family too

4038
03:29:20,895 --> 03:29:21,663
Condolences quote

4039
03:29:22,687 --> 03:29:26,783
The social implications of Dishonor we're suffered not only by the Executioner

4040
03:29:27,039 --> 03:29:28,831
At least had an occupation

4041
03:29:29,087 --> 03:29:30,367
But also by his children

4042
03:29:30,879 --> 03:29:33,183
Who were forbidden to learn and honorable crafts

4043
03:29:33,951 --> 03:29:37,023
Town Craftsman in particular ostracized the Executioner

4044
03:29:37,535 --> 03:29:38,047
And quote

4045
03:29:40,607 --> 03:29:43,423
The Paul Friedland really blew my mind when he talked about how this

4046
03:29:43,679 --> 03:29:44,959
Dishonorable

4047
03:29:45,471 --> 03:29:46,239
Taint

4048
03:29:46,495 --> 03:29:49,567
Turned all these people into people that could only

4049
03:29:49,823 --> 03:29:53,151
You'll hang out and intermarry with each other which overtime creates

4050
03:29:53,407 --> 03:29:56,479
Well dynasties an Executioner's related to each other

4051
03:29:56,735 --> 03:29:58,271
But also people who been

4052
03:29:58,527 --> 03:30:02,367
Intermarrying in a small circle for a long time genetically

4053
03:30:02,879 --> 03:30:04,159
Closer to each other

4054
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:06,975
Then did any of the outside population he writes quote

4055
03:30:08,511 --> 03:30:14,655
How are we to explain the rise of this closely interrelated cast of people who gradually came to occupy

4056
03:30:14,911 --> 03:30:20,287
Time most of the official posts of executioner in the cities and towns of northern France

4057
03:30:20,543 --> 03:30:23,615
The Netherlands and german-speaking Northern and Central Europe

4058
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:28,223
Perhaps the androgyny of executioners was itself the cause of the opprobrium

4059
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:34,623
As practitioners of this very problematic profession came to be quite literally a separate

4060
03:30:34,879 --> 03:30:36,159
Tribal race of people

4061
03:30:37,183 --> 03:30:43,071
Most likely being dodging me and the revulsion attached to the profession were mutually reinforcing

4062
03:30:43,327 --> 03:30:47,679
Has Executioner's became more reviled they increasingly marry their own kind

4063
03:30:47,935 --> 03:30:50,495
Intern making them seem even stranger

4064
03:30:51,007 --> 03:30:51,519
And quote

4065
03:30:54,079 --> 03:30:57,663
It's reading who says that they became an extraordinary being

4066
03:30:57,919 --> 03:30:59,199
So profane

4067
03:30:59,455 --> 03:31:05,087
At the Executioner could not come into contact with other people or objects without profoundly altering them

4068
03:31:05,855 --> 03:31:06,367
In other words

4069
03:31:07,391 --> 03:31:09,183
A something kind of magical

4070
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:11,231
And at the same time

4071
03:31:11,487 --> 03:31:12,511
An untouchable

4072
03:31:15,071 --> 03:31:17,119
The better ones also seem to be part

4073
03:31:17,887 --> 03:31:19,423
Psychologist or psychiatrist

4074
03:31:20,703 --> 03:31:22,495
Because they had to think about this

4075
03:31:22,751 --> 03:31:24,031
Instrument they had to Shepherd

4076
03:31:24,287 --> 03:31:25,311
Human beings

4077
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:26,591
From life

4078
03:31:26,847 --> 03:31:27,615
To death

4079
03:31:28,383 --> 03:31:28,895
The mostest

4080
03:31:29,151 --> 03:31:32,223
Stream emotional and stressful moment of their lies right

4081
03:31:32,479 --> 03:31:33,503
And in these

4082
03:31:33,759 --> 03:31:36,063
Executions that we're almost always these

4083
03:31:36,575 --> 03:31:39,903
Carefully stage drama these spectacles of Justice

4084
03:31:40,415 --> 03:31:41,695
You had to go a certain way

4085
03:31:42,463 --> 03:31:43,999
Route to come off without a hitch

4086
03:31:44,511 --> 03:31:47,839
The Executioner needs the cooperation of The Condemned

4087
03:31:48,863 --> 03:31:50,143
They need to work together

4088
03:31:50,655 --> 03:31:51,679
To pull this thing off

4089
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:53,727
I know that sounds weird

4090
03:31:54,239 --> 03:32:00,383
But it's in everyone's interest I mean we mentioned earlier that there's a journal and Joel Harrington's book on the faithful executioner

4091
03:32:00,639 --> 03:32:01,151
Wonderful

4092
03:32:01,407 --> 03:32:07,551
But unfortunately for we moderns the book does not address the things we want to dress The Executioner's name is French

4093
03:32:07,807 --> 03:32:08,319
Germany

4094
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:11,647
He doesn't say here's how I live with myself and all these things we wanted

4095
03:32:11,903 --> 03:32:13,695
Every time you seem to be

4096
03:32:13,951 --> 03:32:17,023
Thinking about the victim too much he switches to what they did

4097
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:18,303
And what made

4098
03:32:18,559 --> 03:32:22,399
Them end up in this position in the first place the horribleness with their crimes

4099
03:32:22,911 --> 03:32:23,679
By the way of something a lot

4100
03:32:23,935 --> 03:32:24,959
A lot of people would do today

4101
03:32:25,215 --> 03:32:26,495
Focus on the crimes not the justice

4102
03:32:28,031 --> 03:32:29,567
None the less hair even have a great

4103
03:32:30,335 --> 03:32:33,151
Color throughout the book and explains the context of all this stuff

4104
03:32:34,431 --> 03:32:36,991
He's just friend Schmidt executed 394 people

4105
03:32:37,759 --> 03:32:38,783
Over his career

4106
03:32:39,295 --> 03:32:40,319
And tortured and

4107
03:32:40,831 --> 03:32:43,903
Dished out corporal punishment the hundred more

4108
03:32:44,671 --> 03:32:45,695
Think about that for a minute

4109
03:32:47,743 --> 03:32:49,791
If a guy like that comes up to me

4110
03:32:50,559 --> 03:32:56,191
For the last drink right I mean we said earlier the one of the moments that might be the most impactful of your life is the moment.

4111
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:57,727
Executioner touches you

4112
03:32:57,983 --> 03:32:59,775
Another might be when you're in the

4113
03:33:00,287 --> 03:33:03,103
Poor Sinners parlor as it was sometimes called

4114
03:33:03,615 --> 03:33:09,759
You know saying your goodbyes and talking with the religious figures and all that stuff and then the announcement comes in as it often did in the

4115
03:33:10,015 --> 03:33:11,295
German states especially

4116
03:33:11,551 --> 03:33:13,343
The Executioner is at hand

4117
03:33:14,367 --> 03:33:18,463
And this person shows up Frenchman showed up in his best Robes of office

4118
03:33:19,487 --> 03:33:20,511
Came with a drink

4119
03:33:20,767 --> 03:33:22,815
And share the famous last drink

4120
03:33:23,071 --> 03:33:25,887
With a condemned there also in many places with a famous line

4121
03:33:26,143 --> 03:33:28,191
Neil sometimes called The Hangman's meal

4122
03:33:28,447 --> 03:33:30,495
And this is supremely weird

4123
03:33:31,007 --> 03:33:33,567
I think was Richard Evans you pointed out for a lot of these poor

4124
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:36,639
Convicted German criminals during this era

4125
03:33:37,151 --> 03:33:43,295
This lavish meal that they gave the right before they died was probably the greatest meal that they never had and

4126
03:33:43,551 --> 03:33:45,087
Far above anything that ever even seen

4127
03:33:46,111 --> 03:33:49,695
And often times the people who judge you

4128
03:33:49,951 --> 03:33:56,095
And the religious figures and even the Executioner will eat with you at this meal and you might be required to wear your own bear

4129
03:33:56,351 --> 03:33:58,911
Burial shrouds of the whole thing's not weird not at all right

4130
03:33:59,679 --> 03:34:02,239
It's part of the psychological breakdown I mean

4131
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:06,335
I mean my burial shroud and having the best meal I've ever had to meet with the guy is going to kill me

4132
03:34:08,383 --> 03:34:12,735
But if a guy with 394 kills on his record come to me

4133
03:34:12,991 --> 03:34:14,015
And says listen

4134
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:21,439
I know what I'm doing here I've done this a lot of times let me tell you how it's going to go easy as for you and easy as for me I think I'm

4135
03:34:21,695 --> 03:34:22,975
Going to listen to him after all

4136
03:34:23,231 --> 03:34:26,559
If I squirm around too much and don't do what this guy wants

4137
03:34:27,071 --> 03:34:32,703
He's going to take more than one shot at my head if this is a decapitation for example and should be pointed at

4138
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:38,591
The historian had a great lie you said listen these people are under enough pressure anyway they have a reputation not

4139
03:34:38,847 --> 03:34:39,615
Totally

4140
03:34:40,383 --> 03:34:45,503
Without reason of drinking too much what would you do again your job to kill people how you going to handle that

4141
03:34:46,783 --> 03:34:50,111
But if these guys take too many strokes to do the job

4142
03:34:50,367 --> 03:34:56,511
It might be open season on them and violence is a Richard Evans print out violence against executioners who botched

4143
03:34:56,767 --> 03:34:57,279
The job

4144
03:34:57,535 --> 03:34:59,071
What the sources are abundant

4145
03:34:59,583 --> 03:35:04,959
But that'll make him even more nervous right so you really want this condemned to sit still work with you

4146
03:35:05,215 --> 03:35:08,031
And you'll all get out of here as easy as possible Right

4147
03:35:08,287 --> 03:35:10,847
I'm going to listen to the experts in this case if he explains to me

4148
03:35:11,103 --> 03:35:13,407
The best way to hold my head to make this go fast

4149
03:35:15,199 --> 03:35:19,807
I'm going to be broken on the wheel or broken with the wheel the directions might be a little bit more complex

4150
03:35:22,367 --> 03:35:28,511
Just to throw this in there cuz I think it's also interesting another reason these people are so dishonorable as they often had a lot of side gigs

4151
03:35:28,767 --> 03:35:31,583
Is in the community that we're also sort of untouchability things

4152
03:35:31,839 --> 03:35:33,631
Like cleaning the latrines and

4153
03:35:34,399 --> 03:35:38,751
Picking up dead animals and all the stuff people don't want to do right the unclean kind of stuff

4154
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:42,335
But it's kind of interesting because they could often make a really good living

4155
03:35:43,103 --> 03:35:45,407
Almost to the point where they're rich

4156
03:35:45,663 --> 03:35:51,039
And one source pointed out how interesting it was good we modern people think that money is the great equalizer

4157
03:35:51,295 --> 03:35:57,439
And his point was not at all in the earlier you can be as rich as Midas but if you're at a certain level of society I mean if your reach is mine

4158
03:35:57,695 --> 03:35:58,975
Trains

4159
03:35:59,231 --> 03:36:00,255
Nobody cares

4160
03:36:00,767 --> 03:36:05,375
When did real well with all their side games and they were knackers and all these other things but

4161
03:36:05,887 --> 03:36:07,679
Nobody wanted to eat with him anyway

4162
03:36:09,727 --> 03:36:14,335
Another weird thing about him is it at the same time they are these dishonorable beans that you don't want touching you

4163
03:36:14,847 --> 03:36:17,919
They also were kind of thought it was magical Healers

4164
03:36:18,943 --> 03:36:21,247
Obviously they know a little bit about Anatomy

4165
03:36:21,759 --> 03:36:22,527
They also

4166
03:36:22,783 --> 03:36:28,159
Practice torture and keeping people alive to be executed in fact they probably had pretty darn good amateur

4167
03:36:28,415 --> 03:36:31,231
Knowledge it's kind of tough to have the person do what they need to do

4168
03:36:31,487 --> 03:36:34,303
In a way that doesn't dishonor you but people went to them as Healers

4169
03:36:34,815 --> 03:36:36,863
They also had another side business and this

4170
03:36:37,119 --> 03:36:37,887
One of the weird

4171
03:36:38,143 --> 03:36:40,447
Parts of the era left over from the Middle Ages

4172
03:36:40,959 --> 03:36:43,519
They could sometimes sell a little Blood on the side

4173
03:36:44,287 --> 03:36:47,615
The blood of The Condemned was often thought to have magical properties

4174
03:36:47,871 --> 03:36:49,663
Especially for epileptics

4175
03:36:49,919 --> 03:36:52,479
And a lot of these executions people rushed

4176
03:36:52,735 --> 03:36:54,527
Scaffold to get ahold of some blood

4177
03:36:54,783 --> 03:36:55,295
And the

4178
03:36:55,551 --> 03:36:58,623
Smart are more entrepreneurial Executioner's usually had the resistance

4179
03:36:59,135 --> 03:37:04,767
Already in advance ready to go basically saying something like that they get one they get one I mean

4180
03:37:05,023 --> 03:37:07,583
Son of a Dracula sidegig someone's blood but

4181
03:37:08,095 --> 03:37:09,631
In supply and demand and all that

4182
03:37:12,191 --> 03:37:13,983
Supply and demand is not a bad way

4183
03:37:14,751 --> 03:37:15,519
To describe

4184
03:37:16,031 --> 03:37:21,407
Some of the process that led to the decline of these Master Executioner's these Master Craftsman

4185
03:37:22,175 --> 03:37:23,711
Because of the 1700s

4186
03:37:24,223 --> 03:37:24,991
No go on

4187
03:37:25,247 --> 03:37:26,783
You get to the ladder part of them

4188
03:37:27,039 --> 03:37:30,623
These executions become rarer and rarer I mean the numbers are actually public

4189
03:37:31,135 --> 03:37:32,159
Rushing record

4190
03:37:32,671 --> 03:37:34,719
What are the records in the Netherlands the records in Paris

4191
03:37:34,975 --> 03:37:38,815
And you're seeing single digits in some places it sometimes right there

4192
03:37:39,071 --> 03:37:44,959
No reason to have a full-time executioner on staff and there's no reason to have a lot of them until they start declining in number

4193
03:37:46,495 --> 03:37:48,799
Amazon probably making professional

4194
03:37:49,311 --> 03:37:52,127
You know what Champs at the side gigs to make those work full-time but

4195
03:37:52,383 --> 03:37:54,687
You wind up with fewer these people

4196
03:37:55,199 --> 03:37:56,735
And as time goes on

4197
03:37:56,991 --> 03:37:58,015
They're getting older

4198
03:37:58,271 --> 03:37:58,783
One of the

4199
03:37:59,039 --> 03:38:00,575
History's I read had a letter

4200
03:38:00,831 --> 03:38:02,879
From one of these old Executioner's

4201
03:38:03,135 --> 03:38:06,463
Trying to assure a potential employer that he still got it

4202
03:38:06,719 --> 03:38:07,231
Right

4203
03:38:07,487 --> 03:38:11,839
Essentially was said something like you know I know I'm old I know the sword is heavy but you know it's like riding a bike

4204
03:38:13,119 --> 03:38:14,399
But it's a sign

4205
03:38:14,655 --> 03:38:19,519
If you were if you were these people are even around the ones that are around are getting old and they're not exactly

4206
03:38:19,775 --> 03:38:22,847
Are they saying boxing to rest is to rust their rusting

4207
03:38:23,359 --> 03:38:25,919
It's part of the reason you seem more and more botched

4208
03:38:26,175 --> 03:38:27,711
Decapitations during this period

4209
03:38:28,223 --> 03:38:30,015
Which was a significant problem

4210
03:38:30,271 --> 03:38:31,807
And as we know being people

4211
03:38:32,063 --> 03:38:35,135
If you have a significant problem we're going to try to invent ways

4212
03:38:35,647 --> 03:38:37,951
Two eliminated and that's what the guillotine was

4213
03:38:38,719 --> 03:38:42,303
You know the blade that drops down the scaffolding and separates a person

4214
03:38:42,815 --> 03:38:45,631
From life to death in the blink of an eye literally

4215
03:38:47,423 --> 03:38:48,447
Attempt to cut out

4216
03:38:48,959 --> 03:38:52,287
The human equation believe it or not as bad as that looks to us now

4217
03:38:52,543 --> 03:38:55,103
It was a step forward in

4218
03:38:55,615 --> 03:38:57,151
So the man's progress towards

4219
03:38:57,407 --> 03:38:58,943
Becoming more humanitarian

4220
03:39:00,223 --> 03:39:06,111
It took away the infamy associated with being touched by the Executioner that would spread to your family in the old days now

4221
03:39:06,367 --> 03:39:08,927
You know this was all about a rational penal system

4222
03:39:09,183 --> 03:39:11,743
You have to die but it doesn't have to be any more painful

4223
03:39:11,999 --> 03:39:13,279
Then this there's no

4224
03:39:13,535 --> 03:39:16,351
Infamy attached to with The execution is no longer this

4225
03:39:16,607 --> 03:39:20,447
Infamous figure that scares the heck out of people he's just a guy who's a technician

4226
03:39:23,263 --> 03:39:25,823
And as much as the guillotine is associated with these

4227
03:39:26,335 --> 03:39:31,711
Bloodthirsty crowd they come to watch the execution like it's something special because we're using the guillotine

4228
03:39:32,223 --> 03:39:35,039
We should remember in context everything we've been discussing right

4229
03:39:35,551 --> 03:39:38,367
These people the guillotine was to be shortchanged

4230
03:39:39,135 --> 03:39:44,511
There's no show you can hardly see it it's over in the blink of an eye you can go watch executions of the guillotine

4231
03:39:44,767 --> 03:39:45,535
Official

4232
03:39:45,791 --> 03:39:50,655
Judicial ones there's one famous one from France I think it was like shot in the 1930s or something

4233
03:39:51,167 --> 03:39:54,751
It's in slow motion the entire thing because even then it's

4234
03:39:55,263 --> 03:39:59,615
I mean they run the prison right boom boom it happened so fast you can't believe it if you came all day

4235
03:40:00,127 --> 03:40:03,199
And tailgated in expectation of that

4236
03:40:03,711 --> 03:40:06,783
That's like you know when I used to buy pay-per-view boxing matches

4237
03:40:07,039 --> 03:40:10,623
And somebody would walk out and boom it's over with once you know

4238
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:13,183
That's a good way to feel cheated as an audience

4239
03:40:14,975 --> 03:40:16,767
At least one of the histories I was reading made

4240
03:40:17,279 --> 03:40:17,791
Sound like

4241
03:40:18,047 --> 03:40:24,191
People really would have preferred to go back to the more spectacular execution simply for entertainment value alone

4242
03:40:25,727 --> 03:40:26,239
Some people

4243
03:40:27,775 --> 03:40:28,287
Not all people

4244
03:40:30,079 --> 03:40:32,383
And this brings us back around to the third viewpoint

4245
03:40:32,639 --> 03:40:33,663
Here I wanted to examine

4246
03:40:33,919 --> 03:40:34,431
Things from

4247
03:40:35,199 --> 03:40:36,479
Did The Condemned who did the X

4248
03:40:36,735 --> 03:40:37,759
Did you sniff how about the audio

4249
03:40:38,783 --> 03:40:40,831
The audience is really been the question through

4250
03:40:41,087 --> 03:40:42,623
Throughout this entire conversation has ended

4251
03:40:42,879 --> 03:40:44,159
How the audience is reacting and

4252
03:40:44,671 --> 03:40:46,975
During this period this is when it kind of gets fascinating

4253
03:40:47,487 --> 03:40:53,631
The aspect of okay so we human beings like this stuff they've been watching it okay so we're maybe not surprised if we're real cynical

4254
03:40:53,887 --> 03:40:54,911
So why did it end

4255
03:40:55,423 --> 03:40:55,935
And how did it

4256
03:40:56,191 --> 03:40:56,703
Stop

4257
03:40:57,215 --> 03:40:59,775
Definition process is there a roadmap there

4258
03:41:00,031 --> 03:41:01,055
Or you can say Okay weave

4259
03:41:01,311 --> 03:41:04,639
We inoculated our self against that once before and here's how we did it

4260
03:41:05,919 --> 03:41:06,687
During this period

4261
03:41:07,455 --> 03:41:13,343
When the sensibilities as we said earlier begin to change among some people in some classes

4262
03:41:14,111 --> 03:41:17,695
The audience going to be executions begins to in some

4263
03:41:18,207 --> 03:41:19,487
Manner of speaking

4264
03:41:19,999 --> 03:41:21,023
Look at itself

4265
03:41:22,303 --> 03:41:23,583
And not like what it says

4266
03:41:26,655 --> 03:41:27,679
Pierce. Bergin his

4267
03:41:28,191 --> 03:41:29,215
The spectacle of suffering

4268
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:34,591
Gives a primary source account a dramatized one he points out

4269
03:41:35,103 --> 03:41:36,639
From a person who was

4270
03:41:37,151 --> 03:41:43,295
Shall we say on The Cutting Edge of these new sensibilities wouldn't even want to see one of these public executions but stumbled into one

4271
03:41:45,343 --> 03:41:46,623
Remember the positive gravity

4272
03:41:47,391 --> 03:41:47,903
Execution site

4273
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:48,671
Fight in Paris

4274
03:41:48,927 --> 03:41:49,439
Quote

4275
03:41:50,207 --> 03:41:52,511
We were proceeding toward the plaza graph

4276
03:41:52,767 --> 03:41:55,327
It was late and we thought the execution over

4277
03:41:55,583 --> 03:41:58,399
But the gaping mob proclaimed the contrary

4278
03:41:58,911 --> 03:42:02,239
The man was broken on the wheel as where his two companions

4279
03:42:02,751 --> 03:42:04,799
I could not endure the sight of that execution

4280
03:42:05,311 --> 03:42:06,079
I moved away

4281
03:42:07,103 --> 03:42:08,895
His friend

4282
03:42:09,151 --> 03:42:10,687
Watched it all stoically

4283
03:42:10,943 --> 03:42:12,479
I turned to look at something else

4284
03:42:12,991 --> 03:42:14,271
While the victim suffered

4285
03:42:14,527 --> 03:42:15,807
I studied The Spectator

4286
03:42:16,575 --> 03:42:19,391
They chattered and laughed as if they were watching a farce

4287
03:42:19,903 --> 03:42:21,183
But what revolted me most

4288
03:42:21,439 --> 03:42:22,975
What's a very pretty young girl

4289
03:42:23,231 --> 03:42:25,023
Lysol with what appeared to be her lover

4290
03:42:26,047 --> 03:42:27,839
She uttered peals of laughter

4291
03:42:28,095 --> 03:42:31,679
Suggested about the miserable man's expressions and screams

4292
03:42:31,935 --> 03:42:33,983
I could not believe it!

4293
03:42:34,751 --> 03:42:36,543
I looked at her five or six times

4294
03:42:37,055 --> 03:42:39,615
Finally without thinking of the consequences I said to her

4295
03:42:39,871 --> 03:42:40,639
Mademoiselle

4296
03:42:40,895 --> 03:42:42,943
You must have the heart of a monster

4297
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:47,039
At the judge by what I see of you today I believe you're capable of any tribe

4298
03:42:47,551 --> 03:42:50,879
If I Had The Misfortune to be your lover I would shun you forever

4299
03:42:51,391 --> 03:42:52,671
As she was no fish wife

4300
03:42:52,927 --> 03:42:54,463
He writes she stood mute

4301
03:42:54,719 --> 03:42:56,255
! again

4302
03:42:57,279 --> 03:42:59,839
I expected some unpleasant retort from her lover

4303
03:43:00,095 --> 03:43:01,119
He said not a word

4304
03:43:01,631 --> 03:43:05,471
Then a few steps away I saw another young girl drenched in tears

4305
03:43:06,239 --> 03:43:10,591
She came to me leaned upon my arm hiding her face and she said

4306
03:43:10,847 --> 03:43:12,383
This is an honorable man

4307
03:43:12,639 --> 03:43:14,687
Who feels pity for those in anguish

4308
03:43:15,199 --> 03:43:16,735
! again

4309
03:43:17,759 --> 03:43:18,271
And quote

4310
03:43:20,575 --> 03:43:22,623
Those comments also emphasized

4311
03:43:22,879 --> 03:43:29,023
Another key thing it was making some in the crowd judge others in the crowd harshly for their way that they were reacting

4312
03:43:30,047 --> 03:43:30,559
Women

4313
03:43:32,095 --> 03:43:33,119
Women were

4314
03:43:33,887 --> 03:43:36,447
Staples at these executions pretty much every source

4315
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:38,495
Suggest from the get-go

4316
03:43:39,519 --> 03:43:44,127
Some sources suggest that women and boys traditionally made up the majority of the crowd

4317
03:43:45,407 --> 03:43:51,551
It hadn't been a problem before this era but this is the error remember that has certain built-in assumptions amongst Allah

4318
03:43:51,807 --> 03:43:53,087
A lot of the inteligencia

4319
03:43:53,343 --> 03:43:54,623
About human nature

4320
03:43:55,135 --> 03:43:57,951
And one of those assumptions have to do with Womanhood

4321
03:43:58,719 --> 03:44:00,511
And how women are naturally

4322
03:44:00,767 --> 03:44:06,655
The more compassionate sex is one primary source quote are red it's a basically something like they're scared of spiders

4323
03:44:06,911 --> 03:44:10,495
But they can go to these executions and watch intently and enjoy it

4324
03:44:11,519 --> 03:44:13,823
So the reality of women that these executions

4325
03:44:14,591 --> 03:44:20,735
Was clashing with the inteligencia view of what Womanhood was in their minds in their writings in there was

4326
03:44:20,991 --> 03:44:22,015
Assumptions once again

4327
03:44:22,271 --> 03:44:25,087
If woman who does really like this ideal compassionate

4328
03:44:25,599 --> 03:44:29,951
In a mothering State than what we're seeing when we see women go to these executions are

4329
03:44:30,463 --> 03:44:31,231
Twisted people

4330
03:44:31,999 --> 03:44:36,351
People with a screw loose in other words they are establishing a new Baseline for normalcy

4331
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:37,631
One that is

4332
03:44:38,399 --> 03:44:39,935
Idealistic perhaps at least

4333
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:43,519
For some people in their times and then what they're seeing on the ground

4334
03:44:43,775 --> 03:44:45,055
The Ground Zero

4335
03:44:45,311 --> 03:44:46,847
Clashes with their ideal

4336
03:44:48,383 --> 03:44:54,015
But it is fascinating as a modern person to read some of these letters that are published in the histories

4337
03:44:54,527 --> 03:44:56,319
There are upper class women in

4338
03:44:56,575 --> 03:44:58,879
France free sample in their letters are in Freeland

4339
03:44:59,391 --> 03:45:00,415
As wonderful as I said

4340
03:45:00,927 --> 03:45:05,023
And you can see that there is an element of the soap opera

4341
03:45:05,535 --> 03:45:06,559
Going on here

4342
03:45:07,071 --> 03:45:08,863
Some executions are

4343
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:15,519
Horrible others are wonderful others are beautiful the people are all huge part of the draw I mean you have likes

4344
03:45:15,775 --> 03:45:17,823
Celebrity executions imagine simatai

4345
03:45:18,335 --> 03:45:18,847
Most famous

4346
03:45:19,359 --> 03:45:24,735
People who have tons of cosmetic line the reality show them to getting into trouble and then the public execution where

4347
03:45:24,991 --> 03:45:27,039
Their former popularity

4348
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:33,439
Plays into the draw the crowd later I mean if you love this person in this nut film would you love to see them their final

4349
03:45:34,463 --> 03:45:35,231
On the scaffold

4350
03:45:37,791 --> 03:45:41,119
Freeland actually uses some of these letters as a way to

4351
03:45:41,631 --> 03:45:42,911
Try to make his case

4352
03:45:43,423 --> 03:45:44,447
That it wasn't

4353
03:45:44,703 --> 03:45:49,823
Class that determined whether or not you had feeling for these people who died on the scaffold because a lot of these

4354
03:45:50,335 --> 03:45:50,847
Women

4355
03:45:51,103 --> 03:45:53,663
Compare Asian high society for example

4356
03:45:53,919 --> 03:45:56,991
Went to watch executions of people they knew

4357
03:45:57,503 --> 03:45:58,015
Wow

4358
03:45:58,783 --> 03:46:00,063
And enjoy them

4359
03:46:02,623 --> 03:46:04,415
Prelim relates the story of

4360
03:46:04,671 --> 03:46:05,695
Madam

4361
03:46:05,951 --> 03:46:09,279
Two cats execution in 1699

4362
03:46:09,535 --> 03:46:13,631
He says that Spectators of every class crowded the Streets between

4363
03:46:13,887 --> 03:46:16,191
Prison in the execution ground in Paris

4364
03:46:16,447 --> 03:46:21,311
He says all the windows overlooking the scaffold have been rented out well in advance

4365
03:46:23,871 --> 03:46:24,895
And then he writes about

4366
03:46:25,407 --> 03:46:26,943
A letter written by

4367
03:46:27,967 --> 03:46:29,503
A woman named Uno her

4368
03:46:30,527 --> 03:46:33,087
Talkin about the execution he says quote

4369
03:46:33,855 --> 03:46:37,183
Despite having been personally acquainted with Madame to cat

4370
03:46:37,439 --> 03:46:40,255
Denoyers account of the execution dwells far-less

4371
03:46:40,511 --> 03:46:44,863
I'm whatever emotion she might have experienced at the sight of watching her friend die

4372
03:46:45,631 --> 03:46:49,727
Then on the feelings of excitement she felt at watching the spectacle of the execution

4373
03:46:50,751 --> 03:46:52,543
At times you know are compares

4374
03:46:52,799 --> 03:46:53,311
Two cats

4375
03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:55,615
Performance in quotation marks

4376
03:46:56,127 --> 03:46:58,687
Did the experience of watching a dramatic production

4377
03:46:58,943 --> 03:47:04,831
We're calling receipts blurring of the theatrical in the real in his particular brand of tragic realism

4378
03:47:05,855 --> 03:47:06,367
This is

4379
03:47:06,879 --> 03:47:10,719
Madame De Niro writing about watching her friend died

4380
03:47:11,487 --> 03:47:11,999
Quote

4381
03:47:13,279 --> 03:47:17,631
I was in the windows of the hotel-de-ville and I saw poor Madame to cat arrive

4382
03:47:17,887 --> 03:47:19,679
Around 5 in the evening

4383
03:47:19,935 --> 03:47:20,703
Dressed in white

4384
03:47:21,215 --> 03:47:23,775
One would have said that she had studied her role

4385
03:47:24,031 --> 03:47:25,823
Because she kissed The Chopping Block

4386
03:47:26,079 --> 03:47:30,943
And attended do all the other particulars as if they were simply a matter of performing in a play

4387
03:47:31,455 --> 03:47:32,223
In the end

4388
03:47:32,479 --> 03:47:34,783
One had never seen such self-possession

4389
03:47:35,295 --> 03:47:38,623
Anicura saint-sulpice and then she died a true heroine

4390
03:47:39,135 --> 03:47:42,207
The hangman was so moved that he missed her head

4391
03:47:42,463 --> 03:47:46,047
And had to repeat his job five times before he managed to behead

4392
03:47:46,815 --> 03:47:49,119
Descended the beautiful Madame to cat

4393
03:47:49,375 --> 03:47:50,911
Who was the ornament of all Paris

4394
03:47:51,679 --> 03:47:52,191
And quote

4395
03:47:53,727 --> 03:47:55,519
Again it sounds like a soap opera

4396
03:47:57,311 --> 03:48:00,383
And Friedland notes it was only for a brief moment in the letter

4397
03:48:00,895 --> 03:48:01,407
That

4398
03:48:01,919 --> 03:48:06,527
This woman looked at herself and wondered about her own emotions as a spectator

4399
03:48:07,039 --> 03:48:07,807
She writes quote

4400
03:48:08,575 --> 03:48:12,927
One never saw anything as beautiful as her head when it has been separated from her body

4401
03:48:13,183 --> 03:48:16,767
They left it for a Time on the scaffold so the people could see it

4402
03:48:17,023 --> 03:48:22,143
Her face was turned in the direction of the hotel-de-ville and I assure you that I was dazzled by a

4403
03:48:22,655 --> 03:48:24,703
In the end I was so touched by her death

4404
03:48:24,959 --> 03:48:27,263
But it took me more than 6 months to recover from

4405
03:48:27,775 --> 03:48:30,079
I need this with pain that I now recall these thought

4406
03:48:31,103 --> 03:48:31,615
And quote

4407
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:34,943
Freeland has another letter

4408
03:48:35,199 --> 03:48:35,711
He quotes from

4409
03:48:36,223 --> 03:48:36,991
Pie Society

4410
03:48:37,247 --> 03:48:38,527
Parisian woman who was talking about

4411
03:48:38,783 --> 03:48:41,343
Case of murder case involving a woman at the center of it

4412
03:48:41,599 --> 03:48:42,879
Obsessed Paris like

4413
03:48:43,135 --> 03:48:45,951
A great gossip story in a 4 months

4414
03:48:46,207 --> 03:48:47,231
They followed the trial

4415
03:48:47,487 --> 03:48:48,767
And then eventually

4416
03:48:49,023 --> 03:48:51,071
The woman has to go up on the scaffold and be

4417
03:48:51,583 --> 03:48:54,399
Executed in the Nae throw her body on a fire and burn it up

4418
03:48:54,655 --> 03:48:58,495
Sending the ashes up into the small caparison the letter writer says

4419
03:48:59,007 --> 03:49:00,031
But you know for months

4420
03:49:00,287 --> 03:49:04,639
All of Paris lived and breathed this story of the trial is going on

4421
03:49:04,895 --> 03:49:08,223
And now all the Paris was a literally breathing this person in

4422
03:49:08,479 --> 03:49:10,015
Everytime they inhale

4423
03:49:12,319 --> 03:49:14,111
Now this heading cause any sort of fuss

4424
03:49:14,623 --> 03:49:18,463
For a long time by the 1690s you were starting to get the very earliest

4425
03:49:19,231 --> 03:49:21,791
In a complaint and Rumblings about women

4426
03:49:22,303 --> 03:49:27,935
John Holland seemingly it was it they might enjoy this kind of stuff and they were having the same problem with boys kids

4427
03:49:28,447 --> 03:49:33,311
In the ritualistic religious are you could have choirs of kids singing and humming during the

4428
03:49:33,567 --> 03:49:34,847
Worst of the executions

4429
03:49:35,103 --> 03:49:36,127
Considered to be

4430
03:49:36,383 --> 03:49:37,919
A good lesson hold them up on

4431
03:49:38,175 --> 03:49:40,735
The shoulder of the father so that they could see better

4432
03:49:40,991 --> 03:49:47,135
Take him to the Gallows afterwards let him see what happens to malefactors take him to the gibbet showing the dead bodies rotting inside

4433
03:49:47,903 --> 03:49:53,791
The better classes started looking at that and thinking that there was something wrong with that child abuse we would say today

4434
03:49:54,047 --> 03:49:57,375
Or at least the stirrings of people who began to think that way

4435
03:49:59,423 --> 03:50:01,983
And for anyone who didn't there was beginning to be

4436
03:50:02,495 --> 03:50:05,055
Public pressure in the culture on them

4437
03:50:05,567 --> 03:50:08,639
And it's interesting that it was only directed at the so-called better

4438
03:50:08,895 --> 03:50:11,711
People for example V AC control in his book The Hanging Tree

4439
03:50:11,967 --> 03:50:13,503
Talked about Sir Joshua Reynolds

4440
03:50:14,015 --> 03:50:16,063
One of these so-called better people

4441
03:50:16,319 --> 03:50:21,439
Who in 1790 decided to go to water hanging you know no big deal

4442
03:50:22,207 --> 03:50:23,743
It was starting to become important

4443
03:50:24,255 --> 03:50:24,767
Which p

4444
03:50:25,791 --> 03:50:26,303
And he was

4445
03:50:26,559 --> 03:50:31,423
Appalled to find the newspapers criticizing him the next day for going

4446
03:50:31,935 --> 03:50:34,495
They basically said that the man he went with

4447
03:50:34,751 --> 03:50:37,823
Someone lower on the social strata we would expect those kind of

4448
03:50:38,079 --> 03:50:40,383
People to go but not somebody like sir Joshua Reynolds

4449
03:50:41,407 --> 03:50:43,199
And Reynolds was kind of confused

4450
03:50:43,455 --> 03:50:48,831
Should have caught off guard by the change in sensibilities if you will and so we wrote a letter

4451
03:50:49,087 --> 03:50:52,927
To his friend Boswell who we went to the execution with afterwards kind of saying

4452
03:50:53,183 --> 03:50:57,791
What's wrong with going do an execution right here here's the defense if you will

4453
03:50:58,047 --> 03:50:59,071
For enjoying

4454
03:50:59,327 --> 03:51:04,703
The hanging a good hanging hanging well carried out and I should point out that he went to the hanging to watch

4455
03:51:04,959 --> 03:51:07,263
Will five people being hanged but one of them was

4456
03:51:07,519 --> 03:51:10,079
Aeon servant-girl for somebody he knew

4457
03:51:10,591 --> 03:51:11,871
And a servant girl

4458
03:51:12,127 --> 03:51:12,639
New him

4459
03:51:13,407 --> 03:51:19,039
She recognized him right before the news with put around your neck and bowed to him in front of this giant crowd

4460
03:51:19,295 --> 03:51:21,599
She by the way was being hanged for a little theft

4461
03:51:23,135 --> 03:51:24,671
Such was the bloody code right

4462
03:51:25,439 --> 03:51:31,583
But Reynolds says the whole thing went well what's the problem he wrote to his friend Boswell about the criticism he received

4463
03:51:31,839 --> 03:51:33,119
Even the newspapers for going

4464
03:51:33,375 --> 03:51:34,399
And said quote

4465
03:51:35,679 --> 03:51:37,983
I am convinced it is a vulgar error

4466
03:51:38,495 --> 03:51:41,311
The opinion that hanging is so terrible spectacle

4467
03:51:41,567 --> 03:51:45,663
Heard it in any way implies a Hardness of Heart or cruelty of disposition

4468
03:51:45,919 --> 03:51:49,247
Any more than such a disposition is implied in the seeking Delight

4469
03:51:49,503 --> 03:51:51,551
And the representations of a tragedy

4470
03:51:52,063 --> 03:51:54,367
Let me stop here he means like a drama or a play

4471
03:51:54,879 --> 03:51:55,391
He continued

4472
03:51:56,159 --> 03:52:02,303
Such an execution as we saw where there was no torture of the body or expression of Agony of the Mind

4473
03:52:02,559 --> 03:52:04,607
Who were the criminals on the contrary

4474
03:52:04,863 --> 03:52:06,143
Cured perfectly composed

4475
03:52:06,399 --> 03:52:07,679
Without the leaf trembling

4476
03:52:07,935 --> 03:52:12,287
Ready to speak in answer with Civility and attention to any question that was proposed

4477
03:52:13,311 --> 03:52:16,383
Neither in a state of torpidity or insensibility

4478
03:52:16,639 --> 03:52:18,175
A grave and composed

4479
03:52:18,687 --> 03:52:22,015
I consider it is natural to desire to see such sights

4480
03:52:22,271 --> 03:52:24,831
And if I may venture to take Delight in them

4481
03:52:25,087 --> 03:52:27,135
You know that your sister and interest the mine

4482
03:52:27,647 --> 03:52:28,927
To give it some emotion

4483
03:52:29,183 --> 03:52:31,743
Is moderate exercise is necessary for the body

4484
03:52:31,999 --> 03:52:37,375
If the criminals had expressed great Agony of mine The Spectators must infallibly sympathize

4485
03:52:37,887 --> 03:52:39,935
But so far was the fact from it

4486
03:52:40,191 --> 03:52:43,775
You regard with admiration the serenity of their countenances

4487
03:52:44,031 --> 03:52:45,055
And hold apartment

4488
03:52:45,823 --> 03:52:46,335
And quote

4489
03:52:48,127 --> 03:52:49,919
This is clearly a guy

4490
03:52:50,175 --> 03:52:53,759
Who doesn't feel the physical pain of the

4491
03:52:54,271 --> 03:52:57,343
Victims that he's watching otherwise he might have approached

4492
03:52:57,599 --> 03:52:59,135
The way you described this differently

4493
03:52:59,647 --> 03:53:00,671
But 30 Years be

4494
03:53:00,927 --> 03:53:01,951
Before this guy right

4495
03:53:02,207 --> 03:53:02,719
That

4496
03:53:03,743 --> 03:53:04,511
Adam Smith

4497
03:53:05,279 --> 03:53:07,327
Author of The Wealth of Nations

4498
03:53:07,839 --> 03:53:08,863
Wrote something else

4499
03:53:09,631 --> 03:53:13,215
Called the theory of moral sentiments in 1759

4500
03:53:14,239 --> 03:53:16,031
Where he basically implied

4501
03:53:16,287 --> 03:53:22,175
But it's natural when watching someone burn to death as we've been saying to feel the physical pain of the Vic

4502
03:53:23,967 --> 03:53:24,479
Heroes quote

4503
03:53:25,759 --> 03:53:28,319
By the imagination we place ourselves

4504
03:53:28,575 --> 03:53:30,367
In his the sufferers

4505
03:53:30,623 --> 03:53:31,391
Situation

4506
03:53:31,647 --> 03:53:34,975
We conceive ourselves enduring all the same torments

4507
03:53:35,231 --> 03:53:38,303
We enter as it were into his body

4508
03:53:38,559 --> 03:53:41,375
And becoming some measure the same person with him

4509
03:53:41,887 --> 03:53:44,703
Infants form some idea of his sensation

4510
03:53:45,471 --> 03:53:45,983
And quote

4511
03:53:47,775 --> 03:53:51,103
Again these thinkers are implying that this is the way we are

4512
03:53:51,615 --> 03:53:53,151
So then what does that make pee

4513
03:53:53,407 --> 03:53:55,199
People who aren't that way

4514
03:53:55,455 --> 03:53:57,247
Like poor sir Joshua Reynolds

4515
03:53:57,503 --> 03:53:58,015
Right

4516
03:53:58,783 --> 03:54:00,063
It makes him someone liable to be

4517
03:54:00,319 --> 03:54:01,343
Be criticized by the

4518
03:54:01,599 --> 03:54:02,367
Cultural

4519
03:54:03,135 --> 03:54:04,415
Critics of his day

4520
03:54:05,183 --> 03:54:08,255
It also shows a change in the mood and these historians will

4521
03:54:08,511 --> 03:54:14,655
Go over letters and comments and editorials and all sorts of things to show that the mood is changing at this change of sensibility

4522
03:54:15,167 --> 03:54:17,983
Now we told you like when we were talking about how you

4523
03:54:18,239 --> 03:54:19,775
Try to quantify all the different

4524
03:54:20,031 --> 03:54:22,079
Friends that play into any zeitgeist

4525
03:54:22,591 --> 03:54:24,383
The 1960s for example

4526
03:54:24,639 --> 03:54:30,527
Well how much value to place on this change in sensibilities among some classes in some places

4527
03:54:31,039 --> 03:54:33,087
And how much weight to put on the fact

4528
03:54:33,343 --> 03:54:38,975
That the authorities are not liking some of the main things involved in these executions anymore

4529
03:54:39,231 --> 03:54:40,255
Is sort of all

4530
03:54:41,279 --> 03:54:47,423
You know what tomato or tomahto thing if you're an expert I mean this is the kind of things they have debates over no one argues that they all Play-Doh

4531
03:54:47,679 --> 03:54:49,983
What did you argue over how much of a role

4532
03:54:50,495 --> 03:54:53,055
The people out there that are Ground Zero Cenex

4533
03:54:53,567 --> 03:54:54,847
Will point out the listen

4534
03:54:55,359 --> 03:54:56,383
There was never

4535
03:54:56,639 --> 03:55:02,783
A real change in the attendance rates at these executions and unless you want to say that they continually grow

4536
03:55:03,551 --> 03:55:04,831
Is Richard Evans points out

4537
03:55:05,087 --> 03:55:10,719
The high-water mark for attendance of public executions in Western Europe are right before they're taken behind

4538
03:55:10,975 --> 03:55:13,279
You know the jail walls and made private

4539
03:55:13,791 --> 03:55:15,839
Showing that there's no drop-off in demand

4540
03:55:17,631 --> 03:55:20,703
People who put a great amount of importance on this particular angle

4541
03:55:21,215 --> 03:55:23,007
Will point out that people never

4542
03:55:23,519 --> 03:55:29,663
Grew out of public executions because of a change in sensibilities they had the public execution in the spectacle taken

4543
03:55:29,919 --> 03:55:30,687
Away from them

4544
03:55:31,967 --> 03:55:32,735
By the authority

4545
03:55:34,015 --> 03:55:36,575
There are lots of reasons the authorities seem to be

4546
03:55:36,831 --> 03:55:42,207
Less than satisfied with these public executions the first thing is is that slowly but surely

4547
03:55:42,463 --> 03:55:47,839
A consensus was developing that they weren't doing what you wanted to do not just because people weren't terrified

4548
03:55:48,095 --> 03:55:49,631
Because they weren't deterring crime

4549
03:55:50,399 --> 03:55:54,495
Voltaire and other in a public intellectuals that argued that the

4550
03:55:54,751 --> 03:56:00,127
You know death penalty for almost anything or these spectacular ones actually made certain kinds of crimes worse

4551
03:56:00,639 --> 03:56:06,783
So the authorities during this big are of penal reform in the 1700 especially were trying to get down to a Bedrock Prince

4552
03:56:07,039 --> 03:56:08,063
About what works

4553
03:56:09,599 --> 03:56:13,439
The other thing that was happening in the 1700 if you remember your history

4554
03:56:13,951 --> 03:56:19,839
Is the always present fear of the mob amongst the European

4555
03:56:20,863 --> 03:56:22,143
Autocratic rulers

4556
03:56:22,399 --> 03:56:23,423
Exploded

4557
03:56:24,959 --> 03:56:25,983
Intensity

4558
03:56:26,495 --> 03:56:28,287
Right around the 1790s

4559
03:56:28,799 --> 03:56:31,615
That wonderful party known as the French Revolution happened

4560
03:56:31,871 --> 03:56:36,735
Which would spread some of these ideas like an intellectual contagion all over Europe

4561
03:56:36,991 --> 03:56:41,855
And all of a sudden the most dangerous thing if you are a ruler of one of these countries that you can think of

4562
03:56:42,367 --> 03:56:46,207
Is a large crowd of your people together in one place

4563
03:56:47,743 --> 03:56:50,303
Especially if a lot of them are perhaps partying

4564
03:56:50,815 --> 03:56:53,631
Especially if they're very wound up about something

4565
03:56:53,887 --> 03:57:00,031
I mean worst case scenario imagine at the public execution that you are staging to draw all these people into one of your main cities

4566
03:57:00,287 --> 03:57:02,591
To watch and get all drunk and excited about

4567
03:57:03,103 --> 03:57:04,383
Is somebody who's

4568
03:57:04,895 --> 03:57:06,175
Crime was political

4569
03:57:06,943 --> 03:57:08,735
Against you the regime

4570
03:57:09,759 --> 03:57:14,111
The hundreds of course will be the era of revolution in Western Europe 1848

4571
03:57:14,367 --> 03:57:15,391
Crown Jewel year

4572
03:57:15,903 --> 03:57:19,231
But all of a sudden the idea of getting a lot of

4573
03:57:19,743 --> 03:57:23,071
The masses in one place at one time

4574
03:57:23,327 --> 03:57:25,119
I want a sudden sounding very

4575
03:57:26,911 --> 03:57:28,447
BAC Cantrell says

4576
03:57:28,959 --> 03:57:33,055
That it was the authorities that imposed emotional restraint

4577
03:57:33,311 --> 03:57:36,383
On the crowd by taking away their public execution

4578
03:57:36,639 --> 03:57:42,783
Cuz it wasn't serving the needs of the state and you have some German sources that talk about the execution itself

4579
03:57:43,039 --> 03:57:44,831
I think I'm quoting here but from memory

4580
03:57:45,087 --> 03:57:46,111
Brutalizing

4581
03:57:46,367 --> 03:57:47,135
The Spectator

4582
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:51,231
So you can't argue that they're enjoying what they're singing

4583
03:57:51,487 --> 03:57:57,631
What you're arguing that it's the exposure to these kinds of spectacles that are making you enjoy right to become

4584
03:57:57,887 --> 03:57:59,167
Palace used to it

4585
03:58:00,447 --> 03:58:01,215
Numb

4586
03:58:02,751 --> 03:58:04,543
And there is a ton of

4587
03:58:04,799 --> 03:58:09,407
Class animosity in the sources where the dumbasses who go to these executions are portrayed

4588
03:58:09,663 --> 03:58:13,503
You know increasingly is lower and lower class more and more brutal

4589
03:58:13,759 --> 03:58:15,807
And Jennifer example the Prussian nobility Justice

4590
03:58:16,063 --> 03:58:18,367
Completely disconnected from the Richard Evans

4591
03:58:18,623 --> 03:58:24,255
They sneer the masses and think of them as bloodthirsty and low in terms of culture

4592
03:58:26,047 --> 03:58:27,583
By the middle 1800s

4593
03:58:28,095 --> 03:58:34,239
Most of these major states are doing away with public executions changing them in ways to make the crowds

4594
03:58:34,495 --> 03:58:38,079
Very small for example they will still execute people publicly in Paris

4595
03:58:38,591 --> 03:58:40,639
Till 19th of 1930

4596
03:58:41,151 --> 03:58:44,223
What they'll do it in a way that minimizes crowd size

4597
03:58:45,247 --> 03:58:46,015
Chinese Publix pek

4598
03:58:46,271 --> 03:58:48,831
Vehicles will go from being encouraged and staged

4599
03:58:49,343 --> 03:58:50,367
To being discouraged

4600
03:58:50,623 --> 03:58:51,391
Deterred

4601
03:58:51,647 --> 03:58:53,951
And eventually simply taken away

4602
03:58:54,719 --> 03:58:55,231
From the public

4603
03:58:57,023 --> 03:58:58,559
The best quick rundown

4604
03:58:58,815 --> 03:59:03,423
To describe the process that we did in this whole particular section of this conversation this

4605
03:59:03,935 --> 03:59:06,495
Case study if you will from the early modern era

4606
03:59:07,007 --> 03:59:07,519
Is

4607
03:59:07,775 --> 03:59:08,287
Why not

4608
03:59:08,543 --> 03:59:11,103
Richard J Evans rituals of Retribution

4609
03:59:11,615 --> 03:59:12,639
Where he says

4610
03:59:13,151 --> 03:59:13,663
About

4611
03:59:13,919 --> 03:59:19,295
The ending of public executions and he goes down a list of what year they happened in all these different states 1850

4612
03:59:19,551 --> 03:59:21,599
I just ate did it 1856 this state did it

4613
03:59:21,855 --> 03:59:25,439
And then he says of the ending of the public executions in Germany quote

4614
03:59:26,463 --> 03:59:31,071
The predominant immediate motive for this change was official fear of the mob

4615
03:59:31,583 --> 03:59:33,631
Public executions attracted huge crowds

4616
03:59:34,143 --> 03:59:39,519
Any emotions which they were thought to arouse wenzhou considered dangerously unpredictable

4617
03:59:41,311 --> 03:59:44,895
Evans Ben says that what happened was you had this religious ritual

4618
03:59:45,151 --> 03:59:51,295
But the state of NC took their religion out of destabilizing the whole thing and basically leaving nothing left

4619
03:59:51,551 --> 03:59:52,575
For people to enjoy it

4620
03:59:52,831 --> 03:59:54,367
Virtuosity reasons

4621
03:59:54,623 --> 03:59:57,695
Or sadistic reasons or fill in the blank reasons he writes quote

4622
03:59:59,231 --> 04:00:05,375
Decades of official attempts to secularize the execution ritual remove it from the arena of popular

4623
04:00:05,631 --> 04:00:11,775
Culture and Krypto materialist religion and converted into a solemn expression of state power head only

4624
04:00:12,031 --> 04:00:13,567
Only succeeded in destabilizing it

4625
04:00:14,335 --> 04:00:17,151
The transition from a status bound Society

4626
04:00:17,407 --> 04:00:21,759
Tawana growing class antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat

4627
04:00:22,015 --> 04:00:24,063
And broken asunder the synthesis

4628
04:00:24,319 --> 04:00:28,927
Estate in community ritual that had created the early modern public execution

4629
04:00:29,439 --> 04:00:33,535
The educated middle-class has now found the crowd Behavior repugnant

4630
04:00:34,047 --> 04:00:40,191
While it's deliberate desacralization at the hands of the authorities and gradually stripped it of its mean

4631
04:00:40,447 --> 04:00:41,471
Meanings for the common people

4632
04:00:42,495 --> 04:00:46,847
The dismantling of Guild Privileges and other aspects of the urban hierarchy

4633
04:00:47,103 --> 04:00:51,199
Through the political reforms and social changes of the first half of the 19th century

4634
04:00:51,455 --> 04:00:53,503
I destroyed the structured crowd

4635
04:00:53,759 --> 04:00:58,367
And replaced it in the eyes of the authorities with a formless volatile Ma

4636
04:00:59,391 --> 04:00:59,903
And quote

4637
04:01:01,695 --> 04:01:07,839
So this idea that public executions went away because they were no longer serving the interest of the authorities

4638
04:01:08,095 --> 04:01:10,655
He's a popular one off and heavily weighted when people

4639
04:01:10,911 --> 04:01:11,423
Trying to

4640
04:01:11,935 --> 04:01:15,263
Weigh the importance of this or that element playing into the zeitgeist

4641
04:01:16,799 --> 04:01:18,079
Modern sensibilities

4642
04:01:18,335 --> 04:01:20,895
State not liking executions anymore there's a bunch of other little

4643
04:01:21,919 --> 04:01:22,687
In private life I mean

4644
04:01:23,199 --> 04:01:24,991
You can find a lot of little variable that

4645
04:01:25,247 --> 04:01:28,319
Play wonder why things are unfolding the way they do but what's

4646
04:01:28,575 --> 04:01:30,879
Clear and interesting is that it happens very quickly

4647
04:01:32,415 --> 04:01:33,695
Control quotes people

4648
04:01:33,951 --> 04:01:35,487
Writing in the 1850

4649
04:01:36,511 --> 04:01:37,791
Who can't believe

4650
04:01:38,047 --> 04:01:40,863
But in the 1830s they were doing what they were doing

4651
04:01:41,631 --> 04:01:42,399
I mean that's a

4652
04:01:42,655 --> 04:01:43,423
Quick Change

4653
04:01:43,679 --> 04:01:44,191
In the wave

4654
04:01:46,495 --> 04:01:47,519
Some people

4655
04:01:47,775 --> 04:01:49,055
Anyway right which peep

4656
04:01:49,823 --> 04:01:51,103
Would be a good question to ask

4657
04:01:53,151 --> 04:01:54,431
My history books when I was on high

4658
04:01:54,687 --> 04:01:56,223
High School made a kind of sound like

4659
04:01:56,991 --> 04:01:58,783
The arrow we just talked about was the

4660
04:01:59,039 --> 04:02:01,599
The time where humankind in the better parts

4661
04:02:01,855 --> 04:02:03,135
The world grew up

4662
04:02:03,391 --> 04:02:04,159
In a moral

4663
04:02:04,671 --> 04:02:06,975
Became more Humane threw off the shackles

4664
04:02:07,487 --> 04:02:09,279
Leftover medieval ism

4665
04:02:10,303 --> 04:02:14,655
And into the Modern Age when it comes to moral sensibilities write the Modern Age where you could come up with

4666
04:02:15,679 --> 04:02:17,471
Human rights in Concepts like

4667
04:02:17,727 --> 04:02:19,263
War crimes and all these sorts

4668
04:02:19,519 --> 04:02:20,031
The things

4669
04:02:22,335 --> 04:02:25,151
And I actually think there's a pretty strong case for that

4670
04:02:26,175 --> 04:02:28,223
If we're talking about humankind

4671
04:02:28,735 --> 04:02:29,247
Collectively

4672
04:02:30,271 --> 04:02:31,295
All of us together

4673
04:02:33,087 --> 04:02:36,671
What if we're just talking instead of humankind my food just talking about human

4674
04:02:38,719 --> 04:02:39,231
Then you might have

4675
04:02:39,743 --> 04:02:40,255
Say

4676
04:02:41,023 --> 04:02:43,071
Well that differs on a case-to-case basis

4677
04:02:45,887 --> 04:02:48,703
I mean most of our societies no longer impose

4678
04:02:49,215 --> 04:02:51,263
The sort of cruel and unusual public

4679
04:02:51,519 --> 04:02:52,799
Punishment on criminals

4680
04:02:53,567 --> 04:02:56,127
But that doesn't mean their people wouldn't turn out to see it

4681
04:02:58,175 --> 04:03:00,223
I mean many societies have examples

4682
04:03:02,015 --> 04:03:08,159
Let's call it extrajudicial justice that have happened since the early modern era that Drew huge crowds

4683
04:03:08,671 --> 04:03:10,719
When in the United States to take for example

4684
04:03:10,975 --> 04:03:11,743
Lynching

4685
04:03:13,279 --> 04:03:14,303
Lynching is annex

4686
04:03:14,559 --> 04:03:15,327
Extrajudicial

4687
04:03:17,119 --> 04:03:18,143
Something carried out often

4688
04:03:18,399 --> 04:03:20,447
And by a mob or by vigilantes

4689
04:03:21,727 --> 04:03:22,495
In the United States

4690
04:03:23,263 --> 04:03:24,287
A lot of black

4691
04:03:24,543 --> 04:03:30,687
American males have been the victim of lynchings between 1890 and 1929 330 I think the

4692
04:03:30,943 --> 04:03:31,455
Cut off was

4693
04:03:31,711 --> 04:03:33,759
More than 3000 estimated

4694
04:03:34,015 --> 04:03:35,039
Black males lynched

4695
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:38,879
And racism obviously a huge part of The Americans

4696
04:03:39,135 --> 04:03:39,903
Experience including

4697
04:03:40,159 --> 04:03:41,695
Trying to keep people down

4698
04:03:41,951 --> 04:03:48,095
After reconstruction and the Jim Crow laws

4699
04:03:48,351 --> 04:03:48,863
All that was going

4700
04:03:49,119 --> 04:03:49,887
And yet

4701
04:03:50,655 --> 04:03:56,287
The United States of America has our citizens turned out for lynching involving white folks to

4702
04:03:57,311 --> 04:04:00,639
And there are photos of them at lynchings of black folks

4703
04:04:01,151 --> 04:04:02,943
Smiling next to tortured

4704
04:04:03,455 --> 04:04:05,759
A charred corpses of The Condemned

4705
04:04:06,783 --> 04:04:08,319
The victims would be a better word

4706
04:04:09,087 --> 04:04:11,647
And there are also photos of them smiling next

4707
04:04:11,903 --> 04:04:12,927
Do the hanging

4708
04:04:13,439 --> 04:04:15,487
In some cases partially stripped

4709
04:04:15,743 --> 04:04:16,511
Corpses

4710
04:04:16,767 --> 04:04:19,071
Of the white criminals taken out of jail

4711
04:04:19,583 --> 04:04:20,863
And strung up illegal

4712
04:04:23,935 --> 04:04:24,447
In other words

4713
04:04:24,703 --> 04:04:25,215
If we're doing it

4714
04:04:25,471 --> 04:04:26,495
Experiment on whether or not

4715
04:04:26,751 --> 04:04:27,263
People

4716
04:04:27,519 --> 04:04:30,847
Would still come out to a public execution if they were ever brought back

4717
04:04:31,615 --> 04:04:32,127
In the

4718
04:04:32,383 --> 04:04:33,663
20th century

4719
04:04:34,175 --> 04:04:35,199
The datapoint suggest

4720
04:04:35,967 --> 04:04:42,111
But the answer would be yes in fact United States didn't even stop public executions until the middle 1930s and I believe 20,000 peep

4721
04:04:42,367 --> 04:04:43,647
People showed up for the last one

4722
04:04:44,927 --> 04:04:50,303
The difference though it was a kind of what would you say simple hanging out

4723
04:04:50,815 --> 04:04:51,839
Take offense at that statement

4724
04:04:52,607 --> 04:04:53,631
But at least it was

4725
04:04:54,143 --> 04:04:57,983
The punishment prescribed by the enlightened of 20th century Society

4726
04:04:58,239 --> 04:04:59,263
Of the time

4727
04:05:00,031 --> 04:05:00,799
One of the really

4728
04:05:01,567 --> 04:05:05,663
Interesting comparison points when were talking about the lynchings in the United States is

4729
04:05:06,431 --> 04:05:08,223
You are not constrained by

4730
04:05:08,479 --> 04:05:14,623
The law that said you can't have cruel and unusual punishment you off and we're going for cruel and unusual punishments in the air

4731
04:05:14,879 --> 04:05:17,951
Actual accounts of diesel engines are terrifyingly horrible

4732
04:05:19,231 --> 04:05:21,791
You think blowtorches is that enough for you

4733
04:05:23,839 --> 04:05:27,423
Many of them were done in private by small groups of people

4734
04:05:27,679 --> 04:05:33,823
And that's part of the history of the ACT but that doesn't really concern us here for what we're talking about the ones that are interesting is sort of day

4735
04:05:34,079 --> 04:05:35,359
Data points if you will

4736
04:05:36,127 --> 04:05:36,895
Are the ones that

4737
04:05:37,407 --> 04:05:38,431
Drew huge crowds

4738
04:05:39,455 --> 04:05:41,503
Because you can write off small groups of people

4739
04:05:42,271 --> 04:05:42,783
Twisted

4740
04:05:43,551 --> 04:05:44,575
Malcontent

4741
04:05:44,831 --> 04:05:46,367
Unusual outliers

4742
04:05:47,135 --> 04:05:48,927
A lot harder when the sampling

4743
04:05:49,695 --> 04:05:51,231
Is of an entire town

4744
04:05:53,023 --> 04:05:54,047
Like Waco Texas

4745
04:05:55,583 --> 04:05:59,423
In 1916 and I don't mean to single out Waco it's just the most famous

4746
04:05:59,679 --> 04:06:00,191
Case

4747
04:06:01,215 --> 04:06:01,727
Those of you

4748
04:06:01,983 --> 04:06:03,775
Know your history of lynching

4749
04:06:04,287 --> 04:06:07,103
No I'm going to speak for a minute about the Jesse Washington case

4750
04:06:08,639 --> 04:06:12,223
And Washington's a good example because I had people come up to me and try to

4751
04:06:12,991 --> 04:06:13,759
Downplay

4752
04:06:14,015 --> 04:06:18,111
Play the stuff and one of the arguments they'll often uses yeah well of course I'm innocent people

4753
04:06:18,623 --> 04:06:24,255
We're Lynch but most of these people did bad things as though that would somehow be okay

4754
04:06:24,767 --> 04:06:28,351
Remember if Jesse Washington had faced legal justice

4755
04:06:28,863 --> 04:06:31,935
For the crimes he supposed to have committed he would have been hanged

4756
04:06:32,447 --> 04:06:33,727
A simple hanging right

4757
04:06:34,239 --> 04:06:35,007
But he wasn't

4758
04:06:37,055 --> 04:06:41,151
Historian Amy Louise wood describes the Jesse Washington situation this way

4759
04:06:41,663 --> 04:06:42,175
Quote

4760
04:06:44,223 --> 04:06:47,807
The 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco Texas

4761
04:06:48,319 --> 04:06:51,391
Stan's is one of the most widely known and scrutinized lynching

4762
04:06:51,903 --> 04:06:53,439
Because it in many ways

4763
04:06:53,695 --> 04:06:57,535
Typified the grotesque excess of spectacle lynching

4764
04:06:58,047 --> 04:07:01,631
Just over two months after The Birth of a Nation played in Waco

4765
04:07:01,887 --> 04:07:03,935
An estimated 10000 people watched

4766
04:07:04,191 --> 04:07:05,727
As a mob mutilated

4767
04:07:05,983 --> 04:07:08,287
Strangled and burned Washington to death

4768
04:07:08,543 --> 04:07:10,079
On the grounds of the city hall

4769
04:07:10,847 --> 04:07:12,127
The mayor she writes

4770
04:07:12,383 --> 04:07:13,663
And the chief of police

4771
04:07:13,919 --> 04:07:15,455
Watched from a window above

4772
04:07:15,967 --> 04:07:16,479
And quote

4773
04:07:17,503 --> 04:07:20,575
Washington she writes was a 17 year old African American

4774
04:07:21,087 --> 04:07:22,879
He was charged with

4775
04:07:23,135 --> 04:07:25,695
Killing a woman and maybe raping the woman

4776
04:07:26,207 --> 04:07:29,279
The jury deliberated for 4 minutes

4777
04:07:29,535 --> 04:07:31,071
Before convicting him

4778
04:07:31,583 --> 04:07:32,607
But Justice

4779
04:07:32,863 --> 04:07:36,191
As I said which would have been a simple hanging never had a chance to

4780
04:07:36,959 --> 04:07:39,263
In a run its course because as woodwright

4781
04:07:39,519 --> 04:07:40,031
Quote

4782
04:07:41,567 --> 04:07:45,407
Just moments after the jury which has deliberated for only 4 minutes

4783
04:07:45,663 --> 04:07:47,199
Reddit's guilty verdict

4784
04:07:47,455 --> 04:07:51,295
The crowd in the courtroom surged forward and seized Washington

4785
04:07:51,551 --> 04:07:54,111
Local businesses promptly close their doors

4786
04:07:54,367 --> 04:07:56,927
Spectators men women and children

4787
04:07:57,183 --> 04:07:58,719
Swarmed the city center

4788
04:07:59,231 --> 04:08:02,815
Climbing trees and standing on rooftop to get a better View

4789
04:08:04,095 --> 04:08:09,215
Local photographer Fred Gildersleeve who have been notified that Washington would be lynched

4790
04:08:09,471 --> 04:08:12,543
Capture the events on film from a window in City Hall

4791
04:08:12,799 --> 04:08:15,871
Afterwards his images were sold on the streets of the city

4792
04:08:16,127 --> 04:08:17,407
Along with body parts

4793
04:08:17,663 --> 04:08:19,967
And other Grizzly Remnant from the day's events

4794
04:08:20,479 --> 04:08:20,991
And quote

4795
04:08:23,295 --> 04:08:25,087
Folks this is not really modern

4796
04:08:25,343 --> 04:08:27,135
France which is shocking enough

4797
04:08:28,159 --> 04:08:29,439
This is 20th century

4798
04:08:29,951 --> 04:08:31,231
In the Main Street America

4799
04:08:33,535 --> 04:08:35,327
And if you go look at the photos

4800
04:08:35,583 --> 04:08:38,655
Which were taken of this lynching in progress

4801
04:08:39,679 --> 04:08:42,495
You can see why they turned out to be so

4802
04:08:43,007 --> 04:08:45,823
Galvanizing in the anti-lynching movement

4803
04:08:46,847 --> 04:08:48,383
Because you look at it and you are

4804
04:08:48,639 --> 04:08:50,175
Staring into a time machine

4805
04:08:51,199 --> 04:08:52,991
They're dressed differently

4806
04:08:53,503 --> 04:08:55,039
But that's a photograph

4807
04:08:55,295 --> 04:08:57,087
That gives you a pretty good idea

4808
04:08:57,599 --> 04:09:00,671
What these early modern executions must have look like two

4809
04:09:02,975 --> 04:09:05,535
The scenery changes the costumes evolve

4810
04:09:06,559 --> 04:09:08,607
But those people wearing those clothes

4811
04:09:09,631 --> 04:09:12,447
That's the same species as it always was

4812
04:09:12,703 --> 04:09:13,983
We are the lab rats

4813
04:09:14,751 --> 04:09:15,263
Experiment

4814
04:09:15,775 --> 04:09:18,335
Which wonder is about how we react

4815
04:09:18,847 --> 04:09:19,359
To this

4816
04:09:21,151 --> 04:09:23,967
And by the way the things that they did to Washington as

4817
04:09:24,223 --> 04:09:26,271
What's the case in a bunch of these lynchings

4818
04:09:26,783 --> 04:09:29,855
Are every bit as nasty as the stuff that went on

4819
04:09:30,111 --> 04:09:32,159
In those executions in early modern Europe we talk

4820
04:09:32,415 --> 04:09:33,951
Bottoming chopping off fingers

4821
04:09:34,207 --> 04:09:39,839
Burning people Jesse Washington was raised and lowered over fire for at least an hour or some sources say two

4822
04:09:40,607 --> 04:09:44,703
He tried to climb up the chain that was suspending him over the fire

4823
04:09:44,959 --> 04:09:50,079
But apparently was unable to because he lacked fingers which has been chopped off along with his genitals

4824
04:09:50,335 --> 04:09:51,103
This Is Not Unusual

4825
04:09:52,639 --> 04:09:53,919
Crowd of people watch this

4826
04:09:54,431 --> 04:09:55,711
Participated in it

4827
04:09:55,967 --> 04:09:56,735
Enjoyed it

4828
04:09:56,991 --> 04:10:01,855
Send postcards to other people later one is famous and says something to the effect

4829
04:10:02,111 --> 04:10:03,647
Quoting from memory here

4830
04:10:03,903 --> 04:10:04,927
You missed the BBQ

4831
04:10:05,183 --> 04:10:05,695
Q

4832
04:10:06,207 --> 04:10:06,719
We missed

4833
04:10:06,975 --> 04:10:07,487
Good Barbie

4834
04:10:09,791 --> 04:10:10,815
This is cruelty

4835
04:10:11,071 --> 04:10:11,583
Mask

4836
04:10:12,351 --> 04:10:13,119
Plain and simple

4837
04:10:14,911 --> 04:10:15,423
My dictionary de

4838
04:10:16,703 --> 04:10:20,799
Callous indifference to or pleasure in causing pain and suffering

4839
04:10:21,823 --> 04:10:22,335
Clearly.

4840
04:10:23,359 --> 04:10:24,639
And it's not a few outliers

4841
04:10:25,663 --> 04:10:27,967
People with Twisted evil minds

4842
04:10:28,479 --> 04:10:31,807
It's a wide cross-section of an early 20th century American city

4843
04:10:34,111 --> 04:10:37,951
It's tempting to label something like the Jesse Washington lynching as

4844
04:10:38,207 --> 04:10:40,511
Involving inhuman cruelty

4845
04:10:41,791 --> 04:10:43,071
But it looks all too human

4846
04:10:43,839 --> 04:10:44,351
After you

4847
04:10:44,607 --> 04:10:45,119
Leaf through

4848
04:10:45,375 --> 04:10:45,887
If you chapter 7

4849
04:10:46,143 --> 04:10:46,655
Your history book

4850
04:10:49,727 --> 04:10:51,007
Probably safe to say that this

4851
04:10:51,263 --> 04:10:52,543
His cruelty element is

4852
04:10:52,799 --> 04:10:55,103
Is a universal part of The Human Experience

4853
04:10:57,663 --> 04:10:59,711
Uncomfortable questions start coming into

4854
04:10:59,967 --> 04:11:00,479
Play

4855
04:11:01,503 --> 04:11:02,015
If you ask

4856
04:11:02,271 --> 04:11:02,783
Why

4857
04:11:05,087 --> 04:11:07,391
For now by the way and I think I have that

4858
04:11:07,903 --> 04:11:09,183
There is no agreement

4859
04:11:09,439 --> 04:11:10,719
Over this way

4860
04:11:10,975 --> 04:11:11,487
My issue

4861
04:11:12,255 --> 04:11:15,327
Why people are violent why they would enjoy watching violence

4862
04:11:15,583 --> 04:11:17,119
There are theories there are ideas

4863
04:11:17,375 --> 04:11:18,143
There are debates

4864
04:11:18,655 --> 04:11:19,679
There are studies at

4865
04:11:19,935 --> 04:11:21,471
Crosses many disciplines

4866
04:11:24,031 --> 04:11:26,847
I think storytellers have always understood

4867
04:11:27,103 --> 04:11:28,383
Unconsciously

4868
04:11:28,639 --> 04:11:30,687
But there are these buttons they can push

4869
04:11:31,455 --> 04:11:31,967
That

4870
04:11:32,223 --> 04:11:38,367
Trigger emotional responses in us that may be chemically related maybe they know how to push the dopamine or serotonin button

4871
04:11:38,879 --> 04:11:41,951
Every three pages of your script to make sure you get whatever

4872
04:11:42,463 --> 04:11:43,231
You need

4873
04:11:43,743 --> 04:11:46,559
To keep reading the story and be interested maybe it's a gunfight

4874
04:11:47,327 --> 04:11:49,119
Maybe it's a little sexual activity

4875
04:11:49,631 --> 04:11:51,679
Maybe it's some sort of Twisted

4876
04:11:52,191 --> 04:11:53,983
In a scene that makes you laugh

4877
04:11:54,239 --> 04:11:55,263
Or freaked out

4878
04:11:56,287 --> 04:11:59,359
But somebody knows that that's a button that will work for you why does it work

4879
04:11:59,871 --> 04:12:01,663
Do you want over the eras of

4880
04:12:02,687 --> 04:12:06,271
In evolutionary adaptations built on evolutionary adaptations

4881
04:12:06,527 --> 04:12:07,039
Is that

4882
04:12:07,295 --> 04:12:12,671
Flying into Isabel don't like playing into a jungle cats inability to not follow something

4883
04:12:12,927 --> 04:12:15,999
It looks like it's running away from it I mean is there something deep in our souls

4884
04:12:16,255 --> 04:12:18,303
It was once upon a time very useful

4885
04:12:18,559 --> 04:12:20,863
That's just left over like an appendix

4886
04:12:21,887 --> 04:12:25,471
We don't need this cruelty or this desire to see cruelty anymore

4887
04:12:25,727 --> 04:12:28,031
So what you still doing there do we need to get rid of it because

4888
04:12:28,543 --> 04:12:32,639
You know we haven't needed it in a long time and it causes a whole lot of side effects as we all know

4889
04:12:34,431 --> 04:12:34,943
Tncompass

4890
04:12:35,199 --> 04:12:36,735
Question that always the Wonder

4891
04:12:37,247 --> 04:12:39,807
If that's not the case if we still need it somehow

4892
04:12:41,599 --> 04:12:44,415
If it's a standard part of Who We Are

4893
04:12:44,927 --> 04:12:49,791
And along with all the obvious negative signs to it has some positive benefits I like to

4894
04:12:50,047 --> 04:12:52,607
Sometimes uses an analogy and you knew I was

4895
04:12:52,863 --> 04:12:53,375
Going to go here

4896
04:12:53,887 --> 04:12:54,655
Star Trek app

4897
04:12:55,679 --> 04:12:56,703
Captain Kirk

4898
04:12:56,959 --> 04:12:57,471
Explaining to the

4899
04:12:57,727 --> 04:12:59,775
The two halves of his personality I guess you could say

4900
04:13:00,031 --> 04:13:01,311
Politically call them

4901
04:13:01,567 --> 04:13:03,871
The positive and negative half a good the bad half

4902
04:13:04,127 --> 04:13:07,711
The one with the most celebrated positive human qualities in the one

4903
04:13:08,223 --> 04:13:10,015
Another sort of shows us that are most

4904
04:13:11,551 --> 04:13:14,623
Will seven deadly sins oriented best maybe you could

4905
04:13:15,903 --> 04:13:17,439
Throughout most of the episode

4906
04:13:17,695 --> 04:13:22,303
You know there's a good in the bad one of the bad ones doing all these bad things and getting into trouble that Goodwin is worried about

4907
04:13:22,559 --> 04:13:25,119
The moral of the story is there comes a point where

4908
04:13:25,375 --> 04:13:30,239
You're hardcore decisions that affect life and death and all these kinds of things comes into play

4909
04:13:30,495 --> 04:13:33,823
And the half that doesn't have the negative qualities is ill-equipped

4910
04:13:34,079 --> 04:13:36,383
There's something about those negative qualities that help

4911
04:13:36,895 --> 04:13:38,175
Round this person out

4912
04:13:38,687 --> 04:13:44,063
So that they have what they need in different situations most of the time maybe you don't need that cruelty Jean

4913
04:13:44,575 --> 04:13:45,599
To come into play

4914
04:13:45,855 --> 04:13:47,391
But maybe sometimes you do

4915
04:13:48,927 --> 04:13:50,463
That's a weird thing to think about

4916
04:13:50,719 --> 04:13:52,511
Right and maybe let's suggest

4917
04:13:52,767 --> 04:13:53,791
It has to do with

4918
04:13:54,047 --> 04:13:55,071
Chances what if it's like fire

4919
04:13:57,887 --> 04:13:59,679
And if you don't have it at all you freeze to death but

4920
04:13:59,935 --> 04:14:04,031
Maybe in a place like ancient Rome were there watching people die in the arena let's remember

4921
04:14:04,543 --> 04:14:05,567
The Romans

4922
04:14:05,823 --> 04:14:07,359
Is Will Durant pointed out with

4923
04:14:07,615 --> 04:14:09,919
Argue that the arena was good for their people

4924
04:14:10,175 --> 04:14:11,199
In their day right

4925
04:14:11,711 --> 04:14:17,343
Made you less of Shia blood made you a better Soldier made you tougher to watch this kind of stuff or so they thought

4926
04:14:18,623 --> 04:14:24,767
And maybe for their own time that's the level of Cruelty that those people needed to thrive maybe we don't need that level of cruel

4927
04:14:25,023 --> 04:14:25,535
How much less

4928
04:14:26,047 --> 04:14:26,815
Cruel Society

4929
04:14:27,839 --> 04:14:28,351
Then the neck

4930
04:14:28,607 --> 04:14:32,447
Next uncomfortable question that arises from that one is so how much cruelty do we need

4931
04:14:35,775 --> 04:14:41,919
Perhaps the follow-up uncomfortable question after that is even if you decide how much cruelty you need

4932
04:14:42,431 --> 04:14:43,455
What is X Change

4933
04:14:45,759 --> 04:14:49,087
Of course all implies that you can control cruelty like a

4934
04:14:49,855 --> 04:14:50,879
Temperature gauge

4935
04:14:55,231 --> 04:14:56,255
It is strange to think of

4936
04:14:57,535 --> 04:15:03,423
And we've been talkin bout a revolution sensibilities the idea that you could have a counter-revolution in sensibilities

4937
04:15:04,703 --> 04:15:05,471
People can become

4938
04:15:06,751 --> 04:15:11,871
Potentially more brutal depending on how you measure it more cruel than their parents or grandparents

4939
04:15:12,895 --> 04:15:13,407
Understand

4940
04:15:13,919 --> 04:15:17,247
Our parents and grandparents maybe the high-water mark of

4941
04:15:17,503 --> 04:15:18,271
Empathetic

4942
04:15:18,527 --> 04:15:19,807
Human development I mean

4943
04:15:20,063 --> 04:15:21,087
It's pretty recent

4944
04:15:23,647 --> 04:15:25,695
It's impossible to imagine today though

4945
04:15:26,207 --> 04:15:31,583
Play Jesse Washington type lynching happening in a small American city

4946
04:15:31,839 --> 04:15:37,471
In 21st century America in front of all those people can't even imagine it's a we call that progress right

4947
04:15:39,263 --> 04:15:43,359
Might we ever slide back in the other direction I mean I can't imagine

4948
04:15:43,871 --> 04:15:46,175
You never see something like that again

4949
04:15:46,687 --> 04:15:51,295
But maybe you could say that in 20 years do the whole bunch of different modern influences

4950
04:15:51,807 --> 04:15:57,951
If you took a pinion Polo 20% more of the survey people would say that what was done to the victim

4951
04:15:58,207 --> 04:15:58,719
Was correct

4952
04:15:59,743 --> 04:16:01,023
See what I'm saying that would be back

4953
04:16:01,279 --> 04:16:02,047
Sliding wooden it

4954
04:16:04,607 --> 04:16:06,143
And yet there's this weird dichotomy

4955
04:16:07,167 --> 04:16:08,191
Between what

4956
04:16:08,703 --> 04:16:14,847
I guess without study or thinking about it what one would think should be happening to society now

4957
04:16:15,359 --> 04:16:16,639
Versus what you see

4958
04:16:16,895 --> 04:16:23,039
Because what you see is a very empathetic Society some have suggested that the pendulum has even swung too far in that

4959
04:16:23,295 --> 04:16:25,087
Empathetic

4960
04:16:25,343 --> 04:16:26,367
Too weepy

4961
04:16:26,623 --> 04:16:28,159
Bright overly so may

4962
04:16:29,439 --> 04:16:31,231
Which then of course begs the question you know just

4963
04:16:31,487 --> 04:16:32,767
The pendulum swing backwards

4964
04:16:34,047 --> 04:16:35,071
The fire naturally

4965
04:16:35,583 --> 04:16:39,679
Note to self correct to the right amount of heat for the tenor of the times

4966
04:16:41,471 --> 04:16:42,239
Maybe something

4967
04:16:42,495 --> 04:16:48,639
Like a 911 happens and all of a sudden you need to change the cruelty level on the thermostat to allow for more

4968
04:16:50,175 --> 04:16:52,735
Darkside Captain Kirk activities necessary

4969
04:16:54,527 --> 04:16:59,391
You dial it back too often though into shorter. Of time you might find the room uncomfortably cold

4970
04:17:01,439 --> 04:17:02,975
The weird dichotomy

4971
04:17:03,487 --> 04:17:07,583
Is that in this era this Uber sensitive Uber empathetic error

4972
04:17:08,351 --> 04:17:11,167
We have more influences on us

4973
04:17:11,935 --> 04:17:14,239
That theoretically should have worked us

4974
04:17:14,751 --> 04:17:18,079
According to the experts that when I was a kid were telling me

4975
04:17:18,847 --> 04:17:23,199
That the number of simulated murders that I have seen on television is my brain was developing

4976
04:17:23,455 --> 04:17:29,599
You know something in the 14000 whatever they used to throw the number of the average American Child by the time they're fourteen years old is she and 14th

4977
04:17:29,855 --> 04:17:32,159
Does Rachel whatever it was the slogan

4978
04:17:33,951 --> 04:17:34,975
The implication was

4979
04:17:35,231 --> 04:17:38,815
And I don't blame him this was all pretty new stuff you got a 1960's television

4980
04:17:39,071 --> 04:17:43,679
Those hardly even counted murders by 1970 standards and those hardly counted murders by

4981
04:17:43,935 --> 04:17:46,495
Our standards today in terms of how came they are

4982
04:17:46,751 --> 04:17:49,311
Nonetheless there was ample worrying

4983
04:17:49,567 --> 04:17:55,711
But the accumulated effect of all this simulated violence would do something nasty to my generation when we got older and we're old

4984
04:17:55,967 --> 04:17:56,735
Weather now

4985
04:17:57,759 --> 04:17:58,527
What happened

4986
04:18:00,319 --> 04:18:05,695
The problem of course we all faced as we are immersed in the modern Zeitgeist we can't tell

4987
04:18:05,951 --> 04:18:06,975
If we've been warped

4988
04:18:07,743 --> 04:18:12,351
You got to bring somebody back from another era and instantly say hey notice anything weird about us

4989
04:18:12,863 --> 04:18:14,143
Weird funny to you

4990
04:18:14,399 --> 04:18:20,543
Bring back Captain America I love this about the Captain America character by the way he's a 1940's ERA American instantly transfer

4991
04:18:20,799 --> 04:18:21,823
Folded into the now

4992
04:18:22,079 --> 04:18:24,383
And you get to see his reactions to all the changes

4993
04:18:24,639 --> 04:18:26,687
But he didn't get to go through slowly like

4994
04:18:26,943 --> 04:18:28,223
The rest of society did

4995
04:18:29,503 --> 04:18:31,039
Pay 1940s American

4996
04:18:31,295 --> 04:18:32,063
Do we look warped

4997
04:18:32,319 --> 04:18:32,831
Do you

4998
04:18:35,647 --> 04:18:36,159
But

4999
04:18:36,415 --> 04:18:39,743
Tumi living in the milieu as I am

5000
04:18:40,255 --> 04:18:42,047
I don't see that we have been

5001
04:18:42,559 --> 04:18:45,119
Terribly affected in a nasty way

5002
04:18:45,375 --> 04:18:51,519
And if you would gone to the people the 1970s and show them the kind of violence we would see simulated today

5003
04:18:51,775 --> 04:18:53,567
Hey the realism level of it

5004
04:18:54,079 --> 04:19:00,223
I can't imagine what they would have said I mean the movies that you can go see the day and lots of the R-rated ones meet this crime

5005
04:19:00,479 --> 04:19:03,295
Criteria we've been rated X when I was a kid

5006
04:19:03,551 --> 04:19:07,391
X by the way traditionally what you labeled hardcore pornography

5007
04:19:07,647 --> 04:19:08,927
And kids Once Upon a Time

5008
04:19:09,183 --> 04:19:10,975
By the scale of today

5009
04:19:11,231 --> 04:19:14,559
It was a lot more tightly controlled in places like the United States

5010
04:19:14,815 --> 04:19:17,631
So they have your non-pornographic movie

5011
04:19:17,887 --> 04:19:24,031
Labeled X for violence with a huge deal right you basically wouldn't be making your movie we got lots of movie

5012
04:19:24,287 --> 04:19:24,799
Movies like that now

5013
04:19:26,335 --> 04:19:27,103
Again

5014
04:19:27,359 --> 04:19:27,871
So what

5015
04:19:28,639 --> 04:19:34,783
Society seems to be standing and the problem in trying to figure out if you can see long-term damage

5016
04:19:35,039 --> 04:19:38,367
Do do I see more and more simulated violence but more more real

5017
04:19:38,879 --> 04:19:40,159
Is the Zeitgeist thing again

5018
04:19:40,415 --> 04:19:42,207
How do you differentiate

5019
04:19:42,463 --> 04:19:48,607
In all the strands of reality and try to quantify that we have more school shootings with youngsters than we used to maybe it's violent video game

5020
04:19:48,863 --> 04:19:49,887
How would you know

5021
04:19:50,143 --> 04:19:52,959
$15,000 variables acting on those kids as well

5022
04:19:53,983 --> 04:19:56,287
But Society still standing right

5023
04:19:57,567 --> 04:20:00,127
When you think about what we were exposed to it a little bit shocking

5024
04:20:00,383 --> 04:20:02,175
Take for example this is what occurred to me

5025
04:20:02,431 --> 04:20:04,991
How many people have seen the images of the terrorists who are

5026
04:20:05,247 --> 04:20:11,135
Is slitting the throats with the knives of the people in the orange jumpsuits at their feet was on like every magazine cover at one point

5027
04:20:11,391 --> 04:20:14,719
The videos are all over the internet been viewed a bazillion times

5028
04:20:16,255 --> 04:20:22,399
That's more graphic than anything 99% of the population of the western world would have seen when

5029
04:20:22,655 --> 04:20:23,167
When I was a kid

5030
04:20:24,447 --> 04:20:27,007
The kind of stuff you'd only see if you were in combat

5031
04:20:27,519 --> 04:20:32,639
Or a first responder or a journalist or somebody who looked at autopsy photos I mean that's

5032
04:20:33,663 --> 04:20:36,479
That would have shocked America in 1974

5033
04:20:39,039 --> 04:20:39,551
Now

5034
04:20:40,063 --> 04:20:42,879
How many things like that have we seen

5035
04:20:43,647 --> 04:20:49,791
Does it do anything to us at all if you watch a hundred real chilling forget about the simulated stuff they were worried about

5036
04:20:50,047 --> 04:20:51,327
Black kids watching the 1970s

5037
04:20:51,839 --> 04:20:57,727
If you watched a hundred real killings online in a 24 hour period Does he do anyting

5038
04:20:59,007 --> 04:21:00,031
Here's the funny part

5039
04:21:00,287 --> 04:21:01,823
If it does something

5040
04:21:02,079 --> 04:21:06,175
I find that really interesting if it doesn't do anything I find a Justice interesting

5041
04:21:06,943 --> 04:21:08,479
Experiment right

5042
04:21:09,759 --> 04:21:11,295
Of course it would be if we had kept

5043
04:21:11,551 --> 04:21:13,855
The variables the same I mean if you'd shown

5044
04:21:14,367 --> 04:21:20,511
American children 1970s level television violence for a hundred years and then looked at the results

5045
04:21:20,767 --> 04:21:22,815
But it would be one thing but we haven't done that obviously

5046
04:21:23,839 --> 04:21:25,631
Deepened and intensified

5047
04:21:25,887 --> 04:21:27,935
The experience a lot since I was a

5048
04:21:28,191 --> 04:21:28,703
The kid

5049
04:21:29,471 --> 04:21:30,751
We just mentioned the

5050
04:21:31,007 --> 04:21:35,103
More realistic fake violence there is the real violence now online to contend with

5051
04:21:35,359 --> 04:21:38,175
The assassination and execution videos all that stuff you could see

5052
04:21:39,199 --> 04:21:39,967
But there's a

5053
04:21:40,223 --> 04:21:41,503
Temperature

5054
04:21:41,759 --> 04:21:44,319
Element now that wasn't involved back in the day

5055
04:21:45,087 --> 04:21:48,159
Yeah I just asking how watching the stuff affects people

5056
04:21:48,415 --> 04:21:51,999
Now you can ask how participating in it does in a virtual sense right

5057
04:21:52,511 --> 04:21:56,351
The first person shooter games come to mind but there's a lots of things out there

5058
04:21:56,863 --> 04:22:01,215
But do similar sorts of things in terms of immersing you in a fantasy world

5059
04:22:01,471 --> 04:22:04,287
And allowing you to behave in ways you would never behave

5060
04:22:04,543 --> 04:22:05,567
In the real world

5061
04:22:06,079 --> 04:22:08,127
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that

5062
04:22:10,687 --> 04:22:16,063
I know what these people think time should remain static and how would you have prevented this this is the experiment

5063
04:22:16,319 --> 04:22:17,087
People are affected by this

5064
04:22:17,599 --> 04:22:19,135
And so far I'd say

5065
04:22:19,391 --> 04:22:23,487
You know we're doing pretty well but it's such a short term Horizon I mean what's the

5066
04:22:23,743 --> 04:22:27,583
Computer error been like 20 years since that really took off

5067
04:22:29,631 --> 04:22:32,191
Thirty years I mean this is short-term Horizon stuff

5068
04:22:32,447 --> 04:22:33,727
Call me in a hundred years right

5069
04:22:34,239 --> 04:22:36,799
When we will have the ability to put you

5070
04:22:37,311 --> 04:22:39,359
Into any of these situations

5071
04:22:39,615 --> 04:22:41,919
We talked about that are really extreme

5072
04:22:42,175 --> 04:22:44,991
In an almost real sent to me how long until that's the case

5073
04:22:45,759 --> 04:22:46,527
Again

5074
04:22:46,783 --> 04:22:48,831
I don't see anything wrong with that either

5075
04:22:50,111 --> 04:22:52,671
And this is an extension of Storytelling

5076
04:22:53,439 --> 04:22:59,327
And its existence of the very beginning of Storytelling which was oral a long time before anybody ever wrote anything down

5077
04:23:01,375 --> 04:23:04,959
Pushing the same buttons in a more intense and realistic way

5078
04:23:05,215 --> 04:23:06,495
It is always been pushed

5079
04:23:08,031 --> 04:23:13,407
All you storytellers out there understand the pain raises the emotional stakes in the story

5080
04:23:13,663 --> 04:23:14,687
Human beings right

5081
04:23:15,199 --> 04:23:18,783
Whether we talked about emotional physical or even the kind of pain

5082
04:23:19,295 --> 04:23:21,087
That is The Fountainhead of Comedy

5083
04:23:23,391 --> 04:23:25,183
The great poker game of life is

5084
04:23:25,439 --> 04:23:26,207
Played with chip

5085
04:23:26,719 --> 04:23:28,255
The human pain and misery

5086
04:23:29,279 --> 04:23:30,303
And it is interest

5087
04:23:30,559 --> 04:23:31,583
Peking compelling

5088
04:23:32,863 --> 04:23:34,143
Tencent very dramatic

5089
04:23:34,911 --> 04:23:39,519
To watch somebody playing a high-stakes game even if you're not sitting in on it

5090
04:23:40,287 --> 04:23:40,799
Isn't that

5091
04:23:42,079 --> 04:23:42,591
Reading about

5092
04:23:42,847 --> 04:23:43,615
Dramatic character

5093
04:23:44,639 --> 04:23:48,223
Wild situations Reven historical figures

5094
04:23:48,735 --> 04:23:51,551
In the past I mean we're watching them play

5095
04:23:52,319 --> 04:23:53,599
Their poker game of life

5096
04:23:54,623 --> 04:23:55,903
And risking their chips

5097
04:23:56,415 --> 04:23:56,927
Pain

5098
04:23:57,695 --> 04:23:59,231
And you can't look away can you

5099
04:24:01,023 --> 04:24:04,607
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that either unless you find yourself

5100
04:24:05,119 --> 04:24:06,655
You know continually routing

5101
04:24:06,911 --> 04:24:08,191
For that person to lose

5102
04:24:09,727 --> 04:24:11,775
Just like I don't think there's anything wrong

5103
04:24:12,031 --> 04:24:18,175
With finding something like the Jesse Washington lynching situation from a hundred years ago fascinating and reading

5104
04:24:18,431 --> 04:24:19,455
Snap-on all you can on it

5105
04:24:21,503 --> 04:24:23,039
I really think he gets weird

5106
04:24:23,551 --> 04:24:27,391
If you say something like wow this is so interesting I really love

5107
04:24:27,647 --> 04:24:28,415
To see one of those

5108
04:24:30,975 --> 04:24:33,279
Could a revolution in sensibilities

5109
04:24:33,535 --> 04:24:34,047
Truly back

5110
04:24:34,303 --> 04:24:34,815
Track

5111
04:24:35,583 --> 04:24:36,095
That much

5112
04:24:38,399 --> 04:24:39,935
Another thought occurs to me

5113
04:24:40,447 --> 04:24:42,751
And that's what we talked about a long time ago on this day

5114
04:24:43,007 --> 04:24:46,335
Discussion that you know there's never been any blind taste test on this

5115
04:24:46,847 --> 04:24:48,895
In terms of making these statements about

5116
04:24:49,663 --> 04:24:51,711
What might happen Generations from now

5117
04:24:51,967 --> 04:24:55,551
It is slow poison of portrayed or real violence

5118
04:24:55,807 --> 04:24:59,391
Seeps into the body politic over several Generations in thaxted

5119
04:24:59,903 --> 04:25:03,487
Maybe we're already we're we're worried we might get to

5120
04:25:04,511 --> 04:25:07,327
If you say if we're not careful Generations from now they want to watch

5121
04:25:07,583 --> 04:25:10,143
Public executions who says we wouldn't now

5122
04:25:11,423 --> 04:25:13,983
I we mentioned earlier one of the theories on this whole thing is that

5123
04:25:14,495 --> 04:25:20,639
They never went out of fashion these public execution that this was a free market capitalistic content-related decision

5124
04:25:20,895 --> 04:25:22,431
And the audience got to decide

5125
04:25:22,687 --> 04:25:24,223
It never would have gone away maybe

5126
04:25:26,527 --> 04:25:29,087
Bounce that we were going to have the first

5127
04:25:29,599 --> 04:25:31,391
Public execution in the United

5128
04:25:31,647 --> 04:25:33,183
State since the 1930s

5129
04:25:34,207 --> 04:25:34,975
Put it in the sun

5130
04:25:36,255 --> 04:25:37,279
Centralized

5131
04:25:37,535 --> 04:25:38,303
Bigspot

5132
04:25:38,559 --> 04:25:40,607
Some scaffold in the middle of Las Vegas

5133
04:25:41,119 --> 04:25:41,887
Right near all the hotel

5134
04:25:43,167 --> 04:25:45,471
Do you think you'd be able to get a ringside seat

5135
04:25:46,495 --> 04:25:52,639
Can you be able to rent one of those rooms with a picture window of you down on the scaffold and one of the nearby hotels

5136
04:25:54,943 --> 04:25:55,455
I wonder

5137
04:25:55,711 --> 04:25:56,223
And

5138
04:25:56,479 --> 04:25:58,527
You know I think that there's a breakdown

5139
04:26:00,319 --> 04:26:01,087
Age that would have

5140
04:26:01,343 --> 04:26:06,975
I've been where you tap this first execution it be this groundbreaking event and everybody would be appalled and just

5141
04:26:07,231 --> 04:26:13,375
Outrage in there be a lot of public shaming you be sir Joshua Reynolds all over again in the media would be there but of course only to cover

5142
04:26:13,631 --> 04:26:17,727
You know the human depravity of the people that showed up to watch this acting are there any famous ones

5143
04:26:20,031 --> 04:26:20,799
What happens

5144
04:26:22,079 --> 04:26:26,687
With the next one in a war on public execution number three since the government reinstated public X

5145
04:26:26,943 --> 04:26:27,455
Vacations

5146
04:26:28,223 --> 04:26:30,271
I bet by then things start to

5147
04:26:30,783 --> 04:26:31,551
Melo

5148
04:26:32,063 --> 04:26:36,415
And once the public pressure relaxes cuz these things are much more common I bet the entire

5149
04:26:37,183 --> 04:26:37,951
Media

5150
04:26:38,463 --> 04:26:39,487
Approach shifts and we're not

5151
04:26:39,743 --> 04:26:40,255
Looking at

5152
04:26:40,511 --> 04:26:42,047
The crowd any longer in

5153
04:26:42,303 --> 04:26:46,143
Shaming them to the rest of the country we are in fact playing to that crowd

5154
04:26:46,655 --> 04:26:48,703
And I doing some man on the street interviews

5155
04:26:48,959 --> 04:26:52,031
You so did you know the person who's being broken on the wheel today here in Vegas

5156
04:26:53,055 --> 04:26:55,615
I realize that example sounds more like a dystopian

5157
04:26:55,871 --> 04:27:00,223
Movie script than it does any sort of reality but then I have to keep reminding myself listen

5158
04:27:00,735 --> 04:27:01,503
We can get

5159
04:27:01,759 --> 04:27:04,063
Hundreds of people in the world like 500 people died

5160
04:27:04,319 --> 04:27:05,855
It showed up to Ted Bundy's

5161
04:27:06,111 --> 04:27:08,415
Execution when he was put in the electric chair

5162
04:27:08,927 --> 04:27:10,975
Hundreds of people will show up to these things

5163
04:27:11,231 --> 04:27:13,535
When they're happening behind Prison Walls

5164
04:27:13,791 --> 04:27:14,815
Any can't see anything

5165
04:27:15,839 --> 04:27:18,911
Imagine how many more would show up if they could if the

5166
04:27:19,167 --> 04:27:22,495
Person conducting the execution said this guy is so bad that just has one time

5167
04:27:22,751 --> 04:27:24,543
We're going to move the execution back out in public

5168
04:27:25,055 --> 04:27:29,151
Can you imagine in the modern era how quickly that would spread on social media

5169
04:27:30,431 --> 04:27:32,991
Do you think you can get that 500 people that were there

5170
04:27:33,503 --> 04:27:36,063
To see an execution that they couldn't see

5171
04:27:36,575 --> 04:27:37,855
You think that would

5172
04:27:38,111 --> 04:27:41,695
Suelto something keeps could you beat the 20000 people that showed up

5173
04:27:42,207 --> 04:27:44,767
To the last public execution in the United States

5174
04:27:45,279 --> 04:27:46,303
And if you could

5175
04:27:46,815 --> 04:27:52,447
What does that tell you in terms of Trends right we could still pack of moon just as well as we could have in the 1930

5176
04:27:55,007 --> 04:27:57,055
What's it going to be an interesting human experiment

5177
04:27:57,567 --> 04:27:59,615
I tend to think and again my

5178
04:27:59,871 --> 04:28:00,895
Opinion on this

5179
04:28:01,151 --> 04:28:01,919
Just simply personal

5180
04:28:02,687 --> 04:28:03,711
I tend to think that

5181
04:28:04,223 --> 04:28:08,831
Maybe some of us are hardwired definitively one way or the other right give me my

5182
04:28:09,087 --> 04:28:12,415
Eye pain and suffering fictionalized cuz that's how I take it best

5183
04:28:12,927 --> 04:28:17,791
And other people that they know I want to see it real here I wanted to be real when I read my history books and no

5184
04:28:18,047 --> 04:28:24,191
But yes this historical figure suffered this way or I wanted Reno like I want to see it live I think there are people who are hardwired

5185
04:28:24,447 --> 04:28:27,007
One way the other than that I think there's a lot of us there probably

5186
04:28:27,519 --> 04:28:28,543
You know could go either way

5187
04:28:29,823 --> 04:28:34,431
Much more likely to be influenced by the culture we grow up in the times and what not I mean

5188
04:28:34,687 --> 04:28:40,319
You might not be hardwired to like watching animals chew people up in the arena but hey if everybody's going anyway

5189
04:28:40,575 --> 04:28:45,439
And I like the food there it's kind of fun and I have fun life I mean I think there's a lot of people that you know go along with

5190
04:28:45,695 --> 04:28:46,207
The crowd

5191
04:28:47,487 --> 04:28:49,023
So whereas we

5192
04:28:49,279 --> 04:28:53,631
In this particular era are going along with the crowd by being naturally empathetic

5193
04:28:53,887 --> 04:28:56,447
If the crowd changed or the times changed

5194
04:28:56,959 --> 04:29:00,031
I think it's a lot of people in the mushy middle that could go either way

5195
04:29:00,287 --> 04:29:05,151
And people that would never be caught dead in a live public execution today how gauche

5196
04:29:05,919 --> 04:29:07,967
Might change their minds if you know

5197
04:29:08,735 --> 04:29:09,759
You got trendy again

5198
04:29:10,527 --> 04:29:11,039
Leica

5199
04:29:12,063 --> 04:29:13,343
Bell Bottom Jeans

5200
04:29:20,511 --> 04:29:22,815
Do you want a good stuff that was left on The Cutting Room floor

5201
04:29:23,071 --> 04:29:23,583
Floor

5202
04:29:24,095 --> 04:29:24,863
Can we put that

5203
04:29:25,375 --> 04:29:25,887
Show together

5204
04:29:27,423 --> 04:29:28,191
Is amazing

5205
04:29:28,447 --> 04:29:30,751
Because there's just so much stuff that when you're reading it

5206
04:29:31,007 --> 04:29:31,519
Your eyes just get

5207
04:29:32,031 --> 04:29:32,543
WYD

5208
04:29:32,799 --> 04:29:33,567
