1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
What you're about to hear is part 3

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,096
A multi-part series on the first World War

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:10,752
If you're one of those individual that likes to know the story before the story you might want to catch up on those if you missed either

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
One of them

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:17,920
Although some of you probably don't mind just being dropped into the middle of a story like you arrived in the time machine and yet to figure things out

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
If you're one of those kind of individuals

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,552
And who cares about those earlier to shows why don't you just Jump On In

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
And join the horror in Prague

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Grass

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
We blueprint for Armageddon

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Part 3

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,328
December 7th 1941

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
A date which will live

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
In infamy

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,336
Eats history

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
The events

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
The figure it out

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Call nist time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein Berliner

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall

20
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know

21
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Whether or not their President should question

22
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,328
We are not descended from fearful men

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,168
It's hardcore history

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
The very same WeChat

25
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
The first world war breaks out

26
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
August

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
1940

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
A British Expedition

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
Leaves British Waters and heads for the South

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Walpole

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Antarctica

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
Led by guy named Ernest shot

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,512
Shackleton is one of the people that's normally associated with the very tail end

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
What called the age of Discovery the age of exploration

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
And you know what the tail end because

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
You don't like guys like Christopher Columbus Shackleton and his crew have camera

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
1914 you bring a camera with you

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,872
And he's able to document in photographs

39
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,224
Real clear interesting photographs this ordeal that he's about to experience

40
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
As he's on his way to

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,440
He's keeping tabs on this war that's broken out right when you left mean

42
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,816
This is the first real. Of globalization in the world and he can keep track via Telegraph of the

43
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Minnesota major events that are going on

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
And like everyone

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
Shackleton is appalled by the scale

46
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,848
You can't believe the amount of casualties the number of people with challenges involved in logistics

47
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
It feels like this flame that is burning at an unbelievable intensity

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
So everybody just assumed that couldn't

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Continue

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Better than the Assumption even before the war

51
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,696
Broke out the Kaiser family says to his departing troops you be home before the leaves fall

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,608
When the French military leader Joseph Shaffer is told that his troops should be issued metal helmets to replace those cloth

53
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
At their starting the war with

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
He said don't bother

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
You'll never reach the

56
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
For the war is over

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
But there's a real feeling that

58
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Something that's

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
Operating at that level of intensity can't continue for very long

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Before Shackleton get to find out how the whole thing is though

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Ian has

62
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
Ship and his crew get trapped in the ice

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
In the Antarctic

64
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
And again photos

65
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
It's wonderful

66
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,536
You get to watch the ship as it's crushed by the ice and Shackled get out and basically live

67
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
On the ice floes while they wait to be rescued

68
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Which is not happening fast enough

69
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
And you can see that his people are going to die out there

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
If somebody doesn't do the Really Brave thing and take one of the little boats another 20-25 foot

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
Turn off the big boat

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
Amounting to almost an open rowboat not quite but almost

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
And he had a few crew members get in it

74
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
And head out

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Into the Arctic

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Waters

77
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Looking for land

78
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,768
It's insane you think about it and it's insane that he survived

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Anime 1916 Henley's couple of guys that he set out

80
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
You know into the Arctic

81
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,751
With amazing stories of of towering waves and all these things

82
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Stumble into

83
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Isolated

84
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Whaling station

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
South Georgia Island

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Which normally most of us would think is penguin territory it must have seemed positively balmy to

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Shackleton and his crew

88
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Who by this time look like

89
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Bigfoot

90
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
Or something like a missing link

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
Totally sunburned

92
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
The Beards on their faces Frozen and

93
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Icicles hanging off them

94
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
They were originally wearing animal skins but those skins did not like the saltwater very much ahead molted and marotta

95
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Smelled and

96
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Falling off of them I mean

97
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:06,175
The first thing they do when they get to this whaling station to scare the heck out of two boys

98
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
Couple of 12 year old or something see them first and

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Go off running and who could blame them

100
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
Eventually though the adults Come Running

101
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,463
Shackleton identifies himself he's taken into be sort of restored given water

102
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
And I guess you could

103
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
It's a debrief

104
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
We're told one of the first questions he asks

105
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Is benefactor

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
It's for an update on whatever happened with the war he was following

107
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Inches tell me

108
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
When was the world

109
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
And in one of the more famous

110
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:41,503
Responses you'll ever get about this cuz it says so much in a couple of sentences and that's why I've gone down

111
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,599
In history the benefactor supposed to have answered his when was the war over question with

112
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
The war is over

113
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Millions are dead

114
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Europe is mad

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
The world is Matt

116
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Shackleton react to this news

117
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
With horrified disbelief

118
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
And he's just catching up

119
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
The rest of the world

120
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Because no one can believe

121
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:09,407
At the level of intensity that this conflict displays from minute one

122
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Can be sustained

123
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
Remember this war starts very differently than the Second World War

124
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
The second world war kind of ramps up slowly

125
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,719
The first world war is like someone pulling the pin on a grenade and everything explodes at once

126
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Everyone attacks it

127
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
There are a lot more people

128
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
Killed in the first month of the first World War

129
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
In the first month of the sack

130
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
In fact so many people are killed

131
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
But the people living through this. Have nothing to compare this to

132
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
The numbers are off the charts

133
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
I mean look at what

134
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
They were looking at is normal casual

135
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,087
By the way this is considered to be horrible could be bad it could be like the russo-japanese war

136
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
On steroids couldn't it

137
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,951
That war happened two decades before the first World War

138
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Lasted 18 months

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Is seen as sort of the testing ground for a lot of the weapons intact

140
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Fixing everything that would be used in the next War

141
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,751
An 18-month 265000 people are killed it's horrible

142
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
165000 people are killed in a week or two

143
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
In the first World War

144
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
20 mm Frenchman die in a day

145
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
In August 1914

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
There are no metrics

147
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
For that

148
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Are you American history

149
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Fans out there

150
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
What's the worst war in American history

151
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
The US Civil War right

152
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Because everyone who dies is an American

153
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Casualty

154
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Last 4 years

155
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,167
It was between 600000 and 700000 Americans killed

156
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
That's how many people you lose killed roughly

157
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
In the first month

158
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,567
Of the first World War

159
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Everyone is done

160
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
And it's not just

161
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,063
Generals and world leaders and everything that say that this war can't last you have some of the top economic mines in the world

162
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Singapore economic reasons that can't continue

163
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
John Maynard Keynes

164
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
The guy who will later be the father of Keynesian economics

165
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,303
Sajan 1914 that the world won't Last a year

166
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
As soon as the financial liquidity dries up he says

167
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
All the belligerents will be forced

168
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
To come to terms and make peace

169
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
It could have been more wrong

170
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
Countries will ditch the gold standard almost immediately they'll inflate their currency

171
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Dell open up lines of credit will start borrowing

172
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
Lord Horatio Kitchener britons

173
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Warminster one of the few people who understood how

174
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
Along this world would really in the last said quote

175
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,023
No Financial pressure has ever stopped a war in progress

176
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
And quote

177
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Kitchener understood

178
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
But many of these people who should have understood better didn't

179
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,799
And that's that we had entered the era where nation-states could really take a punch

180
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
We talked about that in an earlier episode as a mixed blessing

181
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
It means

182
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
That you don't

183
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,295
Succumb to the enemies attacks right away but it means you also last longer

184
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,415
When you last longer you see your human and your financial capital

185
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Ground into powder

186
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
There are a lot of

187
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
People who Wonder

188
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
Whether it was actually a benefit

189
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
For the French and the British to win the battle of the Marne

190
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
That's where we left off the last program

191
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
The battle of the Marne at the time was seen as

192
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
You know the savior of France

193
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
The Germans with their pre-war battle plans with her meticulous Precision planning that it had decades to come up with

194
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
The perfecting this plan

195
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Stage fail

196
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
At the Battle of the Marne when

197
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,255
When by the time the other than the crowning moment happens where everything rests on what the Germans are doing

198
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
What sides are like a couple of Punch-Drunk Prizefighter

199
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
When using that

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
Analogy for this whole conflict because it works so well

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
And up until

202
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
You know the French and British victory at the Marne

203
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,127
The Germans have been the one really dishing out the heavy blows

204
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
But everyone is so tired and at the end of their rope by the time tomorrow and happens only a month into the conflict

205
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Did you get the feeling like

206
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
The end of the first round of the both Fighters have given everything they have in there so tired that if anybody could just Land once

207
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Solid blow on either side Italy over

208
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
In the French and the British land that blow

209
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
And the Germans are

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Forced

211
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Backward

212
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Air Force backward

213
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
So that they can

214
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Reorganize their life

215
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Sand close up

216
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
This dangerous hole

217
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
In Airline

218
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,319
That was exploited by French and British troops as Churchill famously said is only he can

219
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Those troops were

220
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Probing their way into the German liver

221
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
And it's a

222
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,095
Classic maneuver to try to pull your troops back and reorganize your line when it's also a dangerous

223
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
And it also means

224
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
That the Germans have given up on the silk

225
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Call Schlieffen Plan

226
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
I find it interesting sometimes when you read

227
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Some of the histories

228
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
The first World War

229
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,991
You will find yourself in a very similar situation

230
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Did the commanders on both sides

231
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
Of the western what will become the Western Front

232
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
And that is

233
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,743
You'll be studying this as though you're playing around with

234
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Toy soldiers

235
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,679
I mean I'll read stuff with Hillside in this division did this and pulled back to here and then you're totally losing track

236
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Of the human element

237
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
And the problem with that is if you don't understand the condition of the people on the ground

238
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
You're going to create all sorts of plans

239
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
It don't take into account what they can actually carry out

240
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
I mean for example

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
The general staff

242
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
Of all these armies

243
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,183
Are tens of miles behind where the fighting is I mean

244
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:46,303
Most of them the German general staff example are sitting in wonderful French chateau

245
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,655
With roaring fireplaces drinking wine out of crystal

246
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,799
Glasses and playing with maps and little protractors trying to decide where to move people and what to do with them

247
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
And the British and the French commanders are often doing the same thing

248
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
The problem is is that these little

249
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
Protractors in these armies that they're moving around on maps

250
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
Bear no resemblance

251
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
To what the human beings on the ground or dealing with

252
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
The human beings on the ground or spent

253
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Both sides

254
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
Have worn themselves down to the nub

255
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
I can hardly function anymore I mean this is the point in the war once the German start retreating after the battle of the Marne

256
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
Where the British and French commanders think they've got them on the Run

257
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Sir John French the British commander

258
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
Thanks but he's going to be in Berlin in 6 weeks it's going to be over will unleash the Cavalry will launch this massive Pursuit will just

259
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Who are the enemy whose routing and it'll be all over

260
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,927
The problem is a Sir John French's troops are in no condition to do that

261
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
In fact

262
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Every side is finding out

263
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Another one of the new realities of Modern Warfare

264
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,911
And that's that they use ammunition at a pace

265
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
But nobody was prepared for

266
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
At this point in the conflict

267
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Everybody is actually rationing

268
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
The

269
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Artillery

270
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,759
We can't even use the guns the way they want to because they don't have enough Sheldon take the Russians as a perfect example

271
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
At this point in the war

272
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
The Russians are producing

273
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
35000 artillery shells a month

274
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Sounds great doesn't it

275
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Can you realize that once the fighting actually starts

276
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
They're using 45,000 shells

277
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
A day

278
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Making 35000 a month

279
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
Shooting off 45000 shells a day

280
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,943
Now all these armies went into the conflict with nice reserves the shells

281
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
The buy a month-and-a-half into it

282
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,343
They're down to almost nothing and even the French and the British

283
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
You know as they pursued the German Army's at the German Army's Retreat from the Marne

284
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
They can't

285
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Function the way that they're

286
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
Trained and ready to do so they have to ration everything and so does the German

287
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,655
And everybody's just at the end of their rope

288
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
And you lose the human element when you study the history of things from the very highest levels in the moving of armies around

289
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
On maps when you see arrows and

290
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
Calvary armies in all these kinds of things when the people on the ground

291
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
How many

292
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Keep me different situation

293
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Here's how

294
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
Ryder GJ Meyer describes

295
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,343
In the situation after the Marne quote

296
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
The French and British so jubilant at and in many cases astonished by the German withdrawal from the Marne

297
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
We're badly battered

298
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Worn out

299
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
I'm running low on a Central Equipment

300
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
Many were almost too exhausted to move

301
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
He's quoting an English Soldier now

302
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
Quote after 5 days and nights of fighting

303
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
1 English Soldier Road

304
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Decimated spent and hungry

305
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,967
We are lying on the bare Earth with only one desire in our hearts

306
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
To get ourselves killed

307
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Meijer continue

308
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
And they were short of shells for their artillery

309
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
It is one measure of the sustained intensity of this new kind of warfare that the French faced critical shortages of Amy

310
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,583
Ignition for their 75 mm Cannon their most effective field artillery piece

311
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
Because only ten thousand rounds were being produced per day

312
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
That was barely 20% of the knee

313
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
He continues

314
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,079
For any number of such reasons the armies of the entendre

315
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
The allies

316
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Failed to close with the retreating Germans

317
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Or exploit the huge gap that had prompted there withdrawal they did not attack in force until the German first second and third eye

318
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Armies had settled into fortified position

319
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
On High Ground north of the Ain

320
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
The next East-West River North of the Marne

321
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
By then it was too late

322
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
And quote

323
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
The Germans themselves were not horrible

324
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
German Soldier

325
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
Julia skoczen writes about the retreat from the Marne

326
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Quote

327
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
The streets were badly worn

328
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
Abandoned vehicles were lying on the sides of the road

329
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
We began to move at 3 in the morning and before we were fully aware of what was happening we found ourselves with the rear

330
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Guard regiments of Infantry

331
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
Shot to Pieces arrived in a pitiful condition

332
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
Stay at Castaway their knapsacks and all unnecessary impediments

333
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
And we're trying to get along as fast as possible

334
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,399
Soon after the first shrapnel of the enemy began to burst above our heads

335
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Which caused us to accelerate our March continually

336
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
The road we could also been used during the advance

337
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,175
Was still marked by Deep shell holes that were filled with water to the very edge for it rained without interruption

338
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
It was pitch dark and every now and then someone would fall into one of those shell holes

339
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
We were all wet through but continue to press on

340
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,463
Some would stumble over something in the dark but nobody paid any attention

341
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
The great thing was to get along

342
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,119
Dead horses in men lay in the middle of the road but nobody took the trouble to remove the obstacle

343
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
And quote

344
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
Lest we forget about the human element remember that these Germans

345
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,383
Are moving through country that was formerly occupied by civilians

346
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Where the heck are they

347
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Well

348
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
In a lot of cases

349
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
They're still there

350
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
In very great Danger

351
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Here's what coaching

352
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
About that quote

353
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,719
The road was covered with the equipment the soldiers that thrown away

354
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,559
We too would long ago cast aside all unnecessary ballast

355
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,911
Dust we were marching when we passed a wood densely packed with refugees

356
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
Does hunted people have stretch blankets between the trees

357
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
So it's to protect themselves from the rain

358
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
There they were lying in the greatest conceivable misery

359
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
All in the jumble

360
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Men and women

361
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Children and greybeards

362
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Their Camp reached as far as the road and one could observe the terrible hours that they lived through had left

363
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Deep furrows in their faces

364
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
They looked at us with weary tired eyes

365
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
The children begged us to give them some bread

366
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
But we had nothing whatsoever left

367
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
And wear ourselves tormented by hunger

368
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055
The enemy shrapnel was still accompanying us and we have scarcely left the wood when shrapnel began to explode

369
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
They're which caused the refugees now exposed to the fire to crowd into the field in an attempt to reach

370
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Beach safety

371
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,367
Many of them joined us but before long they were forbidden to use the road because they competed The Retreat of the troops

372
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,719
That's all of them were driven Without Pity into the fields soaked by the rain

373
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
And quote

374
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,399
As German soldiers like Julius or usually escutcheon are

375
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Retreating

376
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Back the way they came

377
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
They're being closely pursued by their French and British officer

378
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,455
One of whom is the Irish Soldier fighting in the British expeditionary force that we talked about earlier John Lucy

379
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Right about this time quote

380
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
Advanced continued steadily as the Germans were driven back from the Marne

381
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
The rear guard showed some resistance everyday

382
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,279
And occasionally we picked up stragglers and wounded from the enemy Army

383
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,887
Although we took our turn in our Brigade at Advanced Garden Outpost duties

384
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,495
Our Battalion did not really Crossed Swords With the Enemy again until the 14th of September

385
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
On that day

386
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,335
And on the few days preceding it rain fell

387
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,967
And we were not very comfortable either in big Wacker on the line of March the weather began to get cold

388
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,807
On the evening of 13th September at British airplane

389
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
One of the few the British army possessed

390
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Approached from the German side

391
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,511
And Wheeling around a lighted in a field to the right of our marching columns

392
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,583
The flying officer climb slowly out of his machine

393
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
And coming stumbling towards us in his heavy kit

394
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
Did not wait to find an officer

395
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
But shouted to us all

396
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,847
There they are waiting for you up there thousands of them

397
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,967
Anyway just right arm toward the wooded Heights across the river Ames I'm 3 miles away

398
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
And quote

399
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
The riveraine

400
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Was right by

401
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
The highest

402
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
Elevated point in this whole area

403
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
On the front

404
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Now it's not very high

405
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
In terms of the grand scheme of geography around the planet but in the very flat area near the French and Belgian border

406
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
It was 500 ft tall and some places

407
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
And that gave a commanding View

408
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
Of all the flat country around it

409
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
This is the point that the German soldiers have been told

410
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
To turn back around

411
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
And face their pursuers

412
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
And Dig Inn

413
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
And stop

414
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,671
This has been one of the last commands made

415
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,535
By the former German Commander the one whose job it was to carry out the Schlieffen Plan

416
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
Helmuth Von moltke the younger

417
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Totally collapsed from his nervous breakdown

418
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
After his plan failed

419
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
He's replaced by one of his critics

420
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
A controversial choice that the Kaiser

421
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
InnoTab

422
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
The guy name

423
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
General Eric

424
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm talking High

425
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
Now one thing that becomes clear

426
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
When you look at the high command of all these arms

427
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,023
Is the generals have outrageous egos most of the time

428
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,327
And they often are jealous

429
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
And a snipe at their peers

430
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,007
Ameren falkenhayn is named it angers among other people Erich ludendorff this

431
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,383
Young wunderkind who's been doing great things for the Germans on the Eastern front and who will say of

432
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Vulcan Hines

433
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Appointment

434
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
I'm only capable of love

435
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
And Hate

436
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
I hate General falkenhayn

437
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
Valkenhayn was critical of

438
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Minolta

439
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
Before the battle of the Marne even starts

440
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,096
Valkenhayn looks at what Von molcas doing and thinks he's lost his mind

441
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
And rights

442
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,936
On September 5th 1914 quote

443
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,008
Our general staff is completely lost its head

444
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,872
Sleeping's notes do not help any further and so molcas wits come to an end

445
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
And quote

446
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
All the Kaiser must have read that and decided

447
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
It's in Van molka couldn't

448
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Pull this off

449
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Maybe one of his critics can

450
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Falkenhayn

451
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
Turns his troops around tell them to dig in and begins looking for replacements for the people who died

452
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Because the German Army is a fraction of what it was

453
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Just a couple of weeks before

454
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
They aren't the only ones

455
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
The British and the French armies have a similar problem

456
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
Are all decimate

457
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,872
The difference is Britain and France have colonies

458
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
And Dominion

459
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
A commonwealth Nations

460
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,344
Who the minute the war starts are basically told to get people over there and their arriving everyday

461
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,976
The British have Indian troops from India arrived in Canadian show up very quickly

462
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
The Scots

463
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,864
From Scotland are always a part of the British forces and they arrive in kilts

464
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,264
And this is where they will get their famous nickname which some people wonder if it even happened this way

465
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
But it's too good of a nickname to

466
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
You're not mentioned

467
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
The Germans supposedly call them the ladies from hell

468
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
Because of the Kilts they were

469
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,576
Where and they're all showing up every day in greater numbers and taking their place in the line

470
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
To replace the dead in the wounded

471
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,184
The French are bringing troops from North Africa

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
From Morocco and Algeria and troops from

473
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,328
Central Africa and places like Senegal so you have

474
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Dark skinned black Africans in the French army

475
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,240
Something that the Germans won are not accustomed to

476
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
And to a little dismayed about because they think about all of the black Africans left in Africa

477
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
That maybe could be brought

478
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
To fight against them to

479
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
When the Germans try to reinforce their own

480
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
Torn open ranks

481
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
They have to do it with German

482
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Now they have a bunch of them

483
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
People who demand that the war was declared signed up

484
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,632
I join the forces and we're in training this whole time the problem is that the war is only about 6 weeks old

485
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,264
None of these people have had enough training to make them anywhere near as good as the soldier they're trying to replace

486
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
The falkenhayn calls them up anyway

487
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,432
The situation is desperate the war could be lost right here right now

488
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
And every man is needed

489
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,576
And all these troops are going to be thrown into the Bloodbath

490
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
Amir the French and Belgian border

491
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
It's at that spot where the Germans have turned around

492
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
Halted the retreat

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
That has been going on ever since the battle of the Marne

494
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
Taking the Heights on the other side of the river Ain

495
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
And began to dig in

496
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Fortify

497
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
Re-equip reinforce

498
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
And are waiting for their pursuers to show up

499
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
Are French and British pursuers

500
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,712
Assume that they are going after a bunch of Rowdy German

501
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,832
They're not expecting to run into heavily fortified positions in a very very strong spot

502
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
Remember John Lucy in the bef are Marching toward that area

503
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:33,280
When the airplane lands in the field in the pilot goes running up to the British March column saying

504
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
They're waiting for you thousands of them on the other side of the river

505
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
I'm a night of September 13th 1914

506
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
The French and the British try cross that River

507
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
And dislodge the Germans from the height

508
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
I need to design

509
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
The British do this Crossing At Night

510
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
In heavy fog

511
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
Pontoon boats for the most part

512
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
I get to the other side

513
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:01,696
A side that has no natural covering its facing Unifour to 500 Foothills in the distance

514
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Heavily wooded

515
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
And the sun comes up

516
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
And burns off the fog

517
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Leaving the British troops totally exposed

518
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
And the Germans slaughtered

519
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,264
Artillery machine guns even from the flank

520
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,336
The British stagger back across the river

521
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,664
And their Commander Sir John French orders them to dig in

522
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
And face the Germans were dug in on the other side of the river

523
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
This is the main thing your history books will tell you

524
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,696
Did the first battle of the aisne is known for its supposedly the time

525
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
When trench warfare was initiated

526
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,120
This will be the most iconic and memorable part of the first World War

527
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,984
But it's a misnomer to suggest the trench warfare just started here

528
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
Because given the technology of the day

529
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,432
Trench warfare begins organically it's a natural human response to the fact

530
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,552
The air above ground level is filled with so much steel and Lead

531
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
But it's suicide

532
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
To be out in the open

533
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Across the entire front

534
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
Stretching all the way from the

535
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
Swiss border

536
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,864
Across the entire franco-german border up through Luxembourg up into Belgium

537
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,704
More than 400 miles in millions of men on both sides long

538
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,288
Human beings have done the most natural thing

539
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Possible

540
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
They've gone to ground

541
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
And they've tried to get as low as possible to escape

542
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
What aren't General will call the storm of Steel

543
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Later in the war

544
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,856
In addition to digging down there throw up things called breastwork

545
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Switches

546
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
Putting stuff in front of your position to

547
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
Stop the bullets

548
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,328
If you're lucky it's sandbags if you're not lucky is anything you can get your hands on

549
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,888
The combination of digging in the Earth

550
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
And putting up barriers in front of you begins to fortify the entire line on both sides and in some spots.

551
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Germans in the French

552
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
Are only a couple hundred yards from each other

553
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,712
The fortification of the entire line

554
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Changes this war

555
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,368
In ways that the generals on either side or unprepared for they don't know what to do

556
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
So they go back to the

557
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
In training

558
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
What would you say

559
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Find a flight

560
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Turn the flank

561
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Attack in the rear

562
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,496
The problem is is that there's only one tiny little area of this more than 400 Mile Line

563
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,592
We're in heaven calcified into an almost seizure like situation

564
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
And that's the area be

565
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Between

566
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,968
In this battle at the river and that is just happened

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
And the ocean

568
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
To the north

569
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
It's not very big

570
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Zone

571
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
And both the British and the French on one side and the Germans on the other

572
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Begin a

573
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Crab like

574
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Dance of Death

575
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
As one historian

576
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Describes it

577
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,120
Trying to probe their way towards Open Country

578
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
For a very long time

579
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
This was known as the race to the Sea

580
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
But historians have come to hate that term because

581
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
He gives the false idea that somehow

582
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
Reaching the sea is the goal

583
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
All about the sides with in fact

584
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
If both sides reach the sea

585
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
It means that there are no flanks anymore

586
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
And there will be several

587
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
Big battles between

588
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
The armies as they collide

589
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
In their attempt to find an open flame to turn

590
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Now

591
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:24,960
It's worth pointing out here that won't worry about experiences the most complicated War

592
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
I've ever studied

593
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
And it's a very unusual conflict because in many cases

594
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
The battlefield is not going to change

595
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,016
This area up near the franco-belgian border for example is going to become

596
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
One of the worst

597
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
Killing ground extended Killing Grounds in all human history

598
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Later in the war

599
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Troops marching up to this Battle Ground will be able to smell it

600
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Before they actually get there

601
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
In addition

602
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:58,496
When one side attacks the other side will often counter-attack so if you look at the battle on a map

603
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,872
It makes no sense at all I've got 400 page books that deal with just single encounters

604
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,712
Between the two sides and it's impossible to make heads or tails of it

605
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Even with maps even if you're an expert

606
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
I'm part of the reason why because the nature of battle has changed

607
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
Armies are staying in contact with each other

608
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,584
That's very different than through most of human history through most of human history Armies come together there's a short Sharp

609
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Clash and then they

610
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
Break contact and move in opposite directions again

611
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,520
Battles that last more than one day are extremely rare

612
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Up until this time.

613
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
All of a sudden

614
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,152
These armies aren't going to break

615
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
They're going to stay

616
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,808
On opposite sides of a short little no man's land and hold each other by the

617
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
The throat

618
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Even on so-called

619
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,512
Quiet parts of the front hundreds or thousands of men can be killed every day

620
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
Now this is not unheard of

621
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Near the

622
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
End stages of the US Civil War

623
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
Ulysses S Grant a northern General

624
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,104
Will have a similar strategy where he maintains contact with the Enemy grab them by the throat doesn't let them go

625
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
Island grinds them down the strategy of attrition

626
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
But that's new

627
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
The European experience

628
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
And neither side's giving up yet they're going to try

629
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,392
Define that blank until there is no flying anymore

630
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,512
That race to the Sea will involve several more big battles including one that involves

631
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,584
You know what's left of the poor Belgian Army

632
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:32,448
Remember the Belgian Army was what the Germans thought we're going to be a bunch of chocolate soldiers

633
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,752
And instead they put up this heroic

634
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
Doom resistance to them

635
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
Enough fighting and being pushed backwards every step of the way

636
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Once the Germans

637
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
Replay on their lines at the riveraine

638
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
Their entire

639
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,576
Blank is threatened by the parts of Belgium that haven't fallen to them yet

640
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
Including the Giant and vital Port City of Antwerp

641
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
So this is when the Germans go take all that

642
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
A pound and work with those same enormous guns that they destroyed the Belgian forts with at the beginning of the war

643
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:08,288
And they pushed the Belgian Army all the ways that the belgians are sitting there with their backs to the ocean

644
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
There's no place left to run

645
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
And the Belgian King is with them and at one point he orders his officers to stand behind the trenches and shoot anybody

646
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:22,880
Belgian soldiers that their run away and they stay there being pounded by the artillery

647
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Until they can't

648
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Stop

649
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
The Germans

650
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
They realized

651
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
If they don't hold that area

652
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:34,400
The Germans are going to be the one who find that open flanken the turn the British and the French in this is

653
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,544
You the part of the war where it looks like the Germans might actually reverse the entire Battle of the Marne results

654
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
And went anyway

655
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
To the belgians do

656
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Something that is

657
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
Are there nuclear option

658
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Huntington

659
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,832
It's a sacrifice that might have saved the war for the allies

660
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,440
Remember Belgium is one of those areas of Europe it is actually

661
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,768
For the most part this part of Flanders that were talking about in Belgium

662
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Below sea level

663
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
And the reason that it even exists because

664
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
In Forever the belgians have been pumping out water and building dikes

665
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
And things like that to keep the ocean out

666
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
In the Belgian When Things become desperate to the point of Doomsday

667
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
Blows up the dikes

668
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,040
The Belgian King makes the decision to let the sea water in

669
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
October 22nd

670
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,952
It's a true sacrifice because he's not just flooding one of the more fertile parts of his country

671
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
He's plotting it with seawater

672
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:37,632
And the saltwater will do terrible damage to the fertility of the region remember the Roman supposedly

673
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
Would so salt into the ground

674
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Of the territory of their very worst enemies

675
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
So that nothing would ever grow there again

676
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
The belgians have done this to themselves

677
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
Voluntarily

678
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
To protect

679
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
The very end

680
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
End of the Allied line and keep the Germans from breaking through and perhaps taking the channel

681
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,488
The Germans have no idea what's going on at the water level rises

682
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
But within a couple of days

683
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,376
There's a five mile wide shoulder deep lake

684
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
Separating them

685
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,752
And the Belgian forces and the belgians will stay behind that like 4 years

686
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
That essentially shuts off.

687
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Part of the front

688
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Bad news for the other Allied Forces

689
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,968
Is it now that the Germans didn't need those troops to try to

690
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
Deal with the belgians they turn them around

691
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,368
And threw them into the developing battle at a place called Ypres

692
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
Which on October 22nd breaks out big-time

693
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
And

694
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
You tried to come to this point where

695
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
The true

696
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Futility

697
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Of the wasting of life

698
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
Is so aptly

699
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,776
Because of course war is all about spending live

700
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
To achieve a goal

701
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,408
The tragedy happens when you spend lies for no good reason

702
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
Eat Pray you begin to see the kinds of

703
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
Tragic level

704
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
That this will reach

705
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
A large number of the troops

706
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
The Germans had called up

707
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Inwood very little training

708
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
We're Young

709
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Students

710
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,816
Whose teachers had indoctrinated them into the idea of

711
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
This is what you do when you fight for Germany and what a great honor it's going to be you know when they would all join up together as students with

712
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,520
Fraternity Badges and all these things in

713
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,848
After very little training they were thrown into this combat

714
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,944
That was developing around the city of Ypres and the surrounding area

715
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
And one of the really tragic

716
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Parts of

717
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Conflict

718
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
The students would run up against

719
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
What was left

720
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,744
Some of the greatest military units in the world

721
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
What was left

722
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
The old British professional Army

723
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Which has been

724
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,240
Ground down new ever since the war started but still had some of its best units intact

725
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
These

726
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
Badly trained

727
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,176
16 17 and 18 year old kids

728
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Would be Massacre

729
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
For no good reason

730
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
As author Winston groom right

731
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Lights quote

732
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
On the front of nearly 20 miles

733
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,096
Tens of thousands of men came to grips and did their best to murder each other in the cold tank

734
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
Misty Hills surrounding April

735
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
In many places the fighting was hand-to-hand

736
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
That morning

737
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
Divisions of the German 4th Army

738
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,336
Consisting in large part of students

739
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Attacked the British line such as it was

740
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,272
In a fitted binary and frenzy the German students came on arm and arm

741
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,088
Are waving their rifles in the air singing

742
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
And with their spikes

743
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Pickle halba helmet

744
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Festooned with flowers

745
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
By the thousands they were shot down

746
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Even though they outnumber the British at times 6 to 1 that morning they face the most professional

747
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Elite regiments of the British army

748
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
If not the world

749
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
The black watch

750
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
Coldstream guards

751
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Scotchgard

752
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Cameron

753
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Grenadier guards

754
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Irish guards

755
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Stafford

756
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Gordon Highlanders

757
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Green Howards

758
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
Royal Scots fusiliers

759
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
Welsh fusiliers and others almost too numerous to mention including the huszar's and dragoons of the Cavalry Court

760
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,304
When was all over the British official history estimated

761
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
At least half of these youthful Teutonic Warriors

762
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
100000 of them have been shot down

763
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,520
The Germans name the battle the massacre of the Innocents

764
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
And quote

765
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
In German it was the kindermourn

766
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
And after the war

767
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Parents of some of these children

768
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
Would put a poignant Monument

769
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Over there Mass grave

770
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
Showing a weeping father and mother

771
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
Looking out over the mass Graves festooned

772
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,768
With the fraternity pin

773
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Of these young kids

774
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
Who thought War

775
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
What's going to be a romantic hero I could venture

776
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
I'm not going to focus

777
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
On Battle after

778
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
The battle after

779
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
The Battle of point

780
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
What's conflict

781
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Story

782
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
It's a complicated

783
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
And

784
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
Detailed enough conflict did you kind of have to pick your battles

785
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Pardon the pun

786
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
And it's a human side of this affair

787
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Taiwan

788
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
Focus on what the people who were living through it

789
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Woodforest to expiry

790
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
For example

791
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
20 year old

792
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Herbert sulzbach

793
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,264
A gunner who joined up as the war starts

794
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
I was getting his first taste of battle

795
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
As the Battle of Ypres

796
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Begins

797
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Lights quote

798
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Change of position

799
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
We pull forward

800
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
Get our first glimpse of this battle

801
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
And have to get used to the terrible scenes in impressions

802
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Corpses corpses and more Corp

803
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
Rubble in the remains of a captured Village

804
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,048
Trenches hastily dug by the British or full of bodies

805
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,888
We get driven out of this position by infantry and artillery fire

806
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,472
We stand beside the guns with the horses in a dreadful night

807
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
Comes down on

808
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,312
We've seen too many horrible things all at once

809
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
They make a very strong impression on us

810
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
Barely twenty years old as we are

811
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
But these things also Harden us up

812
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
What's going to come

813
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
And quote

814
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
He's not the only one

815
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
Another German

816
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
Rights to his sweetheart

817
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:29,120
With care for her sensibilities and understanding of what military censorship might do to his letter

818
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
About with the reality of what he's experiencing is like

819
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
He writes

820
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
During these battles

821
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
In Flanders

822
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Quote

823
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
My dear Maria

824
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,152
I feel so terrible I'd really rather not write to you

825
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,040
That doesn't mean I've forgotten you though every day spent here makes it clear to me how beautiful home is

826
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
What a crowd of feelings that word home

827
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Brings out in me

828
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
I've lived through such horror recently

829
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,976
No words can describe it

830
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
The tragedy all around me

831
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,096
Everyday the fighting gets fiercer and there's no end in sight

832
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Our blood is flowing in Torrance

833
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
When I think of our 247th regiment

834
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
My eyes swim with tears

835
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:11,104
The first and second battalions have only 250 to 300 men left

836
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
Some more than half are gone

837
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,224
Today only a few of my comrades will be still standing

838
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
My company Commander

839
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Lieutenant Moss power

840
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,112
I've been at the front for one hour when he was shot through the head

841
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Pale and close to death

842
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
He was carried past me

843
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Today

844
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Sunday

845
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,536
I started this modest grave and joined in prayer

846
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
That's how it is

847
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,376
All around me the most gruesome devastation

848
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Dead and wounded soldiers

849
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,800
Dead and dying animals horse cadavers burnt-out houses dug up fields

850
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,360
Cars clothes weaponry

851
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
All this is scattered around me

852
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
A real mess

853
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
I didn't think War would be like this

854
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
We can't sleep for all the noise

855
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,368
At least 30 shells exploded once the whole time

856
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,928
We called for backup yesterday and today

857
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
I hope they make it

858
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
There are only a few of us left to tackle the English

859
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
I managed to wash myself properly yesterday for a change

860
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
My beard is getting ever longer

861
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:11,776
Otherwise I'm feeling fine as you can see all this noise is not going to rough on my werdenberg car

862
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
And quote

863
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
German soldier named Paul who

864
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,456
This war

865
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Brings out

866
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
The extremes of humanity

867
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
And even the most

868
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,696
Monsters human beings that you can take out throughout history

869
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Exhibit some of that Humanity through their writing

870
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
Hugo Reid one of the most monstrous human beings who's ever lived

871
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Chronicles of this combat

872
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Even he

873
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
Seems somewhat Human by the whole thing

874
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Adolf Hitler was there

875
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
In Flanders

876
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
In 1914 at these battles

877
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
It was his first encounter with combat

878
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
I wrote about it in his

879
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Book mine comp

880
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Quote

881
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
That last a day came when we left Munich

882
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,928
To begin the Fulfillment of our duty

883
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
For the first time I saw the Rhine

884
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,304
As we rode Westward along that's quiet water to defend it

885
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
The German stream of streams

886
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
From the greed of the old enemy

887
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
Went through the tender veil of the Early Morning Mist

888
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,568
The niederwald monument gleam down upon us in the gentle rays of the Sun

889
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,944
The old watch on the Rhine roared out of the Endless transport train into the morning sky

890
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
And I felt as though my heart would burst

891
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
And then came a damp cold night in Flanders

892
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
Through which we marched in silence

893
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
And when the day began to emerge from the Mist

894
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,768
Suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing out us over our heads

895
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
I'm going to Sharp report

896
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,120
Santa little pellets flying between our ranks

897
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Ripping up the wet ground

898
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
But even before the little clouded path

899
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
From 200 throats

900
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,336
The first hurrah Rose to meet the first messengers of death

901
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,919
Then a crackling in a roaring in a singing in a howling began

902
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,991
And with feverish I teach one of us was drawn forward

903
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,087
Faster and faster until suddenly past Turner Field and hedges

904
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
The fight began

905
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
The fight of man against man

906
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
And from the distance

907
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
The strains of a song reached our ears

908
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,399
Coming closer and closer leaving from company to company just as death plunge too busy hand into our ranks

909
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
The song reached out to and we passed it along

910
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,799
Deutschland Deutschland Uber Alles Uber Alles in Deerfield

911
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
4 days later we came back

912
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
Even our stepdad chain

913
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,711
17 year old boy now look like men

914
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,319
The volunteers of the list regiment may not have learned to fight properly

915
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
But I knew how to die like soldiers

916
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
This was the beginning

917
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
You said that it went on year after year

918
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
But the romance of battle have been replaced by horror

919
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
The enthusiasm gradually cool

920
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,935
I need you to enjoy was stifled by mortal fear

921
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
The time came when every man had to struggle

922
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,103
Between the Instinct of self-preservation and the admonitions of Duty

923
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
I too was not spared by the struggle

924
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
Always when death was on the hunt of vague something tried to revolt

925
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,343
Strove to represent itself to the weak body as reason

926
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
It was only cowardice

927
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
Which in such disguises tries to ensnare the individual

928
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
A grave tugging and warning set in

929
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,119
And often it was only The Last Remnant of conscience which decided the issue

930
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,191
Yet the more this voice admonished wanted to caution

931
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,287
The louder and more insistent explores the sharper resistance group

932
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,847
Until at last after a long inner struggle

933
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
Consciousness of Duty emerge Victorious

934
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,503
By the winter of 1915 1916 he rides

935
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
This struggle has been for me decided

936
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Unlock my wheel was Undisputed master

937
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,719
If in the first days I went over the top with rejoicing and laughter

938
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,511
I was now calm and determined

939
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
And this was enduring

940
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,911
Now Faith could bring on the ultimate test without my nerves shattering are my reason failing

941
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,983
The young volunteer had become an old Soldier

942
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
And this transformation had occurred in the whole Army

943
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,615
It issued hard and old from the Eternal battles

944
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,175
And for those who could not stand up under the storm

945
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Well they were broke

946
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
And quote

947
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Hitler would actually

948
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,927
Leap out into no man's land under a hail of bullets

949
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
And try to rescue a

950
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
Commanding officer

951
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
By putting them on his back and carrying him back to

952
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
The German lines

953
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,191
It will be decorated by the Kaiser for this

954
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
Even though the man he rescue died

955
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:34,431
What Hitler is talking about in this personal struggle but he has to go through to try to make himself do something

956
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,039
The entire urges of humanity inside a human being

957
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
You argue against

958
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Is something that

959
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Every soldier in the war

960
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,695
I was going to face this kind of Carnage needs to

961
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
And deal with at one point or another

962
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
Sometimes they don't even have control over what has

963
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
People will be affected by

964
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
The storm of Steel is

965
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
Ernst Junger will call it later in the war

966
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
In different ways sometimes consciously but sometimes

967
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
In a way that defies even what they want to do

968
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
Can one of the things that The Human Side of

969
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
The first World War

970
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
Requires us to look at

971
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,855
Is how and why were these people doing these things

972
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,415
Intelligent human beings

973
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,279
From the modern era look at what our grandfathers and great-grandfathers did in this conflict

974
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
And can understand how and why they did it

975
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:29,983
Part of it is the romance in the heroism in the ID of Duty and what's expected of them

976
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,055
And some of that is what motivates soldiers to continue to

977
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,663
Press forward in unbelievable situations in combat even today

978
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
But there were other

979
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Elements in play

980
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
Less savory

981
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,855
We were dealing with modern nation-state

982
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,439
Who had ways of compelling a certain level of behavior

983
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
There were a lot of people

984
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
We're not brave in this Combat on all sides or

985
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,143
Whose body is simply would not do what their mind told them to do

986
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Those people

987
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
Often had to be sacrificed

988
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
As an example to others

989
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
In 1914

990
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,663
A British Brigadier General named e l Spears

991
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,247
Wrote about one of those methods that the modern state

992
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,807
And really States had for some time before this

993
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
Used to compel their troops

994
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
To be brave and to do their Duty

995
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
Any road quote

996
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,119
Generally my day had just been roused from sleep on the straw of the shed and was standing in the street

997
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679
When a little group of unmistakable purport

998
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Came around the corner

999
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
12 soldiers in an NCO

1000
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
A firing party

1001
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
A couple of John darms in between them and unarmed Soldier

1002
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
My heart sank

1003
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
And a feeling of horror overcame me

1004
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
An execution was about to take place

1005
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
Generally my day took a look

1006
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,111
And then held up his hand so that the party halted

1007
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,415
And with the characteristic Quick-Step

1008
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
Went up to the doomed man

1009
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
He asked what are you been condemned for

1010
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,559
It was for abandoning his post

1011
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
The general then began to talk to the man

1012
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
Quite simply he explain discipline to him

1013
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,519
Abandon your post was letting down your pals

1014
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
More

1015
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
It was letting down your country

1016
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
It look to you to defend her

1017
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
He spoke of the necessity of example

1018
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,247
How someone could do their Duty without prompting

1019
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
But others

1020
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
Less strong

1021
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,367
How to know when understand the Supreme cost of failure

1022
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:27,487
He told The Condemned man that his crime was not venal not low

1023
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
How many Must Die is an example so that others should not fail

1024
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Surprisingly

1025
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
The wretch agreed

1026
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Nodding his head

1027
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,239
The burden of infamy was lifted from his shoulders

1028
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
He saw a glimmer of something

1029
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Redemption in his own eyes

1030
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
A real hope

1031
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
Though he knew he was going to die

1032
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
The general went on

1033
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
Carrying the man with him to comprehension

1034
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,367
There any sacrifice was worthwhile if it helped France ever so little

1035
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,671
What did anything matter if he knew this

1036
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
Finally the general held out his hand

1037
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,023
Meaning to Shake The Condemned person

1038
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Pand

1039
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Yours is also a way of dying for France he said

1040
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
The procession started again

1041
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
But now the victim was a willing one

1042
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,311
The sound of a volley in the distance announced that all was over

1043
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,151
General d-mate wipe the beads of perspiration from his brow

1044
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,943
And for the first time perhaps

1045
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
His hand trembled as he lived his pipe

1046
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
And quote

1047
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
That's something

1048
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,135
That all sides will do in this war

1049
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,463
The way of saying yes you may face certain death

1050
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,791
If you walk into the storm that is Modern Combat

1051
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,839
But you'll also face certain death

1052
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
If you don't

1053
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,447
Very important build a bear in mind

1054
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:45,567
The fact that these soldiers who failed in their Duty somehow or exposed

1055
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
To capital punishment

1056
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,663
Does not mean that that's why Soldier

1057
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,527
That's something that has been present in most armies throughout history

1058
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Since ancient

1059
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,135
At the Romans if your unit fart badly

1060
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Would make the men

1061
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
Draw Lots

1062
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,815
And one out of every ten soldiers in a unit would be killed that was called decimation

1063
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
And to add insult to injury

1064
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
The Romans would make their comrades killed

1065
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
So that's a standard part of warfare throughout most of History

1066
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,335
Most of these soldiers were fighting for much

1067
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,615
Higher values

1068
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,711
Things that you do more cynical 21st century mind

1069
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
Sometimes almost sound like

1070
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,831
In a military recruiting marketing slogan

1071
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
But they meant something to these people

1072
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
I mean something to soldiers today

1073
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Duty

1074
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Honor

1075
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Country

1076
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Sovereign

1077
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
God

1078
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
And what's more once these soldiers get into combat

1079
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,007
A responsibility to your comrade

1080
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Nonetheless

1081
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
The first World War

1082
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Is able to take

1083
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,503
One of the most extreme activities humans ever take part in

1084
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Warfare

1085
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,063
And make it worse

1086
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
Instart for example

1087
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:07,999
With what trench warfare means for the soldiers on the ground in terms of day-to-day living

1088
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Go out in your backyard

1089
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Dig yourself a hole

1090
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
Sit down in it

1091
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
In the rain

1092
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
And just living

1093
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
Day after day

1094
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
Without any bombs

1095
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
Guns

1096
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Bullets

1097
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
Or murderous combat

1098
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
And it's horrible

1099
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
50 seoul

1100
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,271
Most of them in Flanders one of the rainiest parts of Europe

1101
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
They live in the mud

1102
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,927
And they can't quite get their mind around how that changes this

1103
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,743
Romantic idea

1104
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Of adventurous combat

1105
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,375
It's so many of them signed up for take for example some of the most elite units

1106
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
In France's military men who were in The French Foreign Legion and who find themselves in holes in the ground

1107
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Ground

1108
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
Alan Seeger

1109
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
I will die

1110
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,711
On the Western Front in 1916

1111
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,527
Righteousness trench warfare is getting started

1112
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,295
Quote

1113
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,623
This style of trench warfare is extremely modern

1114
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,951
And for the artillerymen is doubtless very interesting

1115
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
But for the poor common Soldier it is anything but romantic

1116
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:19,423
His role is to Simply dig himself a hole in the ground and keep hidden in it as tightly as possible

1117
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:25,567
Continually under the fire of the opposing batteries he is yet never allowed to get a glimpse of the enemy

1118
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,455
Exposed to all the dangers of War but none of its enthusiasms or Splendid lawn

1119
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,527
He is condemned to sit like an animal in its burrow

1120
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
And hear the shells whistle over his head

1121
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,903
And take your little daily toll from his comrades

1122
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
His feet are numb

1123
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,231
Is canteen Frozen

1124
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
But he's not allowed to make a fire

1125
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
He's not even permitted to light a candle

1126
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
He must hold himself up in his blanket and lie down cramped in the dirty straw to sleep as best as he may

1127
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,055
How different from the popular notion of the evening campfire

1128
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
The song

1129
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
And the good cheer

1130
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
And quote

1131
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,735
It's after the battles up in Flanders

1132
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
On the Ain

1133
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Eat bread

1134
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,855
When is trench warfare sets in the German Soldier

1135
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,207
Rudolf binder tries to explain what's happening in 1914 when he writes quote

1136
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,559
The war is got stuck into a gigantic Siege on both sides

1137
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,143
The whole front is one endless fortified Trench

1138
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Neither side has the force to make a decisive push

1139
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,543
Everyone seemed settled on a winter campaign

1140
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
But as far as I can judge

1141
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,127
There's no possibility of an early finish

1142
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,199
We are still stuck here for perfectly good reason

1143
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,759
One might as well say for perfectly bad reason

1144
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
This business May last for a long time

1145
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
And quote

1146
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Now

1147
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
It's important to remember that most of the people who are finding themselves stuck in this business in 19

1148
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
14

1149
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
Aren't really Soldier

1150
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Soldiers might be expected to deal with this kind of

1151
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,847
Incredible experience but most of the troops in these uniforms and carrying weapons which

1152
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
For all intents and purposes appear to be so

1153
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,479
Six or eight weeks ago were civilians

1154
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
They were shopkeeper

1155
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
A delivery boy

1156
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,391
And students and insurance salesman and teachers

1157
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
All of a sudden find themselves

1158
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,767
In circumstances that they just can't make sense of

1159
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
Horrible situations

1160
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,191
Many of these people have never seen a dead body in their lives

1161
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,495
And then all of a sudden find themselves

1162
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,103
In situations like this German soldier in 1914 describing

1163
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
This new phenomenon of trench life

1164
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,479
Day-to-day living in a hole in the ground

1165
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,807
We combat going on all around you he writes quote

1166
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
The dangers of trench life may be realized

1167
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,231
When I say that often neither the dead nor wounded can be removed

1168
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,071
If you put up as much as a little finger above the edge of the trench

1169
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,631
The bullets come whizzing around immediately

1170
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,727
The dead bodies must therefore be allowed to remain in the trench

1171
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
That is to say the dead man is got rid of by digging a grave for him in the floor of the

1172
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:13,247
French a few days ago a soldier was so badly hit by a shell that he was cutting too

1173
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,343
His shattered body could not be removed without risk to the survivors

1174
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,391
And was therefore allowed to remain

1175
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,719
But presently he gave rise to a horrible stench

1176
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,071
And whatever they did the men could not get away from the mutilated black and features

1177
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:33,727
Sometimes arms and legs torn away from the body are allowed to lie about the bottom of the trench until someone can bury the

1178
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
One gets hardened in time

1179
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
And quote

1180
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
Getting hardened in time

1181
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Is what's happening

1182
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,527
During this period in 1914 once the fighting

1183
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,879
Abby's major first battle died down because this is when the reinforcements arrive

1184
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:55,999
And the reinforcements are not part of the regular army these are the civilians

1185
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
From a short time ago

1186
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,375
Thrown into uniform and sent into this hell of combat

1187
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,471
Little bit different for the veterans especially the profession

1188
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
The British professional Army

1189
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,895
Yeah that existed before the war started the so-called old contemptibles

1190
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Are being as we said

1191
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Whittled down to

1192
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,527
You're practically nothing but there's a few of them laugh

1193
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,111
And you're trying to integrate these former civilians into their ranks

1194
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:26,463
Without getting killed in the process because those people don't know the ropes yet

1195
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,279
And they're doing things that scare the regular

1196
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,375
John Lucy one of the old contemptibles in the Irish guards

1197
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
In the bef rights quote

1198
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:42,079
We stood to win the wet shell holes and crumbling trenches under the Thunder and Blasting flashes of German hike

1199
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Explosives

1200
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:47,967
There is no need to describe this bombardment except to say that it was the worst of my experience

1201
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
A few of our fellows broke under

1202
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:55,135
And 1 porkchop entirely lost his head and ran back out of his trench

1203
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
He had not a chance in the open

1204
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,231
The Earth was vomiting all around us

1205
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
Any tumbled over in a few yard

1206
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,583
Better to have kept to the trench

1207
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
No trained soldier would leave that

1208
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
Hey Corporal a Burly fellow

1209
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
Spell near me with a shrapnel bullet in his head

1210
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
He lay unconscious all the day

1211
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:17,151
Nodding his hold had is if suffering only from some slight irritation

1212
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,455
And did not become still until evening

1213
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,271
Earlier in the day one youngster said

1214
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,319
What about putting him out of his misery

1215
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,647
I'm more experienced man explained that there was no pain

1216
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,951
The smallest earrings a little moans

1217
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,511
Came from a man who was then already as good as dead

1218
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
Another Soldier

1219
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,119
Lucy says

1220
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Had his belly ripped open

1221
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,311
And stop supporting his back against a trench while he gazed with fascinated eyes at large coils of his own

1222
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,615
Guts which he held in both hands

1223
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,431
This was almost too ghastly a site I saw

1224
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
It sequel was better

1225
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,527
The man Central had not been penetrated

1226
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,319
He got safe out of the trench

1227
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Was washed

1228
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,903
Tucked in and mended well in hospital

1229
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:05,535
Maned Men passed crouching and crawling behind me leaving trails of Blood on the ground

1230
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,119
On their way to a Ditch Witch LED back into the woods behind

1231
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,423
Some of them were moaning too loud

1232
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,239
Unlike our old man he means the better

1233
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,055
1 young militia man in particular

1234
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:21,663
Came by roaring in seeking sympathy for a broken arm from everyone he met

1235
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,247
Lance corporal told him that for God's sake to put a sock in it

1236
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,087
And if you were really badly wounded he would have no breath left to howl

1237
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,879
That's topped hysterics

1238
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,231
I should say that the noncoms of the old army had the worst time of all

1239
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:40,095
Trying in circumstances like these to keep inexperienced men in hand

1240
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,423
Some of these men could not even fire a rifle properly

1241
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,519
And at times our hearts quailed for our safety and theirs

1242
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
And quote

1243
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
This experience

1244
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:56,223
Was so unlike with the soldiers of the day were accustomed to

1245
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,271
The minister of War

1246
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,879
And war hero himself Lord Horatio Kitchener in Britain

1247
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,951
Famously said when seeing what this whole deal was like

1248
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
This is not war

1249
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Maybe you hadn't been

1250
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
But this was sort of a way of

1251
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
Telling everyone in this generation

1252
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,031
Welcome to the 20th century

1253
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,079
This is how it's going to be 4

1254
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
These battles in Flanders

1255
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
What you do

1256
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,503
Shatter

1257
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,783
Many of the leaders

1258
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Confident and what's going on

1259
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,415
Remember when the war starts they have a plan for winning the war that's been

1260
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,231
In a worked out over years but once that fails

1261
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
All these generals have to improvise

1262
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
They have to

1263
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:48,191
Create new offensives in new ways to win the war from where things stand

1264
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:55,103
And after these battles in Flanders die down and you have this trench warfare setting in General von falkenhayn in German

1265
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
Money runs the numbers

1266
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
And they're horrible

1267
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
I'm in the Battle of Ypres

1268
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
All sides combined

1269
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:06,367
You're talking about another 250000 casualties in a few weeks

1270
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:10,207
That brings a German totals on the Western Front since the war started

1271
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
Which is August

1272
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,047
2 more than 750 thousand

1273
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,607
The French you're topping a million

1274
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
The British and for all intents and purposes lost

1275
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:24,031
They are professional Army the greatest in the world small but the greatest in the world

1276
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:28,639
It's down to dozens of men in units that had hundreds of men

1277
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
You know a very short time ago

1278
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,759
And in Britain there trying to scrape up replacements

1279
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:38,111
And you can see how how bad it is by how quickly their changing the requirement

1280
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,927
Because when the war starts you have to be 5 foot 8 inches tall

1281
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
To be in the British army

1282
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,279
In October they lower that to 5

1283
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,327
Foot five inches tall

1284
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,143
A single month later in November they'll or that the five foot

1285
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
3 in tall

1286
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
The Germans

1287
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,519
Are having a similar problem they learned a very

1288
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,079
Hard lesson in these battles in Flanders

1289
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
You must

1290
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,503
Let the troops finish their training cuz they threw away a ton of Lies with people who weren't ready to fight

1291
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,111
But Duncan Hines got a more difficult situation

1292
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:16,511
Because the British and the French as we said have dominions and Commonwealth Nations I mean the Canadians alone in a fit

1293
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:20,607
Patriotism are sending more than 30,000 fresh troops

1294
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,143
Across the Atlantic

1295
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
In the largest

1296
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,959
Transportation of

1297
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Troops

1298
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,543
When the history of the world across the large ocean

1299
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,103
I'm talkin I have two accounts

1300
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,943
He goes and he tells the civilian leadership

1301
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Did the war in the west camp B1

1302
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,855
He tells them that they have to come to some sort of an arrangement

1303
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
And He suggests making

1304
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
Peace with somebody

1305
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Maybe the Russian

1306
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,535
Because if you make peace with the Russians maybe the French will lose heart

1307
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,887
He says all of these other nations are simply weapons in the hands of the arch in

1308
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Which is English

1309
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,751
And they have to be at the British have to be the ones

1310
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,079
That the Germans focus on and we have to get these other countries

1311
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,431
Which are merely sword in the hand of perfidious Albion he says

1312
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Need to get them out of the war

1313
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,087
Now this is going to be very hard to do because way back in September all the allies

1314
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Chinese agreement saying nobody will make A Separate Peace

1315
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
Nonetheless falkenhayn hopes

1316
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,255
But he can make his War aims

1317
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,863
You no longer Victory but shattering some of these Powers they leave the war

1318
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,215
The civilian leadership in Germany the politicians like bethmann-hollweg

1319
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,775
Are appalled by what

1320
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,103
They can't figure out a way to do this because

1321
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:40,223
The Germans just like all these other countries are so appalled by the casualties in the blood that's been spilled

1322
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
The nobody is willing

1323
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,063
To give up anything

1324
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,111
You've already lost too many people

1325
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,927
One thing if you lose all those people in a victory

1326
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,999
Do nothing if you lose all those people in a loss

1327
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Besides

1328
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,351
Batman holding just a couple of months ago was writing up

1329
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,959
Plans for what the victory conditions in the war going to be in he got these grandiose

1330
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:07,359
Schemes where we're going to push the Russians back we're going to keep the French down forever we're going to all these vassal States and now his Chi

1331
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,663
Military leader is saying listen we can't win the war

1332
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Now

1333
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,831
Don't forget Hines Rivals guys like ludendorff in the East who already hate him

1334
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Viscerally

1335
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,719
Say that his attitude you know this early in the war is tantamount to treason

1336
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:28,863
I basically insinuating and no one certain terms that I change and Military leadership my change all these sorts of things

1337
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,167
Valkenhayn is told

1338
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,703
But there's no way

1339
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
That we're ending the war

1340
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,799
He tells his troops on the Western Front

1341
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
To hold on to what you have

1342
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:44,223
Never Surrender a square foot of what you one if you do counter-attack immediately and retake it

1343
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Because they take invaluable territory valuable Farmland valuable resources valuable industrial Land from the French

1344
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
And if he can't get the war

1345
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,791
Stop from the political leadership he's going to hold on to what he had

1346
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,119
He tells the troops in the west to deepen their fortification

1347
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
Instead of just one line of trenches

1348
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
He wants multiple line

1349
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,519
He and all the other leaders

1350
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
On both sides begin to use

1351
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,919
This wonderful weapon which doesn't seem like a weapon at all of barbed wire

1352
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Something it was first invented

1353
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,247
A generation before to keep

1354
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,551
Title pending in the American West

1355
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,367
And in the last couple of Wars since then it been used

1356
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,183
You know sparingly and soda experiment Lee

1357
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,327
Now all sides take this wire with all these sharp edges and begin to use it as a fortification

1358
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,143
This will be another one of these

1359
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,727
Iconic things on the Western Front and you don't even think that

1360
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:43,103
Something like wire with little tiny barbs on will make that much of a difference but it proved to be one of the

1361
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
You know most

1362
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
Important

1363
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:49,247
Elements of the of the war on the Western Front you can even make a case

1364
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,367
Did they will invent weapon systems which still dominate militaries today

1365
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,415
Simply overcome the barrier

1366
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
Created by things like

1367
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,719
Like barbed wire

1368
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
Now it's not all bad

1369
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,631
For the Central Powers in Germany is 19141

1370
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:11,775
Shore General von falkenhayn has decided that he can't see a way to Victory on the Western Front

1371
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,591
But there's fighting going on on other friends too

1372
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,663
Is main adversaries in Germany's High command

1373
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:22,271
The ever more powerful team of Hindenburg and ludendorff

1374
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:28,159
Believers that you can win the war by beating the Russians they will become part of the

1375
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:31,231
Group of German generals that will be known as Eastern

1376
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,279
Rich people to think you can win the war

1377
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,119
By being victorious in the East Falcon Hines one of these guys who

1378
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,935
Is part of the cabal known as the westerners

1379
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,775
Believers that any real victory in the war will come on the Western Front

1380
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:49,407
Newfronts opening up is 1914 wines down strange front Stu

1381
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,991
We haven't even mentioned that there's fighting going on

1382
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,087
In the Pacific because it really is a sidebar to this story

1383
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
Japan for exam

1384
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,439
Once the war breaks out quickly throws in their lot

1385
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,743
With Britain and France and Russia in the eye

1386
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,071
They do so for purely opportunistic Ruiz

1387
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,143
The Germans have some territories in the Pacific

1388
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:14,751
The Japan can easily snap up it won't be much fighting it won't be much trouble

1389
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,591
And if the Allies somehow lose the war

1390
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,199
There's not much Germany and Austria-Hungary and stuff can do to Japan way over in the Pacific anyway

1391
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
There's no downside

1392
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,831
So the Japanese snap up some of these Drummond Island possessions in the

1393
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Pacific to take some German territories

1394
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
On the Asian mainland

1395
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,487
And the most important part of all of those

1396
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
Actions

1397
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,327
Will be the fact that some of those places will be

1398
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,375
The Battlegrounds in the second world

1399
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
And also that Japan's

1400
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,263
Taking a German possessions on the Asian mainland help

1401
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,663
Precipitate later war between Japan and China which will help create the conditions where the Japanese are part of the Pacific War in the

1402
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,735
The Second World War I mean it's more of a long-term situation

1403
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,783
I mean it's more of a long-term

1404
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
Cancerous situation but

1405
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
Japan's been in the war since the beginning it's part of what makes this a world

1406
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,743
Buddy November 1914 turkey at

1407
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
And this is a very different

1408
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
First of all

1409
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,911
The Turks are not United on the idea at all

1410
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,447
Some of the more aggressive

1411
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Members of the government

1412
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,799
For now called The Young Turks

1413
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
Sort of precipitate

1414
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
In a way that leaves the rest of the government out of the decision

1415
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,735
They in some Germans working together decide to Shell

1416
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,807
Some Russian Port facilities in the Black Sea

1417
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,367
Without getting the rest of the government's position

1418
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,439
And then of course Russia declares war on turkey and boom there in

1419
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,791
The Germans have been trying to set this up for a long time

1420
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
They wanted turkey on their side

1421
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,631
Which is strange

1422
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,983
Because turkey is one of those Powers that's really having a hard time right now

1423
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,543
And the Germans already have one of those

1424
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,103
Allied to Austria-Hungary

1425
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,431
Which yunnan for 5 months of War already look

1426
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Doughton

1427
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
The Germans will take the saying

1428
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,783
About their Austrian allies

1429
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
That they are fettered to a corpse

1430
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,975
Well now they're adding another corpse I mean you really have to admire how well Germany doesn this war considering

1431
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,791
Did they have two of the weakest powers in Europe

1432
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
Not just on their side

1433
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
But requiring a lot of their help

1434
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
But the Turks provide

1435
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,215
An interesting

1436
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Are you

1437
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
To the journey

1438
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,591
It's not that they have an Army and Navy that's going to be real helpful

1439
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,407
But the Turks control a nice

1440
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,223
Trunk of what today we would call the Middle East

1441
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,295
And by simply deciding to get into the war

1442
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Dayforce

1443
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,135
The British and the French who have a lot of possessions in that area

1444
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,415
To defend them

1445
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
They've expanded

1446
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
The battlefield

1447
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,791
To include a whole bunch of areas

1448
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,351
But nobody was fighting over before turkey

1449
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
He got into the war

1450
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
What's more

1451
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
Turkey's historic

1452
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Anime

1453
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Is Russia

1454
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,591
A Russia that is putting all their Manpower

1455
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:02,175
The dealing with the Germans in the austro-hungarian then all of a sudden

1456
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,479
South of all that fighting

1457
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,551
They now have their historic enemy turkey in the war

1458
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,367
Again it's not that they're so afraid of the Turk

1459
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,463
It's they're afraid of taking any troops away from the main Battlefront

1460
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,255
To defend that area at all

1461
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,351
Same thing with the British and the French now they have to take troops away

1462
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,167
From places where they're using them against the Germans

1463
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
And use them elsewhere

1464
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:29,055
So the Germans aren't really getting the Turkish armies help as much as they're getting

1465
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,871
The fact that the people they're fighting

1466
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
How to fight

1467
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
Somewhere else

1468
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
2

1469
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Now

1470
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
For our purposes there's a wonderful little

1471
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,367
Moment right at the beginning of turkeys involvement where

1472
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,951
The highest-ranking figure in the Muslim World religious

1473
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,255
Proclaims a Jihad

1474
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
Against the allies

1475
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,351
Britain France Russia Serbia

1476
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:58,751
And this is an era where the Muslim world was was more united in a religious sense of me nowadays

1477
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,031
It's more like

1478
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:04,639
The Protestant version of Christianity where there's a lot of different religious leaders who

1479
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Kind of all have equal standing

1480
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
At this time.

1481
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,295
The guy who was running the religion from Turkey

1482
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
Had

1483
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
Not total

1484
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
Control over their religion

1485
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,487
3 carried a lot of weight and when the war breaks out on November 14th

1486
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
1914

1487
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,559
He proclaims a holy war against

1488
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,351
Britain France Serbia Russia

1489
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,887
And this is big because

1490
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,167
Britain France

1491
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
And Russia all have

1492
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Huge

1493
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,007
Muslim population

1494
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,311
Germany's ambassador

1495
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
To Turkey

1496
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
Says that now

1497
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,687
You know the British are going to burn up in Jihad

1498
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,271
Whether or not that's what really happens

1499
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,087
If your Britain and your friends and your Russia

1500
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:49,695
You need to be concerned about that and now you need to divert forces

1501
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,487
From other crucial fronts

1502
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
To deal with this new dilemma

1503
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
Turkey is

1504
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:59,167
And has been for more than a hundred years known as the sick man of Europe

1505
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
They've just bought

1506
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:06,079
Two Wars before the first world war breaks out the first and second Balkan War

1507
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
I'm lost

1508
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,151
Most of those European possession

1509
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,431
Penniless

1510
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,759
It's a disaster they just bought two battleships

1511
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
Which they had to ask their

1512
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
Citizens

1513
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:21,183
To essentially donate the money for they purchased them from Britain

1514
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,487
And then when the war broke out Britain kept on

1515
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
Which was another reason the church were not too happy with the Ally

1516
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Nonetheless

1517
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
The fact that turkey is going to be in the war

1518
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
Means that the British

1519
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,215
Who am I

1520
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,031
Controlled Egypt for some time now

1521
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
Have to worry about it

1522
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,359
Have to worry about the Suez Canal

1523
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Also

1524
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,919
This is the era

1525
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Where oil is

1526
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
Finally becoming important

1527
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:50,879
In a right before the first world war breaks out of prison lays down its first ships that are going to burn oil

1528
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
Instead of

1529
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Cole

1530
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,719
And everybody is starting to see

1531
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,767
Did not only is oil important

1532
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,071
But the Middle East is a place that has a lot of

1533
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,399
And now the Middle East is going up in flames

1534
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,751
Some of those planes probably would have been very welcome

1535
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,799
On the Eastern front at this

1536
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:14,431
Point where the Russians and the Germans in the austro-hungarian they're locked in Mortal Kombat because it begins to free

1537
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,247
At the end of the year as one might expect

1538
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295
They may be dealing with

1539
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
In a rain and historic

1540
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,415
Cold one of the coldest winters on memory on the Western Front

1541
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,207
What's the coldest winters

1542
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,535
In memory on the Western Front were pretty darn average on the Eastern

1543
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:33,119
And the weather conditions slow everyone down

1544
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
The Eastern commanders and Hindenburg and ludendorff also don't have enough troops to do anything truly MoMA

1545
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Meant to say

1546
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,871
Begging falkenhayn in the Kaiser for them and they keep

1547
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,895
Getting rebuff

1548
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
The Russians

1549
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
AR

1550
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Inapt

1551
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
When they're attacking but they're very tough when they're defending so things tend to slow down and the Russians tend to go

1552
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
Go on the defensive

1553
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,975
The austro-hungarians are already almost done

1554
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:04,863
In a 5 months into the war and they're fighting the last defensive that they will launch independently in the whole War

1555
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,655
They already have

1556
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:11,007
A giant Fortress with 150000 austro-hungarian troops in it

1557
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
Surrounded by the Russians it's a bad situation

1558
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
The weather slows everything down

1559
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,919
And if you actually try to follow

1560
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,967
The various battles going on

1561
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
You'll notice that there is

1562
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,575
Ate a rhythm to them that makes it difficult

1563
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,463
For anything to ever be solved I mean one side moves forward the other side moves back and then you know they were verse course

1564
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,279
Historian Peter Hart does a pretty good

1565
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,607
Rundown of the rhythm of the Eastern front at this time

1566
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
And sums up the way the

1567
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Infirst

1568
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,215
Six months of War end

1569
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
You know in

1570
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,519
Delizia

1571
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
And Poland and places like that

1572
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
He writes quote

1573
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,407
The Seesaw nature of the fighting in the east

1574
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,223
Two steps forward three steps back

1575
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
One step forward

1576
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,831
What's becoming increasingly apparent to all along the line

1577
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,135
In the north for all their efforts

1578
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,231
The Russians only managed to hold onto a token sliver of East Prussia

1579
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,583
In contrast they lost much of Russia and Poland to the German advance

1580
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,423
What's the Strategic drawback of occupying this territory was such

1581
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,007
It was not a particular disadvantage in the broader scheme of things

1582
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,079
It was in the South against the austrians

1583
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,127
That the Russians have made their biggest gains

1584
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,455
Are they had overrun nearly all of Austrian Galicia

1585
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
Justice on the Western Front

1586
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,319
The scale of the forces involved have been incredible

1587
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,415
By the end of the year 143 Russian divisions

1588
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,999
Face 53 Austrian and 38 German division

1589
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,327
Losses on all sides have been simply breathtaking

1590
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:44,447
By the end of 1914 up to 750,000 Russian soldiers

1591
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:49,823
500000 austro-hungarian and 140000 German to become casual

1592
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,663
All this in just five frantic months of mayhem

1593
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
And quote

1594
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
It will await

1595
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,295
A change in weather conditions

1596
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
For that front heats up

1597
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
Throughout this

1598
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Most inhumane of conf

1599
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
There are tons of stories of

1600
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,303
Prisoners being killed

1601
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,167
And horrible things being done all over me when you have millions and millions of men involved in

1602
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
Warfare

1603
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
There are going to be

1604
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Stories

1605
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
You know that run the gamut

1606
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,311
The ones though that sort of

1607
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Reinforce

1608
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
Know your connection

1609
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
To humanity

1610
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:30,271
Are there too and they deserve to be pointed out sometimes there on an individual level

1611
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
Is a story from the West

1612
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
Confronted I like right around the time of

1613
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,439
He pray about a British soldier named Willie Frazier

1614
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
Is wounded in the shoulder

1615
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,583
Duck you know in place as the Germans overrun his position

1616
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
And the stories recounted by author

1617
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
Winston groom

1618
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
Here's groom talking about

1619
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
Frasier

1620
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Injured

1621
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
On the bottle

1622
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
Quote

1623
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,151
His shoulder have been Shattered by shrapnel

1624
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,735
There was fighting and killing all around and the Germans captured him

1625
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:07,135
Having studied German in Frankfurt in 1909 he was astonished to hear a German Sergeant yell out an order

1626
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
Where to shoot him

1627
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,207
Willie yell to a German officer

1628
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,487
How many officers spoke

1629
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,279
Willie recognized his accent

1630
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
How do you ask if he was from Frankfurt

1631
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,375
When the officer replied that he was

1632
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
Willie asked him in German

1633
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
Don't you wish you were there now

1634
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,775
The two men exchanged forced grins

1635
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,079
And the officer ordered his men not to harm

1636
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
And quote

1637
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,223
You can find stories like that all throughout

1638
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,551
People who shoemanity shines through on an individual

1639
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,855
In a base on all sides by the way

1640
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,647
No one had a monopoly on that

1641
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
But there were times

1642
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,999
When the humanity sort of jest

1643
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Burst

1644
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Fourth

1645
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
And math

1646
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,351
Spontaneously

1647
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
None more famous

1648
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,215
Maybe overrated some people say but I don't see how it

1649
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,239
Can be overrated

1650
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
Then what happened

1651
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
It on Christmas Eve

1652
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,847
1914

1653
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
Especially on the west

1654
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
The conditions are horrible

1655
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
It's freezing

1656
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
You know your feet are

1657
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,087
Stocking gruul mudwater

1658
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,183
But you think can't get any worse and then it all freezes and you're stuck out there in the cold

1659
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,999
And all the sudden the people on the Western Front

1660
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
See something

1661
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:24,447
Relatively unbelievable in a conflict where you have shells going on every second snipers picking off any

1662
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,007
You want raises his head above the trench and then all the sudden

1663
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,055
Soldiers reported

1664
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Hearing singing

1665
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
And seeing

1666
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Weird

1667
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Colored light

1668
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
The colored lights were off and coming

1669
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,527
From the German trenches

1670
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Soldier

1671
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
Julia skoczen

1672
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
Was in one of those trenches

1673
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
Opposite

1674
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
The French

1675
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
China conditions were horrible

1676
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Put on Christmas Eve

1677
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
This is what

1678
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Quote

1679
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
Christmas in the trenches

1680
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
It was bitterly cold

1681
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,263
We procure to Pinetree for there were no fir trees to be had

1682
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:02,079
We decorated the tree with candles and cookies

1683
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,639
We had imitated the snow with wadding

1684
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,223
Christmas trees were burning everywhere in the trenches in at midnight

1685
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,783
All the trees were lifted onto the parapet

1686
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
With your burning candle

1687
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:17,439
And along the whole line German soldiers began to sing Christmas songs in chorus

1688
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,975
Old owl blissful

1689
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Holdout joyous

1690
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,303
Mercy bringing Christmas time

1691
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,399
Hundreds of men he writes were singing the song in that fearful wood

1692
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
Not a shot was fired

1693
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,263
The French had ceased firing along the whole line

1694
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,359
That night I was with a company that was only Five Paces away from the enemy

1695
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
The Christmas candles were Burning Brightly

1696
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
And were renewed again and again

1697
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,271
For the first time we heard no shots

1698
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,087
From everywhere throughout the forest he writes

1699
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,159
One could hear powerful Carol's come floating over

1700
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,439
Peace on Earth

1701
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,767
The Frenchie says left their trenches

1702
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,327
And stood on the parapet without any fear

1703
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,399
There they stood quite overpowered by emotion

1704
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,191
And all of them with cap in hand

1705
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
We too had issued from our trenches

1706
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,543
We exchange gifts with the French

1707
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,895
Chocolate cigarettes Etc they were all laughing and so where we

1708
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687
Why we did not know

1709
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,759
Then everybody went back to his trench and incessantly

1710
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
The Carroll resounded

1711
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,879
Evermore solemnly Evermore longingly o thou Bliss

1712
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
And quote

1713
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
Private William

1714
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Quinton

1715
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,791
In the trenches

1716
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
On Christmas Eve

1717
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,095
On the British side

1718
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,423
Wrote about a similar situation farther down the line

1719
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Quote

1720
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:37,823
All around us lay about 3 in of snow a typical picture postcard Christmas

1721
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,103
Things were very quiet

1722
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,199
That peace and goodwill to all men feeling seem to be in the air

1723
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:48,831
We could hear the German still strafing of Ypres way but the next night Christmas Eve

1724
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
Even up there with much quieter

1725
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:55,231
Something in the direction of the German lines caused us to rub our eyes and look again

1726
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
Here and there

1727
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
Showing just above their parapet

1728
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,143
We could see very faintly would look like very small colored lights

1729
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
What was this

1730
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,519
What did some prearranged signal and the Forerunner of an attack

1731
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
Was it to make us curious

1732
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,895
And that's expose ourselves to a sudden breaking of machine-gun Fire

1733
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,247
We were very suspicious and we were discussing the strange move of the enemy

1734
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
When something even stranger happen

1735
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,087
The Germans were actually singing

1736
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
Not very loud

1737
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
But there was no mistaking it

1738
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
We began to get interest

1739
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:30,047
The enemy at least we're going to enjoy themselves as much as the circumstances would permit

1740
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,327
Suddenly

1741
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,631
Across the snow-clad no man's land

1742
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,935
A strong clear voice rang out

1743
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,751
Singing the opening lines of Annie Laurie

1744
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,567
It was sung in perfect English and we were spelled out

1745
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,151
No other sound but this unknown singers voice

1746
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,967
To us it seemed like the war had suddenly stopped

1747
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,295
Stop to listen to this song from one of the enemy

1748
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:55,903
Not a sound from Friend or Foe and is the last notes died away

1749
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:01,023
A spontaneous Outburst of clapping a rose from our trenches encore

1750
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
Poodle French

1751
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
And quote

1752
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,167
All along the line

1753
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
The two sides

1754
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,495
To have this interesting moment where they

1755
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,104
Began to emerge From The Trenches little by little

1756
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
You know a place where they couldn't stick a finger up

1757
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,968
Without having a shot off

1758
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,504
Just hours before

1759
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:25,600
Everybody must have been so incredibly Brave to try

1760
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:30,976
But once I would raise themselves up a little bit in the other side with raised themselves up a little bit more

1761
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
Until both sides

1762
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,608
In this hellish environment where nobody could go anywhere near

1763
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,144
In the open-air

1764
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,704
We're standing apart from each other

1765
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984
Gazing

1766
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,544
Right at the enemy in no man's land

1767
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Find on Chris

1768
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,384
Private William Quinton

1769
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
Quote

1770
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
Has daylight trapped in

1771
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,576
We were surprised to see the Germans waist-high out of their trenches

1772
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,392
Gazing across at us with impunity

1773
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Imagine the position

1774
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:06,560
Where is yesterday the mere sight of a bit of field gray uniform would have caused a dozen British rifles to crack

1775
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
He was the enemy

1776
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,192
In full view of us gazing serenely across no-man's-land at us

1777
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
And we had him

1778
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,800
To wash in the front line the whole world to change

1779
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,128
We could take stock of our surroundings at our leisure

1780
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:26,528
At 9 precisely the German burying party climbed From The Trenches shovels and picks on their shoulders

1781
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:30,624
Advanced about 10 yards in our Direction and waited expectantly

1782
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,928
A word from our company officer

1783
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
And our party were soon out

1784
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,256
The officers looked on

1785
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
Apparently conversing

1786
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:42,656
The digging party soon lost interest in their task and before long were busy fraternizing

1787
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
Cigarettes were being exchanged

1788
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,264
And they seem to be enjoying themselves immensely

1789
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,360
Needless to say before very long we in the trenches were soon out on top

1790
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,152
Sauntering about the snow

1791
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,712
But keeping this side of our wire entanglement

1792
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
Likewise the Germans

1793
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,344
For the whole of that day and for many days to come

1794
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,928
Friend and foe mixed freely out on no man's land

1795
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:11,328
Except for the fact that a few of the enemy could speak a little English we found the language difficulty of bar to conversation

1796
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,888
But we may do with signs and gestures

1797
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,752
I remember distinctly German holding out an open box of chocolates for me to take one

1798
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,336
The Germans wanted to play as a football match on no man's land

1799
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,384
But our officers would not allow it

1800
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
And quote

1801
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,480
There are reports.

1802
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,064
British and German troops engaging in soccer matches

1803
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
Up and down the line

1804
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,416
It was an amazing spontaneous

1805
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Outburst of

1806
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
Humanity

1807
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,280
And it's so appalled

1808
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
The higher leadership

1809
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,352
But they made sure

1810
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
In future Christmases

1811
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
Nothing like this would ever be allowed again

1812
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
If you thought the war was bad

1813
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
4

1814
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
It's about to get worse

1815
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,104
And I'll let Winston Churchill

1816
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
He

1817
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,944
In a leadership position during the

1818
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
As part of the war

1819
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
Set up 1915

1820
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
Time when he says

1821
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
Man lost control

1822
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:06,880
The conflict

1823
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,184
And forces took over

1824
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
He wrote quote

1825
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,096
The year 1915 was fated to be disastrous to the cause of the allies

1826
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
And of the whole world

1827
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,264
Spider mistakes of this year the opportunity was lost of confining the conflagration within limits

1828
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,080
Wichita with normous we're not on control

1829
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,664
There after the fire roared on till it burned itself out

1830
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,784
Thereafter events past very largely outside the scope of conscious choice

1831
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:38,880
Governments and individuals conformed to the rhythm of the tragedy

1832
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,208
And swayed and staggered forward and helpless viola

1833
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,048
Slaughtering and squandering on ever-increasing scales

1834
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:51,680
Till injuries were Rod to the structure human society which a century will not face

1835
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,264
And which may conceivably prove fatal to the present civilization

1836
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,568
13 January 1915

1837
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,384
The terrific Affair was still not unmanageable

1838
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,944
It could have been grasping human hands

1839
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,760
And brought to rest in righteous and fruitful victory

1840
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,808
Before the world was exhausted

1841
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,856
Before the nations were broken

1842
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,416
Before the empires were shattered to pieces

1843
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,952
Before Europe was ruined

1844
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
It was not to be

1845
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:16,768
He writes

1846
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:21,632
Mankind was not to escape so easily from the catastrophe in which it involved itself

1847
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,192
Pride was everywhere to be humbled

1848
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,496
And nowhere to receive its satisfaction

1849
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,080
No Splendid Harmony was to Crown the wonderful achievements

1850
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:33,408
No prize to reward the sacrifices of the combatant

1851
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,528
Victory was to be bought so dear as to be almost indistinguishable from defeat

1852
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,344
It was not to give even security to the victors

1853
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,696
There never was to be the silence following the great words of peace

1854
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:50,816
To the convulsions of the struggle must exceed the impotent turmoil of the aftermath

1855
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
Noble hopes

1856
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:57,472
Hi comradeship Inglorious during rain every nation Toledo only to disappointment

1857
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
Dissolution

1858
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,520
And prostration

1859
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
The sufferings and impoverishment of people's might arrest their Warfare the collapse of the defeated might still the

1860
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:06,944
Cannonade

1861
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,248
But their hatreds continue on a PS

1862
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,296
And their quarrels are still on set

1863
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,624
The most complete Victory ever gained in arms

1864
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,184
Espanol to solve the European problem

1865
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,744
How to remove the dangers which produce the war

1866
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,792
And quote

1867
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,144
The war was entering a new phase

1868
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Buffets

1869
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,728
A stalemate

1870
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,824
What do you do to break the stalemate

1871
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,944
That was the main challenge facing commanders on all sides

1872
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,248
At 1915 rolls around

1873
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
And you know later in the war

1874
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,880
The Allied generals especially will get labeled

1875
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,160
It was butchers

1876
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Blockhead

1877
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,768
Some people who can't think their way out of a paper bag

1878
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:58,656
And in some of that's Justified later in the conflict but we have to cut them quite a lot of slack early on because

1879
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:05,312
Leave Western Front in the trench warfare and everything begins to solidify all of these generals on all sides

1880
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:08,128
You're confronted with circumstances that there are no metrics for

1881
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,712
There is no data on how you deal with this

1882
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:16,832
They have to learn they have to experiment and then they have to look at the data afterwards the problem is

1883
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,112
Is in this conflict

1884
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:21,440
Any experimentation in the military Laboratory

1885
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,232
Human beings are the lab rats

1886
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
And you learn at the

1887
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
Of human Carnage

1888
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Now

1889
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:35,008
The Allies are more willing to do this they have more Lab Rats to play with in this becomes

1890
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:38,080
Huge feature in the early part of 1915 because

1891
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,384
If you are Sir John French the British

1892
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
Or if you are

1893
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,688
Justice shop

1894
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,456
The French Commander

1895
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
You know that if this thing has devolved from a wild swinging boxing encounter in the first round just something that small

1896
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
More like a wrestling match where both combatants are

1897
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,208
Holding each other in a death grip

1898
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,000
But that works in your favor

1899
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,792
You're the stronger comeback

1900
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,376
You have more man you are more industrial power you control the Seas

1901
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
If it's going to go that way you're going to win

1902
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:08,800
That you may not want to have to be as hurt as you may have to be to make that work

1903
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:11,616
Worst case scenario long-term

1904
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
You're going to win that in cash

1905
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,688
It's the German commands

1906
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,992
Sanders that are forced to think outside the box

1907
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
Because they're not

1908
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
The problem is

1909
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,136
Is the box that they have to think outside of

1910
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:28,000
Is the one that was worked on for decades before the first world war came out

1911
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
To create

1912
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,816
Laws of war

1913
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:34,400
Humanitarian restrictions on what you could do

1914
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,168
Ways to pray

1915
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:38,752
Protect civilians non-combatants and even combatants from

1916
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,800
Your things that were considered to be

1917
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,592
Unsportsmanlike or

1918
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,664
Extra horrific more horrific than it needed to be

1919
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,736
Remember in the first episode we talked about things like The Hague

1920
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Conference

1921
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,296
Ways to make war

1922
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,600
Conform to international law

1923
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
The problem was

1924
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,952
The Germans in the Central Powers were now in that

1925
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,280
Position that everyone kind of knew was going to happen

1926
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,840
You know when you wrote those laws of war which is

1927
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,632
They have to decide whether or not

1928
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,936
Adhering to international law

1929
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,728
Is worth losing a war

1930
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,800
Can you begin to see

1931
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,824
Both sides

1932
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
Try to use

1933
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:21,504
Asymmetrical Warfare and new technology to break the stalemate and a lot of what use are the very things

1934
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
Prohibited

1935
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,064
Annie's pre-war agreement

1936
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:29,184
A perfect example starts in late 1914 when German warships

1937
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
Open fire

1938
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,256
On British coastal town

1939
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,792
Kill more than a hundred

1940
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,072
British citizens

1941
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,888
Becomes a wonderful propaganda tool

1942
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,960
For the Allies to cite the baby killers of Germany

1943
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:43,776
But that's nothing compared to what's coming in 1950

1944
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,592
The first thing that happens is a

1945
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,872
Absolute benchmark

1946
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Arkin

1947
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Warfare

1948
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,200
When in January

1949
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
The German start

1950
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,016
Really

1951
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,600
Trying to get involved in what we call today strategic bomb

1952
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:01,952
No aircraft have been in use since the very moment the war started

1953
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,232
One of these

1954
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,560
Excuses that the Germans used

1955
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,960
For attacking France was they said that some plane had come from France and bombs nurenberg at the very moment that the Warsaw

1956
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Started

1957
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,264
Which is probably nonsense

1958
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:20,384
But it shows that there were airplanes involved in the conflict from the very beginning but anyways.

1959
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,200
Really didn't involve the laws of war

1960
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:30,112
All of the Air Force's put together in the world when the war started had less than 500 plane

1961
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,928
What planes they did have

1962
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,280
Turned out to be wonderfully valuable tools for reconnaissance which

1963
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,560
Was what

1964
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,864
Air power has been used for

1965
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,704
Earlier than this time even in the American Civil War there were hot air balloons

1966
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,288
That they would use to see what the enemy was doing in the distance

1967
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,336
Planes were wonderful for that

1968
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:55,200
They also turned out to be fantastic in the more technologically sophisticated armies

1969
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,760
It was known as artillery spot

1970
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:03,136
And that allowed Your Guns to shoot at Targets that the Gunners couldn't see

1971
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,440
And you could shoot for example

1972
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:11,072
In a Faraway over a hill and if it was an airplane there they could tell you what was happening and that was

1973
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:16,704
Interesting enough to trying to explain without radios and everything what was happening but they could tell you that your shot.

1974
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,544
Tell short or long or was too far to the left or too far to the right

1975
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:24,384
And this gave a huge Advantage the armies that can make that work

1976
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,200
Less sophisticated armies like the Russians couldn't

1977
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,760
And hence were relegated to shooting at things they could own

1978
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
Only see you at

1979
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:35,136
But this early on in the fighting you can see how primitive Things Are

1980
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,696
Because early on when aircraft

1981
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,744
Wooden counter enemy aircraft

1982
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
Didn't have any way to do anything about

1983
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
And they were

1984
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
Taking handgun

1985
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,912
These Pilots up in the plane with them

1986
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:50,496
And trying to take potshots with their pistols at the enemy air pilot

1987
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Let me know

1988
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,080
Sophisticated things are at this stage in the war

1989
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
It's only when

1990
01:30:56,128 --> 01:31:02,016
The Germans run up against the in a trench warfare in the Western Front and they're forced to start looking for things

1991
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,832
That might help them your break the stalemate

1992
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:07,136
They noticed they have the greatest Zeppelin

1993
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Fleet in the world

1994
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,976
Zeppelins of course are lighter than air

1995
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,560
Blimps dirigibles those kinds of things

1996
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,376
And before the war the Germans have built 10 or 12 of them

1997
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:21,472
And had them sort of sitting aside when the war started which scared

1998
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
Their enemies

1999
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:27,616
Probably more than they should have they sort of had a fleet in being role where

2000
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,920
People like Churchill and Britain at the beach

2001
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,944
And worried about

2002
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,224
What are the German Zeppelin

2003
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
Mike the German Zeppelin

2004
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,368
That was probably out of all proportion to what the German Zeppelins could do

2005
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,952
The Germans try to use them at the beginning of the war for example

2006
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,232
Renovated

2007
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,304
Belgium and had to try to deal with those forts a couple of zeppelins

2008
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,096
Play Wolverine trying to drop some bombs

2009
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
When the stalemate on the Western Front reaches its real

2010
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
Uno

2011
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Calcification moment

2012
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,056
The German start looking for ways to use these tools that they have

2013
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,616
And there is no metrics

2014
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:06,016
Just like to run any metrics on the Western Front to try to figure out how to break that Stanley there's no metrics that will tell you what these Zeppelin

2015
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,552
Will do if a bomb

2016
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,600
Targets in another country

2017
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
Was a British theorist

2018
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,696
Who suggested that the very power

2019
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
S&S

2020
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,744
The people

2021
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,376
You don't need another country in their home country feel when the enemy is able to with impunity

2022
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,448
Fly over your territory and bomb you

2023
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:28,544
He suggested that if they bombed the civilians with confetti

2024
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,104
It wouldn't make any difference it would still

2025
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,712
Damage their morale terribly because it's a feeling like you can't be defended even at home

2026
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,808
The place that most people tend to feel safe at this stage in military history

2027
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,368
They were people arguing

2028
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,160
The German High command saying

2029
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:47,488
For all we know these Zeppelins could win the war

2030
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,536
And before the war at these

2031
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,888
In a big conferences that were part of trying to come up with International laws of war

2032
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,288
You're there were rules discussed about how bombing should work I mean should you have to give the city that you're going to vomit

2033
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,336
Chance to surrender before we bombed them

2034
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,360
And

2035
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:07,456
Lest you think only the Germans were doing this both the British and the French were sending

2036
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,272
In a small bombing raids over into Germany

2037
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:16,672
And Germany was sending small bombing raids with aircraft that were holding little hand bombs out of the open-top

2038
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,720
Pits and dropping them but nothing significant

2039
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,512
Nothing like sending large

2040
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,304
Numbers of Zeppelin

2041
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,840
All together

2042
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,864
Embalming

2043
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,936
January 1915 the Germans launched

2044
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
The first one of those

2045
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,264
They go after

2046
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Comport

2047
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Facilities

2048
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Britain

2049
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,224
The problem with this is the same problem they're going to have any early second world war which is you may say you're trying to hit military

2050
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:46,624
Target but the accuracy is so terrible you're lucky to fly over a city the size of London

2051
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,904
And be able to hit it

2052
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
Buddy's Port facilities end up being

2053
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,048
An example of an early example of when civilians get hit

2054
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,376
With these weapons will start bombing London in May 19th

2055
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
15

2056
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,728
And of course it becomes a propaganda Victory right away for the allies

2057
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,800
Again label the Germans baby killers

2058
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,920
Which make the Germans defensive as you might imagine there's a wonderful letter from a German Zeppelin leader

2059
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,456
To his mother

2060
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
Trying to

2061
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,784
Explain to her what apparently he's already tried to

2062
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,808
Explain to her before

2063
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
But this isn't

2064
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:23,232
The evil stop that this is Modern Warfare and yes it's not like you know knights fighting a duel

2065
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,304
But at the same time the Situation's different than win tonight

2066
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
It's fought duels

2067
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,656
People in the homefront are no longer innocent

2068
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,936
In Modern Warfare

2069
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,752
They are the ones who make the weapons

2070
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,544
That the soldiers require

2071
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,384
To fight if the soldiers can't break through on the Western Front what if you could

2072
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,736
Prevent one side from building the shelves necessary to keep the war going

2073
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,784
This is where the idea

2074
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,808
Of the home phone

2075
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
First really take

2076
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
6 hole

2077
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,416
And it becomes the justification for attack

2078
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,952
Packing civilians in other country

2079
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,536
There's a letter that the German Zeppelin leader writes to his mother

2080
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
Trying to make his

2081
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,656
Action City apparently feels guilty over himself

2082
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,448
Sound morally okay

2083
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
Quote

2084
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,056
We who strike the enemy where his heart beats

2085
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
I've been slandered as baby killer

2086
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,896
And murderers of women

2087
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,712
What we do is repugnant even to us

2088
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
Necessary

2089
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
Very necessary

2090
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,088
Nowadays there's no such animal is a non-combat

2091
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,904
Modern Warfare is total warfare

2092
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,488
A soldier cannot function at the front without the factory worker

2093
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,304
The farmer and all the other providers behind him

2094
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,864
You and I mother have discussed this subject

2095
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,912
And I know you understand what I say

2096
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,216
My man are brave and honorable

2097
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,752
Their causes holy

2098
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,312
How can they send while doing their Duty

2099
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,592
Is what we do is fight

2100
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,408
They may frightfulness be Germany's salvation

2101
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
And quote

2102
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
This

2103
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
Same attitude

2104
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,320
Will be applied

2105
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
To the other

2106
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,392
Hearts of warfare the

2107
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:58,208
Rear their ugly head in 1915

2108
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:03,584
Because of the needs of the situation I mean flamethrowers are one of the technological weapons

2109
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,168
UniFirst appear in 1950 and again using science

2110
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,216
In ways to try to

2111
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
Create opening

2112
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:14,592
Weather actively on the battlefield or strategically in the war itself

2113
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,688
Another perfect example of this from the first World War

2114
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,528
Has to do with another one of these new Weapons Systems

2115
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,320
Challenged

2116
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,880
Angel theories in Orthodoxy

2117
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
One of them had to do

2118
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,000
With rules concerning Naval blockade

2119
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:39,168
When the first world war breaks out the British and the French navy literally sweep the Seas clean of German ship

2120
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,472
Military & merchant ship

2121
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,288
Disordered Naval blockade was

2122
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:50,688
One of the main things that Britain could offer early in the war they certainly were going to offer millions and millions of troops they didn't have millions

2123
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
The troops to have the greatest Navy in the world

2124
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,784
And just like in Napoleon's time

2125
01:36:55,552 --> 01:37:01,696
On a strong Continental power takes hold you shut down their merchant ship and you close their ports you don't allow them to get any

2126
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:05,024
Materials resources anything from anyone else if you can help it

2127
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
Another word

2128
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,888
International laws concerning what you were allowed to keep from

2129
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,936
Combatants you weren't supposed to keep

2130
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,216
Food stops are the

2131
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:19,616
The needs of everyday life you can keep weapons in those kind of things but the British and the French pushed those rules way past abound

2132
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,640
Common sense

2133
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
And work

2134
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:28,064
In a classifying things like cotton Fabrics is war necessary material they weren't really going to allow anything through

2135
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Now

2136
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,672
For all of human history

2137
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
There's been sort of a of a

2138
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,512
Calculus you could count on

2139
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,328
And that's that the weaker Naval power

2140
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,912
Cannot blockade the stronger Naval Power by sea

2141
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,448
How could you write

2142
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:50,080
Your ships try to blockade a country like Great Britain they'll just send their Navy out to sweep your ships off the sea

2143
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,616
What if your ships aren't

2144
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,640
On the sea

2145
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,712
What is the ships that are trying to blockade

2146
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,528
And island nation like Britain nienstedt

2147
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,808
Under the sea

2148
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
The Germans had summary

2149
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,696
This is not a brand new invention

2150
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:09,024
When did finally reached a stage of Effectiveness where

2151
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,328
The British were to find out

2152
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,704
At the old Naval orthodoxies about what a weaker Naval power could and couldn't do

2153
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,984
A change

2154
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,312
There was no answer at this point in history

2155
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,592
To the submarine

2156
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,432
Surface vessels could not detect them unless the submarine

2157
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,480
Surface they couldn't destroy them

2158
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:33,088
Germany had a lot less submarines than Britain and France but here's the thing

2159
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,904
Britain and France couldn't do anything with their submarines

2160
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,184
They couldn't use their

2161
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:43,584
Submarines against German Merchant shipping because there wasn't any German Merchant shipping about five minutes after the war breaks

2162
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,912
The surface fleets of France and Britain thought of that

2163
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,984
But Germany surface lead which is one of the

2164
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:55,872
Things that have precipitated the war one of the many causes it's always cited is the naval arms race between

2165
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
Britain and Germany

2166
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,456
State import for the most part

2167
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:02,528
Knight of the British know the Germans were willing to risk

2168
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,344
He's enormously expensive

2169
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,952
And hard to replace surface ships that were they would have called capital

2170
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,744
Battleships

2171
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,144
Unbelievably expensive ones mean for example the British had just commissioned the class of ships known as the Queen Elizabeth class battleship

2172
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:23,008
Which was so good in the first world war they still be very effective units in the Second World War

2173
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,128
But if a cheap Little Submarine could sink one of those ships with a torpedo

2174
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,456
That's nothing to any Naval commanders are willing to

2175
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:37,856
Risk and so all of a sudden everybody's being so careful with their big ships that it leaves openings for The Little Ships to make

2176
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,184
Everyone thought at the beginning of the war

2177
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,280
But these submarines would be used in the military sense against other warships

2178
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,608
By February 1915

2179
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,168
The Germans are now using them against Merchant

2180
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:55,776
Shipping and all of a sudden the greatest Navy in the world finds that they can't defend their merchant shipping

2181
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,592
Because of a new technological creation

2182
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:02,688
Or a weaker Naval power has the potential to turn the tables

2183
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,224
On the best weapon

2184
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
Did the great Naval Powers have

2185
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,320
Blockading weaker Navy

2186
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
Powers

2187
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:12,928
And the British were doing a very good job of keeping goods and

2188
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:15,232
Weapons from flowing into Germany by sea

2189
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:19,328
Are finding out that the Germans had the capability to do the same thing back to them

2190
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,144
Now the big issue

2191
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,704
Will surface if you'll pardon the pun

2192
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
Around whether or not

2193
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:31,360
The Warfare should follow the old famous rules of the sea or not

2194
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
The old famous rules of the sea

2195
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,224
Where did you didn't destroy

2196
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,576
Merchant shipping non-military vessels without letting them know

2197
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
That piracy

2198
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
You basically are supposed to

2199
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:47,232
Give them a message and say we're seizing your ship let them

2200
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:52,096
Take their people off the ship on lifeboats and stuff and then you can either sink the vessel that you

2201
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:55,424
You know more after or you can take it as a prize and capture it

2202
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:58,496
The problem is when a submarine to try to do this

2203
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,288
It open the damn up

2204
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:04,896
To being destroyed and the British played this up they started putting guns on all these Merchant ships

2205
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,224
So if the Germans came up and did what they were supposed to do

2206
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:14,624
Tell the merchant ship captured your prize of War now get your lifeboats out get your people off the ship and will sink it

2207
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:21,536
They'd often pull the canvas off a gun and start shooting at the now vulnerable submarine cuz it had to surface in order to

2208
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:24,096
Comply with the international laws of war right

2209
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,912
Did the Germans were having these debates

2210
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,448
In 1915

2211
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,008
About whether or not they should do that at all

2212
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,824
Maybe they should just sink these vessels

2213
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,640
Without surfacing or warning them or anything

2214
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,712
But this again would look like the Germans were

2215
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:42,272
You know the ones outside international law

2216
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,832
We're the ones who were the bad guy

2217
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,112
And worse

2218
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
Then that

2219
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:53,536
They risk alienating neutral powers the most important of which was the United States which was a very

2220
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,864
A maritime power

2221
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:03,264
Huge in the trade and by the way at this point in the war if you wanted to say who is gaining from the first World War

2222
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,312
It's the United States because

2223
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,616
One of the things that all these powers do

2224
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,480
When they find out they can't produce enough shells and weapons and War materials to keep the war going

2225
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,528
Is borrow money from the United States

2226
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,344
And then turn around and spend that borrowed money

2227
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,648
On stopping production from the United States

2228
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,232
Often called the Great neutral

2229
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:27,328
The United States just wants to be able to keep delivering your stuff word has to go

2230
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,912
They're already getting tents with the British

2231
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:35,520
In a searching their ships and saying that this ship for that ship can't dock at this point of that port

2232
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,056
When the German start

2233
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,848
Sinking Merchant vessels

2234
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,152
Sometimes those Merchant vessels have Americans

2235
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:41,920
On them

2236
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,224
In early 1915

2237
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,528
One of those vessels was called the Lusitania

2238
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,344
The Lusitania if you want to think of it

2239
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,160
Inner to conceptualize what we're talking about here

2240
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,464
Is very much like the Titanic

2241
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,280
An extremely large ocean liner

2242
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:03,936
A passenger ship this is how people got from the old world to the new world and back again across the Atlantic in the day

2243
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,728
He's before transatlantic Air flight

2244
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
Now

2245
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,080
Controversy has raged ever since

2246
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,128
The German submarine

2247
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,664
Which open fire on the loose

2248
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
Betania sank that ship

2249
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:18,272
On whether or not it was a legitimate Target of War

2250
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
It have munitions

2251
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
If it did

2252
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,368
Supposedly they could sink it

2253
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:29,024
Is a lot of evidence that suggested did and some conspiracy theories out there that suggests that people like Winston Churchill

2254
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,816
Assured that it did

2255
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,352
So that it would be another

2256
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:38,496
In nail in the coffin he was starting to construct that would eventually get the United States into the war more than a hundred Americans

2257
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,032
Turn on the Lusitania.

2258
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,128
At various times in the war

2259
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,712
The Germans would start up what was called unrestricted

2260
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,992
Submarine warfare

2261
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,064
With a shot of anything that looked like an enemy ship of any

2262
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,368
And other times where they would stop

2263
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,952
Because there was a huge debate within the halls of German leadership

2264
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:01,792
Over whether or not they gained more or lost more when they did this

2265
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,864
If the United States comes into the war it's a huge loss

2266
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,912
But it's one of the few ways that

2267
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:08,448
In 1915

2268
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Vacancy

2269
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,264
But they can bring Britain

2270
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,288
To its knees

2271
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
They can starve thataylaa

2272
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:18,176
In ways that the British never could have imagined before the war

2273
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,504
Because before the war they thought you had to have a bigger Navy to do that

2274
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,808
Technology and turn the table

2275
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,112
On the greatest naval power in history

2276
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
Perhaps

2277
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
The most iconic

2278
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:33,280
Asymmetrical Warfare

2279
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
Of this.

2280
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:40,960
Has to do with something that was a big worry at the Hague conferences in the late 1800s and early 1900s

2281
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,752
Something that

2282
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,128
New shows the desperation of the Germans at this stage in the war that they would Resort

2283
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
Involves the use

2284
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,480
What the Hague conference call

2285
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,528
Asphyxiating

2286
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,552
Gases

2287
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,904
Everyone is realized by the late 1800s

2288
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:05,280
That the modern chemical industry as we would recognize it today it come of age

2289
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,864
Meaning we're all sort of explosive gunpowder's and everything

2290
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,424
They were so much more explosive than

2291
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
You know I've been the case in Napoleon

2292
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,824
Time less than a century before hand so everyone was aware of the possibilities

2293
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:24,480
Gunpowder and explosives were just more powerful versions of weapons that have been used for a very long time

2294
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,552
The chemical industry made possible the use of weapons

2295
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
3 never been used

2296
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
No one knew

2297
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:35,488
And what the effects if they were used would be and so at the Hayden conference in 1899

2298
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,024
The issue was addressed

2299
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,864
The conference outlawed the use of quote

2300
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,168
Poison or poisoned weapons

2301
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,192
Arms

2302
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:49,056
Projectiles or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering

2303
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:52,384
And projectile design for the diffusion of asphyxiating

2304
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
Or deleterious gases

2305
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,456
And quote

2306
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,528
Buddy 1915

2307
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,600
Germany's looking at all these laws of war

2308
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,392
Completely different land

2309
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
As we said the trade-off

2310
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,440
Between

2311
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,232
Follow international law

2312
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,512
Or lose the war

2313
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:15,424
What's more they're dealing with this front as we said on the Western Front that had solidified an interesting way

2314
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
You said you have a

2315
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,496
Continuous trench system

2316
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:20,800
From the Swiss border all the way

2317
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,824
You know up to the

2318
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
Ocean

2319
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,408
And the interesting part is

2320
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:29,760
A lot of that territory is not really good fighting ground

2321
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:33,856
A lot of its to Marshall a lot of us to Forest did a lot of it

2322
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,464
The Germans are in such an amazingly strong position you'd be an idiot to challenge them

2323
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:44,352
Which leaves the same few spots as good areas to launch offensive

2324
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,888
Your campaign

2325
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,424
Which means

2326
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,704
That those areas but

2327
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,008
Become the most horrific battlefields

2328
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,032
In human history

2329
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,384
Because they basically don't move very much for the entire War

2330
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
And

2331
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:59,200
The same ground is

2332
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:02,784
Cloud up by artillery shells over and over again

2333
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,088
People that died

2334
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,648
In some of these places are never buried

2335
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,928
And so you have

2336
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
A Charnel House of Horrors

2337
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:14,304
Of people who just been killed the other day

2338
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:20,704
People that were killed a month ago people that were killed a year ago all in the same spot and you was the soldier have to leave in the

2339
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
This environment

2340
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,776
Kinetochores ignores

2341
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:27,360
The more mundane aspects which is if you are trapped in a trench

2342
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
And you can't move without being shot

2343
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,968
What do you go to the bathroom

2344
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,272
Early on in the combat

2345
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,576
British soldiers were talking about taking

2346
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:42,976
The German helmets with the spikes on them as souvenirs for the war but quickly realized that the best thing you can do with those things

2347
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,768
Is use them as a receptacle

2348
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:51,424
For the call of Nature and then toss it as far away from the trenches possible so that the smell of thousands of men doing this

2349
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,960
In a confined space over

2350
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
Years

2351
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,080
Doesn't overwhelm you was reset certain Battlegrounds like Ypres

2352
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,616
Will become famous

2353
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:03,712
For their smile and you will be able to smell them before you get anywhere near them

2354
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,064
Canadians are arriving in early 1915 in numbers

2355
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,624
And they take over some of these battlefields

2356
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,416
You know where

2357
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:19,328
Nothing has changed I mean no one's going out and buried anybody that was one of the things by the way during the Christmas Truce has

2358
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,352
That we talked about

2359
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:24,704
It was the number one thing both sides tried to do which tells you how crazy

2360
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,776
The smell in the situation and I'll horrifying must have been but

2361
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:32,384
They jump out of these trenches and start to try to bury these bodies that have been out there for months

2362
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,736
Canadian soldier on the Western Front arriving at the trenches of Ypres

2363
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
Early 1950

2364
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,832
Trenches that have been occupied by

2365
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,904
In a Gurkha forces from around India

2366
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,208
Anna Canadian Sergeant name

2367
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,744
SV Britain

2368
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:49,024
Describes

2369
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,048
His

2370
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,072
In welcome

2371
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,352
To the Western Front

2372
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,400
In suitably horrific

2373
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,168
Terms

2374
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
He says quote

2375
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:01,056
Left at 6:30 p.m. for Reserve trenches

2376
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,872
And reached our Reserve dugouts VST Julia

2377
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,408
Just rathole

2378
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,712
One hell of an accommodation

2379
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:11,808
Got to the trenches as a fatigue party with steak and sandbags

2380
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,112
I know there were Reserve trenches

2381
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
They were so rotten

2382
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,976
No trench is it all in Parts just isolated mount

2383
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:22,560
Found Germans feet sticking up through the ground

2384
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:26,656
The gurk is it actually used human bodies instead of sandbags

2385
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:32,544
Right beside the stream where we were working with a bodies of two dead since November last

2386
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,640
1 face downward in full marching order with his kid on his back

2387
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,920
He died game

2388
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:41,504
Stench something awful and dead all around

2389
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,832
Water rats and made a home of their decomposed bodies

2390
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:49,696
Visiting the barbed wire with Ray ordinary wire strung across

2391
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,744
Quit about 1 a.m.

2392
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,560
Came back to our Dugout and found them on fire

2393
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:56,608
Add to Market St Julien

2394
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
And put up in a roofless house

2395
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:01,472
Not a roof left on anything in the whole place

2396
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,800
Found our sack of food have been stolen and we were family

2397
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:09,152
Certainly a most unlucky day for I lost my cherished pipe

2398
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,688
Bad at 4 a.m.

2399
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
And quote

2400
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,808
Call the Canadian start the battlefield

2401
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,904
And the traditional aspects of what war had already come to be by that time

2402
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,696
Where's bad as it was going to get

2403
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:23,488
They were frightfully mistake

2404
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,304
Can fight this battle that will be called the Second Battle of Ypres

2405
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,864
Is the first time

2406
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,168
That the major gas attack happen

2407
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,728
And the Canadians will be the

2408
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,264
Reason that it doesn't

2409
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:39,104
Turn out to be a huge tragedy for the Allied cause

2410
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,432
The other reason will be that the Germans had no idea

2411
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:47,808
That their attack was going to be this successful in this becomes a pattern with all this new technology

2412
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,344
Very often

2413
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,624
The Commanders

2414
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:55,744
Are trying to figure out whether this new technology is going to be something that's effective and useful

2415
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,096
So they try it out on a small scale not really expecting to make good use of it

2416
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:03,424
And because of the sheer shock of the new stuff

2417
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:06,240
It proved wonderfully effective

2418
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:12,640
But it can't be exploited because the generals who authorized it to use hadn't planned to explode if they were hoping to test

2419
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,200
Get out a little bit and then if it was good they'll use it later

2420
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:19,808
But by the time later comes around the other side has figured out countermeasure

2421
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,856
Gas work exactly like the

2422
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,672
And before it was used

2423
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:28,256
The German High command just as they did with submarine warfare

2424
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,816
Debated whether or not this was a good thing intensely

2425
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,632
As we said

2426
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
There were all these

2427
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:38,496
Laws of the Hague conference it set down saying you couldn't use the stuff

2428
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:45,408
And some of the German leaders that said we sign these papers and others had found little loopholes like legal loopholes it said

2429
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
Couldn't use shells

2430
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,968
But nothing said anything about

2431
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,016
Just taking the lids off of

2432
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
In a containers

2433
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:54,368
But had chlorine gas in them

2434
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,696
Historian Eric dhoombros rights

2435
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
Quote

2436
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:05,376
The same kind of murderously cold wartime mentality that would terminate 1200 civilians

2437
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:07,424
Aboard the Lusitania two weeks later

2438
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,216
Did not allow however

2439
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,264
Perspective international law

2440
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,664
German legal experts advise General falkenhayn that the attack could be justified because the gas was released

2441
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
From containers

2442
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
In fact

2443
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:21,248
Just to save artillery shells

2444
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,784
And not from projectiles

2445
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,576
On the other side of the debate

2446
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:28,160
Duke Albrecht averton Berg commander of the 6th Army

2447
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:31,488
Argue that unleashing this new weapon would not only be immoral

2448
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,792
But also dubious military value

2449
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:40,448
For the allies with the wind normally at their backs would probably send 10 times as much gas on the germ

2450
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,216
German positions

2451
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:44,288
Karl Von einem of the third Army agreed

2452
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,848
And then Express additional worries over the quote

2453
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:52,480
Tremendous Scandal and the quote that would compromise and disgrace Germany in the eyes of the world

2454
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:56,576
Quote War has nothing to do with chivalry anymore he wrote

2455
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:00,672
The higher civilization Rises the more vile man becomes

2456
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:01,952
And quote

2457
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,280
If anybody still had

2458
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,328
Any of those old

2459
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:10,912
19th century truly going back to ancient times

2460
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:17,568
Versions of the Romantic glorious heroic duel that they've been raised to believe that war was

2461
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,616
Operation

2462
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,896
Disinfectant

2463
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,944
Will cure them

2464
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,968
I'm such a little

2465
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,272
That will be the German name for the

2466
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,040
The program

2467
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,832
And the code word

2468
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,368
To start the operation

2469
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,928
Will be God punish England

2470
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
The operation balls

2471
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:37,536
Almost sick

2472
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,816
Mm cylinder

2473
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,888
Containing chlorine gas a by-product

2474
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:48,544
Of the German die manufacturing industry that the Germans are planted in the soil carefully overtime around the battlefield at E3

2475
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
In August 1915

2476
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,408
They took the tops off the container

2477
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,688
When the wind was right

2478
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,968
A letter

2479
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,504
Chlorine gas

2480
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,832
Blow across the battlefield toward the Allied trenches

2481
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
Which were occupied

2482
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,696
By french-algerian forces which involved

2483
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
French troops

2484
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,744
And Algerian troops

2485
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,560
And also the newly-arrived Canadian

2486
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,376
I didn't know what to make

2487
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,680
But they figured out pretty quickly

2488
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,216
It was

2489
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,496
Hell on Earth

2490
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:21,312
As one Indian soldier would ride his face

2491
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,080
Father after work

2492
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,616
This isn't War

2493
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,408
This is the end of the world

2494
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,712
The end of the world

2495
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,992
To some of these p

2496
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,784
People at the Second Battle of Ypres

2497
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,576
Look like a cloud

2498
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:33,856
Greenish-yellow gas

2499
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:37,440
It was floating across the battlefield so slowly

2500
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:40,256
You could actually walk ahead of it

2501
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:44,608
Because the soldiers didn't know what they were looking at most of them didn't move

2502
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,144
Until I hit them

2503
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,704
Again historian

2504
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,984
Eric Dorn brose

2505
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,336
Stretching 6000m along opposing line

2506
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,992
And bellowing high up into the air I think ghastly looking green yellow cloud of gas moved eerily and

2507
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,808
Threateningly with the breeze across no-man's-land

2508
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:10,464
The gaseous monstrosity took on a pinkish Hue from certain angles as the descending Western Sun show

2509
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
I'm through it

2510
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:17,120
To compound the shock and Terror German heavy artillery began to lay down a pounding barrage

2511
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,424
Two French Colonial divisions

2512
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,496
And a Canadian division were caught completely unaware

2513
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,264
Quote

2514
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,056
Take a look at this

2515
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:30,944
Said one Canadian artillery Observer to his Superior as he stared through binoculars it was coming towards them

2516
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,736
There's something funny going on

2517
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:36,320
Any dough for cover from the incoming shells

2518
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:38,368
But just then the wind shifted

2519
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,928
Compressing the gas cloud over the Algerian

2520
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
Whose forward units were in golf

2521
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,280
The soldiers grab their throats

2522
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:49,632
Choking and writhing in excruciating pain from the Searing chlorine gas

2523
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
In minutes

2524
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:54,496
Many hundreds lay drowning in fluids given off by the lungs

2525
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
Seeing this

2526
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,800
Others panic

2527
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
Drop their rifles and ran

2528
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,152
Leaving a 6 kilometer Gap in the line

2529
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
And quote

2530
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,784
Private William Quinton

2531
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,320
A British soldier

2532
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,624
Experienced his first gas attack

2533
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:13,952
Only about a week after the first time it has been used

2534
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,512
That Affair had caused

2535
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,560
The high command

2536
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,352
To tell the troops to soak

2537
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,680
Flannel in water and just put it over their noses is a

2538
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:27,264
Cheap easy attempt to try to forestall the gas

2539
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,336
But none of these soldiers knew what they were facing until they actually

2540
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,384
I had a gas attack hit them

2541
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,200
Which Clinton had hit him on May 1st

2542
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:35,968
1950

2543
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,736
Quote

2544
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,296
Suddenly over the top of our Frontline

2545
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:42,112
We saw what look like clouds of thin gray smoke

2546
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,928
Rolling slowly along with a slight wind

2547
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:48,768
It's under the ground reaching to the height of eight or nine feet and approached

2548
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,584
So slowly that a man walking could have kept ahead of it

2549
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,864
Gas

2550
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,656
The word quickly passed around

2551
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:57,216
Even though it had no Terror for us

2552
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:59,008
For we had not yet tasted it

2553
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,288
From our haversacks

2554
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,592
We hastily drew the flannel belts

2555
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:06,176
Soak them in water and tie them around our mouths and noses

2556
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:11,552
Suddenly through the communication trench came rushing a few khaki clad figures

2557
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,112
Your eyes glaring out of their heads

2558
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:17,440
Their hands tearing at their throats as they came on

2559
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:20,768
Some stumbled and fell in Lay writhing at the bottom of the trench

2560
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,352
Choking and gasping whilst those following trampled over them

2561
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:27,936
If ever man were raving mad with Terror these men were

2562
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:32,544
What was left of our section still crouched at the support into the communication Trench

2563
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:37,152
Are Frontline judging from the number of men who just come from it had been abandoned

2564
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,456
And we not waited for the first Russian German

2565
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,736
But they did not

2566
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:44,064
Come see our biggest enemy was now within a few yards of us

2567
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,112
And in the form of a cloud of gas

2568
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,904
We caught our first whiff of it

2569
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:52,512
No words of mine can ever describe my feelings as we inhaled the first mouth

2570
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:53,536
WeChat

2571
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,072
Spit and cough

2572
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,632
My lungs felt as though they were being burnt out

2573
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:59,168
But they were going to burst

2574
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,984
Red hot needles were being thrust into my eyes

2575
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,776
The first impulse was to run

2576
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:07,360
We just seen men running just certain death and new it

2577
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,944
Rather than stay and be choked into a slow and agonizing death

2578
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,016
It was one of those occasions when you do not know what you were doing

2579
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,344
The man who stayed with no braver than the man who ran away

2580
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,648
We crouched there terrified

2581
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
Stupify

2582
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,976
A large shell burst on the parapet

2583
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,512
Just where we were sheltered

2584
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:27,072
We were almost buried beneath the falling Earth

2585
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,888
Young Addington a chap about my own age

2586
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:33,728
Was screaming at the top of his voice and trying to free his buried legs

2587
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:37,824
He got free and before we could stop him he rushed off god-knows-where

2588
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,128
We then saw the reason for his screen

2589
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,688
His left arm was blown off above the elbow

2590
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:47,296
He left a trail of blood over my tunic is he climbed over me in a mad rush to get away

2591
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,088
And quote

2592
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
Clinton and his unit of Canadians

2593
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,208
Will block

2594
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
Heroic

2595
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:58,816
Play the hole that develops in the line keeping the Germans from breaking through

2596
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:05,472
German hadn't expected to break through the entire reason for this gas attack was to experiment with the gas

2597
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:10,848
And to cover the fact that the Germans were removing troops for use on the Eastern Front

2598
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,688
The German High command had no idea it was going to be this successful

2599
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,992
And no one had any idea how horrifying

2600
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,344
Private William Quinton in this unit will move up to the front line

2601
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,136
Animal experience

2602
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,672
The aftermath

2603
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,208
Of what the gas attack today

2604
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,744
The people who first encounter cat

2605
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,512
Hero quote

2606
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:35,168
Black in the face their tunics and shirt-fronts torn open at the NEX in their last desperate fight for breath

2607
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Many of them quite still

2608
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:41,824
While others were still wriggling and kicking in the agonies of the most awful death I've ever seen

2609
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,128
Some were wounded in the bargain

2610
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,176
And there gaping wounds lay open

2611
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,224
Blood still oozing from them

2612
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,296
One poor devil was tearing at his throat with his hands

2613
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,344
I doubt if you knew or felt

2614
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,136
Did he had only one hand

2615
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,464
And the other was just a stump where the hand should have been

2616
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,304
This Stumpy worked around his throat as if his hand was still there

2617
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,888
In the blood from it was streaming over his bluish black face and neck

2618
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,192
A few minutes later he was still

2619
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,008
Except for occasional shutters as he breathed his last

2620
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,544
And quote

2621
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:19,200
As I've said before in this program and I think I will say many times more

2622
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:23,040
This is the most horrifying sustained

2623
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,088
Situation

2624
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:26,880
Terrible

2625
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:29,696
I've ever seen soldiers forced to endure

2626
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,488
And millions

2627
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:34,816
Millions of people will get to experience this before the end of

2628
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,584
Conflict

2629
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:37,120
My own grandfather

2630
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
Bagasse

2631
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,168
On the Western Front

2632
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,704
And he was never the same after

2633
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,056
The use of poison gas

2634
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,104
Is a defining moment

2635
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,128
Quentin Nesconset

2636
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,408
One that puts

2637
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:51,456
The Final End stamp

2638
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:54,784
19th century Victorian romantic ideals

2639
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,624
You can't pretend anymore when human beings are being treated

2640
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
Either way you would treat

2641
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:03,744
Ants with a can of raid or some other insect

2642
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Decide

2643
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,584
Even before gas is used

2644
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,656
The times of London the great paper in Britain

2645
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:13,216
In November 1914 will run

2646
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,496
An article

2647
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,520
Which

2648
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:20,128
Seems amazing by modern standards but of course we're in a post

2649
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:22,432
First and second World War era now

2650
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:28,576
Those people were coming into this conflict with certain ideals and understandings of what war was going to be like

2651
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,368
And the trenches

2652
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
And the

2653
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:34,208
Continual death for no apparent gain

2654
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,536
Head shaking their whole view of what war was all about

2655
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,352
In November 1914 the times ran this

2656
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,376
Peace quote

2657
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:45,472
All the spectacular side of the war has gone

2658
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:47,264
Never to reappear

2659
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,568
Trenches and always trenches

2660
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:54,176
And within range of the concealed guns invisibility the supreme law

2661
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:58,272
Day after day The Butchery of the Unknown by the Unseen

2662
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:00,064
War has become stupid

2663
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,368
The screen on the Infantry is tremendous

2664
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,648
And it is endless

2665
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:08,000
At the cost of thousands of lives a few hundred yards maybe gain

2666
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:11,840
But rarely indeed does even the most brilliant attack produce anything

2667
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:18,496
Fresh troops brought up under cover of a tremendous artillery fire which opens up by surprise me effective

2668
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:22,080
Breech but only with heavy loss can such an attack be carried through

2669
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:23,872
And quote

2670
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,176
That little

2671
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:29,760
Run-down about how War has become stupid now

2672
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,552
Accurately describes

2673
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:35,392
What the entire year of 1915 on the Western Front will be like

2674
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,696
Nobody is going to move

2675
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,720
At all

2676
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:42,048
An amazing numbers of people are going to die

2677
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:44,096
In efforts to gain

2678
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:48,704
Now in the defense of the generals who ordered these efforts to gain nothing

2679
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:53,312
They have to figure out how to do things including experimentation

2680
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,104
To our minds

2681
02:02:55,872 --> 02:03:02,016
You would think you would stop after a while but these people had to figure out how to win the warm and they didn't even know for example

2682
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,296
How to get through

2683
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:08,928
The ever-expanding fields and barbed wire that crop up between the two enemy trench line

2684
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:15,328
You have to have battles to Simply see what kind of artillery blows up enough of the wire to create a pack

2685
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:17,376
Have for your troops to attack through

2686
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,216
This is lessons being learned

2687
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:25,312
At an Incredible cost but there's really no other way to do it

2688
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:30,176
It's fascinating to look at pictures already in 1915

2689
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:33,504
Six to eight months after the war has started

2690
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,600
And see how this. Has become sort of an estuary

2691
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,416
Between the 19th and 20th Century

2692
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:44,768
Will you see the combination of the two centuries blending I mean

2693
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:49,632
When the war starts you a Cavalry that is indistinguishable from Napoleon's

2694
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,984
Cuirassier is going off to war with gleaming breastplates and horsehair

2695
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,520
Helmets and Sabers and

2696
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,824
Heel spurs and white gloves

2697
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,152
And now you have gas and soon you're going to have

2698
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:07,552
You know German Cavalry Lancers for example as soon as 1916 rolls around they start having the same helmet that the Germans were

2699
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,600
Using the second world war the Stahl helm

2700
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:16,000
And you have no Cavalry with lances and a Stahl Helm and a gas mask and it's the perfect example

2701
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,024
All of the two errors

2702
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
Blending

2703
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,864
So like I said a historical estuary

2704
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,424
Hugo from

2705
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,960
Let Napoleonic

2706
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:30,848
Feeling of war with French soldier going off into the conflict with bright red pants

2707
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:35,200
You know in 6 to 8 months later we have gas we have flamethrowers

2708
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:41,600
We have hundreds of guns at a time firing on Battlefield we have trenches barbed wire snipers every

2709
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,368
Freeware

2710
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,696
This is not what anybody thought was going to happen

2711
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,488
Anna Begins

2712
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,792
To unhinge a lot of people

2713
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,840
Which is something that

2714
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,888
Is new to The Human Experience

2715
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:54,912
At least

2716
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,192
As far as

2717
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,216
The modern

2718
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,264
European armies are concerned

2719
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,104
People begin to go insane

2720
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,944
To lose their mind to have their nerve shadow

2721
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:10,528
This is something that I said no just War

2722
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:12,064
Does something that seems

2723
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,832
Unbelievable

2724
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,624
The ability to take

2725
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,720
One of the most stressful situations human beings ever find themselves in

2726
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,000
And make it worse

2727
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,536
Is all war

2728
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,840
Psychologically challenging isn't it

2729
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,400
Made the first World War

2730
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,936
More difficult

2731
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:30,752
Then almost any other major conflict you can think of

2732
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:34,336
It's not just the changes in Warfare although that significant

2733
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,896
How long the soldiers

2734
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,920
We're forced

2735
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,944
To deal with it

2736
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:44,576
Take one of the worst battles in human history to be a soldier in

2737
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,368
The famous

2738
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,440
Second Punic War battle of cannae Right Where

2739
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:54,816
Hannibal and his carthaginians famously surround maybe 80000 Romans

2740
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:57,632
And then spend the entire afternoon

2741
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,936
And slaughtering them by hand

2742
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:02,496
Cutting their way into the center of this

2743
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:06,336
Crowd of doomed men who have to wait all day

2744
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:08,384
In the most unbelievably

2745
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:14,784
Disorienting environment you can think of they can't hear anything they can't see anything there's dust everywhere but they know what's coming

2746
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:18,368
You're told by the ancient writer that's so terrible

2747
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:22,720
It when the carthaginians cut their way into the center of this mass of doomed men

2748
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:25,024
They will find that some Roman soldiers

2749
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,120
Back so tightly that they couldn't even raise their hands in the crowd of people

2750
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,424
Just sunk to their knees

2751
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:35,264
Dug a little hole with their hands put their head in the hole and covered it up

2752
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,312
Committing suicide

2753
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,872
Because either they had lost their mind

2754
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,408
Or they come to the conclusion

2755
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,432
Why wait

2756
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:47,040
That's that's supposed to show you how terrible the situation is

2757
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,832
In the first World War

2758
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:51,136
You begin to see very quickly

2759
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,672
People who are

2760
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:53,952
Unhinged

2761
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,024
These soldiers

2762
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,352
Trapped at the Battle of cannae we're having a historic

2763
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,632
Bad day

2764
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,936
But it was one day

2765
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:08,800
A week or two before that battle they were in relatively little danger

2766
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:11,872
If they survived a week or two after that battle same thing

2767
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:14,176
The soldiers in the Great War

2768
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,968
Had no such luxury

2769
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:19,296
They had to deal with these circumstances

2770
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,088
Day after day

2771
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:28,256
And after this war military psychologist looking into the phenomenon of what will later be known as shell shock

2772
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,048
Will determine

2773
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:34,656
Under the conditions the soldiers were fighting in it doesn't matter how Brave you were

2774
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,680
Eventually

2775
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,472
A WeChat a different

2776
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:40,544
Threshold we could stand but eventually anyone would lose

2777
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:44,128
Think about what's involved

2778
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,432
And you begin to understand why first

2779
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,456
Take

2780
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,992
The shelling itself

2781
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:49,760
Which is

2782
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,040
Something that

2783
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:56,160
Is it really impossible for any of us to understand there are very few people living that have ever

2784
02:07:56,416 --> 02:08:00,768
Been through the kinds of shelling that these World War 1 soldiers routinely had to deal with

2785
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,304
And it's

2786
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,840
Very hard to describe

2787
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:08,960
One of the traditional kinds of shelling in that war was something that came to be known as Drum Fire

2788
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
Drumfire

2789
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:14,848
Is so named because it sounds like a drum roll

2790
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:20,992
I'm instead of you just hearing the drum being tapped at that speed each one of those things represent the shell going off

2791
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:23,040
How quickly the shelter Landing

2792
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,344
Ernst Junger

2793
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:31,744
Don't we quota. The author of the storm is still one of the most unusual Soldier by the way in the first world war because

2794
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
He kind of like

2795
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
The Wharf

2796
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:39,168
Any kind of saw in a positive benefits to it you know so it's really uplifting side of War

2797
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:45,568
And he was about as Brave as any Soldier you will ever find lost his composure

2798
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,848
Under artillery fire

2799
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,896
Explains a situation

2800
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,688
Ray comes Under Fire

2801
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:55,552
And just loses his mind temporarily you know this again one of the strongest

2802
02:08:56,064 --> 02:09:00,416
People mentally in the first world war that we know about and younger says quote

2803
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:06,816
We fell out in extended order and lay down expectedly in a series of flattish depressions

2804
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:09,888
Did some predecessors of ours had scooped out of the ground

2805
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,960
Powerball conversations were suddenly cut off

2806
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:15,008
Buy a marrow freezing cry

2807
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,056
20 yards behind us

2808
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:20,640
Clumps of Earth World up out of a white cloud and smacked into the BIOS

2809
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,944
The crash echo through the woods

2810
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:25,248
Stricken eyes look at each other

2811
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:29,856
Bodies press themselves into the ground with a humbling sensation of powerlessness

2812
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,880
To do anything else

2813
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,440
Explosion followed explosion

2814
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:36,000
Choking gases drifted over the undergrowth

2815
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:38,048
Smoke obscured the Treetops

2816
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:41,376
Trees and branches Came Crashing to the ground screams

2817
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:43,680
We leaped up and ran blindly

2818
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:47,520
Chased by lightning and crushing air pressure from tree to tree

2819
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,544
Looking for cover

2820
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,872
Skirting around giant tree trunks like frightened game

2821
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:54,432
A Dugout where many men have taken shelter

2822
02:09:54,688 --> 02:10:00,832
And which I too was running towards took a direct hit that ripped up the planking and sent heavy Timber spinning through the air

2823
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:07,488
Like a couple of squirrels having Stones thrown at them the NCO and I dodged panting around a huge beech tree

2824
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,120
Quite mechanically and spurred on by further explosions I ran after my Superior

2825
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:18,752
Who sometimes turned around and stared at me wild I yelling what in God's name are those things

2826
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
What are they

2827
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:25,152
Suddenly there was a flash among the root work and a blow on the left Fife lonely to the ground

2828
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:30,528
I thought I've been struck by a clump of Earth but the warm trickle of blood indicated that I've been wounded

2829
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:34,624
Later I saw that a needle sharp piece of shrapnel had given me a flesh wound

2830
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,672
Don't my wallet had taken the brunt of it

2831
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,952
Define cut

2832
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:44,352
Which before slicing into the muscle head split no fewer than nine thicknesses of stout leather looked as though it might have been

2833
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
Administered by scalp

2834
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:47,680
He continued

2835
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,288
I threw down my haversack and ran toward the trench weed come from

2836
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:56,640
From all sides wounded men were making tracks towards it from the shelter Woods

2837
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,176
The trench was appalling

2838
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:00,992
Choked with seriously wounded and dying man

2839
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:05,344
I figure stripped to the waist with a ripped open back leaned against the parapet

2840
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:11,488
Another with a triangular flap hanging off the back of his skull emitted short high-pitched screams

2841
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:14,048
This was the home of the great God pain

2842
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:18,400
And for the first time I looked through a devilish Cinque into the depths of his realm

2843
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,960
And fresh shells came down all the time

2844
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:23,008
I lost my head completely

2845
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:26,336
Ruthlessly I barged past everyone on my path

2846
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:29,664
Before finally having fallen back a few times in my haste

2847
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:36,320
Climbing out of the hellish Crush of the trench to move more freely above like a bolting horse I rushed through the dense under

2848
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,624
Growth across passing clearings

2849
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,440
Till I Collapse in the cops by The Grand tranchi

2850
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,464
And quote

2851
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,256
This

2852
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:48,608
One of the most suicidally brave Soldiers of the Great War

2853
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,912
If it can happen to him

2854
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:52,704
Could happen to anyone

2855
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,520
And I'm constantly amazed

2856
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,568
At the immense

2857
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,104
Bravery

2858
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:03,456
And an almost carelessness of death that are grandparents and great

2859
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:06,272
Grandparents showed consistently in this conflict

2860
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,064
And I always wonder about how

2861
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
Baidu

2862
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:12,928
Am I generation would do in the same situation

2863
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,280
The owner tries later on

2864
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,816
To explain what the

2865
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:22,144
Feeling of being in an artillery barrage is like

2866
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:25,216
It's difficult because we have nothing to compare it to

2867
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:31,616
Have you ever been on an airplane for example when it's in heavy turbulence and it takes one of those horrible drops in your stomach just

2868
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,664
I mean it

2869
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,456
I can't even describe that feeling

2870
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,480
And that's nothing

2871
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,504
Younger

2872
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,784
Write this

2873
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,600
In one of the greatest descriptions I've ever heard of what

2874
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:44,672
Feels like he was trying to explain it to people who never experienced it

2875
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:45,952
He wrote this

2876
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:46,976
Quote

2877
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:50,560
It's an easier matter to describe these sounds

2878
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:51,840
Then to endure them

2879
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:56,960
Because one cannot put associate every single sound of flying steel with the idea of death

2880
02:12:57,216 --> 02:13:03,360
And so I had told in my hole in the ground with my hand in front of my face imagining all the possible there

2881
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,384
Variance of being hit

2882
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:08,736
I think I found a comparison the captures the situation in which I

2883
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:11,296
And all the other soldiers who took part in this war

2884
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,832
So often found ourselves

2885
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:16,416
You must have imagined that you were securely tied to a post

2886
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:19,488
Being menaced by a man swinging a heavy hammer

2887
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,840
Now the hammer has been taken back over his head ready to be swung

2888
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:26,144
Now it's clearing the air towards you

2889
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,192
On the point of touching your skull

2890
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,984
Then it struck the post

2891
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,520
And the splinters are flying

2892
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:35,616
That's what it's like to experience heavy shelling in an exposed position

2893
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:36,896
And quote

2894
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:40,992
Now when you can

2895
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:44,832
Take cover in the trench and press yourself up against the Earth

2896
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:48,160
And dig your head into the soil and try to just

2897
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,208
Weather the storm that's hard enough

2898
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:54,048
But there are a lot of times in this conflict a lot of times

2899
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,328
When your job

2900
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,864
Easter run through

2901
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,424
The Drum Fire in the Halo shells

2902
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:01,728
To do everything your body

2903
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:07,616
Tells you not to do if I'm stronger than get carried away by the shell fire you know what help do

2904
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:10,688
Regular old shows like yours truly have right

2905
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,272
Yulia scotching is in one of those situations

2906
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:20,672
That soldiers all through the war will be and we know some officer blows a whistle and says time to jump out of the trench

2907
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,464
Run-pass the gunfire

2908
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
And he writes

2909
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,560
The feeling you have when it's your turn

2910
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:27,840
Quote

2911
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:34,496
Weird approach the firing line a little more than two miles when we got Within Reach of the enemies curtain of Fire

2912
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:38,592
A terrific Halo shells with plowing up every foot of ground

2913
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:41,408
Thousands of corpses of German soldiers

2914
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:46,784
Were witnesses to the immense losses the Germans had suffered in bringing up all available Reserves

2915
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:53,440
The French try their utmost to prevent the Germans from bringing in their reserves and increase their artillery fire

2916
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,720
To an unheard-of viola

2917
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:58,560
It seemed impossible for us to break through that barricade of Fire

2918
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:01,376
Hundreds of shells were bursting every minute

2919
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,936
We were ordered to pass that he'll

2920
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:06,240
Singly and that her running pace

2921
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:10,848
We were lying on the ground and observed how the first of our men tried to get through

2922
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:12,896
Some ran forward like mad

2923
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:16,224
Not heating the shells that were bursting around them and got through

2924
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:19,808
Others were entirely buried by the dirt dug up by the shells

2925
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:22,368
Torn to Pieces by shell splinters

2926
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,464
Two man had scarcely reached the line when they were struck by a bullseye

2927
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:29,536
IE the heavy shell exploded at their feet

2928
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:30,560
Leaving nothing of

2929
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:36,192
You can imagine what we were feeling during these harrowing minutes as we laid crouching on the ground

2930
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:38,240
Not quite a hundred feet away

2931
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:39,776
Seeing everything

2932
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,824
And only waiting for our turn to come

2933
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:45,152
One-hit entangled oneself in a maze of thoughts

2934
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:47,200
Certainly one of the officers would cry

2935
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,224
The next one

2936
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,248
That was I

2937
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,808
Just as if we're out of a bad dream

2938
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,832
I jumped up

2939
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,624
And race away like mad

2940
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,672
Holding the rifle in my right hand

2941
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:58,208
And the bayonet in my left

2942
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:04,608
I jump aside a few steps in front of to bursting shells and running to two others which are bursting at the same time

2943
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:10,496
I leapt back several times run forward again race about wildly to find a gap through which to escape

2944
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:12,544
Fire and iron everywhere

2945
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,384
Like a hunted Beast one seeks some opening to save oneself

2946
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:19,712
How was in front of me and behind me the officers revolver

2947
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,992
Kept ready to shoot

2948
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:26,624
The lumps of Steel fall down like a heavy shower from high above hell and Damnation

2949
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:32,512
I blindly run and run and run until someone gets me by my coat where there someone Roars into my ear

2950
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:33,280
Stop

2951
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,304
Are you wounded

2952
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
Have a look

2953
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,864
Perhaps you are when you don't know it

2954
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,912
Here I am trembling all over

2955
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,936
Sit down

2956
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:42,240
The other person says you'll feel better

2957
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,520
We tremble to

2958
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,312
And quote

2959
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,152
How many of us could do that

2960
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:51,456
And think about the mentality

2961
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:53,248
And how these people were raised

2962
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,064
You know what was involved that allowed them

2963
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:02,464
To do this I mean I have a feeling that my generation would just turn around at the office or holding a gun to watch to get

2964
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:07,072
Get us to do that and figure like I can't take us all out we're not going into that

2965
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:09,888
We did a history show Once about

2966
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:15,264
The question of whether the older generation raised in a different time we're tougher than we were

2967
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:18,848
And of course there's no way to really come to any conclusions about that

2968
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,152
When you read this and you see

2969
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,968
What are grandparents and great-grandparents did

2970
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,760
It boggles the mind

2971
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:29,600
And if those shells won't drive you insane

2972
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:34,208
The Carnage that they create that you have to live around everyday

2973
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,744
Just met

2974
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,096
As I said one of the terrible things about this battle that's different from most of the second World War

2975
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,632
Is in the second World War

2976
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:44,960
You have What's called the moving front Gwynne Dyer his

2977
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:48,288
Famous peace War talk about the continuous front

2978
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,312
Duty calls

2979
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:51,360
The first world war initiated

2980
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:54,944
In the second world war The Continuous front mu

2981
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,480
Blitzkrieg

2982
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:59,040
And the people are continually changing location

2983
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:03,904
What makes the battlefields of the first World War we said earlier so particularly horrifying

2984
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,440
Isn't it doesn't change

2985
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:09,024
You get to live around the Carnage

2986
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:12,608
From years past even in the Second World War

2987
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:14,400
Eugene Sledge writing

2988
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:20,032
You know from the US Marine talking about fighting in the Pacific will talk about his particularly

2989
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,312
Horrified feeling

2990
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,336
As he watched

2991
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:23,104
Flies

2992
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:26,176
It were feeding on dead bodies right near him

2993
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,200
Fly-Rite

2994
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,992
To the edge of his coffee

2995
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,528
And land in his coffee

2996
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,320
These are the little

2997
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:36,416
Horrifying things that you would think after why we just drive you out of your mind

2998
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,256
Philip Gibbs

2999
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,280
Is absolutely

3000
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:43,584
The groundbreaking work now it can be told

3001
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:48,448
Was a journalist on the scene as we said earlier and unable to write about the reality of

3002
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,984
The war until afterwards

3003
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:51,264
He describes

3004
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,800
One of these situations

3005
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:53,824
Just how

3006
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:56,384
Incredible it was to have to live in this

3007
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:58,176
It's worse than the Charnel house

3008
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,248
He describes

3009
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,296
An area called

3010
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,320
Couch

3011
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:06,368
That was so terrible

3012
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,160
Near the Ypres Battlefield

3013
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:09,440
Just quote

3014
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:15,072
The worst school of War for the sons of gentleman was in those days in for long afterwards

3015
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
Couch

3016
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:17,888
This was the Devil's Playground

3017
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:23,008
And his chamber of Horrors wherein he devised Mary tortures for young Christian men

3018
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,800
It was not far out of Ypres

3019
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:29,408
To the left of the Mendon Road into the north of is Wildwood and Sanctuary wood

3020
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:33,248
For a time there was a chateau there called the white chateau

3021
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:37,088
With excellent stable and good accommodation for one of our Brigade staff

3022
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:42,208
Until one of our generals was killed and others wounded by a shell which broke up their conference

3023
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,256
Afterwards that was no chateau

3024
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:50,656
But only a rubble of bricks backed up with sandbags and deep mine craters filled with stinking water

3025
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:52,960
Swapping over from the Belvedere Lake

3026
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,752
And low-lying pools

3027
02:19:55,264 --> 02:20:00,128
Bodies and bits of bodies and clots of blood and green metallic looking slime

3028
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:06,528
Made by explosive gases were floating on the surface of that water below the crater Banks when I first pass that way

3029
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,064
And so it was always

3030
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:12,672
Are men live there and died there within a few yards of the enemy

3031
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:14,464
Crouch below the sandbag

3032
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,512
And pasted into the mud bag

3033
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:18,816
If they dug to get deeper cover

3034
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:22,656
Their shovels went into the softness of dead bodies who have been their comrade

3035
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,448
Scraps of Flash

3036
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,728
Booted legs

3037
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:31,616
Black and tans eyeless heads came falling over them when the enemy trench more their position

3038
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:33,408
I blew up a new Mineshaft

3039
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:34,688
And quote

3040
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:38,784
How would that not drive anybody crazy

3041
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,320
Daddy is

3042
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:41,344
War

3043
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,368
Made worse

3044
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:45,696
That's you living in Zombieland

3045
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:48,768
And being shelled at the same time it's

3046
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:55,936
It is as I said many times and will continue to say this is the worst experience or soldiers in Warfare I've ever seen on a map

3047
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:56,704
Scale

3048
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,288
Even in Stalingrad in the Second World War

3049
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:03,616
Widely considered one of the worst places to be in the world

3050
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:05,408
That just equal

3051
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:10,272
The experience that many men on the Western Front got to experience routinely

3052
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:13,088
How did they deal with it

3053
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:14,624
In ways

3054
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,904
That are

3055
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,952
Some sort of a wonderful

3056
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,744
Testament to Human Nature

3057
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,792
They often joked about

3058
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:26,912
Adopted a sort of gallows humor at times

3059
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:29,984
That reminds you of police officers

3060
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,264
Or fireman

3061
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,056
Or be honest journalist

3062
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:36,640
And soldiers and people who see this horrible stuff

3063
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:38,432
And their way of coping with it

3064
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,456
Is humor

3065
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:43,040
The journalist Philip Gibbs

3066
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:45,856
Experience this and took part in it

3067
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,648
And this was his theory on the

3068
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,672
Whole thing quote

3069
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:53,536
It was astonishing how loudly one laugh to Tales of gruesome things

3070
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,072
Awards brutality

3071
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,864
I with the rest of them

3072
02:21:57,376 --> 02:22:00,704
I think it's a bottom of it was a sense of the ironical contract

3073
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:03,520
Between the normal ways of civilian life

3074
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:06,336
And this hark back to the caveman code

3075
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:10,432
It made all of our old philosophy of life monstrously

3076
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,480
It played the hat trick

3077
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,784
With the gentility of modern manners

3078
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:17,856
Men who have been brought up to Christian virtues

3079
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:20,928
Would prattle dear little prayers at their mother's knees

3080
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:23,232
Would grown up to love poetry

3081
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,000
Painting

3082
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:26,304
Music The Gentle Arts

3083
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:29,632
Over sensitized to the subtleties of halftones

3084
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:31,680
Delicate scales of emotion

3085
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:33,728
Fastidious in their choice of words

3086
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:35,008
In their sense of beauty

3087
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,848
Found themselves compelled to live and act like eight men

3088
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,152
And it was abominably funny

3089
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:47,552
They laughed the most frightful episode which revealed this contrast between civilized ethics

3090
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:49,344
Any old Beast law

3091
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:51,392
The more revolting it was

3092
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:53,952
The more sometimes they shouted with laughter

3093
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,744
Especially in reminiscence

3094
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,584
When the tale was told of the Gilded Salon of the French chateau

3095
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,864
Or at the mess table

3096
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,680
It was I think he writes

3097
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,472
The laughter of Mortals

3098
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:08,800
That's a trick which have been played on them by Anna ronico fate

3099
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:11,872
They have been taught to believe that the whole object of life

3100
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:14,176
What's to reach out to Beauty in love

3101
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:19,040
And that mankind and its progress to Perfection had killed the Beast instinct

3102
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,064
Cruelty

3103
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:21,344
Bloodlust

3104
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,368
The primitive

3105
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:26,976
Savage laws of Survival by tooth and Claw and Club aynax

3106
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,000
Allpoetry

3107
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:32,096
All art all religion had preached this gospel in this promise

3108
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:36,192
Now that ideal had broken like a China base - 2 hard ground

3109
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:38,496
The contrast between that

3110
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:39,264
And this

3111
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:40,288
Was

3112
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,080
And quote

3113
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:45,920
The stories that they told

3114
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:48,224
We're both funny

3115
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:54,368
And revealing in a horrified way like The Gallows humor you see from police officers and soldiers and whatnot

3116
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,904
One of the ones

3117
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:56,928
Is this one

3118
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:57,696
Quote

3119
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:04,608
In one section of trenches the men made a habit of betting upon those who would be wounded first

3120
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:07,168
It had all the uncertainty of the roulette table

3121
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:11,520
One day when the German Gunners were putting over a special dose of hate

3122
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:14,080
A sergeant kept coming to one dugout

3123
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:17,920
To inquire about a quote and quote new Chum

3124
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:19,456
Who would come up with the draft

3125
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:22,016
Is private Smith alright he asked

3126
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:25,600
Yes Sergeant he's alright answer the man crouching in the dark hole

3127
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:27,392
Private Smithers and wounded yet

3128
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:30,976
Master sergeant again five minutes later no sergeant

3129
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:34,560
Private Smith was touched by this interest in his well-being

3130
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:35,584
And said

3131
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:38,656
That's Sergeant seems a very kind man said the boy

3132
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:40,448
Seems to love me like a father

3133
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:42,496
A yell of laughter answered him

3134
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:45,568
You poor bleeding fools and one of his comrades

3135
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:47,360
Each drawing you in a lottery

3136
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,896
How to do win if you've been hurt

3137
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,432
And quote

3138
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,504
Another example

3139
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:54,528
Of this

3140
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:58,880
Amazing ability of human beings to adapt in these kinds of situations

3141
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:04,512
With the tools given to us including humor which again you you look at survivors

3142
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,536
Of Auschwitz

3143
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:08,608
And Treblinka and the death camps of the Nazis

3144
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:11,424
The Jews were using humor even there

3145
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,448
Hope

3146
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:14,496
Gibbs tells the story

3147
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,264
Quote

3148
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:18,592
In digging new trenches and New dugouts

3149
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:21,408
Bodies and bits of bodies were on Earth

3150
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:23,712
And putting the sand bags with the soil

3151
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:30,112
It was sent back down the line of men concealing their work from German eyes waiting for any new activity in our ditches

3152
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:33,696
Bitter Bill said the leading man putting in the leg

3153
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:37,024
Another bit of Bill he said unearthing a hand

3154
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,560
Bill's ugly mug

3155
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:41,888
He said at a later stage in the operation when the head was found

3156
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:48,032
Gibb says quote has told afterwards that little episode in the trenches seemed immensely comic

3157
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,568
Generals charcoal.

3158
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,104
Chaplin's Treasury

3159
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,384
And quote

3160
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,968
All the coping mechanisms in the world.

3161
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,272
We're not enough to help

3162
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,088
Things got to a really critical

3163
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:01,856
Echostage

3164
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:04,160
Every human being has a breaking

3165
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:06,720
And

3166
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:09,792
What in the first World War was called shell shocked

3167
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,144
We mentioned it earlier would later be updated to battle fatigue

3168
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,168
As soon as

3169
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,312
The experts realized it was an imprecise term because you didn't have to be exposed to artillery in the shells at all to get it

3170
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:25,664
Now we would call it post-traumatic stress disorder u-see-it in soldiers today

3171
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:26,432
It's pretty common

3172
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:27,968
No

3173
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,248
I'm not

3174
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:32,576
Just not his story and I'm not a psychology

3175
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,856
Just either so take this with the gray

3176
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:37,952
But this is something that appears to be what they call a spectrum disorder

3177
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
Meaning

3178
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:41,024
You can have a severity scale

3179
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,304
Golf like 1 to 10

3180
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:45,376
And not to minimize anything

3181
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:46,656
Current veterans go through

3182
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:48,960
They'll often come back from these wars

3183
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
It was Nightmare

3184
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:52,544
Or an inability to sleep or

3185
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,312
Eat properly

3186
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:57,664
For the we integrate into society and they've obviously suffered some trauma and damage

3187
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,968
In the first world war though

3188
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,272
Those people would often be shot

3189
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:07,392
If you couldn't see visible evidence and often times even if you could

3190
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:10,464
The people in that are especially

3191
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,000
Early in the war

3192
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:18,400
Didn't look at this as some sort of a legitimate problem to them this was just another manifestation of cowardice

3193
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:20,704
Punishable by Death

3194
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,264
Take for example

3195
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:28,640
Phillip Gibbs his account and he has a bunch of them because this was one of the things that upset him the most

3196
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,920
He would go to the front

3197
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:32,480
Report on what the soldiers had to endure

3198
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:38,368
And then once they were damaged by what they had to endure report on how

3199
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:41,952
The completely clueless militaries of the day

3200
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:47,584
You'll then punish them again for something they were already victimized once for he tells one story for example

3201
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,144
I'm an officer that he's meeting with who comes back

3202
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,240
To the meeting with him from a court-martial hearing he just been

3203
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:55,264
To where

3204
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,824
They'd sentenced one of these people who

3205
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:00,896
He had his mind blown by his experience

3206
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:02,176
To death

3207
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,456
He says quote

3208
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:09,344
Going up the camel one day I had to wait in Battalion headquarters for the officer I'd gone to see

3209
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,136
He was attending a court-martial

3210
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:14,464
Presently he came into the wooden Hut with a flushed face

3211
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:19,584
Sorry I had to keep you you said tomorrow there will be once wine Less in the world

3212
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:22,656
A death sentence game said he nodded

3213
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:23,936
A damn coward

3214
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:27,264
Eddie didn't mind rifle fire but couldn't stand shells

3215
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:29,056
Admitted he left his post

3216
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:31,360
He doesn't mind rifle fire well

3217
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:35,456
Tomorrow morning the officer laughed grimly and then listen for a second

3218
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:40,832
There was some heavy crump's falling over camelhill rather close it seem to our wooden Hut

3219
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:42,880
He's talking about artillery shells falling

3220
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:43,648
Nearby

3221
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:46,720
Damn those German Gunner said the officer

3222
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:48,512
Why can't they give us a little piece

3223
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,048
Return to his papers

3224
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:54,656
But several times while I talk with him he jerked his head up and listen to a heavy crash

3225
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:55,680
On the way back

3226
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:57,216
I saw a man on foot

3227
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:01,312
Walking in front of a mountain man passed the old Hill love the shepherd bird

3228
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:03,104
Who are the village of Lockport

3229
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,664
It was something in the way he walked in his attitude

3230
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:07,712
The head hunched forward a little

3231
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:09,504
In his arms behind his back

3232
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,296
Would make me turn to look at it

3233
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:12,832
He was manacled

3234
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,880
And Tied by a rope to the mountain man

3235
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:18,720
I caught one glimpse of his face and then turned away cold and sick

3236
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:21,024
It was Doom written on his face

3237
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,816
And in his eyes a captured look

3238
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:24,864
He was walking to his wall

3239
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:25,888
And quote

3240
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,192
I mean the wall where he was going to

3241
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:28,960
He put up again

3242
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,240
And Shop

3243
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:31,008
By his compare

3244
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:35,104
Gibbs later quotes another General saying

3245
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:39,200
But anyone who comes down with these symptoms is a damn coward and he have them all shot

3246
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:40,992
Now

3247
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:44,064
Early in the war this is how they thought

3248
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:47,136
Because they didn't deal with this routinely

3249
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:53,536
They're doing a little talk of this during the russo-japanese war a decade before this where the Russians were encountering this kind of

3250
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,304
No problem

3251
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:57,632
But this was a new experience this idea

3252
02:29:57,888 --> 02:30:03,008
Combat fatigue battle fatigue shellshock this would be stuff by the way that all the major militaries of the world

3253
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:05,568
Would study after the first World War

3254
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:07,616
Any would incorporate what they learned

3255
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:10,432
Into training procedures and how you

3256
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:14,016
Dealt with combat in the next War to try to minimize these problem

3257
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,320
Even later in the first World War

3258
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:17,856
The generals would learn

3259
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:20,928
If you need to rotate your troops away from the front lines

3260
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:24,512
Regular intervals you can't leave them up there indefinitely

3261
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:25,792
Or they're all going to go

3262
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,096
So you'll see these times where

3263
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,888
For a week or two

3264
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:35,776
The troops will have to live in the mud in 3 feet of standing water under shell firing all the time

3265
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:38,848
But then they'll take him to the back to the rear areas that are safer

3266
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:40,896
Can let them recover

3267
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:43,968
And then slowly moving back toward the front this rotation

3268
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:46,016
Was intended to keep them fresh and key

3269
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:48,320
Keep them from becoming psychological casualty

3270
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:49,856
And

3271
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:51,392
These are people

3272
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:53,184
Who are foaming at the mouth

3273
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:53,952
Sometime

3274
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:59,840
When they were brought back from the line these are people who are saying I just can't handle it anymore General although sometimes

3275
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,864
That's what you encounter

3276
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,448
These are people whose limbs have turned to Rigamortis

3277
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:06,240
Or War so palsy

3278
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,520
They can't walk

3279
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:09,312
For the epileptic seizures

3280
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:13,920
Or seizure-like things you're seeing you can actually go see this by the way because after the war

3281
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:16,480
People didn't heal they never heal

3282
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:18,528
40 years later there still

3283
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:21,344
I'm taking up Hospital space in some of these countries

3284
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:26,464
And there are films that the doctors made showing you these people symptoms in their online you can view them

3285
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:32,096
Some of these symptoms are so physical in nature

3286
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:35,936
That this is kind of how the term Shell Shock first became

3287
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:36,960
Fashion Nova

3288
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:43,360
Because there were theories that maybe the concussion in the change in air pressure that the shells nearby

3289
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:44,128
Exploding

3290
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:47,456
Actually did brain damage or nerve damage to these people

3291
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:51,808
Because when you actually see some of these cases and how they were affected

3292
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:55,392
That looks like physical damage it doesn't look like mental

3293
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:58,720
Again that did not prevent the military's

3294
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:00,512
I'm treating this as cowardice

3295
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:02,048
Especially early on

3296
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,584
And dishing out

3297
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,888
The capital punishment penalty for

3298
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,192
That having been said

3299
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,984
Still fascinating to me how

3300
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,264
You actually

3301
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,288
Had to BX

3302
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,056
Executed for this

3303
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,872
Sometimes you can read books with a British

3304
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:16,640
These cells

3305
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:18,688
The 1970s 1970s

3306
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,480
And it's just as outraged

3307
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:24,064
No end and you looking and 330

3308
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,368
People are executed or something for

3309
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:30,208
Running away in combat abandon your post desertion those kind of things

3310
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:36,352
And I think to myself I think my generation if we were forced to go through with those people had to go through

3311
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:38,656
That's how many people they shoot in a month

3312
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:46,592
Because what's happening in 1915 and you can sum up the entire Western Front in 1950 you don't have to

3313
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:48,128
To deal with any of the battles

3314
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,432
Is that the situation is

3315
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:51,968
Is degenerating into

3316
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:54,016
What we understand the first World War

3317
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:55,808
Trenches

3318
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:58,880
And defenses that are becoming ever more sophisticated

3319
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:02,464
We are now getting beyond the error we are talking about

3320
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:07,072
China One Long trench on one side and one long trench on the other and maybe

3321
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:08,608
Sophistication here in there

3322
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:11,424
A little barbed wire between

3323
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,472
And we are entering into a phase now

3324
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:14,240
We're

3325
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:15,520
On the Western Front

3326
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:18,592
You begin to have to fortification

3327
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,408
And you're not talking now about

3328
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,200
Successful attacks

3329
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:27,040
Going after people you're trying to batter down

3330
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:29,856
Defenses that goes sometimes mile

3331
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:30,880
Backward

3332
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,928
Astoria

3333
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:33,696
Thorne Bros

3334
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:34,720
Describe the

3335
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:36,512
Deepening 1915

3336
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:37,792
Fortifications like this

3337
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:38,560
Quote

3338
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,144
When the Allies attacked in May 1915

3339
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:45,216
The Trenches were shielded by two belts of barbed wire

3340
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:48,800
Each five feet high and 30 m deep

3341
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:51,104
Behind the wire lay a trench Network

3342
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:54,432
Consisting of three lines 100 m apart

3343
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:58,784
At regular intervals each trench had a zigzag or dogleg Traverse

3344
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,600
The Shield Defenders from shells Landing nearby

3345
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:05,696
And prevent attackers from firing machine guns down the entire length of the trench

3346
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:09,280
Dish Network of trenches was supported 1000 back

3347
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:12,096
Buy concrete machine gun pillboxes

3348
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:15,680
Thermodown enemy soldiers who pierce the forward position

3349
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,472
Those

3350
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:20,800
Already formidable sounding defenses were increased

3351
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,080
During the summer

3352
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:23,872
Brose continues quote

3353
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:30,272
During the summer a second double belt of barbed wire went into place 1000 meters behind the rear pill boxes

3354
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:31,552
The first train system

3355
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:36,672
Then came a second triple line of trenches also backed by machine gun emplacement

3356
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:40,256
The Defenders also burrowed ever more deeply into the ground

3357
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:46,400
To make the system work optimally monthly outputs of machine guns that increase nearly 12 volt

3358
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:52,800
Both the first and second trim systems were linked by communication trenches for moving up reinforcements are retreating

3359
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:59,200
Underground telephone cables connected the first line with the second as well as with the artillery far to the rear

3360
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:01,760
General falkenhayn well-designed

3361
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:03,040
Kilometers deep

3362
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:08,160
Double killing zones amounted to a massive engineering and construction project

3363
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:10,976
But it was carried out before the Allies attacked again into

3364
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:11,744
September

3365
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:13,280
And quote

3366
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:15,840
That's attacking a fort

3367
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:21,984
Now if the Allies were also deepening and making the trenches more sophisticated

3368
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:27,360
But not to the same degree the Germans were because the Allies attitude is why would we waste that much effort

3369
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:32,736
When were hoping the next attack of the next attack breaks us through would be out of these trenches will be in their Trench

3370
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:37,088
The Germans have a much more defensive attitude on the Western Front at this time

3371
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,880
They plan on staying awake

3372
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:45,792
They dig deeper into the Earth and build these bunk houses with you Timber overhead in a big trees laid down

3373
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:52,192
Log cabin-style with Earth on top of that sometimes they have carpeting on the floor wallpaper on the walls show

3374
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,216
Shelving I mean

3375
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:53,984
It's

3376
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,264
In some ways

3377
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,544
A giant

3378
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:59,616
You know Roman Empire kind of

3379
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:02,688
Hadrian's Wall up and down the line mini belt

3380
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:03,456
The Deep

3381
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:04,992
Peter insane Fordham

3382
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:10,368
Application who in their right mind would think you want to slam human beings up against that over and over again

3383
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:11,648
Well

3384
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,416
Franklin

3385
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:14,208
British military leadership on the cob

3386
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,048
France's military leaders also jafra

3387
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,120
Have an attitude of just get them out

3388
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:26,752
They're on the sacred soil of France it's also important resource in industrial territory

3389
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:31,616
Chopper will waste if necessary an entire generation of young Frenchman to eject

3390
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:33,408
The Haunting from Francis oil

3391
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:35,968
Propaganda

3392
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:37,504
Nickname for the Germans

3393
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:38,784
Andy

3394
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:41,856
British commander of British forces in France

3395
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:45,696
Confusingly and ironically named as we said before Sir John French

3396
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:48,000
Agrees with shop or just give us more troops

3397
02:36:48,256 --> 02:36:51,584
Where the bigger boxer in this price by who cares if we get there

3398
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:52,608
Elbows in there

3399
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,656
Risks in their bones

3400
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:59,776
They're going down eventually just give us more truth will pound these fortifications down

3401
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,848
And the way they did this by the way

3402
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,384
What did Morgan

3403
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:11,808
1915 is not just the beginning of the heavy duty trench warfare it's the beginning of the attempt to deal with the heavy duty

3404
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:12,576
Trench warfare

3405
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:15,648
And you do this with ever-increasing amounts of guns

3406
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:17,184
A bigger caliber

3407
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:17,952
And

3408
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,744
Using them for longer.

3409
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:20,512
What time

3410
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,560
In just one of these

3411
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:26,144
Double headed battle that will be fought in the middle of 1915

3412
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:29,984
Jean French figures out the way to break through these kinds of fortifications

3413
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:32,032
Is with many many hours

3414
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:33,824
A mini mini guns

3415
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:35,616
Shooting in a confined area

3416
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,200
Stockpiles 5.2 million shells

3417
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:39,968
Start using this

3418
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,504
A1 double-headed offensive

3419
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:47,904
Are you going to pound these fortifications and then you going to send men into the Gap to occupied and that's what I

3420
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:49,696
Friendship the tencent

3421
02:37:49,952 --> 02:37:52,256
Artillery conquers the ground

3422
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:54,560
Can you send the man in afterwards to occupy

3423
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:56,864
The 1915 Stratus

3424
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,632
He's also called

3425
02:37:57,888 --> 02:37:59,680
Buy some commanders bite and hole

3426
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,472
Tony's General ideas with

3427
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:03,264
Can you grab an area

3428
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:09,664
Get your grab it with artillery you take it over with people when all the other side killed by the artillery and then you start for Define

3429
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:12,992
Why don't you turn that into your little castle and now you just moved

3430
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:15,552
Your side's fortifications more toward their side

3431
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:17,600
It's a giant moving War

3432
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:19,392
Trenches in sea

3433
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:21,952
Fortification the moon one side take

3434
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:22,976
A new area

3435
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:24,000
The other side

3436
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:27,072
Goes and attack them right away before they can fortify

3437
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:28,096
Again

3438
02:38:28,352 --> 02:38:29,632
Possible to follow these battles

3439
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:32,704
1915 look like

3440
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,240
Evermore big guns

3441
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:38,080
Evermore wasted opportunities Evermore futility

3442
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:41,152
And the most forward-thinkers amongst the Allied

3443
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:42,432
Leaders in

3444
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:43,456
Decision makers

3445
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:48,576
I'm looking at this already at the end of 1914 and they can see it in the distance and they thinking to themself

3446
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:50,112
Must we go there

3447
02:38:51,648 --> 02:38:52,928
French think you're supposed to have

3448
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:56,768
Floated the idea first Bluetooth picked up most famously by Winston Churchill

3449
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,816
An idea of finding a flying

3450
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:00,608
In another fighting

3451
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:01,376
Theater

3452
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,168
Why do we have to

3453
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,704
Throw more troops into the meat grinder

3454
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:05,728
Did the British Empire

3455
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:08,800
It's just starting to produce a decent number of people

3456
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:10,080
They got some

3457
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:12,384
Building up of troops happening

3458
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:16,992
These volunteers that first joined up at the very beginning of the war now

3459
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:18,528
Gone through their training.

3460
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,576
And I could be thrown in early like

3461
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,880
General falkenhayn did with those poor

3462
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:26,464
Student soldiers are going to be husband in for just the right time they're green

3463
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,000
But they're trained

3464
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:30,560
Must we throw these precious

3465
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,328
Intrude

3466
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,608
Into the meat grinder

3467
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,680
More Empire troops by the way are also showing up the

3468
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:37,728
Canadians as we said the Indians were already there

3469
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:38,752
But other troops

3470
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,800
Really from Dominion I think we should

3471
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:41,824
Commonwealth earlier

3472
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,384
And although the term was in use it's not officially the right

3473
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,432
Term until between the two Wars when

3474
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:48,736
Commonwealth status is branded to some of these places

3475
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:50,784
Let's just call them to minions

3476
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:51,808
Troops from

3477
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:53,600
New Zealand and Australia

3478
02:39:53,856 --> 02:39:56,672
Raised up again in patriotic fervor

3479
02:39:56,928 --> 02:40:01,536
For the cause and large numbers of people relative to the total population D places

3480
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,816
They're on the way

3481
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:05,632
Are you really going to sacrifice all these troops into

3482
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:06,400
Hacking

3483
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:07,936
Deepwater vacations

3484
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:11,008
For the commanders on the western

3485
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:12,800
Front French and British war

3486
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,336
You know of the

3487
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:17,152
Opinion that every person should be thrown into the Western

3488
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:18,688
Confront stay would argue that

3489
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:22,272
It's only a meat grinder on the Western Front cuz we don't have enough men yet

3490
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:23,552
To overrun that me

3491
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:28,160
You give us enough people we will end this war fast in a lot less people will die

3492
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:32,256
There was as I mentioned earlier

3493
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:33,536
Kind of cabal

3494
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:35,072
Bankers

3495
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:36,864
Food come to the conclusion

3496
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:38,912
But that sort of thinking was mistaken

3497
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:42,240
And it surely there are better ideas out the

3498
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:43,776
Then to throw

3499
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:47,360
Are more and more human beings into the teeth of the enemy's defenses

3500
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:49,664
Decabol had some famous members

3501
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:51,456
Winston Churchill

3502
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:53,248
For example maybe the most famous

3503
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:57,088
Call the Lord Horatio Kitchener the war minister not far behind

3504
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:58,624
And these people

3505
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:00,672
Were of the opinion I guess you could

3506
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,696
Compare it to

3507
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,976
Set up a predator

3508
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:06,560
They have been trying to take down

3509
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:09,376
The nastiest animal in the herd

3510
02:41:09,632 --> 02:41:12,704
4 months now and they gotten Gordon the process

3511
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,752
The Germans had done damage to every

3512
02:41:15,008 --> 02:41:15,776
Major

3513
02:41:16,032 --> 02:41:18,080
Member of the Allies by this time

3514
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,360
And there were

3515
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:23,968
The great Lions of France and Britain and Russia looking around and take you to themselves

3516
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:26,272
Why don't we just follow the traditional

3517
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:27,296
Predatory

3518
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,344
Son of a protein go after the week

3519
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:30,880
Anosike

3520
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:32,416
Any ol

3521
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:36,768
Instead of going after the strong and young and dangerous

3522
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:41,888
And there was a country in the war now that met all three

3523
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:45,728
Of those key classifications of the guy like Churchill would have made

3524
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:47,520
Country

3525
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
The week

3526
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:53,920
Is more than a country

3527
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:55,200
What's an Empire

3528
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:57,248
Dying

3529
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:00,576
I've been calling a turkey

3530
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:05,440
Throughout this whole show because that's the proper name for the first world war but there's another proper name 2

3531
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:11,072
Conjures up a whole different set of images than the perhaps modern sounding name of Turkey

3532
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:13,376
What's the Ottoman Empire

3533
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,984
And that conjures up images of salt

3534
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:20,544
Janissary

3535
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:22,336
Harem

3536
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:27,456
And being on the gates of Vienna almost over running into

3537
02:42:27,712 --> 02:42:30,272
Central Europe at one point at the height of their history

3538
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:32,320
Of knocking down

3539
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:35,136
The walls of Constantinople

3540
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,696
Formerly known as Byzantium to the Greek

3541
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:39,744
Constantinople to the Romans

3542
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:41,024
And then

3543
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:42,560
After the sultan

3544
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:46,656
And got through that historic barrier in Concord the city he renamed it

3545
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:47,424
Eastham

3546
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:49,984
As sort of a momento

3547
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:52,032
And giant Monument

3548
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,056
For what his

3549
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:55,360
Ottomans had achieved

3550
02:42:56,896 --> 02:42:58,432
That was when the Ottomans were young

3551
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:01,248
The Ottomans were old

3552
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:04,320
And they were losing territory

3553
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,344
Over the

3554
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,392
Decades like nobody's business

3555
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:09,952
They were seen as a carcass to be picked

3556
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:12,256
The sick man of Europe they were called

3557
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,304
And someone like

3558
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:15,584
Churchill

3559
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:16,608
Looked at

3560
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:21,472
Turkey just sitting there they come into the war in November several months after the war officially start

3561
02:43:21,984 --> 02:43:23,520
And they're surrounded by water

3562
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,544
And there

3563
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:29,664
Maybe not even a second-rate power they have the territory of a big second-rate Power lots of

3564
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:33,248
Places trying to get out of turkey but still stuck in Turkey

3565
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:37,856
Hello neighbor might look at it a record might look at it or an Armenian might look at it

3566
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,440
None the less without them mean to sort of

3567
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:45,536
Territory named one of their main reasons there been a war called the

3568
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:46,816
Crimean War

3569
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:48,608
In the middle of the 19th century

3570
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:49,632
Is because

3571
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:52,448
Turkey was so weak and yet soul

3572
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:54,496
Filled with territory you could take

3573
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:58,336
Did the British and the French had to get involved to keep the Russians from snapping up too much of it

3574
02:43:59,104 --> 02:44:02,944
So this appeared to be the easy animal in the herd to take down

3575
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:07,808
And a crucial place that might have all sorts of impact on the war if you did take him down

3576
02:44:08,064 --> 02:44:09,088
Take for example

3577
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:14,208
All the countries that hadn't decided whose side they were going to fight on yet

3578
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:16,512
Turkey enters the war as we said

3579
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:21,120
A headache for the Allies cuz they open up an entire new theater

3580
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:27,776
Of operations really there might have been in a little stuff on the side going on but when turkey gets in the war in November 1914

3581
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:29,056
The Middle East is now in

3582
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,848
India maybe in

3583
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:36,224
Southern rushes in play North African Egyptian play the Balkans is in play

3584
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:38,272
Balkans

3585
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:42,112
Is territory that when the ottoman Turks were young and Powerful

3586
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:42,880
They own

3587
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:47,488
They'd fought two wars in the past couple of years

3588
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,888
With the former territories that they used to own and watch them in a shake off the Ottoman Empire

3589
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:58,752
Serbia Bulgaria Romania Greece all these places have been pulling themselves away

3590
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:01,056
From ottoman influence for some time now

3591
02:45:02,592 --> 02:45:03,872
And none of them had decided

3592
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:10,272
Which side they were going to fight on in this war yet and it's fascinating and you talk about watching open diplomacy in a way

3593
02:45:11,552 --> 02:45:17,184
Like watching horse trading going on is watching the Allies on one side and the central powers on the other side

3594
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,208
Try to

3595
02:45:18,464 --> 02:45:21,792
Convince a country to go their way I mean with Italy for example

3596
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:24,096
It's almost open auction time

3597
02:45:24,352 --> 02:45:30,496
I mean one Alliance will walk in the front door and say well if we win the war on you join us you can have this province from the enemy in that prob

3598
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:36,896
Believe in any other door comes together Alliance it something is that all they promised you what if we win you can have this.

3599
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:41,760
And this was going on with all these countries in the Balkans and Greece

3600
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,040
Revamp on the Aegean

3601
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:46,624
The number two thing they were all concerned with his what were they going to get

3602
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,648
They got in the war

3603
02:45:47,904 --> 02:45:50,464
What are you promising me and you know going to the highest bidder

3604
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,768
What's the number one thing they were all concerned

3605
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:54,816
Who is going to win

3606
02:45:56,096 --> 02:46:00,192
These countries knew that they were absolutely like roadkill if they picked the wrong

3607
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:00,960
Inside

3608
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:03,264
But in early 1915

3609
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:04,543
No clear-cut

3610
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:06,847
Dominant side head emerged

3611
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:10,175
Wenzhou Churchill and his compatriots had this idea that

3612
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:14,015
They could strike a big blow in that theater right in that part of the world

3613
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:18,367
Even if they didn't knock anybody out with it it might convince a lot of these Powers while you can save

3614
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:20,671
Britney's going to win France going to win let's join them

3615
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:22,719
Write change the course of the war that way

3616
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:25,279
So all these good arguments

3617
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,815
Starting to accrue for

3618
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:29,887
Cabal of people like Winston Churchill

3619
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:33,471
When all of a sudden something intervenes to bring the whole thing to a head

3620
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:40,639
Put it on the front burner and make the government consider whether or not it's a good idea that one thing to have a good idea to another thing

3621
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:42,943
You really be thinking about a case of Scooby-Doo

3622
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:44,991
And a request from the Russians

3623
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:48,063
Change this from a theoretical question to one that they're debating

3624
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:49,343
In early January 9th

3625
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:50,111
15

3626
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:51,647
The Russians are asking for him

3627
02:46:53,183 --> 02:46:54,207
They're facing

3628
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,999
The Turks down near there

3629
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:57,279
In a border the

3630
02:46:57,535 --> 02:46:58,303
Turks in the Russian

3631
02:46:58,559 --> 02:46:59,583
Territory touch

3632
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:04,703
Far away from where Russian forces were fighting the Germans in the austro-hungarian

3633
02:47:05,215 --> 02:47:06,495
Because of the distance

3634
02:47:07,007 --> 02:47:09,567
The Russians have pretty much taken their troops in

3635
02:47:09,823 --> 02:47:12,639
They're fighting for their lives against the Germans and use them up north

3636
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:14,175
And now the Turks are attached

3637
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:15,199
Lacking in strength

3638
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:16,223
Down south

3639
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,015
The situation will get

3640
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:19,295
Critical and late

3641
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:21,087
December 1 on December 29th

3642
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:24,671
The Turkish forces up against the Russians on their Mutual border

3643
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:26,207
Start the Battle of Sarah,

3644
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:27,999
And try to attack

3645
02:47:28,255 --> 02:47:29,535
The Russian Defenders

3646
02:47:30,047 --> 02:47:31,327
From multiple sides

3647
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:32,351
Tutte

3648
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:35,423
Very optimistic during Napoleonic in concept

3649
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:36,959
Plan

3650
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:39,263
Led by a civilian strategy

3651
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:43,615
I will take a hundred and twenty thousand men a good Turkish Army

3652
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:45,151
And ruin it

3653
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:49,247
Because he's Russian

3654
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:52,575
A smaller Force than the Turks attacking them

3655
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:53,855
Are ensconced

3656
02:47:54,111 --> 02:47:56,671
In the natural Fortress that is the Caucasus Mountain

3657
02:47:58,207 --> 02:47:59,231
In the middle of winter

3658
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:02,303
All this fighting is going to happen

3659
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:03,071
Elevation

3660
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,095
5000

3661
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:05,375
P1065

3662
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,191
Turkish soldiers are going to be fighting

3663
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:10,495
As though they're dressed for the lowlands

3664
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:12,799
The logistics of this

3665
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:15,359
120000 man army are going to be

3666
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:20,223
Carried up into these mountains on tiny little windy mountain roads and is not even many of them

3667
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,551
And it's snowing like you can't believe we're told of

3668
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:27,903
In a multiple days of 14-hour marches through

3669
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:33,023
In a waist-deep snow by the time these poor Turkish troops get to the Russians

3670
02:48:33,535 --> 02:48:35,071
Their darn near defeated that

3671
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:41,215
Some of them surrender ride with several cords Just Surrender that you and you just get this image of these starving

3672
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:44,799
You know units that are just falling apart and at the end of their rope

3673
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:51,199
Some fight bravely and almost fanatically anyway and then the next part of the story that's famous is the retreat

3674
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:52,479
Of this Turkish Army

3675
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:55,807
Back to Turkey they lose about half their strength

3676
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:57,599
We're told that of the

3677
02:48:58,111 --> 02:48:59,135
People that do make it back

3678
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:03,231
Is turkey a third of them are so badly wounded that they'll have some part of their body and face

3679
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:06,047
And the stories themselves and

3680
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:07,327
Amazing how

3681
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:09,119
A like they are booked a book

3682
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:13,215
But they make they create the sort of mental image of like Napoleon

3683
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:17,055
Retreating from Moscow in the winter harried the whole way back

3684
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:18,591
With these

3685
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:24,735
Soldiers that were freezing on the March cuz it was so cold in the mountain passes in the middle of winter

3686
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,783
And the Army is supposed to be followed by

3687
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:29,599
Through these

3688
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:31,135
It almost Bram Stoker

3689
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:32,671
Schleich train

3690
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:39,071
And taking the Frozen soldiers as they freezer is it become too wounded to defend themselves it's a horrifying story

3691
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:41,119
And the church will be very bitter

3692
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:42,143
And affected by the

3693
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:42,911
This battle

3694
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:45,215
The Russians will be though too

3695
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:47,775
Because even though they technically Win It

3696
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:53,407
For all they know the church could do this in another three weeks or another month and they're not ready for this again

3697
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:55,455
The Turkish attack down here

3698
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:58,015
Prove that this is not a quiet safe front

3699
02:49:58,271 --> 02:49:59,807
And you better be ready for more

3700
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:01,087
They're not ready for

3701
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:01,855
More

3702
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:02,623
This is why they are

3703
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:03,391
For help

3704
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:06,975
And they asked for some diversion to be made

3705
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:09,791
Will draw some of these Turkish troops away from them

3706
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:11,583
And maybe something that will

3707
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:13,119
Open up

3708
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,911
The supply lines again

3709
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:16,447
Because the Turks control

3710
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,471
One of the most

3711
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,751
Strategically important

3712
02:50:19,007 --> 02:50:19,519
Spots

3713
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:22,079
Not just in the world but in world history

3714
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:27,455
When you take Constantinople in the 15th century like the Turks did

3715
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:29,247
The Dardanelles come with it

3716
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,039
The Dardanelles

3717
02:50:31,551 --> 02:50:33,855
Are the actual separation

3718
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:36,415
And this is a geographic feature that goes back to

3719
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:37,183
Forever

3720
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:38,463
Between

3721
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,487
Asia and Europe

3722
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:41,279
You look at it on

3723
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:45,119
Satellite images it looks like a rather large river

3724
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:48,447
But it really is only a mile apart in some

3725
02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:49,215
Spotting

3726
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:50,751
This is the Waterway the

3727
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:51,775
It takes you from

3728
02:50:52,287 --> 02:50:57,663
You know the Aegean Sea which is connected to the Mediterranean Sea we just connected to the rest of the world

3729
02:50:58,687 --> 02:50:59,967
And get you from there

3730
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:00,991
To the black

3731
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:02,783
Which is not connect

3732
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,063
Get to the rest of the world

3733
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:05,855
Unless you're using the Dardanelles

3734
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:07,135
It's a straight

3735
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:08,927
Extreme importance

3736
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:10,207
And the church control

3737
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:13,023
They are fortresses on both sides of this

3738
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:14,303
Glorified River

3739
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:15,327
With Canon

3740
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:21,983
They've got mines in the water way to prevent people from getting through that they don't want to get through and once they get in the war in

3741
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:24,543
M1914 they don't want the Russians to get through

3742
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:26,335
And they don't want the British to get through

3743
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:31,711
And the French to get through and this is a huge problem for Russia because they don't have a lot of places

3744
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:35,295
You know where people can trade with them via the ocean

3745
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:36,319
Especially

3746
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:38,623
You know if it's anywhere near the winter months

3747
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:40,671
If it's near the winter months

3748
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:41,951
You need

3749
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:43,231
Dysport open

3750
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:44,511
Find the Black Sea port

3751
02:51:45,023 --> 02:51:46,047
Now the trucks are closed it

3752
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:48,095
The Russians are in such bad Straits

3753
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:49,887
They are sending soldiers

3754
02:51:50,143 --> 02:51:51,167
Into battle

3755
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:52,703
With a rifle

3756
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:56,799
And then another Soldier whose job it is to Shadow the first Soldier

3757
02:51:57,055 --> 02:52:01,151
And when the first Soldier dies pick up his rifle and use it because the second person didn't get it right

3758
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:06,527
The Russian industry cannot keep up with the military need

3759
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:12,927
So they're having problems like that so you can see how important it is for them to be able to trade with Britain and France and maybe I'll

3760
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:13,695
Outside powers

3761
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:18,047
If just to get rifles to arm their troops with and now the trucks are closed off

3762
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:19,583
An important area

3763
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:21,887
And Winston Churchill things he can open it

3764
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,703
He gets an idea

3765
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:29,055
That will involve any ground troops at all he continually point this out in his book by the way

3766
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,359
Use this book for

3767
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:33,151
For the show but not of the history book

3768
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:34,175
It's not the kind of

3769
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:34,943
Do you want to use

3770
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:35,967
Define historical

3771
02:52:36,223 --> 02:52:36,735
Truth

3772
02:52:37,247 --> 02:52:38,527
It's the kind of book you want to look

3773
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:39,295
Define

3774
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:42,879
The truth as Churchill saw it and Justified it after

3775
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:44,415
Which is a very different thing

3776
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:47,231
Churchill's fingerprints are all over this thing

3777
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:48,511
This thing is going to go south

3778
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:56,191
He does what almost any other person with any responsibility for World War in their postwar

3779
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:57,215
Memoirs

3780
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,751
He defends himself

3781
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:01,311
Answers his critics justifies this

3782
02:53:01,567 --> 02:53:02,847
Explains that and

3783
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:05,663
You no different than the German generals

3784
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:06,431
What not

3785
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:07,455
In that respect

3786
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:09,503
But his point is

3787
02:53:09,759 --> 02:53:11,807
When he thought of this idea

3788
02:53:12,063 --> 02:53:13,599
It didn't involve any land troops

3789
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:15,647
Since its land troops are going to be a huge part of

3790
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:20,511
Tragedy that this unfolds into he basically says he washed his hands of the whole plan once

3791
02:53:20,767 --> 02:53:22,047
That situation changed

3792
02:53:22,303 --> 02:53:23,327
Churchill's plan

3793
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:24,351
What's the take

3794
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:28,447
The largest most powerful Fleet ever assembled in world history

3795
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:29,983
And force the straight

3796
02:53:31,519 --> 02:53:32,031
Simply

3797
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:33,567
Sail through them

3798
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:39,967
Wiping out any Fort you know this anywhere nearby with Naval gunfire and go from one side to the

3799
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:43,039
And then once you're on the other side you're right next to

3800
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:48,159
Formerly Constantinople now Istanbul and you have a giant megalopolis

3801
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:50,463
Underneath the guns of the greatest

3802
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,487
Fleet ever assembled

3803
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:52,767
Sent to war

3804
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:55,327
It's an idea that looks

3805
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:56,095
Great

3806
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:56,863
On paper

3807
02:53:58,143 --> 02:53:58,655
And then by the

3808
02:53:58,911 --> 02:54:03,263
Time events go from a all the way through the alphabet to Z though

3809
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:05,567
You see who rules the alpha

3810
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:07,871
When it comes to getting

3811
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:08,895
Something from the

3812
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,663
Leafy erratic

3813
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:10,943
Full stage 2 the reality

3814
02:54:11,199 --> 02:54:12,479
Beijing that's Murphy's Law

3815
02:54:13,503 --> 02:54:15,551
And Murphy's Law grabs hold of these events

3816
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:18,623
And quickly turns this whole Affair into something

3817
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:20,415
No one had ever thought

3818
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:21,183
What's the right thing to

3819
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:23,743
Told you how people can get

3820
02:54:23,999 --> 02:54:28,351
Swamped by events sometimes in Churchill spends a good part of his book on this subject

3821
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:31,679
Trying to point out that he was one of the victims of what happen

3822
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:35,263
He's often been portrayed

3823
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:36,287
As the architect

3824
02:54:38,591 --> 02:54:39,359
If you ever want to see

3825
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:40,383
Frustrating

3826
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:41,407
History

3827
02:54:41,663 --> 02:54:42,175
Can be sometime

3828
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:44,479
Look at Churchill's thinking of

3829
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:48,575
Because when you examine it it's so logical he's doing exactly what

3830
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:52,159
Any of us would help somebody in a position of power we do in terms of

3831
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:56,255
I'm going down the arguments and the risks and benefits logically

3832
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:58,047
And it still turns out

3833
02:54:58,559 --> 02:54:59,071
Horribly

3834
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,351
What's the weather

3835
02:55:00,607 --> 02:55:02,911
Lesson is that teaching to the other commanders were saying

3836
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:05,215
Yeah just keep smashing against the wall

3837
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:07,007
Oh my goodness doesn't scene

3838
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:12,639
To matter whether you think outside the box we do the same darn stupid pointless thing again and again

3839
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:16,735
The first world war equalizes the results of both of that

3840
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:20,063
And you're darned if you think and you're darned if you don't

3841
02:55:21,599 --> 02:55:22,879
Church of the basic assumption

3842
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:26,975
Was it the British Empire was sitting on an enormously powerful Fleet

3843
02:55:27,743 --> 02:55:28,255
That was used

3844
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:34,399
The part that was useless is so useless you can't even use it if the enemy Fleet comes out

3845
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:36,447
The fight is a whole bunch of British ships

3846
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:39,775
It were made obsolete only in 1906 remember

3847
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:41,567
1940-1950

3848
02:55:42,335 --> 02:55:43,615
What happened in 1906

3849
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:45,663
A brand new type of battle

3850
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:50,271
Became the name of the initial ship names dreadnought

3851
02:55:50,783 --> 02:55:53,087
And that becomes the name for that entire

3852
02:55:53,599 --> 02:55:54,111
Type of vessel

3853
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:56,415
A dreadnought

3854
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:58,463
Class name now that's

3855
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:00,511
Because that's how revolutionary this ship was

3856
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,303
The problem is

3857
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:04,607
Is the instant it arrives on the scene

3858
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:05,887
It makes obsolete

3859
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:07,167
Fleets of

3860
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:13,823
Hugely expensive vessels dozens and dozens and dozens of the Dead have been built up over a lifetime makes them obsolete overnight

3861
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:18,175
And of course the British being the greatest Navy in the world they had the most of these

3862
02:56:18,687 --> 02:56:19,199
Battleship

3863
02:56:19,967 --> 02:56:20,479
The older boy

3864
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:24,831
The ones that in 1905 or the greatest force of float

3865
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:27,391
The 1906 are ready for the scrap Heap

3866
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:31,231
That's what Churchill said all these ships were heading for

3867
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:35,327
What are we saving them for they just going to be scrapped after the war he said that the Admirals had these

3868
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:37,631
Emotional attachments to these ships

3869
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:38,911
Because they've served on the Moor

3870
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:42,751
They remember the day when these were the most powerful warships afloat in Churchill

3871
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:46,079
Attitude is these are assets to be used up for a gain

3872
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:49,151
We can use him in the Dardanelles and if we lose him we don't lose any

3873
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:56,831
Winston Churchill's plan of using

3874
02:56:57,087 --> 02:57:03,231
The fleet in a lightning attack that the Turks weren't ready for with massive Force I could just force The Straits before anyone

3875
02:57:03,743 --> 02:57:04,511
Could respond to it

3876
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:07,583
Turns into something totally different

3877
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:09,631
Over the next several weeks

3878
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:12,447
And Churchill has always claimed

3879
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:15,263
Did the events were completely out of his control

3880
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:18,079
What are uses as an argument the line

3881
02:57:18,335 --> 02:57:20,639
He was told that there were no troops available

3882
02:57:20,895 --> 02:57:23,199
So any plan he came up with pretty much had to have

3883
02:57:23,455 --> 02:57:27,295
A tiny little group of Marines to run on Shore and knock out a gun if necessary

3884
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:30,111
But nothing else so he says basically he can't be responsible

3885
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:32,671
Sponsible for this land disaster that's about to happen

3886
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:34,975
He never assumed there be any troops anyway here's what he said

3887
02:57:35,743 --> 02:57:36,255
Quote

3888
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:39,839
At the evening meeting of the war council on January 28th

3889
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:44,703
When the final decision to adopt the plan was taken Lord Kitchener repeated quote

3890
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:47,007
We have at present no troops to spare

3891
02:57:47,263 --> 02:57:53,151
It was on that Foundation alone that all our decisions in favor of a purely Naval attack have been taken

3892
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:57,503
But henceforward a series of new facts and pressures came into play

3893
02:57:57,759 --> 02:58:01,343
Which gradually but unceasingly change the character

3894
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:04,159
An enormously extended the scale of the Enterprise

3895
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:08,255
Under these influences in less than 2 months the naval attack

3896
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:12,095
With its lack of certainty but with its limited costs and risks

3897
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:13,631
Became subsidiary

3898
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:17,727
And in its place there arose a military development of great magnitude

3899
02:58:17,983 --> 02:58:21,567
Over this new plan the admiralty had no responsible control

3900
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:27,967
Our advice did not Prevail our criticisms were not welcomed and even inquiries became a matter of

3901
02:58:28,223 --> 02:58:28,991
Delicacy intact

3902
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:30,015
Nonetheless

3903
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:32,575
By the results of this military operation

3904
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:34,367
We had to stand or fall

3905
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:35,647
And quote

3906
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:38,207
I know you don't need translation from me

3907
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:43,839
But isn't that the same as saying hey that wasn't my idea you changed it but I still have to be responsible for it

3908
02:58:44,863 --> 02:58:46,655
You see a lot of post World War 1 map

3909
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:47,935
Martin sound like that

3910
02:58:48,191 --> 02:58:48,703
Nonetheless

3911
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:50,751
It adequately explains how

3912
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:56,127
Out of control the process seen once Churchill and his cabal had taken their little private idea

3913
02:58:56,383 --> 02:59:00,479
And had adopted by not just one government but the Allies as

3914
02:59:00,735 --> 02:59:01,247
The plan

3915
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:03,551
Of course in the final analysis

3916
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:06,623
The people with the most control over your plan

3917
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:07,903
If your wisdom Church

3918
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:10,463
Are the ones on the scene

3919
02:59:10,975 --> 02:59:11,999
Actually have to make it work

3920
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:13,279
The military can

3921
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:15,327
In this case the Admiral

3922
02:59:17,119 --> 02:59:18,399
On February

3923
02:59:18,655 --> 02:59:24,031
17th a couple of those Admirals are leading the most powerful Fleet that's ever gone to war

3924
02:59:26,847 --> 02:59:27,359
Bleeding a little

3925
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:30,943
Who poker the most powerful Fleet in the world is the British Fleet sitting

3926
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:35,551
I'll be in scapa flow up in Scotland waiting for the German Fleet to come out

3927
02:59:35,807 --> 02:59:36,319
Play

3928
02:59:36,831 --> 02:59:38,111
But that bleeds never done any

3929
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:40,159
They're waiting for their chance

3930
02:59:40,415 --> 02:59:44,511
What's the largest most powerful Fleet that ever gone to war and try to do something so far

3931
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:45,279
This one

3932
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:49,119
18 or so battleships most of the British summer in French

3933
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:52,191
Most of these the old battleships

3934
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:55,263
That were made obsolete a decade before but also including

3935
02:59:55,519 --> 02:59:57,055
The newest Super dreadnought

3936
02:59:57,567 --> 02:59:59,615
Queen Elizabeth with 15 inch guns

3937
03:00:00,127 --> 03:00:04,223
At 12 or so Cruisers 30 destroyers a couple hundred transports

3938
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:07,295
This Fleet might not have lasted very long again

3939
03:00:07,807 --> 03:00:08,319
Crack

3940
03:00:08,575 --> 03:00:09,855
German Fleet

3941
03:00:10,111 --> 03:00:12,927
But in this part of the world it's the most powerful

3942
03:00:13,183 --> 03:00:13,951
Uniforce afloat

3943
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:17,023
And would have been the greatest thing in the world a decade

3944
03:00:18,047 --> 03:00:19,839
It arrives in off the coast

3945
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:20,863
Turkey and begins

3946
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:21,887
Selling those

3947
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:22,655
Straits

3948
03:00:23,679 --> 03:00:24,447
On February 19th

3949
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:26,751
And things starts

3950
03:00:27,007 --> 03:00:27,775
Slowing down

3951
03:00:29,055 --> 03:00:32,639
Plan is to battle your way through destroy all these fortresses as you continue to move.

3952
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:33,919
Deeper and deeper into this

3953
03:00:34,175 --> 03:00:34,943
A river like

3954
03:00:35,199 --> 03:00:36,223
Piece of geography

3955
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:38,527
But you know the weather gets bad

3956
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:39,295
Sweet Retreats

3957
03:00:39,551 --> 03:00:40,575
Into a safe distance

3958
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:46,719
And then it comes up and they shall come forth and then something else goes wrong and Church of the sitting back in Britain going crazy pulling his hair out

3959
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:49,279
Sending messages after messages basically saying

3960
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:52,351
Hurry hurry hurry the whole plan requires you to hurry

3961
03:00:53,119 --> 03:00:54,143
Because the longer they take

3962
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:57,727
The more you lose this whole idea that there's some surprise to it

3963
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:59,519
The catches the Turks off guard

3964
03:00:59,775 --> 03:01:04,127
And so the Turks have already figured out when you see the largest Fleet than it ever going to war

3965
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:10,783
Show the British are doing something down here the good news is that does take away troops fighting the Russians and take some pressure off

3966
03:01:12,575 --> 03:01:13,343
He asked for help

3967
03:01:13,599 --> 03:01:14,111
The first place

3968
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:17,695
The bad news is instead of the British advancing against a totally

3969
03:01:17,951 --> 03:01:21,023
I'm ready fo you know when taking advantage of surprise

3970
03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:24,863
They're sitting there giving the whole basic idea way

3971
03:01:25,119 --> 03:01:25,631
Vermont

3972
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:28,959
On the 18th of March

3973
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:35,103
The fleet decide to try again in a big way Churchill's back there prodding and get to work it out there do a big attack

3974
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:38,943
And the 18 battleships in the whole Fleet goes in start selling the Ford

3975
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:39,967
Submarines are

3976
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:44,319
Detached and sent on land to go take some of these sports that are particularly troublesome

3977
03:01:44,575 --> 03:01:45,343
And then

3978
03:01:46,111 --> 03:01:47,135
A ship hits a mine

3979
03:01:48,415 --> 03:01:49,183
French battleship

3980
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:50,719
Range Rover

3981
03:01:50,975 --> 03:01:51,487
Really quick

3982
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:53,023
About 700 people died

3983
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:53,791
Kaboom

3984
03:01:55,327 --> 03:01:57,375
Before anyone's had time to digest.

3985
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:58,655
Another one

3986
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:03,263
And then another one and by the way on the scene they don't know that these are mine

3987
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:09,407
Mine's are one of the things I thought about Torpedoes or another all they know is big expensive important ships

3988
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:10,687
At least in the old

3989
03:02:10,943 --> 03:02:11,967
They are starting

3990
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:13,247
Sink and list and

3991
03:02:13,503 --> 03:02:17,343
Explode and the commanders pull everything back and by the time

3992
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,879
They get away from The Straits

3993
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:20,159
They've lost

3994
03:02:20,415 --> 03:02:21,695
Or seen

3995
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:22,719
Triple six

3996
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:28,095
Now what Winston Churchill would say and what he did say is who cares

3997
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:32,447
These are old battleships are not of any use to us at all

3998
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:35,263
So using to take the straight but at least take the straight

3999
03:02:35,519 --> 03:02:37,567
He said the Admirals had a whole different opinion

4000
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:40,895
They didn't see this as an asset to be used

4001
03:02:41,151 --> 03:02:42,175
They saw it as

4002
03:02:42,431 --> 03:02:42,943
A

4003
03:02:43,199 --> 03:02:44,479
Charge to protect

4004
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:51,135
Pajamas he said had an emotional attachment to these ships they walk their decks back when they were young officers in

4005
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:52,159
Chinese ships were the

4006
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:54,719
Queens of the Seas and he says now they had this

4007
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:59,583
Attachment they didn't want to lose them and the whole point was they were there cuz they were losable

4008
03:03:00,351 --> 03:03:05,471
Again what's so terrible about what follows is Churchill's attitude was that the sleep was totally expendable

4009
03:03:05,727 --> 03:03:07,263
Put in order to protect this

4010
03:03:07,519 --> 03:03:10,591
Expendable Fleet the high command decides the ground troops how to

4011
03:03:10,847 --> 03:03:11,359
Be sent in

4012
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:13,151
They pull the fleet back

4013
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:16,735
I begin assembling these 80000 men that they're going to attack

4014
03:03:17,247 --> 03:03:19,295
This area within the plan is

4015
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:24,415
To overwhelm this peninsula called the Gallipoli Peninsula that's right next to the Dardanelles

4016
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:28,767
And take over all those Forts and all those gun positions with your ground troops

4017
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:34,911
Then those guns won't fire on your little teeny minesweepers were clearing the Straits of the mines

4018
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:36,959
And then your big battleships won't get mine

4019
03:03:38,239 --> 03:03:39,263
But it's the tail

4020
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:40,543
Wagging the dog here

4021
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:44,127
And Churchill and others have said ever since the war was over

4022
03:03:44,383 --> 03:03:45,663
That this was a disaster

4023
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:47,711
Waiting to happen because the whole point of this

4024
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:52,063
Plan is to use strategic surprise to catch the enemy off guard

4025
03:03:52,319 --> 03:03:54,623
How's it going to be going to be caught off-guard when it takes

4026
03:03:55,135 --> 03:03:55,647
5

4027
03:03:55,903 --> 03:03:58,463
Weeks after the battleships pull back

4028
03:03:58,719 --> 03:04:00,511
To get the ground forces on the beach

4029
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:03,327
The Turks are commanded

4030
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:04,351
My German Jen

4031
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:05,375
Case

4032
03:04:06,655 --> 03:04:09,727
A very competent guy named liman Von Sanders who supposedly says

4033
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:16,383
If the Allies will just give him eight days he can put together a defense he's desperate for time

4034
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:17,663
In 5 weeks

4035
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:20,479
By the time the landings take place

4036
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:23,295
In late April early May 1915

4037
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:27,647
To say that the Turks are ready maybe is a little bit presumptuous

4038
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:28,927
But they're waiting

4039
03:04:31,743 --> 03:04:33,791
And you get a chance to see

4040
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:37,631
What the worst nightmares of Allied planners

4041
03:04:38,143 --> 03:04:41,727
We're planning for D-Day in the second world war you know the attack

4042
03:04:42,239 --> 03:04:43,007
Across the beaches

4043
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:44,799
Across the English Channel Landing

4044
03:04:45,055 --> 03:04:51,199
Allied troops on the occupied French Coastline so you can see what their nightmares must have been like because they were young men when they

4045
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:54,271
They got to see how something like an amphibious assault could go wrong

4046
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:55,551
Have they saw it on the

4047
03:04:55,807 --> 03:04:56,319
Beaches of

4048
03:04:58,367 --> 03:04:59,135
First of all

4049
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:01,439
It was a nightmare

4050
03:05:01,951 --> 03:05:02,719
Improvisation

4051
03:05:04,511 --> 03:05:05,791
These troops were trained

4052
03:05:06,047 --> 03:05:08,095
For war not trained for amphibious assault

4053
03:05:09,119 --> 03:05:10,911
They landed sometimes on the wrong Beach

4054
03:05:11,423 --> 03:05:16,543
They have completely somehow gotten the train all wrong even with aerial surveillance

4055
03:05:16,799 --> 03:05:19,359
I mean the poor Australians are landed in a

4056
03:05:19,615 --> 03:05:22,943
Mile from where they were supposed to land

4057
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:25,247
It's like a reverse Amphitheater

4058
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:30,111
A historian John Keegan who visited the sites of the one thing that overwhelms you when you go there

4059
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:31,647
I needed it this

4060
03:05:31,903 --> 03:05:38,047
I need little coal and you drop a ton of Australians there with The High Ground all around them like an Amphitheater

4061
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:39,583
And just leave them

4062
03:05:41,119 --> 03:05:42,143
I'm some of these beaches

4063
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:47,007
The Allies are able to land route relatively easily and try to capture The High Ground

4064
03:05:47,263 --> 03:05:51,103
Another Beaches they landed on sure what to do on a couple of these

4065
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:53,151
Beaches the Turks are waiting for them

4066
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:54,687
And massacres

4067
03:05:55,199 --> 03:05:55,967
She would have won

4068
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:58,271
The Allies had taken a a

4069
03:05:58,527 --> 03:05:59,295
Transport ship

4070
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:04,415
And cut out a hole in it so that they can drive it right up on the beach in the soldiers could just

4071
03:06:04,671 --> 03:06:06,207
Jump out and be ready to fight

4072
03:06:06,719 --> 03:06:08,255
The troops trained machine gun

4073
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:09,279
On the door

4074
03:06:09,535 --> 03:06:14,399
I'm in the door opened and all these troops jumped out they were machine-gunned one by one by one as they hit the

4075
03:06:15,935 --> 03:06:16,703
Less than

4076
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:17,983
25 of them

4077
03:06:19,007 --> 03:06:19,519
Several hundred

4078
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:25,151
Even when the Allied Forces at Great cost sometimes take these beaches

4079
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:27,455
They're not only sure what to do next

4080
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:31,295
They have no idea how things are going on the beach next to them

4081
03:06:31,551 --> 03:06:36,671
They don't know if the ships know where they are the ships don't know where they are there's no coordination going on

4082
03:06:37,183 --> 03:06:42,303
And you really get a wonderful object lesson in which you're also getting on the Western Front

4083
03:06:43,071 --> 03:06:45,631
Concerning what weapon system is really missing

4084
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:46,655
War

4085
03:06:46,911 --> 03:06:52,031
Unit exist but not in the way where it's coordinated not in the way that you'll see it come of age in the next World War

4086
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,079
It's one of those things that when you

4087
03:06:54,847 --> 03:07:00,991
Considerate in a vacuum it doesn't even sound like a weapon it's like barbed wire you don't think of Barbed wires weapon you don't think of Ray

4088
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:03,551
Radio communications as a weapon either

4089
03:07:04,831 --> 03:07:09,183
Pin the missing ingredient in so many of these missed opportunities in this war

4090
03:07:09,439 --> 03:07:15,583
If only the troops that broke through knew they broke through if only they could change were the artillery with shootings if only we could

4091
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:18,911
Bring up reinforcements this happens all the time on the Western Front

4092
03:07:19,679 --> 03:07:20,447
Now it's happening

4093
03:07:20,959 --> 03:07:21,471
Gallipoli

4094
03:07:23,519 --> 03:07:24,799
Sometimes these troops land

4095
03:07:25,311 --> 03:07:31,455
Imma just noticed and they don't know what they're supposed to do next or they take the first position that the plans ahead of time called for them to take

4096
03:07:31,711 --> 03:07:32,735
And they stop there

4097
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:35,807
What would you expect them to do they don't know what's going on

4098
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:39,135
Have to be careful of their own artillery going to Shell them

4099
03:07:39,647 --> 03:07:40,927
The problem is is once again

4100
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:42,719
It allows the Turks

4101
03:07:43,999 --> 03:07:46,303
And you will see a lot of fighting going on

4102
03:07:46,559 --> 03:07:48,351
For the high ground bees areas

4103
03:07:48,607 --> 03:07:50,143
That Overlook the beaches

4104
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:54,751
You know this whole time still might have work if the Turks had turned out to be a soft

4105
03:07:55,007 --> 03:07:55,519
Anime

4106
03:07:56,031 --> 03:07:57,823
You know if they turned out to be as weak

4107
03:07:58,079 --> 03:07:59,615
And is decadent and his

4108
03:07:59,871 --> 03:08:03,455
The unmotivated is Allied planner sort of assumed that they would be

4109
03:08:03,711 --> 03:08:05,503
Instead they fought like a lion

4110
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:10,879
Which of the Turks are capable of the Turks are very dangerous Soldiers the ethnic Turks especially

4111
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:12,927
And they'll be an incident at one of the top

4112
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:13,695
Chubbies Heights

4113
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:15,487
Where Allied Forces

4114
03:08:15,999 --> 03:08:19,839
Are fighting with Turkish forces led by a guy named Mustafa Kemal

4115
03:08:20,863 --> 03:08:24,703
Go after the war will become one of the most important figures in post-war turkey

4116
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:26,495
35 years old

4117
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:32,895
And he sees the Allied Forces in his area reaching the heights everybody knows that these Heights are going to be important

4118
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:34,431
And he ordered his troops there

4119
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:35,711
Out of ammunition

4120
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:37,503
To hold them off and he says

4121
03:08:37,759 --> 03:08:38,527
These famous

4122
03:08:38,783 --> 03:08:40,831
In a lines that have gone down in Turkish history

4123
03:08:43,135 --> 03:08:45,695
I don't order you to attack I order you to die

4124
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:48,255
In the time which passes until we die

4125
03:08:48,511 --> 03:08:50,559
Other troops and commanders can take our place

4126
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:52,351
And quote

4127
03:08:53,631 --> 03:08:58,239
What about the opposite reaction what the Allies were expecting the resistance to be like

4128
03:09:00,031 --> 03:09:01,055
The Allied resistance

4129
03:09:01,567 --> 03:09:02,591
Is just a spirit

4130
03:09:03,871 --> 03:09:05,407
The Australians and new zealanders

4131
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:09,247
To be honest will prove themselves some of the best if not

4132
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:10,015
The best

4133
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:12,063
Fighters in the war on these beaches

4134
03:09:12,319 --> 03:09:14,111
But they're completely hamstrung by the

4135
03:09:15,135 --> 03:09:15,647
Screw up

4136
03:09:16,159 --> 03:09:16,927
On the situation

4137
03:09:17,695 --> 03:09:19,231
And in almost no time

4138
03:09:20,255 --> 03:09:22,303
The Gallipoli campaign

4139
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:25,375
Turns into a Mediterranean version

4140
03:09:25,887 --> 03:09:27,167
Eastern Front

4141
03:09:29,727 --> 03:09:31,263
And it's got all the same

4142
03:09:31,775 --> 03:09:34,079
Tragic Hallmarks that the Western Front has

4143
03:09:34,591 --> 03:09:35,359
Barbed wire

4144
03:09:35,615 --> 03:09:36,383
Artillery

4145
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:37,663
No man's land

4146
03:09:38,175 --> 03:09:39,199
Trenches the whole thing

4147
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:43,039
And a military historian would point out that of course it does

4148
03:09:43,295 --> 03:09:48,927
It's the same situation the same things and conditions that created the need to have people dig into the Earth

4149
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:50,207
Anna created

4150
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:56,351
The power of the defensive over the offense if it's just as present in the Mediterranean in the Aegean is it is on the Western Front

4151
03:09:57,119 --> 03:09:58,655
The Australians find out about this

4152
03:09:59,167 --> 03:10:00,703
Firsthand I grew up next to it

4153
03:10:00,959 --> 03:10:03,775
Air Force Colonel Isaac you fought in the Second World War

4154
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:06,591
I used to ask him who the toughest soldiers were

4155
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:09,663
8 that was an interesting question to me

4156
03:10:10,175 --> 03:10:11,967
And I always wanted to hear something like

4157
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:16,063
Germans and I remember he surprised me once by saying the British in general

4158
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:18,879
And the Australian and New Zealand troops specifically

4159
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:21,183
I said why and he said be

4160
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:24,511
Because you would find yourself in these horrible situations

4161
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:25,791
And they would be like

4162
03:10:26,815 --> 03:10:27,327
Joke

4163
03:10:28,607 --> 03:10:29,375
They said that's

4164
03:10:29,887 --> 03:10:31,167
Indicative of a

4165
03:10:31,423 --> 03:10:33,727
I'm a level of bravery that you don't normally see

4166
03:10:34,239 --> 03:10:35,519
But it doesn't always help you

4167
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:36,287
There's a story

4168
03:10:36,799 --> 03:10:42,943
I'm an Australian corporate who wrote about being pinned down on one of these beaches when they land and the Turks have The High Ground there shoe

4169
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:44,479
Shooting down before Australian

4170
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:49,855
For trying to get their act together get organized figure out what we do next while they're under Fire

4171
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:51,647
And while their friends are dying

4172
03:10:51,903 --> 03:10:52,671
And yes

4173
03:10:52,927 --> 03:10:53,951
For a little while

4174
03:10:54,207 --> 03:10:54,975
Some of them are laughing

4175
03:10:55,231 --> 03:10:55,999
Rights quote

4176
03:10:56,767 --> 03:11:00,607
Golling fire rained on us from the left where they were high Cliffs

4177
03:11:00,863 --> 03:11:03,423
One man drop down alongside me laughing

4178
03:11:03,935 --> 03:11:05,215
I broke the news to him gently

4179
03:11:05,727 --> 03:11:08,287
You got yourself into the hottest Corner you'll ever strike

4180
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:10,079
I showed him where the enemy were

4181
03:11:10,335 --> 03:11:11,615
He fired a few shots

4182
03:11:11,871 --> 03:11:14,175
And again I heard the sickening thought of a bullet

4183
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:15,711
I look at him in horror

4184
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:20,063
The bullet-head fearfully mashed his face and gone down his throat rendering him dumb

4185
03:11:20,575 --> 03:11:22,367
What is eyes were Dreadful to behold

4186
03:11:22,879 --> 03:11:24,159
How he squirmed in agony

4187
03:11:24,671 --> 03:11:27,743
There was nothing I could do for him but pray that he might die swiftly

4188
03:11:27,999 --> 03:11:30,303
It took him about 20 minutes to accomplish this

4189
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:33,631
And by that time he tangled up his legs in pain and stiffened

4190
03:11:33,887 --> 03:11:36,447
I saw the waxy color creepover his cheek

4191
03:11:36,959 --> 03:11:37,727
And breathe easier

4192
03:11:38,751 --> 03:11:39,263
And quote

4193
03:11:40,287 --> 03:11:44,895
Amazing to think about this one person who's got to consider his own life which is under attack

4194
03:11:45,407 --> 03:11:47,711
How he deals with Tru to need him and

4195
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:49,503
He gets to watch that going on

4196
03:11:49,759 --> 03:11:50,783
20 minutes to

4197
03:11:51,295 --> 03:11:55,903
If I tend to focus on the horror in the story they didn't tell me it's because that's what gets to me

4198
03:11:56,671 --> 03:11:58,975
Any history you read on any subject is going to

4199
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:00,767
By its very nature

4200
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:04,095
The person telling a story usually historian but then sometimes you

4201
03:12:04,607 --> 03:12:06,911
Is going to focus on the things

4202
03:12:07,167 --> 03:12:09,215
Intrigue or interest them for me

4203
03:12:09,727 --> 03:12:12,287
It's what these people had to go through on all sides

4204
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,079
And it's the horror

4205
03:12:14,335 --> 03:12:18,943
Did I constantly try to imagine myself experiencing and it's mind-blowing to me

4206
03:12:19,199 --> 03:12:19,711
And I think I

4207
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,735
Anime shows

4208
03:12:20,991 --> 03:12:23,551
The ones who stayed with me listening like you

4209
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:25,855
There's got to be something that touches you too

4210
03:12:26,367 --> 03:12:27,135
Gallipoli

4211
03:12:27,391 --> 03:12:28,415
You have the same

4212
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:29,439
Charnel house

4213
03:12:29,695 --> 03:12:31,743
Situation where dead bodies

4214
03:12:32,511 --> 03:12:33,791
Are a part of your life

4215
03:12:34,303 --> 03:12:36,351
And living amongst them

4216
03:12:36,863 --> 03:12:41,727
Is part of the horror that enough that your life is always at stake that you watch all this death and destruction

4217
03:12:41,983 --> 03:12:43,519
But you live with Corpses

4218
03:12:44,287 --> 03:12:45,055
Corpses of

4219
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:47,615
People you often know or knew

4220
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:50,687
This is a remembrance by British soldier

4221
03:12:50,943 --> 03:12:52,735
Leonard Thompson who arrives

4222
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:54,527
Are the Dardanelles right after the

4223
03:12:54,783 --> 03:12:55,551
Major Landing

4224
03:12:56,063 --> 03:12:56,575
Quote

4225
03:12:57,087 --> 03:13:01,439
We arrived at the Dardanelles and saw the guns flashing and heard the rifle fire

4226
03:13:01,695 --> 03:13:04,767
They heaved our ship the river Clyde right up to the shore

4227
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:09,887
They've cut a hole in it and made a little peer so we were able to walk straight off and on to the beach

4228
03:13:10,143 --> 03:13:11,167
We all sat there

4229
03:13:11,423 --> 03:13:12,191
On the hellespont

4230
03:13:12,703 --> 03:13:13,983
Waiting for it to get light

4231
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:16,287
The first things we saw our big wreck

4232
03:13:16,543 --> 03:13:17,311
Turkish guns

4233
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:19,359
The second a big Marquee

4234
03:13:19,615 --> 03:13:22,687
You didn't make me think of the military but of the village vets

4235
03:13:23,199 --> 03:13:28,831
Other people must have thought like this too because I remember how we all rushed up to it like boys getting into a circus

4236
03:13:29,087 --> 03:13:30,623
And then found it all laced up

4237
03:13:30,879 --> 03:13:32,671
We on laced it and rushed in

4238
03:13:33,183 --> 03:13:33,951
It was full of corpse

4239
03:13:34,719 --> 03:13:35,231
Englishmen

4240
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:38,303
Lines and lines of them with their eyes wide open

4241
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:40,095
We all stop talking

4242
03:13:40,351 --> 03:13:42,143
I never seen a dead man before

4243
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:44,447
And here I was looking at two or three hundred of them

4244
03:13:44,959 --> 03:13:46,239
It was our first fear

4245
03:13:46,495 --> 03:13:47,519
Nobody had mentioned that

4246
03:13:48,031 --> 03:13:48,799
I was very shocked

4247
03:13:49,311 --> 03:13:50,079
And I thought of Suffolk

4248
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:53,151
And how it seemed a happy place for the first time

4249
03:13:53,663 --> 03:13:55,199
We set to work to bury people

4250
03:13:55,711 --> 03:13:57,503
We pushed them into the sides of the trench

4251
03:13:57,759 --> 03:14:00,575
The bits of them kept getting uncovered in sticking out

4252
03:14:00,831 --> 03:14:02,623
But people in the badly made bed

4253
03:14:03,135 --> 03:14:04,159
Hands were the worst

4254
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:05,951
They would escape from the sand

4255
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:08,255
Pointing begging even waving

4256
03:14:08,511 --> 03:14:11,327
It was one which We All Shook when we passed by

4257
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:13,631
Saying good morning in a posh voice

4258
03:14:13,887 --> 03:14:14,655
Everybody did it

4259
03:14:15,167 --> 03:14:19,263
The bottom of the trench with springy like a mattress because of all the bodies underneath

4260
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:20,031
At night

4261
03:14:20,287 --> 03:14:21,567
When the stench was worse

4262
03:14:21,823 --> 03:14:24,127
We tied crepe around our mouths and noses

4263
03:14:24,383 --> 03:14:27,967
Describe have been given to us because it was supposed to prevent us from being gassed

4264
03:14:28,223 --> 03:14:30,271
The Flies enter the trenches at night

4265
03:14:30,527 --> 03:14:32,063
And lined them completely

4266
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:34,623
With a density which was like moving claw

4267
03:14:35,135 --> 03:14:39,231
We killed millions of them by slapping are spades along the trench walls

4268
03:14:39,487 --> 03:14:41,279
But the next night it would be just as bad

4269
03:14:41,791 --> 03:14:45,887
We were all lousy and we couldn't stop shiting because we caught dysentery

4270
03:14:46,399 --> 03:14:46,911
We wept

4271
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:48,447
Not because we were frightened

4272
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:49,983
Because we were so dirty

4273
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:51,263
And quote

4274
03:14:53,055 --> 03:14:54,591
And like a bad movie

4275
03:14:55,615 --> 03:14:58,175
The Gallipoli campaign which was supposed to

4276
03:14:58,431 --> 03:14:59,711
Do an end-around

4277
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:01,759
The suffering of the Western Front

4278
03:15:02,271 --> 03:15:04,575
An end more quickly by striking

4279
03:15:04,831 --> 03:15:05,855
Another week joint

4280
03:15:06,111 --> 03:15:07,391
In the enemy's Alliance

4281
03:15:08,159 --> 03:15:10,463
Just extended that suffering to a new phone

4282
03:15:12,511 --> 03:15:13,279
The entire

4283
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:15,327
Affair will get continually worse

4284
03:15:15,839 --> 03:15:18,143
As generals and Admirals who don't want to admit

4285
03:15:18,399 --> 03:15:21,215
Defeat keep pouring more and more reinforcements into it

4286
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:23,263
The Turk do the same thing I just becomes

4287
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:24,799
This ongoing hell

4288
03:15:25,823 --> 03:15:27,103
Is on going to hell

4289
03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:29,663
Will eventually cost Winston Churchill his job

4290
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:32,223
Back to British government

4291
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:36,831
Essentially have to reorganize after create a coalition government in Churchill's the one left out

4292
03:15:37,599 --> 03:15:39,647
He will leave the admiralty were told

4293
03:15:40,159 --> 03:15:41,183
After being shot

4294
03:15:41,439 --> 03:15:43,487
With tears in his eyes certain

4295
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:45,279
But his career is over

4296
03:15:46,303 --> 03:15:47,327
Talk about one of the

4297
03:15:47,583 --> 03:15:48,095
Great

4298
03:15:48,351 --> 03:15:51,167
Mistakes of all-time obviously had a great career ahead of him

4299
03:15:51,679 --> 03:15:53,215
Pictures of weird guy

4300
03:15:54,239 --> 03:15:55,775
I always have to watch myself with him

4301
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:56,799
Because I like him

4302
03:15:57,055 --> 03:15:58,079
I think a lot of us like you

4303
03:15:58,591 --> 03:16:00,639
As a historical figure he's quite likeable

4304
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:01,919
Teddy

4305
03:16:02,175 --> 03:16:02,943
That's the same way

4306
03:16:03,199 --> 03:16:04,479
But you have to remember

4307
03:16:04,735 --> 03:16:06,271
These guys have qualities

4308
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:08,063
That make them somewhat unusual

4309
03:16:08,319 --> 03:16:11,135
It's hard to factor those qualities into the man

4310
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:12,671
Churchill toad

4311
03:16:13,183 --> 03:16:15,487
One of his best friends in February 1950

4312
03:16:15,743 --> 03:16:18,815
The time when he's planning this whole Gallipoli thing

4313
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:24,191
Something that's relatively shocking to hear when the whole world is stunned by the Carnage

4314
03:16:24,447 --> 03:16:25,215
Of the worst

4315
03:16:25,471 --> 03:16:26,495
War in human history

4316
03:16:28,287 --> 03:16:29,055
He told his friend this

4317
03:16:29,311 --> 03:16:29,823
Quote

4318
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:32,127
I think a curse should rest on me

4319
03:16:32,383 --> 03:16:33,919
Because I love this war

4320
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:38,271
I know it's smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment and yet

4321
03:16:38,527 --> 03:16:39,295
I can't help it

4322
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:40,831
I enjoy every second.

4323
03:16:42,367 --> 03:16:42,879
And quote

4324
03:16:44,159 --> 03:16:44,927
Imagine if

4325
03:16:45,951 --> 03:16:49,791
People whose loved ones were over there fighting and dying and heard Churchill admit that

4326
03:16:51,839 --> 03:16:54,655
And one of the things that happens when you use Churchill's account

4327
03:16:54,911 --> 03:16:57,727
Of these events that he played an important role in

4328
03:16:57,983 --> 03:17:00,543
Did you get all his excuses and you get his point of view

4329
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:01,311
And you get

4330
03:17:02,335 --> 03:17:08,479
Very one-sided account of these Affairs were Churchill is the hero he was right all along and only people would listen to him if only the

4331
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:10,527
You have screwed up his plans at all would have

4332
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:11,295
Ingrate

4333
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:15,135
Historian Peter Hart and Brittany I find B

4334
03:17:15,647 --> 03:17:16,415
Very fair

4335
03:17:16,927 --> 03:17:18,975
He had this to say he's not on the

4336
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:20,255
Churchill was right

4337
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:22,815
Wrote about the Hogle

4338
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:24,095
Quote

4339
03:17:24,863 --> 03:17:30,239
Apologists for the Gallipoli campaign have long tried to boast of what could have been

4340
03:17:30,495 --> 03:17:33,055
With a heavy emphasis on if only

4341
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:39,455
This fails to recognize that the Allies bought the campaign with levels of Naval and Military Support that will consider

4342
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:40,223
Acceptable

4343
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:42,015
Until the Turks defeated them

4344
03:17:42,527 --> 03:17:47,135
Time and time again Hamilton promise success again and again he failed

4345
03:17:47,391 --> 03:17:49,951
Gallipoli was one of a series of military

4346
03:17:50,207 --> 03:17:51,487
Easterner Adventures

4347
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:57,887
Launch without proper analysis of the global strategic situation without consideration of the local Tactical

4348
03:17:58,399 --> 03:18:02,751
Ignoring logistical realities under estimating the strength of the opposition

4349
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:07,871
And predicted are hugely optimistic assessment of the military capabilities of their own troops

4350
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:11,711
Not for nothing is hubris regarded as the English disease

4351
03:18:12,223 --> 03:18:14,527
The Gallipoli campaign was a serious matter

4352
03:18:14,783 --> 03:18:17,855
Vital resources have been drawn away from where it really matter

4353
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:20,927
The Turks were all but helpless if left on their own

4354
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:26,815
They tried to launch an ambitious attack across the Sinai desert on the Suez Canal but have been easily thwarted

4355
03:18:27,071 --> 03:18:28,607
Gallipoli achieve nothing

4356
03:18:28,863 --> 03:18:33,983
But you provide the Turks with the opportunity to slaughter British and French troops and copious numbers

4357
03:18:34,239 --> 03:18:37,311
In a situation in which everything was in The Defenders favor

4358
03:18:37,567 --> 03:18:40,383
Meanwhile back on the Western Front was the Real Enemy

4359
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:41,919
The German Empire

4360
03:18:42,943 --> 03:18:43,455
And quote

4361
03:18:44,991 --> 03:18:46,527
The ends by saying the Gallipoli

4362
03:18:46,783 --> 03:18:47,807
He was a tragic sideshow

4363
03:18:48,575 --> 03:18:50,879
And blaming Churchill in large part

4364
03:18:51,135 --> 03:18:51,647
The disaster

4365
03:18:54,463 --> 03:18:55,999
All the tragic sideshow

4366
03:18:56,255 --> 03:18:57,279
What's going on

4367
03:18:57,791 --> 03:18:59,839
Another horrible disaster was as well

4368
03:19:00,095 --> 03:19:00,863
This is a console

4369
03:19:01,375 --> 03:19:03,167
After all full of horrible disasters

4370
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:05,215
But this one was somewhat different

4371
03:19:05,727 --> 03:19:07,775
From soldiers fighting it out on bottle

4372
03:19:08,799 --> 03:19:09,567
This one involved

4373
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:11,103
Entire

4374
03:19:12,383 --> 03:19:12,895
Several

4375
03:19:13,151 --> 03:19:13,663
Entire

4376
03:19:14,431 --> 03:19:14,943
In fact

4377
03:19:16,479 --> 03:19:16,991
And it is

4378
03:19:17,503 --> 03:19:18,783
Perhaps the most

4379
03:19:19,295 --> 03:19:20,575
Argued about

4380
03:19:21,599 --> 03:19:23,135
Case of genocide

4381
03:19:23,903 --> 03:19:24,671
In world history

4382
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:27,487
In order to understand the

4383
03:19:29,279 --> 03:19:31,327
Need to recall how much of a role

4384
03:19:31,583 --> 03:19:34,399
Did of ethnic self-determination

4385
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:36,447
In leading up to

4386
03:19:36,703 --> 03:19:38,751
Did the conditions that create the first World War

4387
03:19:39,263 --> 03:19:40,287
End of the first World War

4388
03:19:40,543 --> 03:19:41,055
Shelf

4389
03:19:41,823 --> 03:19:43,359
Remember there are a bunch of

4390
03:19:43,615 --> 03:19:44,895
Centuries-old

4391
03:19:45,663 --> 03:19:47,455
Free 20th century Empire

4392
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:50,015
Let's go to stumble into the 20th century

4393
03:19:50,527 --> 03:19:54,111
Carrying all sorts of baggage from previous eras with

4394
03:19:54,623 --> 03:19:56,159
Baggage that is in part

4395
03:19:56,415 --> 03:19:57,183
Tearing them up

4396
03:19:57,951 --> 03:19:59,231
And a lot of this baggage

4397
03:19:59,487 --> 03:19:59,999
Just ethnic

4398
03:20:00,767 --> 03:20:01,535
Take the

4399
03:20:01,791 --> 03:20:02,559
Austro-hungarian

4400
03:20:02,815 --> 03:20:03,327
Pirate a perfect

4401
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:05,631
Example of a multi-ethnic Empire

4402
03:20:05,887 --> 03:20:08,191
With a ton of different ethnicities in it

4403
03:20:08,703 --> 03:20:12,287
Are presided over by a German Hungarian Elite

4404
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:14,847
On paper all these people are

4405
03:20:15,103 --> 03:20:16,895
Equal austro-hungarian subject

4406
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:21,503
But if you happen to not be German or Hungarian off and you don't feel very equal

4407
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:24,575
And during this time. Many different ethnic groups

4408
03:20:25,087 --> 03:20:27,135
Are either looking to create their own

4409
03:20:27,391 --> 03:20:27,903
States

4410
03:20:28,415 --> 03:20:28,927
For themselves

4411
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:30,207
Or they're looking to

4412
03:20:30,463 --> 03:20:30,975
Join

4413
03:20:31,231 --> 03:20:33,791
With ethnic Brethren of there that have already done this

4414
03:20:35,327 --> 03:20:37,631
When the first World War II Fletcher College

4415
03:20:37,887 --> 03:20:39,423
Touched off by a Serb National

4416
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:41,215
Someone the Slavs

4417
03:20:41,471 --> 03:20:42,239
You probably look at it

4418
03:20:42,495 --> 03:20:43,007
Patriot

4419
03:20:43,775 --> 03:20:46,079
But the austro-hungarians looked at him as a terrorist

4420
03:20:46,847 --> 03:20:49,663
And looked at any of their own people that wanted to join

4421
03:20:49,919 --> 03:20:52,223
With Serbia a not that old

4422
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:54,271
What country created by the ethnic serbs

4423
03:20:54,783 --> 03:20:58,111
Anyone want to do that it was an austro-hungarian subject was now treason

4424
03:20:58,879 --> 03:20:59,903
An insurrection

4425
03:21:00,159 --> 03:21:00,671
And a rebel

4426
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:02,975
If you're actually in a war with that country

4427
03:21:03,231 --> 03:21:04,511
Your fifth columnist

4428
03:21:05,023 --> 03:21:05,791
Or 8

4429
03:21:06,047 --> 03:21:06,559
Cancer

4430
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:07,327
On your knees

4431
03:21:09,119 --> 03:21:09,631
And there's

4432
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:11,935
No question that there are a bunch

4433
03:21:12,447 --> 03:21:16,799
Of Empires that are dealing with these problems in their a bunch that are sort of put those problems off

4434
03:21:17,055 --> 03:21:18,335
Even the winners in the first

4435
03:21:18,591 --> 03:21:22,687
World War II Britain and France were only going to push these questions farther down the road

4436
03:21:23,199 --> 03:21:27,551
And after the next World War the British will be dealing with similar situations in India

4437
03:21:27,807 --> 03:21:30,879
And the French will be dealing with it in North Africa and Indochina

4438
03:21:31,135 --> 03:21:32,415
The austro-hungarians

4439
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:35,231
And the Russians and the Ottoman Empire deal with it now

4440
03:21:35,999 --> 03:21:37,535
And it creates huge problems

4441
03:21:38,047 --> 03:21:43,167
And it does so in a realm that is historically extremely violence inducing

4442
03:21:44,191 --> 03:21:44,959
Tanacon

4443
03:21:45,727 --> 03:21:47,263
Annie's old Empires were

4444
03:21:47,519 --> 03:21:49,311
Poor people have very long memories

4445
03:21:49,823 --> 03:21:51,359
And everybody has

4446
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:56,223
Atrocities that the other side is committed over the centuries that they can point to as

4447
03:21:56,735 --> 03:21:59,295
A justification for what they are going to do now

4448
03:22:01,087 --> 03:22:01,599
Modern

4449
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:03,135
For example

4450
03:22:03,391 --> 03:22:06,207
All the situation in the Middle East right now and how

4451
03:22:06,463 --> 03:22:08,767
To sit down with anyone who's involved in a

4452
03:22:09,023 --> 03:22:10,559
Close at hand with those conflicts

4453
03:22:11,071 --> 03:22:13,119
The first thing you find out if everyone has

4454
03:22:13,375 --> 03:22:14,911
A ton of bad things that they can

4455
03:22:15,167 --> 03:22:16,447
Pinpoint to the other side did

4456
03:22:16,703 --> 03:22:21,055
And after a while your head just spins because you don't even know where to start everyone's got such long memories

4457
03:22:21,311 --> 03:22:25,151
And there were so many bad things that have happened that they point to the other side is

4458
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:26,687
Being responsible for

4459
03:22:27,455 --> 03:22:29,503
That you just don't even know how to solve

4460
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:31,551
Back problem and untied gordian knot

4461
03:22:32,063 --> 03:22:32,831
But that's not

4462
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:34,367
Compared to the ethnic

4463
03:22:34,623 --> 03:22:35,391
Memories

4464
03:22:35,647 --> 03:22:36,415
People in Europe

4465
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:37,695
And anyone who remembers that

4466
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:41,535
Breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the middle 1990s

4467
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:42,815
Remember

4468
03:22:43,583 --> 03:22:45,375
That's a perfect example of how deep

4469
03:22:45,631 --> 03:22:46,911
Desatnick tensions go

4470
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:48,959
You know we were all under the impression

4471
03:22:49,215 --> 03:22:51,007
That whole ethnic

4472
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:53,567
Animosity between groups in those

4473
03:22:53,823 --> 03:22:57,919
Areas had been tamed and that those fires have been completely put out

4474
03:22:58,687 --> 03:22:59,711
Little did we know that

4475
03:23:00,223 --> 03:23:01,247
Heat under the ashes

4476
03:23:01,759 --> 03:23:05,087
Smoldering the whole time that all it took was a little gasoline poured on them

4477
03:23:05,343 --> 03:23:06,623
In a smoldering Heat

4478
03:23:06,879 --> 03:23:07,903
Flare up

4479
03:23:08,159 --> 03:23:11,999
And horrible things to be done and then when you went and questioned anyone

4480
03:23:12,255 --> 03:23:13,279
For example a Serb

4481
03:23:13,535 --> 03:23:16,095
Or acrylic or a Bosnian Muslim about it

4482
03:23:16,351 --> 03:23:21,727
They would point to the other side and talk about hundreds of years of awful things that they had done to them

4483
03:23:22,239 --> 03:23:23,519
You don't even know where to begin with

4484
03:23:26,079 --> 03:23:27,359
The worst situation of this

4485
03:23:28,383 --> 03:23:31,967
Happens in the first world war although it happens in a lot of places

4486
03:23:32,479 --> 03:23:34,271
I forget during the 1915 retreat

4487
03:23:34,527 --> 03:23:38,111
The Russians did a lot of terrible things to poles and Jews when these things get

4488
03:23:38,367 --> 03:23:39,135
Pale dog

4489
03:23:39,391 --> 03:23:41,951
In history book by comparison with what happened to the

4490
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:43,743
Christian minorities in the Ottoman Empire

4491
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:46,815
For example

4492
03:23:47,327 --> 03:23:47,839
The Greeks

4493
03:23:48,607 --> 03:23:50,143
Corbin inhabiting the

4494
03:23:50,399 --> 03:23:51,167
The Anatolian

4495
03:23:51,423 --> 03:23:52,703
Plain of Asia Minor

4496
03:23:52,959 --> 03:23:53,983
Since the Bronze Age

4497
03:23:55,007 --> 03:23:56,287
Or the Assyrian p

4498
03:23:56,799 --> 03:23:58,335
All the Christian Assyrian minority

4499
03:23:58,847 --> 03:23:59,871
In what's now

4500
03:24:00,127 --> 03:24:01,151
Kind of Northern Iraq

4501
03:24:01,919 --> 03:24:02,431
And who

4502
03:24:02,687 --> 03:24:05,247
Claim to be the descendants of the ancient

4503
03:24:05,503 --> 03:24:06,783
That's true

4504
03:24:07,039 --> 03:24:08,575
That's a weird horrible

4505
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:11,903
Karmic wheel genocide coming around to hit them because

4506
03:24:12,415 --> 03:24:13,183
After all.

4507
03:24:13,439 --> 03:24:14,975
Biblical Assyrians are one of the

4508
03:24:15,487 --> 03:24:17,279
Very early confirmable

4509
03:24:17,791 --> 03:24:18,303
You know

4510
03:24:18,559 --> 03:24:21,631
Instigators of ethnic cleansing and genocide you can find

4511
03:24:22,399 --> 03:24:22,911
And of course

4512
03:24:23,679 --> 03:24:25,215
The most famous of all

4513
03:24:25,727 --> 03:24:26,239
The Armenia

4514
03:24:27,519 --> 03:24:29,055
The Armenians are in

4515
03:24:29,311 --> 03:24:29,823
Ancient

4516
03:24:30,847 --> 03:24:32,383
Who inhabit an area

4517
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:36,991
During the first world war is kind of around where the borders of Russia

4518
03:24:37,247 --> 03:24:39,039
And the Ottoman Empire come together

4519
03:24:39,295 --> 03:24:39,807
To hiss

4520
03:24:40,063 --> 03:24:40,831
Historic arch enemy

4521
03:24:42,367 --> 03:24:43,647
The Armenians are caught in the middle

4522
03:24:44,415 --> 03:24:45,183
And they always have been

4523
03:24:46,463 --> 03:24:49,791
Certain periods in history they've been able to form their own independent state

4524
03:24:50,047 --> 03:24:54,655
For example when Rome and Persia were little week they could do that and then as soon as Roman Persian

4525
03:24:55,167 --> 03:24:57,983
The ancient world got their act together from this while in a brownie

4526
03:24:58,495 --> 03:25:00,799
Armenia was the first official Christian state

4527
03:25:01,055 --> 03:25:04,127
Which did not particularly make the Ottomans enthusiastic

4528
03:25:05,663 --> 03:25:07,199
It's kind of part of the reasons

4529
03:25:07,455 --> 03:25:08,223
With the Armenians

4530
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:11,295
In the Ottoman Empire had always been treated as second

4531
03:25:11,551 --> 03:25:12,063
Citizen

4532
03:25:12,575 --> 03:25:14,623
And they remind one

4533
03:25:14,879 --> 03:25:17,183
Of the Jews in Russia where

4534
03:25:17,439 --> 03:25:18,463
Periodically youku

4535
03:25:18,719 --> 03:25:19,231
Have these

4536
03:25:19,743 --> 03:25:20,511
Pogrom

4537
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:23,839
Incidence of violence break out

4538
03:25:24,863 --> 03:25:27,935
Calling men women and children would just be slaughtered I mean there were

4539
03:25:28,191 --> 03:25:29,471
1895 1896

4540
03:25:29,727 --> 03:25:30,495
The sultan Ahmed

4541
03:25:31,007 --> 03:25:33,823
Did awful things in from 50,000 to 3

4542
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:35,359
Hundred thousand Armenians

4543
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:41,247
Died in just that one in there was another one a couple years later another one a couple years after that 1909 there was another one

4544
03:25:41,759 --> 03:25:42,783
And the Armenians

4545
03:25:43,039 --> 03:25:46,367
Between a rock and a hard place because part of them live in what

4546
03:25:46,623 --> 03:25:47,647
The Ottoman Empire

4547
03:25:47,903 --> 03:25:51,231
A part of their territory and ethnic group extends up into Southern Russia

4548
03:25:51,743 --> 03:25:54,559
An area by the way that Russia had been taking over over

4549
03:25:54,815 --> 03:25:55,327
For the past Century

4550
03:25:55,839 --> 03:25:57,887
So it's sort of a Battle Ground area

4551
03:25:58,399 --> 03:26:03,007
And you take this people that the ottoman Turks and never been that enthusiastic about anyway

4552
03:26:03,775 --> 03:26:09,919
And then you start this war remember the Russians in the church start fighting in late 1914 early 1950 and the Turks get

4553
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:10,687
Defeated by the

4554
03:26:10,943 --> 03:26:14,271
They have that Napoleonic retreat with the Wolves reading all the Frozen people

4555
03:26:15,039 --> 03:26:16,575
And a lot of that army

4556
03:26:17,087 --> 03:26:18,367
Defeat the Turks in that battle

4557
03:26:19,135 --> 03:26:20,159
Who composed of Armenia

4558
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:22,207
Armenians

4559
03:26:22,463 --> 03:26:23,487
From the Russian song

4560
03:26:23,999 --> 03:26:24,511
Date of the Border

4561
03:26:26,303 --> 03:26:27,583
A bunch of the Ottoman troops

4562
03:26:27,839 --> 03:26:28,863
In the defeated Army

4563
03:26:29,119 --> 03:26:30,655
We're also Armenians

4564
03:26:31,167 --> 03:26:32,703
And to make matters even more complicated

4565
03:26:32,959 --> 03:26:34,495
There were some Armenian Rebels

4566
03:26:34,751 --> 03:26:37,311
We're trying to create some sort of a state of Their Own

4567
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:43,711
And who can blame them for wanting the wrong state after so much persecution for so long

4568
03:26:43,967 --> 03:26:46,015
But the way the Ottoman Empire Beauty

4569
03:26:46,271 --> 03:26:46,783
People

4570
03:26:47,295 --> 03:26:49,343
You know what the best of times was unreliable

4571
03:26:50,367 --> 03:26:56,511
Once the Russians win the important battle in late 1914 or early 1950s and the Turks feel their back up against the wall

4572
03:26:57,023 --> 03:27:01,887
Now they begin to worry that the Armenians on their side of the Border are positively dangerous

4573
03:27:03,167 --> 03:27:04,703
You know the ones who are loyal

4574
03:27:04,959 --> 03:27:09,055
Are potentially vulnerable to subversion or propaganda

4575
03:27:09,567 --> 03:27:11,615
Or maybe even having to do Guerrilla groups

4576
03:27:12,895 --> 03:27:16,479
You coerced them into cooperation through agile practices

4577
03:27:16,991 --> 03:27:19,039
Like killing collaborators as it's called

4578
03:27:19,807 --> 03:27:24,671
That's the best-case scenario worst case scenario you Armenian subjects are just loyal to the Core

4579
03:27:24,927 --> 03:27:28,511
And are hoping waiting and actively working behind the scenes

4580
03:27:29,023 --> 03:27:30,047
To help the Russians

4581
03:27:31,839 --> 03:27:34,399
To the Turkish government this is treason

4582
03:27:35,423 --> 03:27:35,935
They are

4583
03:27:36,191 --> 03:27:40,799
Feeling like you're either about to be or are being stabbed in the back and their government

4584
03:27:41,055 --> 03:27:44,383
As we said never all that enthused about Armenians anyway

4585
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:48,479
Decide that a solution has to be found in their solution is to get rid of the Armenia

4586
03:27:50,015 --> 03:27:51,807
If you believe the official Turkish line

4587
03:27:52,063 --> 03:27:53,855
Getting rid of the Armenians Medrol okay

4588
03:27:55,135 --> 03:27:55,903
If you believe what

4589
03:27:56,159 --> 03:27:59,487
Majority of historians obviously Armenians believe

4590
03:27:59,743 --> 03:28:01,023
Getting rid of the men killing

4591
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:04,863
The process when it began with systemic

4592
03:28:05,119 --> 03:28:05,631
One Village

4593
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:06,399
After another

4594
03:28:06,911 --> 03:28:08,191
It was done with a certain amount of

4595
03:28:08,703 --> 03:28:09,983
Understanding

4596
03:28:10,239 --> 03:28:12,031
That it would be bad publicity

4597
03:28:12,287 --> 03:28:12,799
The

4598
03:28:13,055 --> 03:28:14,335
Christian Towers

4599
03:28:14,591 --> 03:28:16,895
Russia mainly but also Britain and France

4600
03:28:17,151 --> 03:28:18,687
Had often times used

4601
03:28:18,943 --> 03:28:23,039
Persecution against the Armenians and other Christian groups as an excuse to

4602
03:28:23,295 --> 03:28:27,647
Intervene in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire that's the way the Ottoman Empire was it got it

4603
03:28:27,903 --> 03:28:33,023
So then there was all the reason in the world not to publicize that you were doing this and not make a big deal out of

4604
03:28:34,047 --> 03:28:36,351
Official line of the Turkish government is the during

4605
03:28:36,607 --> 03:28:40,959
These efforts to move the Armenian people away from the trouble spot

4606
03:28:41,215 --> 03:28:43,263
It won't be a problem if you moving to say Syria

4607
03:28:43,775 --> 03:28:44,287
A lot on.

4608
03:28:45,311 --> 03:28:46,335
Through starvation

4609
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:47,359
Do disease

4610
03:28:47,615 --> 03:28:53,759
Through hostile ethnic groups that never like the like the Kurds decided to take advantage and swoop in and killed a man in right there

4611
03:28:54,015 --> 03:28:55,295
Women in all the horrible things

4612
03:28:56,575 --> 03:28:57,855
But there's so much ever

4613
03:28:58,879 --> 03:29:00,159
That this was done

4614
03:29:01,183 --> 03:29:04,511
In the same sort of fashion that any one of us would recognize

4615
03:29:04,767 --> 03:29:05,791
Genocide being iffy

4616
03:29:06,047 --> 03:29:11,167
It was the Holocaust or Rwanda or it really reminds one of the former Yugoslavia a lot

4617
03:29:12,447 --> 03:29:13,727
And the trucks are very sensitive

4618
03:29:15,007 --> 03:29:17,567
Any Armenians are very angry that they won't admit it

4619
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:19,871
You know this is where I get a little upset with this whole

4620
03:29:21,663 --> 03:29:23,967
The idea of genocide as an official

4621
03:29:24,223 --> 03:29:25,247
International crime

4622
03:29:26,015 --> 03:29:27,551
Only a rose in the

4623
03:29:27,807 --> 03:29:28,831
Middle 1940

4624
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:31,391
And since that time

4625
03:29:31,647 --> 03:29:33,439
That word has become a legal High

4626
03:29:34,975 --> 03:29:37,535
Where it would if someone were actually

4627
03:29:38,047 --> 03:29:39,327
Convicted of genocide

4628
03:29:39,583 --> 03:29:42,655
I trigger all sorts of real-world ramifications

4629
03:29:42,911 --> 03:29:47,007
And so everybody does everything they can for the most part unless it's a pariah state

4630
03:29:47,263 --> 03:29:49,311
To find anything except genocide

4631
03:29:49,823 --> 03:29:50,335
Welts

4632
03:29:50,847 --> 03:29:52,383
Hundreds of thousands of people died

4633
03:29:52,895 --> 03:29:56,223
But it's merely a crime against humanity cuz there was no intent mean

4634
03:29:56,735 --> 03:29:59,551
Become a legalistic word where all these different things have to be mad at the

4635
03:29:59,807 --> 03:30:01,087
Big deal with disabled

4636
03:30:02,111 --> 03:30:03,135
Countries can find

4637
03:30:03,391 --> 03:30:04,159
Themselves

4638
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:05,695
You dealing with sanction

4639
03:30:05,951 --> 03:30:09,535
Calls for reparations or issues with alliances or train deals

4640
03:30:10,303 --> 03:30:12,095
And turkey didn't want that nobody want

4641
03:30:12,351 --> 03:30:14,143
Even in countries

4642
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:15,167
Did acknowledge

4643
03:30:15,423 --> 03:30:17,471
Their genocidal practices at one time

4644
03:30:17,983 --> 03:30:23,871
They were a group that have Arisen in the more trying to get that overturned in Japan there are right-wing nationalist now we're trying to now

4645
03:30:24,383 --> 03:30:25,663
Cover up and down play

4646
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:29,759
Japanese genocide activities against China during the second World War

4647
03:30:30,015 --> 03:30:31,551
The most normal thing in the world

4648
03:30:32,063 --> 03:30:33,087
But we've all done it

4649
03:30:34,111 --> 03:30:35,647
That's why it's hard for me to understand

4650
03:30:35,903 --> 03:30:36,671
The Turkish

4651
03:30:36,927 --> 03:30:39,231
Attitude the decisive blow to their pride somehow

4652
03:30:39,487 --> 03:30:41,791
If they hadn't committed the genocide they be

4653
03:30:42,559 --> 03:30:46,143
Like one of the only people on the planet of any consequence it hadn't

4654
03:30:47,935 --> 03:30:50,495
Part of the shared Human Experience a sad is that sound

4655
03:30:51,007 --> 03:30:52,799
Go look at the Old Testament of the Bible

4656
03:30:53,567 --> 03:30:54,591
A book that Jews

4657
03:30:54,847 --> 03:30:57,407
Christians and Muslims all hold sacred

4658
03:30:58,431 --> 03:31:00,223
The god of the Old Testament orders

4659
03:31:00,479 --> 03:31:01,503
Genocide

4660
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:03,039
After genocide

4661
03:31:03,295 --> 03:31:04,319
After genocide

4662
03:31:04,575 --> 03:31:05,087
Chill

4663
03:31:05,343 --> 03:31:05,855
Everyone

4664
03:31:06,623 --> 03:31:07,391
Put the man

4665
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:10,719
Women children and all the animals to the sword

4666
03:31:12,255 --> 03:31:13,791
The reason it's in the Old Testament

4667
03:31:14,047 --> 03:31:15,327
Is because that was such

4668
03:31:15,583 --> 03:31:18,911
Common behavior that those people at the time would have understood it

4669
03:31:20,703 --> 03:31:25,567
I've often said about slavery that we all have slave blood running through our ancestral veins

4670
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:26,591
Somewhere

4671
03:31:27,103 --> 03:31:28,127
Same is true for

4672
03:31:28,383 --> 03:31:28,895
Genocide

4673
03:31:29,407 --> 03:31:30,175
We've all

4674
03:31:30,431 --> 03:31:31,455
Had ancestors

4675
03:31:31,711 --> 03:31:33,759
Who were the victims of genocidal attacks

4676
03:31:34,271 --> 03:31:37,599
And we've all had ancestors somewhere down the family tree

4677
03:31:38,111 --> 03:31:39,135
Who are the ones committing the

4678
03:31:40,671 --> 03:31:42,207
In their book why not kill them

4679
03:31:42,463 --> 03:31:42,975
Mall

4680
03:31:43,231 --> 03:31:45,791
Professor Daniel Sherrod and Clark McCauley right

4681
03:31:46,559 --> 03:31:48,607
The one of the downsides of this whole thing

4682
03:31:49,119 --> 03:31:50,399
Is that we act as though

4683
03:31:50,655 --> 03:31:51,935
That bad man

4684
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:56,543
Or that bad people committed this unusual act when in reality as they say

4685
03:31:57,055 --> 03:31:57,567
Quote

4686
03:31:57,823 --> 03:31:59,359
Given the right circumstances

4687
03:31:59,615 --> 03:32:01,919
Normal human beings are all too ready to

4688
03:32:02,175 --> 03:32:02,943
He killed my cat

4689
03:32:03,967 --> 03:32:04,479
And quote

4690
03:32:06,015 --> 03:32:08,063
He will often hear the Turks in their own defense

4691
03:32:08,575 --> 03:32:09,343
When accused of

4692
03:32:09,855 --> 03:32:11,647
The Armenian Genocide saywell

4693
03:32:11,903 --> 03:32:12,927
Look at what was happening

4694
03:32:13,183 --> 03:32:13,951
To Muslims

4695
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:15,231
And Turkish Folk

4696
03:32:15,487 --> 03:32:16,767
Who were in the Balkans

4697
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:19,327
And we're being treated by those

4698
03:32:19,583 --> 03:32:21,887
Countries that had thrown off the Turkish yoke

4699
03:32:22,143 --> 03:32:25,471
Enough to rape and murder and all these horrible things and displacement

4700
03:32:25,727 --> 03:32:27,007
All that is totally true

4701
03:32:28,031 --> 03:32:30,079
But it doesn't alleviate Turkish Guild

4702
03:32:30,335 --> 03:32:33,919
Open the Armenian situation it just adds more people to the court docket

4703
03:32:34,943 --> 03:32:36,223
What happened to the Armenians

4704
03:32:36,991 --> 03:32:39,039
And other Christians in the Ottoman Empire during the

4705
03:32:39,295 --> 03:32:40,319
Time including Greeks

4706
03:32:40,831 --> 03:32:41,343
And Assyrians

4707
03:32:42,111 --> 03:32:42,623
WhatsApp

4708
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:47,487
Between 500000 and 1.5 million

4709
03:32:47,743 --> 03:32:48,255
In Armenian

4710
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:49,791
Women

4711
03:32:50,047 --> 03:32:50,559
Children

4712
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:52,607
Men old people

4713
03:32:52,863 --> 03:32:53,631
Lots of rape

4714
03:32:53,887 --> 03:32:54,911
Horrible stories

4715
03:32:55,167 --> 03:32:57,983
Sounds like the einsatzgruppen under the Nazis

4716
03:32:58,239 --> 03:32:59,263
Sounds like Rwanda

4717
03:32:59,519 --> 03:33:02,079
Sounds like indonesi sounds most like

4718
03:33:02,591 --> 03:33:05,663
The former Yugoslavia in the 1990s on steroids

4719
03:33:07,199 --> 03:33:10,015
But I don't blame the Turks anymore than I blame the rest

4720
03:33:10,271 --> 03:33:11,807
Sport that human behavior

4721
03:33:13,087 --> 03:33:14,111
And what's interesting is

4722
03:33:14,367 --> 03:33:19,231
The Armenian Genocide actually overshadows something similar to it involving

4723
03:33:19,487 --> 03:33:23,583
The Russians retreating in 1915 from a German offensive in Poland

4724
03:33:23,839 --> 03:33:27,935
And at gunpoint taking hundreds of thousands of poles and Jews out

4725
03:33:28,191 --> 03:33:29,727
And a lot of those people never return

4726
03:33:29,983 --> 03:33:36,127
They were seen in the same way that the Armenians were seen by the Turks is unreliable disloyal elements likely to see

4727
03:33:36,383 --> 03:33:37,151
Side with the Germans

4728
03:33:38,431 --> 03:33:41,759
And interstingly enough in a wonderful sort of karmic way

4729
03:33:42,527 --> 03:33:45,855
A lot of the reports that are considered to be the most reliable

4730
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:47,647
About what the Armenians were going

4731
03:33:47,903 --> 03:33:48,415
True

4732
03:33:48,671 --> 03:33:49,439
Come from the

4733
03:33:49,695 --> 03:33:50,463
Turks allies

4734
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:51,743
The Germans

4735
03:33:53,535 --> 03:33:55,071
German advisors in military

4736
03:33:56,351 --> 03:33:56,863
An embosser

4737
03:33:57,375 --> 03:33:58,655
For telling their own government

4738
03:33:58,911 --> 03:33:59,679
The terrible things that are

4739
03:33:59,935 --> 03:34:00,447
Happening

4740
03:34:00,703 --> 03:34:01,983
To the Armenians

4741
03:34:02,239 --> 03:34:02,751
In that country

4742
03:34:03,519 --> 03:34:05,055
And then within a generation

4743
03:34:05,567 --> 03:34:06,079
Those story

4744
03:34:07,103 --> 03:34:07,615
Germany

4745
03:34:09,919 --> 03:34:10,431
That's how

4746
03:34:10,687 --> 03:34:11,199
Endemic

4747
03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:13,247
Whole idea

4748
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:14,271
Chilling

4749
03:34:14,527 --> 03:34:16,063
Your enemies down to the last

4750
03:34:16,575 --> 03:34:17,087
Qunar

4751
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:19,903
Terrible as this is

4752
03:34:20,927 --> 03:34:21,951
That's the way we are

4753
03:34:22,207 --> 03:34:22,719
Human being

4754
03:34:25,023 --> 03:34:25,791
And killing

4755
03:34:26,559 --> 03:34:28,863
Your enemies down to the last person

4756
03:34:29,631 --> 03:34:30,399
Is not just

4757
03:34:30,655 --> 03:34:33,471
Beginning to look like the equation in these horrible

4758
03:34:33,983 --> 03:34:34,495
Criminal

4759
03:34:34,751 --> 03:34:35,519
Genocides

4760
03:34:36,287 --> 03:34:38,079
Starting to look like the equation

4761
03:34:38,847 --> 03:34:40,127
In that algebra

4762
03:34:40,383 --> 03:34:41,151
Problem

4763
03:34:41,407 --> 03:34:43,199
If you're one of the military commanders in this convo

4764
03:34:43,455 --> 03:34:44,479
How you win the war

4765
03:34:46,015 --> 03:34:48,575
Not killing every man woman and child just killing

4766
03:34:48,831 --> 03:34:49,599
Every Soldier

4767
03:34:49,855 --> 03:34:50,623
You're on the other side

4768
03:34:52,415 --> 03:34:53,183
You know after

4769
03:34:53,695 --> 03:34:55,999
Another horrible battle on the Western Front

4770
03:34:56,255 --> 03:34:57,535
1915 when the Allies lose

4771
03:34:57,791 --> 03:35:00,863
Town of people to gain literally not an inch of territory

4772
03:35:02,143 --> 03:35:05,215
The French General Patton becomes one of the first Allied Commander to openly say

4773
03:35:05,983 --> 03:35:08,287
If this war is not going to be one by some miraculous

4774
03:35:08,543 --> 03:35:09,055
Breakthrough

4775
03:35:09,567 --> 03:35:11,359
Or some tactical or strategic

4776
03:35:11,615 --> 03:35:13,407
Bit of Brilliance that opens up

4777
03:35:13,663 --> 03:35:15,711
You know flying for a breakthrough

4778
03:35:15,967 --> 03:35:18,527
Going to be one by killing more of the enemy

4779
03:35:19,039 --> 03:35:19,807
Then we lose ourselves

4780
03:35:21,087 --> 03:35:22,623
The war's turning into a war

4781
03:35:22,879 --> 03:35:23,391
Attrition

4782
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:26,719
And while that might sound like an ultimate Allied victory

4783
03:35:27,743 --> 03:35:29,023
Because if everybody kills

4784
03:35:29,279 --> 03:35:34,399
You know one person on the other side until there's no one left the Allies have a lot more people than the central

4785
03:35:35,423 --> 03:35:36,191
The problem with that

4786
03:35:36,447 --> 03:35:37,471
Little bit of mathematics

4787
03:35:37,983 --> 03:35:38,751
Set the Central Powers

4788
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:39,775
Are killing

4789
03:35:40,031 --> 03:35:42,591
More Allied troops in a losing themselves

4790
03:35:43,359 --> 03:35:44,383
And will do so ever

4791
03:35:44,895 --> 03:35:45,663
Single month

4792
03:35:45,919 --> 03:35:47,455
Until almost the end of the war

4793
03:35:48,223 --> 03:35:50,271
So that mathematical equation is as yet

4794
03:35:50,783 --> 03:35:51,551
Unsolved

4795
03:35:52,063 --> 03:35:52,575
And I'm predict

4796
03:35:54,111 --> 03:35:54,623
But of course

4797
03:35:55,647 --> 03:35:56,415
Modern Nations

4798
03:35:57,439 --> 03:35:57,951
Pac-Man

4799
03:35:58,463 --> 03:35:59,231
At some point

4800
03:35:59,487 --> 03:36:00,255
They cry on

4801
03:36:01,279 --> 03:36:06,911
Which in this conflict has been ruled out by the Allies signing those treaty saying no one will make A Separate Peace

4802
03:36:07,423 --> 03:36:08,447
Which means they'll fight

4803
03:36:08,703 --> 03:36:09,215
Until

4804
03:36:09,727 --> 03:36:11,007
The political system

4805
03:36:11,519 --> 03:36:12,543
Were the armies

4806
03:36:12,799 --> 03:36:13,311
Or

4807
03:36:13,567 --> 03:36:16,383
The will of the soldiers to resist collapsing

4808
03:36:17,663 --> 03:36:18,687
By the end of 19

4809
03:36:18,943 --> 03:36:19,455
15

4810
03:36:19,967 --> 03:36:26,111
There's a couple of countries that look in real danger having that happen and even the countries that look quite a bit safer than off

4811
03:36:26,367 --> 03:36:27,135
Austria-Hungary

4812
03:36:27,391 --> 03:36:28,415
Oar Russia look

4813
03:36:28,927 --> 03:36:30,207
Even they are showing

4814
03:36:30,975 --> 03:36:31,487
Democrat

4815
03:36:31,743 --> 03:36:32,511
Vulnerability

4816
03:36:32,767 --> 03:36:33,791
Please can this war

4817
03:36:34,047 --> 03:36:35,327
Really go on

4818
03:36:35,583 --> 03:36:36,607
For another year

4819
03:36:37,887 --> 03:36:38,911
Pokemon longer than that

4820
03:36:40,191 --> 03:36:41,215
But not everyone's going to make

4821
03:36:50,943 --> 03:36:52,735
Don't forget you can now buy the classic

Composer

4838
03:37:22,175 --> 03:37:22,943
Emotes artist

4839
03:37:23,199 --> 03:37:26,271
Supposed to answer when someone said how do you come up with your composition

4840
03:37:27,039 --> 03:37:27,807
Indy start with

4841
03:37:28,063 --> 03:37:29,855
The piano and then build off the battery start

4842
03:37:30,111 --> 03:37:31,391
Destruction and fill in the middle or

4843
03:37:31,647 --> 03:37:32,671
And he's supposed to say

4844
03:37:32,927 --> 03:37:33,951
But it comes to him

4845
03:37:34,463 --> 03:37:34,975
Like

4846
03:37:36,511 --> 03:37:37,023
The same time

4847
03:37:37,791 --> 03:37:38,303
All together

4848
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:42,399
And that phrase keeps popping into my head because that's the biggest challenge

4849
03:37:42,911 --> 03:37:44,959
In telling this first world war story

4850
03:37:45,215 --> 03:37:47,775
The second biggest challenges the ungodly amount

4851
03:37:48,031 --> 03:37:48,543
Material

4852
03:37:49,055 --> 03:37:50,847
It is produced from many different

4853
03:37:51,103 --> 03:37:52,127
Countries in viewpoints

4854
03:37:52,639 --> 03:37:56,735
About the story I've never been so overwhelmed with material as I have been for this

4855
03:37:56,991 --> 03:38:00,575
And it's all controversial so you really need to read a bunch of different

4856
03:38:01,087 --> 03:38:02,879
In authors and viewpoints tutu

4857
03:38:03,135 --> 03:38:04,159
Get a sort of a nice

4858
03:38:04,927 --> 03:38:06,719
Broadview some of these

4859
03:38:07,487 --> 03:38:10,815
But the stories can't even be compartmentalize because they affect each other

4860
03:38:11,583 --> 03:38:17,727
What's going on in the Eastern front affects outcomes on the Western Front which affect outcomes in the Mediterranean theater and

4861
03:38:17,983 --> 03:38:19,775
So you can't even tell the stories

4862
03:38:21,055 --> 03:38:22,335
Separately they all have to

4863
03:38:22,591 --> 03:38:26,175
The kind of weave together and it's really easy with this much going on

4864
03:38:26,431 --> 03:38:27,967
To lose track of the story

4865
03:38:28,991 --> 03:38:31,039
So I thought we would have a rare

4866
03:38:31,551 --> 03:38:32,319
Little Rico

4867
03:38:32,831 --> 03:38:37,439
As to where we are right now so the broad Trends to get us up to speed

4868
03:38:37,695 --> 03:38:38,719
And a few thoughts

4869
03:38:38,975 --> 03:38:40,767
From the last show that I'd like to do

4870
03:38:41,023 --> 03:38:42,047
Just throw in a little extra

4871
03:38:42,303 --> 03:38:44,351
Love here at the end no extra charge

4872
03:38:44,863 --> 03:38:47,167
Just bring us up to speed make sure I cover

4873
03:38:47,679 --> 03:38:49,215
I have a list of things I want to make sure I

4874
03:38:51,519 --> 03:38:53,567
I hate to get through this whole show Tayo I left

4875
03:38:53,823 --> 03:38:54,335
That out

4876
03:38:55,871 --> 03:38:57,151
A quick recap

4877
03:38:57,663 --> 03:38:58,943
Can be done relatively soon

4878
03:38:59,711 --> 03:39:00,735
The war breaks out

4879
03:39:00,991 --> 03:39:01,759
In August 9th

4880
03:39:02,015 --> 03:39:02,527
1914

4881
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:09,183
A bunch of these countries have been ready for predicting yet they mobilize quickly it's all on a time scale and everybody

4882
03:39:09,695 --> 03:39:11,487
Launches their pre-war battle plan

4883
03:39:11,743 --> 03:39:14,559
Switch for the Germans is most famously called the Schlieffen

4884
03:39:15,583 --> 03:39:17,887
Advance through Belgium in a wide Arc

4885
03:39:18,399 --> 03:39:20,703
Smashed the French armies on the head while you're

4886
03:39:21,215 --> 03:39:23,263
Keeping them occupied to the front as well

4887
03:39:24,031 --> 03:39:25,567
That doesn't go too well

4888
03:39:25,823 --> 03:39:26,847
It does for a while

4889
03:39:27,103 --> 03:39:29,663
I mean the armies clash in the first month of the wars

4890
03:39:30,687 --> 03:39:33,503
Commonly referred to as the battle of the Frontiers

4891
03:39:33,759 --> 03:39:36,831
When you get these 19th century tactics

4892
03:39:37,087 --> 03:39:39,903
Running into twentieth-century mechanized Warfare

4893
03:39:40,159 --> 03:39:45,279
Which leads to the worst single month in terms of casualties that you're going to get in the whole War

4894
03:39:45,791 --> 03:39:47,583
Because you're not going to see

4895
03:39:47,839 --> 03:39:48,351
A lot of

4896
03:39:48,607 --> 03:39:51,423
Cavalry Charges against machine guns and artillery

4897
03:39:51,679 --> 03:39:52,191
Prepositions

4898
03:39:52,447 --> 03:39:53,215
After the first

4899
03:39:54,495 --> 03:39:55,263
That's when

4900
03:39:55,519 --> 03:39:56,287
The really

4901
03:39:56,799 --> 03:40:02,687
Mind-blowingly shocking things mean guys with armor and swords and white gloves and red pants and

4902
03:40:02,943 --> 03:40:07,551
A bayonet charging prepared positions I mean the whole thing is is Cookie and that last for bottom

4903
03:40:08,831 --> 03:40:11,135
The next month is what happens after the Germans

4904
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:12,415
Lose the battle of the Marne

4905
03:40:12,927 --> 03:40:13,695
And they're sleeping play

4906
03:40:14,207 --> 03:40:14,719
Is broken

4907
03:40:14,975 --> 03:40:19,071
As of the second month of the wars then basically running away from there earlier position

4908
03:40:19,327 --> 03:40:21,119
Trying to find a place to regroup

4909
03:40:21,375 --> 03:40:25,471
Finding a really good place to regroup on the other side of the river rain

4910
03:40:25,727 --> 03:40:26,495
And digging it

4911
03:40:27,007 --> 03:40:29,055
And the Allies following them

4912
03:40:29,311 --> 03:40:30,847
Unable to take those

4913
03:40:31,359 --> 03:40:34,943
Wonderful positions on the other side of the river rain and digging in themselves

4914
03:40:35,455 --> 03:40:36,223
Inaugurating

4915
03:40:36,735 --> 03:40:38,271
Officially trench warfare

4916
03:40:39,551 --> 03:40:41,599
And you have the so-called race to the Sea

4917
03:40:42,111 --> 03:40:48,255
When the Germans and the French and the British you don't want to run into each other's prepare defenses anymore start trying to find a flank in the only

4918
03:40:48,511 --> 03:40:49,279
A open party

4919
03:40:49,535 --> 03:40:50,815
Of the battle line left

4920
03:40:51,071 --> 03:40:54,143
From the riveraine up north towards the sea

4921
03:40:54,399 --> 03:40:57,471
Both sides reach the sea before they find a flag

4922
03:40:57,983 --> 03:41:03,103
They have a couple of terrible battles including the first battle of Ypres up there and then

4923
03:41:03,359 --> 03:41:07,199
We settled down to the 1915 Warfare basically

4924
03:41:07,455 --> 03:41:08,479
Which is going to involve

4925
03:41:08,735 --> 03:41:11,295
Both sides launching offenses that don't do

4926
03:41:12,575 --> 03:41:18,719
And that City read the book sometimes they can make him exciting oh they almost broke through and all of their only been modern communication

4927
03:41:18,975 --> 03:41:20,511
But the bottom line is the bottom line

4928
03:41:21,023 --> 03:41:23,839
You have a bunch of battles during 1915 on the Western Front

4929
03:41:24,095 --> 03:41:24,863
Nothing changes

4930
03:41:26,143 --> 03:41:27,167
On the Eastern Front

4931
03:41:27,423 --> 03:41:29,215
Nothing changes either

4932
03:41:29,471 --> 03:41:30,751
But a lot of movement happen

4933
03:41:31,263 --> 03:41:33,311
Why do people die a lot of movement happens

4934
03:41:33,567 --> 03:41:36,383
The overall strategic situation Remains the Same

4935
03:41:36,639 --> 03:41:42,527
Because when the Russians and the Germans Clash right at the war start the Russians get crushed in a couple of big battles

4936
03:41:42,783 --> 03:41:44,063
Tannenberg masurian Lakes

4937
03:41:44,575 --> 03:41:46,623
Then they beat the austro-hungarians

4938
03:41:46,879 --> 03:41:50,719
The serbians be the austro-hungarian whole bunch of stuff happens when you turn around

4939
03:41:50,975 --> 03:41:55,071
And subtract all the deaths and all the movement everything else the situation is the same

4940
03:41:55,583 --> 03:41:56,607
The Russians are there

4941
03:41:56,863 --> 03:41:59,935
They're not defeated they can replace all their losses

4942
03:42:00,191 --> 03:42:06,335
And if you really want to chase them they'll run all the way back to Moscow like they did against Napoleon and like they'll do against Hitler

4943
03:42:06,591 --> 03:42:08,895
How do you really want to follow them all the way back there

4944
03:42:10,175 --> 03:42:13,759
So they don't have trench warfare they have movement Warfare

4945
03:42:14,015 --> 03:42:16,063
The movements not ending anything

4946
03:42:16,319 --> 03:42:17,343
And then of course

4947
03:42:17,599 --> 03:42:21,183
Because the Russians and the Turks start getting into it down in the south

4948
03:42:21,439 --> 03:42:25,535
The Russians at the Allies for help which leads to Winston Churchill's cabal

4949
03:42:25,791 --> 03:42:31,935
Having yet another good argument to argue that maybe we should take the Dardanelles with all these pre Dreadnought battleships

4950
03:42:32,191 --> 03:42:33,471
And then the Dardanelles happen

4951
03:42:33,727 --> 03:42:35,007
Here's what we can kind of

4952
03:42:35,263 --> 03:42:37,567
Add the Flop I was just promising you because

4953
03:42:38,079 --> 03:42:39,871
Remember one of the sidebar hope

4954
03:42:40,383 --> 03:42:45,759
With this Dardanelles campaign is that it might influence some of those countries down in that region

4955
03:42:46,015 --> 03:42:50,111
The head and decided which side to join yet but it was obvious that they were sort of taking bids

4956
03:42:50,623 --> 03:42:52,159
Italy most among them

4957
03:42:52,415 --> 03:42:54,207
They like the Allied been better

4958
03:42:54,463 --> 03:43:00,607
They saw the Dardanelles campaign looking pretty strong back in May 1915 you know when they were Landings and true

4959
03:43:01,119 --> 03:43:03,167
Assaulting the heights everyday and want to look like

4960
03:43:03,423 --> 03:43:04,447
Britain and France were strong

4961
03:43:04,703 --> 03:43:05,983
The Italians join the war

4962
03:43:06,495 --> 03:43:08,799
They instantly attacked the austro-hungarians

4963
03:43:09,055 --> 03:43:12,639
At really the only good spot on their border to do that

4964
03:43:13,407 --> 03:43:15,711
Because the rest of their borders basically the Alps

4965
03:43:16,223 --> 03:43:21,599
And basically the austro-hungarian have The High Ground although they find and have found recently

4966
03:43:22,623 --> 03:43:25,439
Almost like something out of the old Captain America comic books

4967
03:43:25,951 --> 03:43:28,511
In which Captain America Frozen in the snow except

4968
03:43:28,767 --> 03:43:29,791
Of course he was alive when they

4969
03:43:30,303 --> 03:43:31,071
Defrosted them

4970
03:43:31,327 --> 03:43:33,119
These poor Austrian

4971
03:43:33,375 --> 03:43:38,239
And Italian soldiers that their finding with these glaciers melting up in the Alps

4972
03:43:38,495 --> 03:43:40,287
In these caves and I mean they look

4973
03:43:40,543 --> 03:43:44,127
Perfect like they were frozen yesterday their uniforms their weapons

4974
03:43:44,383 --> 03:43:48,991
Their facial characteristics everything I mean it's crazy it's like a time capsule of the most

4975
03:43:50,015 --> 03:43:51,295
Grotesque kind

4976
03:43:52,063 --> 03:43:54,367
Nevertheless the one area that's good for fighting

4977
03:43:54,623 --> 03:43:55,647
At least compared to the Alps

4978
03:43:56,159 --> 03:43:57,183
It's on the river re songs

4979
03:43:57,695 --> 03:44:01,279
The Italians attacked the austro-hungarians right away at the river is Alonzo

4980
03:44:01,535 --> 03:44:02,303
And lose

4981
03:44:03,071 --> 03:44:08,447
So then they attack again on the River Song so this will be called the Second Battle of the river so I'm gonna lose again

4982
03:44:08,959 --> 03:44:10,239
They do it again third bottle

4983
03:44:10,751 --> 03:44:12,287
Riverssance all they do it again the 4th.

4984
03:44:12,799 --> 03:44:13,311
River sounds

4985
03:44:13,567 --> 03:44:15,871
By the last year of the war there on the 12th

4986
03:44:16,127 --> 03:44:17,663
Battle of the river isonzo

4987
03:44:18,175 --> 03:44:19,967
And hundreds of thousands have died

4988
03:44:20,223 --> 03:44:20,991
And in fact

4989
03:44:21,247 --> 03:44:26,367
In only 6 months of warfare the Italians will have 200,000 casualties and are quickly

4990
03:44:26,879 --> 03:44:27,647
Playing catch up

4991
03:44:28,159 --> 03:44:28,671
With the rest of

4992
03:44:28,927 --> 03:44:30,975
The power I should point out something by casualty

4993
03:44:31,231 --> 03:44:33,535
Please do we keep using that term in its worth to finding it

4994
03:44:34,303 --> 03:44:36,863
Casualties of the military term in many of you know

4995
03:44:37,119 --> 03:44:39,679
And it simply refers to the loss of battle

4996
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:43,519
Your general and it's your army were talking about

4997
03:44:43,775 --> 03:44:45,311
Casualties simply means

4998
03:44:45,567 --> 03:44:47,871
The number of people you don't have available to fight

4999
03:44:48,639 --> 03:44:53,247
Those who've been killed those who've been wounded those who've been captured and those who are missing

5000
03:44:53,759 --> 03:44:55,039
So when I say casualties

5001
03:44:55,551 --> 03:44:58,111
That's what it means all the missing in this war usually means

5002
03:44:58,367 --> 03:45:00,159
Dad if I say Dad well

5003
03:45:00,671 --> 03:45:01,695
That means killed in action

5004
03:45:03,487 --> 03:45:06,047
Tell the Italians 200000 casualties within six months

5005
03:45:06,303 --> 03:45:09,375
The other power that gets into the war does so in October

5006
03:45:09,887 --> 03:45:13,471
And it's the bulgarians another one of these Powers at Churchill and his friends at home

5007
03:45:13,727 --> 03:45:14,239
To convince

5008
03:45:14,495 --> 03:45:20,639
To join the Allied side when they saw how the Dardanelles campaign was going but by October the Dardanelles campaign is really going poor

5009
03:45:20,895 --> 03:45:27,039
Morley and the Bulgarian have been promising good land and they don't like the serbs anyway so they joined with the Germans in the

5010
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:30,623
The austro-hungarians all three of them promptly attacks Serbia

5011
03:45:30,879 --> 03:45:32,671
And knock them out of the war

5012
03:45:33,183 --> 03:45:35,231
Nobi the story this harrowing story of

5013
03:45:36,511 --> 03:45:37,535
Serbian Army

5014
03:45:37,791 --> 03:45:39,583
I'm going all the way through Albanian

5015
03:45:39,839 --> 03:45:41,375
Mountain passes like a bunch of

5016
03:45:41,631 --> 03:45:47,519
REITs starving until they reach the C&O be evacuated by French British warship to fight another day

5017
03:45:49,055 --> 03:45:54,175
One thing I wasn't sure if I mentioned in the story you know we talked about the Second Battle of Ypres where the Germans use

5018
03:45:54,431 --> 03:45:55,967
Poison gas for the first time

5019
03:45:56,223 --> 03:45:58,015
In a successful way was used on the

5020
03:45:58,271 --> 03:45:59,551
Eastern front in a weird way once

5021
03:46:00,063 --> 03:46:05,439
But after the Second Battle leave for the Allies start using gas to and by the end of 1915

5022
03:46:05,695 --> 03:46:09,791
The standard mix of shells is you want some high explosive in your mix

5023
03:46:10,047 --> 03:46:16,191
And you want some shrapnel shells in your mix which are like giant balls filled with tiny little babies when they explode is like a

5024
03:46:16,447 --> 03:46:17,983
Giant hand grenade going off

5025
03:46:18,239 --> 03:46:21,311
And then the last shells you want mixed into your little Triad

5026
03:46:22,847 --> 03:46:24,895
Infrared Fitness are your gas shells

5027
03:46:25,151 --> 03:46:28,223
SO gas high explosive shrapnel you shoot it all the same time

5028
03:46:28,479 --> 03:46:29,759
It makes a nasty little cock

5029
03:46:30,015 --> 03:46:30,783
For the poor troops

5030
03:46:31,039 --> 03:46:31,551
The ground

5031
03:46:32,575 --> 03:46:35,647
Everyone got gas and everybody wearing gas masks now

5032
03:46:35,903 --> 03:46:39,231
And you end up with these images that are still to my mind

5033
03:46:39,487 --> 03:46:40,767
The greatest images of

5034
03:46:41,023 --> 03:46:42,559
The first world war cuz they say the most

5035
03:46:42,815 --> 03:46:45,631
When you'll see for example I love the one that shows

5036
03:46:45,887 --> 03:46:47,167
A German

5037
03:46:47,423 --> 03:46:48,191
Cavalry

5038
03:46:48,447 --> 03:46:49,215
Lancer

5039
03:46:49,727 --> 03:46:51,775
In 1916 or 1917

5040
03:46:52,031 --> 03:46:53,055
Who's wearing

5041
03:46:53,311 --> 03:46:59,455
The Stahl Helm which will come into Vogue in 1916 which is basically the same basic design you'll see the

5042
03:46:59,711 --> 03:47:03,807
German Army have in the second World War II is wearing like a German wehrmacht Helmet

5043
03:47:04,063 --> 03:47:04,831
Little Lamb

5044
03:47:05,599 --> 03:47:06,367
On a horse

5045
03:47:06,623 --> 03:47:08,159
And wearing a gas mask

5046
03:47:08,927 --> 03:47:10,975
He's like half medieval Knight

5047
03:47:11,231 --> 03:47:13,535
And half Stormtrooper from Star Wars

5048
03:47:14,047 --> 03:47:20,191
And that to me encapsulate what this war is these meetings of the modern world with the pre-modern world

5049
03:47:20,447 --> 03:47:22,495
Like a historical Estuary like I said

5050
03:47:23,775 --> 03:47:24,543
And in fact

5051
03:47:24,799 --> 03:47:29,663
You know what seat is Uber modern because really there hasn't been a major war fought with gas

5052
03:47:30,175 --> 03:47:30,687
Since this

5053
03:47:31,199 --> 03:47:32,991
Time. I mean there been incidents

5054
03:47:33,247 --> 03:47:34,783
Of chemical weapons and gas use

5055
03:47:35,039 --> 03:47:37,343
But you've never had the major mean the second world war there was no

5056
03:47:39,647 --> 03:47:43,999
Also it should be obvious that there have been several theaters that have not gotten much or perhaps

5057
03:47:44,255 --> 03:47:45,279
Any attention

5058
03:47:45,535 --> 03:47:50,399
From yours truly and it's not because I don't find them interesting and I think you could do a whole

5059
03:47:50,655 --> 03:47:51,679
Podcast just

5060
03:47:51,935 --> 03:47:52,447
On

5061
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:55,263
The African experience in the first World War

5062
03:47:55,775 --> 03:47:57,311
But it's not important to the out

5063
03:47:57,567 --> 03:48:00,639
Come of the first world war when you have to chop in places for

5064
03:48:00,895 --> 03:48:02,431
4 time these are long enough already

5065
03:48:02,687 --> 03:48:05,247
You naturally look at the Pacific in the first World War

5066
03:48:05,503 --> 03:48:07,807
Or Africa because it didn't affect the outcome

5067
03:48:08,575 --> 03:48:10,367
What had more of an effect on the outcome

5068
03:48:11,135 --> 03:48:17,279
Are the soldiers from those two areas that were trucked into places like the Western Front and who fought the

5069
03:48:18,303 --> 03:48:19,071
Lots of North Ave

5070
03:48:19,839 --> 03:48:21,119
Lots of sub-Saharan

5071
03:48:21,631 --> 03:48:24,959
Lots of people from the Far East fought on the Western Front

5072
03:48:25,215 --> 03:48:27,263
And places like the Dardanelles

5073
03:48:27,519 --> 03:48:30,079
And eventually at Salonika and places like that

5074
03:48:30,591 --> 03:48:32,127
In the funny way

5075
03:48:32,383 --> 03:48:33,663
The place where

5076
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:39,039
Africans and Asians had the most impact on the war going one way or the other

5077
03:48:39,551 --> 03:48:41,343
Was the same Western Front that

5078
03:48:41,599 --> 03:48:43,391
We normally think of as being a British

5079
03:48:43,903 --> 03:48:45,183
French Canadian

5080
03:48:45,439 --> 03:48:46,463
Soda preserving

5081
03:48:47,231 --> 03:48:48,255
Down the road and American Way

5082
03:48:49,791 --> 03:48:51,583
So by the end of 1915

5083
03:48:52,607 --> 03:48:55,167
You basically have a static situation

5084
03:48:55,423 --> 03:48:56,191
Western Front

5085
03:48:56,447 --> 03:48:57,215
Stays unchanged

5086
03:48:57,727 --> 03:48:59,775
Eastern Front keeps moving around

5087
03:49:00,031 --> 03:49:02,335
But everybody still standing there facing each other

5088
03:49:02,591 --> 03:49:03,871
Dalian Turkey

5089
03:49:04,383 --> 03:49:07,711
The war's been extended to down there but it's just stable

5090
03:49:08,735 --> 03:49:10,783
Turn of the reasons this is called the year of

5091
03:49:11,039 --> 03:49:12,575
Stalemate in the first World War

5092
03:49:13,087 --> 03:49:15,647
If you want to talk about something new that has happened

5093
03:49:15,903 --> 03:49:16,415
Helmets

5094
03:49:16,671 --> 03:49:17,183
Just started right

5095
03:49:18,207 --> 03:49:21,791
We mentioned the German stahlhelm a minute ago the first one is the French help

5096
03:49:22,047 --> 03:49:24,863
But then the British metal helmet than the German one appears

5097
03:49:25,119 --> 03:49:31,007
And it's one of those things that doesn't seem like a big deal but all of those helmet designs will be the basic design

5098
03:49:31,263 --> 03:49:33,055
That the second world war helmets

5099
03:49:33,567 --> 03:49:35,871
They'll all look very familiar and being

5100
03:49:36,383 --> 03:49:38,687
Vogue for quite a while at least in their basic

5101
03:49:38,943 --> 03:49:39,711
Look the German one change

5102
03:49:40,223 --> 03:49:40,991
Oil change

5103
03:49:42,271 --> 03:49:43,039
But also

5104
03:49:43,295 --> 03:49:44,575
Because it boggles the mind

5105
03:49:44,831 --> 03:49:45,343
And a little bit

5106
03:49:45,599 --> 03:49:46,111
Doesn't it

5107
03:49:46,367 --> 03:49:52,511
If you don't get your first metal helmet really till late 1915 which means all these people have been

5108
03:49:52,767 --> 03:49:57,375
Fighting the most artillery intensive war in human history by far

5109
03:49:58,143 --> 03:49:58,911
With cloth

5110
03:49:59,423 --> 03:49:59,935
Hats

5111
03:50:00,191 --> 03:50:00,703
On their head

5112
03:50:02,751 --> 03:50:07,103
Digging holes in the ground where the only thing that's exposed to fire

5113
03:50:07,615 --> 03:50:09,407
Is the top of your head and it's

5114
03:50:09,663 --> 03:50:10,687
Covered by a hat

5115
03:50:10,943 --> 03:50:16,063
And forget the obvious thing about like shrapnel exploding in the air and just you know hitting you in the head

5116
03:50:16,575 --> 03:50:19,903
So many of these shells don't come all that close to you they just blow.

5117
03:50:20,159 --> 03:50:24,255
Tons of rocks and stuff up in the air that then come down and land on your

5118
03:50:24,767 --> 03:50:25,279
Had

5119
03:50:26,303 --> 03:50:26,815
How many

5120
03:50:27,071 --> 03:50:27,839
Casualties

5121
03:50:28,351 --> 03:50:28,863
From the first

5122
03:50:29,119 --> 03:50:30,399
Where the war could you a tribute

5123
03:50:31,679 --> 03:50:32,447
The fact that none of these troops

5124
03:50:32,703 --> 03:50:33,215
Had metal helmet

5125
03:50:33,471 --> 03:50:37,567
It's crazy to think about head crazy to think that it took him a year to come up with that

5126
03:50:38,335 --> 03:50:38,847
More than

5127
03:50:41,663 --> 03:50:42,175
Finally

5128
03:50:42,431 --> 03:50:42,943
And I think this

5129
03:50:43,455 --> 03:50:46,271
Firmly belongs in the casualty area when we're discussing

5130
03:50:46,527 --> 03:50:47,039
10 casualties

5131
03:50:47,807 --> 03:50:48,831
Modern medicine

5132
03:50:49,343 --> 03:50:50,623
Change the situation

5133
03:50:51,647 --> 03:50:53,439
If you were studying military history

5134
03:50:53,695 --> 03:50:55,487
You'll notice a very interesting

5135
03:50:55,999 --> 03:50:56,511
Change

5136
03:50:56,767 --> 03:50:59,071
In the way the casualty death to wounded figure

5137
03:50:59,583 --> 03:51:00,095
Show up in the

5138
03:51:01,375 --> 03:51:02,399
Normally

5139
03:51:02,655 --> 03:51:08,543
The number of people wounded and the number of people who die are pretty close together and take the Crimean War

5140
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:09,823
What happened in the 1800

5141
03:51:10,591 --> 03:51:11,871
More people died

5142
03:51:12,127 --> 03:51:12,639
From disease

5143
03:51:13,151 --> 03:51:18,271
Then from combat-related wounds that might have been a little extreme but not that far off the norm

5144
03:51:18,527 --> 03:51:19,807
By the first World War

5145
03:51:20,063 --> 03:51:21,599
That changes immensely

5146
03:51:21,855 --> 03:51:22,623
It's because

5147
03:51:22,879 --> 03:51:25,183
The medical situation has been Revolution

5148
03:51:25,439 --> 03:51:26,207
Modern

5149
03:51:26,463 --> 03:51:28,511
Military medicine really begins in

5150
03:51:29,279 --> 03:51:31,839
A lot of these doctors especially on the Western Front

5151
03:51:32,095 --> 03:51:35,423
Are doctors from private practice who have been drafted or

5152
03:51:35,679 --> 03:51:40,543
Joined and volunteered for the war effort they're often doing surgeries right near the front

5153
03:51:40,799 --> 03:51:45,407
These are people who live in the modern era when medicine is starting to be pretty darn good

5154
03:51:45,663 --> 03:51:50,271
And it completely changes the game I mean these people are not just able to save lives

5155
03:51:50,527 --> 03:51:51,551
And this is sort of a mixed by

5156
03:51:51,807 --> 03:51:52,831
I guess if you're a soldier

5157
03:51:53,087 --> 03:51:55,903
But they will be able for the nation-states that they work

5158
03:51:56,159 --> 03:51:57,695
Work to send a lot of these

5159
03:51:57,951 --> 03:51:59,231
Damaged soldiers

5160
03:51:59,743 --> 03:52:03,327
Back to fight again another day and sometimes multiple times

5161
03:52:04,351 --> 03:52:04,863
That ends up

5162
03:52:05,119 --> 03:52:06,143
Increasing

5163
03:52:06,399 --> 03:52:08,959
Ability of many of these states to keep fighting pass

5164
03:52:09,215 --> 03:52:11,007
Where they otherwise would have been able to

5165
03:52:11,519 --> 03:52:14,847
We don't have to do for example is look at the burn rate on some of these armies

5166
03:52:15,359 --> 03:52:16,127
By the end of

5167
03:52:16,383 --> 03:52:18,687
1950 by October 1915

5168
03:52:18,943 --> 03:52:19,967
The Russians are losing

5169
03:52:20,479 --> 03:52:22,783
235000 man

5170
03:52:23,295 --> 03:52:23,807
Every

5171
03:52:24,063 --> 03:52:24,575
Month

5172
03:52:26,879 --> 03:52:30,207
By the end of 1915 17 months into the war

5173
03:52:30,719 --> 03:52:33,279
The total Russian casualties were over 2 million man

5174
03:52:34,047 --> 03:52:34,559
I even though they could

5175
03:52:35,071 --> 03:52:36,863
Replace the human beings

5176
03:52:37,375 --> 03:52:38,399
What they can't do is

5177
03:52:38,655 --> 03:52:39,167
Replace

5178
03:52:39,423 --> 03:52:40,191
The morale

5179
03:52:40,959 --> 03:52:41,471
The capital

5180
03:52:42,239 --> 03:52:43,775
These are tells his French and British

5181
03:52:44,031 --> 03:52:45,567
Counterparts the end of 1915.

5182
03:52:45,823 --> 03:52:47,103
The population has turned

5183
03:52:47,359 --> 03:52:48,127
Pacifistic

5184
03:52:48,895 --> 03:52:49,919
An anti Ally

5185
03:52:51,967 --> 03:52:52,479
Meanwhile

5186
03:52:52,735 --> 03:52:54,527
The Western allies are having their own prom

5187
03:52:55,039 --> 03:52:58,623
The soldiers in the trenches starting to get a little uppity

5188
03:52:58,879 --> 03:52:59,903
About their willingness

5189
03:53:00,159 --> 03:53:01,695
The continued suicidal attack

5190
03:53:01,951 --> 03:53:02,975
Endlessly

5191
03:53:03,231 --> 03:53:04,511
That's not a good sign

5192
03:53:06,303 --> 03:53:07,839
Commander of the German forces

5193
03:53:08,095 --> 03:53:09,119
Is creating strategy

5194
03:53:09,631 --> 03:53:14,239
Is deciding that if they're really in a war of attrition why not designed the Battle 2

5195
03:53:14,495 --> 03:53:16,543
Who killed the most people instead of having breaks

5196
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:17,567
Teresa maneuver isn't

5197
03:53:17,823 --> 03:53:18,335
All that

5198
03:53:18,847 --> 03:53:20,639
And Erich von falkenhayn

5199
03:53:20,895 --> 03:53:21,407
Create

5200
03:53:21,919 --> 03:53:22,431
Killing grass

5201
03:53:22,687 --> 03:53:23,711
To invite

5202
03:53:23,967 --> 03:53:26,783
The French Nation to bleed itself white in

5203
03:53:27,807 --> 03:53:28,575
The big fleets

5204
03:53:28,831 --> 03:53:29,599
Finally come out

5205
03:53:29,855 --> 03:53:30,367
How to play

5206
03:53:30,879 --> 03:53:33,439
And new technologies debut

5207
03:53:33,695 --> 03:53:37,023
Whose job it is to break this Log Jam

5208
03:53:37,279 --> 03:53:38,303
I'll trenches

5209
03:53:38,815 --> 03:53:39,583
Machine guns

5210
03:53:40,095 --> 03:53:41,119
Barbed wire

5211
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:42,911
And gas

5212
03:53:44,959 --> 03:53:48,543
The year 1916 is sometimes called the breaker of Nations

5213
03:53:49,567 --> 03:53:52,127
It's going to be some Nations that suffer some Mortal wounds

5214
03:53:52,895 --> 03:53:53,663
Before that years old

5215
03:53:53,919 --> 03:53:54,687
Overall that

5216
03:53:55,455 --> 03:53:55,967
And more

5217
03:53:57,247 --> 03:53:57,759
Part 4

5218
03:53:58,783 --> 03:53:59,295
A blueprint for
