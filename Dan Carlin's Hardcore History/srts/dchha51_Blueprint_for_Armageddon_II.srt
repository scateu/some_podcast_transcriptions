1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
How much time do you put into a

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,608
The development

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
Gap

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,448
The perfect example

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,240
All of the sort of question they've been devil.

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
In this

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,288
Episode

8
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,848
Which covers by the way a ridiculously

9
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
A short span of time

10
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
But one of the most important

11
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
Let's just say month or so

12
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
In human history

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
It represents

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
The greatest mass

15
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
Pouring of organized violence that the world had ever seen

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't think there's ever been anything quite like

17
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
In the second world war begins

18
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,448
With the German attack on Poland and fighting between Germany and Poland it's over rather quickly and it's like 8 months

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
Before the major Powers actually come to blows

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,592
This war starts with all the major Powers coming to blows head on

21
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,944
Instantly on multiple fronts with casualties that no one had ever even seen

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
In a while

23
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Streams

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
The same time

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
At speed

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
And I started to realize that

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
The program

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
You know what's happening.

29
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
You can't

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
Get into the minds of the people in the human stories in the drama in the story

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
Without getting into the military Affairs and its is

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
Day-to-day progression because that's the driving force

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
That's what sets

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
The timeline that's what determines the turn in fortune

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
And that's what creates

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
Human impact on the ground

37
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
You know when we quote

38
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,648
A reporter talking about what it looks like in the hospitals in France

39
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,744
There's a reason that the hospitals are full of hurt people in that

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,328
Because the events on the ground continue to dictate what's going on

41
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,400
But the military Affairs are complex as all get-out

42
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
How much time do you spend

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
On a gaap

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
In the battle of the Marne write the famous

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
Miracle on the Marne is determined by this Gap in the enemy line

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,760
How much time do you spend on in a wider the Gap I mean if that really is

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
A war losing

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,928
Situation to have developed you get into that will if you get into that you're starting to follow a line of detail that just

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
I'll take you off into the weed

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
The difficult story to decide when to go off into the weeds

51
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
And went to stay put on the main road

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
This is our attempt

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
And explaining

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
This most

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Complex

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
And yet

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,080
Filled with human drama and great events

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
And larger-than-life figures

59
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
And

60
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Really a changing

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Of the Guard

62
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
In terms of

63
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
In one century to another

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Asbestos we can do with the Dan Carlin approach to the

65
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Called

66
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Blueprint

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
For Armageddon

68
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Vanessa's party

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
December 7th

70
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
19

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
41

72
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
A date which will live

73
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
In infamy

74
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Its history

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
The event

76
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,632
Call nist time and place I take pride in the words

77
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Ich bin ein Berliner

78
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
Instagram

79
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,624
I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know

80
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
Whether or not their presidential question

81
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,328
If we dig deep in our history and our Doctrine and remember that we are not descended

82
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
From fearful men

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
It's hardcore history

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,896
What year

85
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Did humankind

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Acquire the capability

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Asteroids

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
If it's an interesting idea isn't the idea that

89
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Every civilization in the universe if it continues to progress technologically down the road

90
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Orisha.

91
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
When it can kill it

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Either on purpose or accidentally

93
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
This fits into something

94
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Some physicists

95
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Theories

96
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
On What's called the Fermi paradox

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
And this idea of reaching a danger point in your civilization

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Is called

99
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
The great filter

100
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
The Fermi paradox

101
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Famous

102
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Paradox that was

103
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,999
Initially talked about supposedly by a bunch of the great physicists in the world on their lunch break

104
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Where they had done the math

105
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Trying to figure out the possibilities

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
Intelligent life being elsewhere in the universe in the math is so overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that there

107
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Must be

108
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
Why there's hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
Hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe it just seems like a slam dunk

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Right

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
So then

112
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Enrico Fermi famously one of the Great

113
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,343
Physicist ever famously than sister the group so where is everybody

114
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
That's affirmative

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Set the masses they should be there but they're not there

116
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
What's the reason they're not there

117
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
And that's where the great filter comes

118
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Because some of these people who study this stuff

119
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,935
Have suggested that there might be a point in every

120
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,543
Intelligent civilizations development where they acquire this ability to destroy themselves

121
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
Have to get through the.

122
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
Where they have that capability and get to the point where they

123
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
Figure out how not to do that

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
And it's kind of like a pass-fail test

125
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
For intelligent civilisational growth everywhere in the universe

126
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
And soda

127
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
By its very nature most civilizations

128
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Don't pass

129
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
That's what maybe that's the reason they're not all out there

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
And guys like Nick Bostrom study

131
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
Global catastrophic risk and stuff like that

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,079
You know what if a comet hit the planet what is nanotechnology goes out of control means looks at all these issues

133
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,967
He suggests that the Earth entered the civilizational phase this great filter. In our own history

134
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
In 1945

135
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
When the atomic bombs were

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Now I think about this

137
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
In terms of

138
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
The first world war because

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
I think that's when people first realized

140
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
The human beings had acquired a military capability

141
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
That was frightening not frightening because your enemy had it frightening because human beings had it

142
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
You can go back and look at history there are lots of times when people

143
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
We're afraid of the deadliness of weapons but they were afraid of the deadliness of weapons either because they were afraid themselves of get

144
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,855
Getting killed for their country of getting taken over whatever they weren't afraid for the species

145
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
They Wonder frayed

146
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
First civilization as a whole in the closest you'll see

147
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
You know with that Cummings you have like a Mongolian Beijing or Invasion from the step in it it it it strikes the subtle

148
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
Nations a bit like a wave and it washes up a certain amount

149
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
You know civilization up on the beach but it doesn't destroy everything

150
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
In the 19th century

151
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
That's the first time. We're

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,551
You can read writings from people who are certain that maybe what they're developing Battlefield capability wise

153
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Can destroy

154
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
Now their version of everything is a little bit different than our

155
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
When we talk about things like existential risk

156
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
We're talking about the survival of life

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
On the planet

158
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
That's a post-atomic

159
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,007
You no idea what existential risk means we understand that you have a nuclear war amongst all the great powers and

160
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
You can kiss life on Earth goodbye

161
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Or

162
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Certainly our level of civilization

163
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
You've heard that phrase bomb someone back to the Stone Age

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
Only modern people have the capability to do that right

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
But it was in the 19th century

166
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
The definite the idea that that's what a major war between the major Powers might amount to that

167
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Actually that idea takes hold

168
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Those people are worried about

169
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Definition number two

170
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Of existential threat

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
You guys like Nick Bostrom have two definitions one is the one we think about

172
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Wiped out life on Earth

173
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
But the other

174
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
Definition of what an existential threat is

175
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Is being knocked

176
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
Back down a few rungs

177
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
On your level of civilization

178
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
And then never finding your way back to your

179
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Weakness

180
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
You know to have

181
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,511
A Statue of Liberty in the sand moment doesn't like

182
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
To call it where you look up and you see the Statue of Liberty like in the Planet of the Apes

183
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Coming out of the sand and you instantly realize in a blinding flash of light

184
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,311
That you're living in an era that is off the civilizational highs

185
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
And that's what the people rioting in the late 19th

186
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
Early 20th century

187
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,807
Especially in places like Great Britain in the United States where everything seems just great why don't have to screw it up with the war

188
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,135
And really nothing to gain and everything to lose those people are writing about

189
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Living in a golden age

190
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Did they believe is fragile

191
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
And that these giant war machines

192
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,911
That are equally deadly in terms of their abilities to kill people on the battlefield

193
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
But also their ability to Simply

194
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
Bankrupt the societies that have to maintain them

195
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
Is causing consternation at end of the very weapon systems themselves and the arms race is that there

196
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
You're having

197
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Create more opportunities for some sort of violent

198
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Outbreak of War

199
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
The women see these things employee

200
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
The funny thing about human history who study military history

201
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Is the up until about 200 years ago

202
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
You can imagine armies

203
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
From a very long time ago

204
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Fighting and beating

205
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Armies from not that long ago

206
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
Alexander the Great's army I think

207
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
Beats the carolingian army of Charlemagne which is

208
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
You know a first-rate army up thousand years later

209
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
I don't think they must the macedonians must have hair

210
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
And their books like arther ferrill the origins of War

211
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Wechat

212
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
You don't say that credible historian can't help but play with the Battle of Waterloo inserting Alexander and his Mack

213
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Sidonians from the 330 BCE

214
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,935
In the place of Napoleon and his French sending the macedonians up against the

215
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,287
Duke of Wellington and his British and their Coalition allies and having

216
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,871
Alexander in the makedonian do at least as well as Napoleon

217
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
So what is that show you

218
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
What shows you how all of human military history changes

219
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
At about the time

220
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
The Napoleonic Wars because all of a sudden

221
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
A new law of historical nature takes over

222
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Which does the earlier armies

223
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
Do not beat later on

224
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
In the rules changed

225
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Thousand percent first of all think about today

226
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Speech at the US Army from today had it fight a battle against

227
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
In the US Army of 1945

228
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Today's US Army destroys that

229
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,967
Second World War army mid-twentieth-century army and maybe doesn't lose a man when they do it

230
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
But that 1945 US Army

231
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
We defeat easily

232
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Any army from the first

233
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
Any army from the first world war the major Powers would easily defeat

234
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
Do United States in the US Civil War

235
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
And the Civil War armies

236
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
If they went back to Waterloo

237
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Nobita Nepali

238
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
So that's sort of the rule

239
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,799
Of the law of technological Battlefield development for the last 200 years

240
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,639
And that's what the people in this story have had to try to suck up and understand

241
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,039
In 1700 some ruler can decide on a new musket design and not change it for a hundred years

242
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
He still probably okay

243
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,463
In nineteenth-century if you miss 15 years of development in Rifle technology

244
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
You might lose a war cuz of that

245
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
You think about

246
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
Something like the naval arms race

247
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,447
Places and how this just destroyed everybody's treasuries and everything else

248
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
But at the beginning of the 1800s

249
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
You are using ship-of-the-line type stuff I mean

250
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
You know the same Naval technology of giant Wooden Ships with cannons all in the side that's been the way things are

251
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
I've been done for a couple centuries

252
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
And when you build a ship and spend all that money and all that time it's good for a long time if it doesn't get destroyed in battle that ship cancer

253
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
Serve you for

254
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
20-30 years and then just be fine great invest

255
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,351
Pay off overtime if you amortize the cost out over the decades

256
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Tacos way

257
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
At the end of

258
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
The 19th century

259
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
And yet

260
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
The cost explodes

261
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
You look at a battleship from 1900

262
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
And it doesn't look like anything

263
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
From Napoleon's

264
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:40,063
It looks like a Thoroughly Modern Battleship the problem is is technology is changing so fast now

265
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
That in the time it takes you to design that new battleship

266
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,719
The Torso years it takes to build and launch and finish it

267
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
It may be outdated by the time it's ready to be used

268
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
You take a first-class first-rate

269
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
No Fleet from a global power in 1914

270
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,895
And you pitted in battle against the First Rate top-of-the-line Fleet from a mere 14 years ago

271
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
And the one from 1914 destroys the one from 1900 and maybe doesn't lose a major surf

272
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
This vessel while doing so

273
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
That is mind-boggling

274
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
The people who lived back then because

275
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,327
That means if you can't keep up technologically with what your neighbor is doing at Great expense

276
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
You can negate all the money you spent on that Fleet in the first place better to not have that Fleet from 19

277
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,823
If you're just going to lose the whole thing and not even think one of your enemy ships

278
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,175
The need to keep up with the killing power of everyone else

279
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Was impacting the treasuries of these countries in Waze

280
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
They created just as big of a threat to their continued existence

281
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
As the threat of all these dangerous armies did

282
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
It was a catch-22 for them

283
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Take the role

284
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Dirty

285
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
Russian czar

286
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
Found himself in in 1898 guy named Nicholas.

287
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,679
II may be the single most powerful person on the planet

288
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
He's

289
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
Got a shaky regime

290
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,359
It's a lot of Revolution there's a lot of discontent in a lot of it is exacerbated by the cost

291
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Trying to

292
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
You keep up a modern military

293
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
And even with all these cost

294
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
He's falling behind

295
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Rushes

296
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
To illiterate

297
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
It's Industries are too small

298
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,743
It's Society still need so much modernization for can keep up with places like Germany in

299
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
France Great Britain and even the United States

300
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
The problem is

301
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
Is that the czar's power is all in the country size in the population

302
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
And that's becoming

303
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Less and less important

304
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
Technology begins to determine who wins and who loses battle

305
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,479
And that's being demonstrated all through the 19th century at these small Colonial armies from the

306
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
Technologically sophisticated powers

307
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Destroy sometimes

308
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Giant army

309
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Tribal natives

310
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
All over the world

311
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
I mean that line

312
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
Famous one that says whatever happens we have got the Maxim gun

313
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
And they have not

314
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Is about using machine guns

315
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
On

316
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Tribal people

317
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
The Russian Czar is looking ahead and seeing that

318
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
If he can't

319
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,383
Keep up with this technological arms race that seems to be never-ending an endlessly expensive

320
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
The Russians are just going to be the new tribal

321
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
And yet he has to have this modern military machine

322
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Because of his adversaries have it and he doesn't

323
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
He's going to lose any War he

324
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Gets into

325
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
He loses his dynasty potentially either way

326
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
How do you get out of a mess light

327
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
In 1898

328
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
The Russian Czar thinks he finds a way

329
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Money issues

330
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Public invitation

331
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
Two representatives from the other great Powers who are

332
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
One degree or another in the same boat he's in

333
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
No one knows what the next major war will look like

334
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,647
But everybody's had a chance to see some minor wars in the meantime and if you sort of extrapolate what what they were

335
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
They were telling you

336
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,255
The next Wars going to be horrifying and Nicholas II was actually reading

337
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,327
The guy who turned out to be one of the most accurate

338
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
Prognosticators what the next door we can be like we talked about in the last show

339
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Ivan block

340
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
Nicholas II is reading Ivan Block in blocks

341
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
Predictions are horrific

342
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
So those are wants out he wants he wants to figure out a way to stop this dangerous cycle that the modern world seems to be for

343
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Forcing all the great Powers into

344
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
And I think it's a wonderful

345
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Sort of commentary on the attitude of the times that these guys thought that they could do this it looks like rainbows and unicorns

346
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
We modern people but to then they must have thought

347
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,095
Reasonable people can sit down over cigars and whiskey

348
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,727
See this Dynamic that we've got ourselves caught up in realize that it's in no one's interest and reasonable people

349
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Can figure a way out of this

350
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
And in 1898

351
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,663
These are of Russia proposed something that will be called the hate

352
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
France to deal with this

353
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
There are many ways

354
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
At the 1899 Hague

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Going to be another one in 1907

356
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
And truthfully it looks like an early version of Arms Control agreement you will see throughout the

357
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
20th century

358
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Which you can also View

359
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
Multiple lenses

360
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
The first one is you can take it at face value

361
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
The ways are sold at

362
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
If you want to

363
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Use modern terms desires PR people

364
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
When he issues this invitation to the rest of the world leaders

365
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,527
Your couch is this whole thing is a common-sense effort

366
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
At a high-minded idea

367
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
Is the goal of this conference he wants to put together with quote

368
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
Seeking to make the great idea of universal peace

369
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
Triumph over the elements of trouble and Discord

370
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
And quote

371
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,191
We might sell an arms-control conference today like that

372
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,031
This is the era where you really see for the first time in human history

373
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,871
The growth of what today we would call the International Peace movement

374
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,455
It had many conferences before the Hague conference

375
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,783
To promote these ideas and there was a general feeling

376
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,135
A progress on these issues and sodas are made been playing into that although

377
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Desert was kind of interesting dude

378
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,511
Very much a similar role on the monarchy dice

379
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
As the Germans got with Kaiser Wilhelm a very mediocre sort of guy not the sort of person you could imagine ever getting the

380
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
This job if it were merit-based

381
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
He's the same Czar the last czar

382
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
By the way

383
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,103
Who will fall victim in under sort of the sway of

384
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,759
The person that ours is sometimes called The Mad Monk grigory Rasputin although he's more interesting than that probably deserves more credit than that

385
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,063
What kind of again shows you

386
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,135
Bizarre is a kind of an idealistic romantic

387
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
I mean he might have bought into this stuff it might be legitimate on the czar's part

388
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
But like most Arms Control agreements

389
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
There's a

390
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
Realpolitik side to this thing

391
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:52,031
The Czar knows that his armies are falling behind in this technological race the old line about arms controller

392
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,639
Bereavement is if you're losing an arms race it's a good time to have an arms control agreement

393
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,551
And when the powers that are invited to this Hague conference asked for clarification of what's on the agenda

394
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,159
The Czar and his people give them eight or nine points that are going to be goals of the conference

395
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Any 8 or 9 points to a 21st century mind

396
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Are fascinate

397
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
Because it really shows you what the Czar wants to come out of this conference

398
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
The czar's

399
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,007
Number to gold for example that the agenda give to the rest of the participants says quote

400
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
To prohibit the use in the armies and fleets

401
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
Have any new kind of firearms whatever

402
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
End of new explosive

403
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
Were any powders more powerful than those now in use

404
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Either for rifles or Cannon

405
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
And quote

406
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Now

407
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,743
This is a staple to some degree of Arms Control agreements ever since I mean

408
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
The US and the Soviet Union were having an arms control agreement on anti-ballistic Missile agreement or whatever they may have

409
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Rules on technological progress

410
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
But they aren't trying to stop

411
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
All technological progress

412
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
What does r wants to do

413
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Is freeze thing

414
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Where they are

415
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,455
He doesn't want anymore

416
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
Research to increase the killing power

417
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
That already exists in military

418
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
He doesn't want any more deployment

419
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,511
If you accidentally discover that new Battleship gun that will shoot twice as far as your current one you can't deploy it

420
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,911
He wants the size of armies Frozen and then reduced he wants to size of military budgets Frozen and then reduced

421
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
This is a person who clearly shows

422
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
His main issue with the way things are

423
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Is the pace of change

424
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
And he wants this conference to address it

425
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,991
Nothing modern people who will often freak out

426
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
If the promised phone upgrade that's supposed to be released today is late in the internet will blow up with angry people

427
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,207
I've had their pace of change sabotage

428
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
The people in the late 19th century can probably be forgiven for thinking something we would assume is impossible

429
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Is possible

430
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
The first time I ever encountered this idea by the way was in James Burks

431
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Wonderful TV series from the 1980s the day the universe changed

432
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
We asked the question

433
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,175
Is humankind looks in a down the road

434
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
Where a particular branch of knowledge seems to be taking them

435
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
Can they decide if they don't like the destination to just

436
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,672
Not learn that branch of knowledge at all or the wall it off so that no one learns it

437
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
To Modern people that sounds impossible

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,888
Two people in the late 19th century they would have been able to show you multiple historical examples where that have been done

439
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
The Catholic church was very good out of the medieval times for example

440
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
Durban Chinese Emperors who could do it well

441
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,408
The idea of creating 4biddenknowledge and then preventing people from having it or using it

442
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Was Not Unusual in this time.

443
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
That's what the Czar wants

444
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
He wants to slow

445
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Or retard

446
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
The pace of change

447
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
And I always try to remind myself

448
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,536
How whipsawed all these people were in This Time. By the pace of change to

449
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
That's really what the 19th century is

450
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
The are aware at all speeds up

451
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
If you could for example

452
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Graph

453
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,336
Human technological progress the way you would a stock market performance graph

454
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
Starting at the beginning of human history ending yesterday

455
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
You don't having your ups and downs all throughout history

456
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
You noticed a couple of things right off the bat

457
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
The first thing you notice that there are UPS

458
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
And downs

459
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
One thing the modern mind seems

460
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Define incomprehensible

461
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
Is the progress that removes backward

462
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,864
The people who lived in 1904 example

463
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,216
Reading history books that made that sound like a historical law of nature

464
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
They had every reason to believe

465
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:41,920
The Tiara they were living in might be the last of a golden age before a fall because after all

466
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
That's what it happened to every other golden age that they look back on

467
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
The first thing the modern mine

468
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
Sees when it looks at the Historical

469
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:55,232
Stock performance chart showing human technological progress that there's a bunnyhop sort of dynamic going

470
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Two steps forward

471
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
One step

472
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
You might get a big upturn

473
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,424
You know when the New Kingdom Egyptians come on the scene

474
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
Maybe another uptick when the Han Chinese arrived another uptick when the Roman Empire arrived but after your Roman Empire High as you get you

475
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Roman Empire bubble dump

476
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,760
And a couple hundred years later when it's gone you have Germanic barbarians and formerly Roman territory looking

477
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,112
Crumbling Aqueduct and wondering what sort of giants once roamed the Earth

478
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
I could build stuff like that

479
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
The first thing you're going to notice as a modern person

480
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Is a technology doesn't always move forward

481
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
The second thing you're going to notice

482
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
Is the throughout most of human history

483
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Weather it's going up

484
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,312
We're going down it's moving at a glacially slow pace

485
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
The amount of change from the beginning of time to about the Renaissance is nowhere near what you would expect if we were anywhere

486
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
We're near the pace of change we have now

487
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Very little overall growth

488
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
Until you hit the Renaissance Mac little up

489
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,000
And I'm the century after that little bit more and then about 1810 1820

490
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
The graph becomes almost vertical overnight

491
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:08,192
Shoots up instead of ever plateauing as we all know it goes Evermore vertical everyday

492
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,032
Now we're used to this because it's been going that way for a while

493
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
Does our generation yeah that's century

494
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
That's the first time it really takes off and those people are looking at that isn't

495
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
Extremely destabilizing Force

496
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Bizarre things perhaps

497
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,416
An arms control agreement will help Russia from falling too far behind their more technologically sophisticated neighbor

498
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Now as you might expect they're more technologically sophisticated neighbors see this as an artificial constraint on

499
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
On the fact that they're winning

500
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Take the Germans as a perfect

501
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
Examples of people who are trying very hard to make up for what they see as the rest of the powers treating them like dirt

502
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:52,736
They're the ones building more ships than anybody and trying to catch up to Britain the other ones modernizing their military every day they're the

503
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,088
The ones who instead of being Panic by the pace of change are taking advantage of it

504
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,184
To them this looks like an agreement that will lock in their inferiority

505
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
And by the way

506
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
That's a situation that will repeat many times after this. In Arms Control negotiations

507
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Trying to gain

508
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
An edge on your opponent if you were losing the arms race as I said

509
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,496
Good time to have an arms-control agree

510
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,848
Finally there's an interesting group of people

511
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,152
And they really don't exist anymore not opened

512
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
They're on the opposite side of the Ledger from save the

513
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
International Peace movement

514
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
In ramping up during this era

515
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,904
The people who think that war is a good thing

516
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Forget about International

517
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
You don't golzar realpolitik people that literally believe that humankind thrives on war and it without War

518
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
We will drown in materialism

519
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
The only thing that keeps us focused on the higher things

520
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
That's an idea that is sort of Gone by the wayside

521
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
In Western culture

522
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Today is

523
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Peace activist to argue against

524
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
You know realpolitik people

525
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:01,600
In the 1880s for example you have guys like the Elder helmuth Von moltke who tries to explain to people why Pisa

526
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
She's not even a good idea

527
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
You're deluded he said quote

528
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
Perpetual peace is a dream

529
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
And not even a beautiful dream

530
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,608
And here is an integral part of God's ordering of the universe

531
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,936
In war man's noblest virtues come into play

532
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:22,336
Courage and renunciation Fidelity to duty and a Readiness for sacrifice that does not stop at giving up life

533
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Life itself

534
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
Without War the world would be swamped in materialism

535
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
And quote

536
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Others will point out

537
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
But if you decide to try to make war

538
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,672
You know what thing of the past what happens to all those people that are in situations

539
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Where

540
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:42,304
You are struggling against foreign oppression for example you going to tell someone they can't free themselves

541
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
I'm a horrible pressure because you

542
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Violence

543
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Is bad

544
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
But finally

545
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,544
You also have the people that the modern peace activist would recognize very well

546
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
Those who adhere

547
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
2A

548
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Belief system

549
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
That is difficult to argue with

550
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,504
In terms of new historical proof

551
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
You going to use history as your guide

552
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,368
You're going to argue that the best way to keep the

553
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
The piece is to be so strong

554
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Adidas almost suicidal

555
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
2

556
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Fight with you

557
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
Best exemplified perhaps

558
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
British Admiral

559
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
Sir John Fisher who try to explain

560
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
To a friend of his

561
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
That when he sounds

562
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Horrific

563
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
He's really an advocate of peace

564
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
And he said quote

565
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,736
I am not for War I am for peace that is why I am Pursuit cream Navy

566
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
Writing your autograph book at the Hague the supremacy of the British Navy is the best security for the Peace of the world

567
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
My sole object is

568
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
What you call my truculence is all for peace

569
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
If you rub it in

570
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
Both at home and abroad

571
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,936
But you are ready for instant war with every unit of your strength in the first line

572
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
And waiting to be first in

573
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
And hit your enemy in the belly

574
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Kick him when he's down

575
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Boil your prisoners in oil if you take any

576
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
And torture his women and children

577
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
Then people will steer clear review

578
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
And quote

579
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
Well as harsh as that is it has a certain amount of

580
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Historical evidence to back it up doesn't

581
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
When asked

582
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,000
How to make war more humane

583
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
The nephew of

584
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,400
Helmuth Von moltke the Elder that would be Helmuth Von moltke the younger

585
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,544
The field Marshal in charge of Germany's war effort at the start of the first world war famously said the only way to make war humane

586
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Is to make it short

587
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Hence

588
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
The Schlieffen

589
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
We talked about this

590
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,272
So-called Schlieffen Plan in the last episode

591
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Almost

592
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,672
Mythological pre-war plan for how Germany was going to deal with this terrible two front problem

593
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
My analogy is like a bar fight

594
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Is there a

595
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
A meme online that I saw

596
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
Comparing World War 1 to a bar fight

597
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
But it's a little like

598
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
You know that Germany knows it's going to have a bar fight

599
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
With France and Russia

600
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
But they know that France is going to be there five minutes before Russia so they get to the bar right on time knock France out in 5 minutes later

601
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
When Russia shows up late

602
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Stick it to fight the Germans one-on-one that's the war plan

603
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
In a nutshell

604
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,808
But the questions surrounding this war plan

605
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
Have become maybe the number one most controversial issue that historians argue with each other and froth at the mouth over

606
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,816
And yours truly you know I don't have a dog in this fight I'm just going to sit back

607
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,144
Eat popcorn and watch the very entertaining discussion

608
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
On the sleeping so-called Schlieffen Plan

609
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
Because it's not just a

610
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
This or that

611
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,664
It's like a Kennedy assassination thing where I mean every different Theory you can think of is out there

612
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
There was a sleeping pill

613
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,528
It wasn't Schlieffen Plan but it was modified

614
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,880
X x x x

615
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
The people often on multiple sides of this issue are very credible

616
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
So I'm not getting it

617
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
Waiting on a discussion with scientist you just have to store watch some

618
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,008
How to take a position on the so-called Schlieffen Plan and we'll call it the Schlieffen Plan because that's what everybody knows it by

619
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
But suffice it to say that

620
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,920
Sleep is retired for quite a long time before the first world war breaks out

621
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,760
So whatever plan the Germans were going to use are in the hands

622
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:18,112
A helmuth Von moltke the younger the guy who's leading this whole

623
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Early

624
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,048
War on the Germans part and he's been the one designed his plan for a long time after the first world war is over

625
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
You will get a bunch of German generals writing memoirs

626
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
Sort of castigating this Malta guy

627
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,312
For deviating from schlieffen's amazingly brilliant plan

628
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,896
It's the way we're supposed to hear you just stayed with the plan the way it was supposed to be

629
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
You know that we win the war

630
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
It's worth talking about the plan a little bit

631
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
From a military history standpoint

632
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
The Schlieffen Plan

633
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,928
And again I have to say as it's normally understood

634
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,488
Because somebody out there's going to have a very good

635
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Piece of evidence showing it

636
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
Totally different that I'm saying right now

637
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,376
What is it as it's commonly understood the Schlieffen Plan

638
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Is a fantastic military camp

639
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
Involved

640
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
Taking trips

641
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,312
From basically everywhere else you might have to fight

642
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,688
And taking as many of them as you can and sticking them on that one part that's going to be the sledgehammer

643
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Ahead of the slideshow

644
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
End

645
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,624
Your superiority in numbers at the head of that Sledgehammer going to be so overwhelming it's going to crush everything

646
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
And then you can swing it around

647
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
And trap all the French armies that are sitting on the French border in a waiting to fight the Germans on the other side of the German border

648
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
But the head of the Hammers coming through Belgium

649
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
A neutral country

650
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
Going to swing from above

651
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
And then it's going to collapse down on all those French armies facing the Germans

652
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
And trapped them in the rear

653
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
But it's a huge Gamble

654
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
What if you screw up

655
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,600
What if the Russians mobilized faster than you think they are going to

656
00:31:54,112 --> 00:32:00,256
Well they'll be mowing down your tiny little forces left there to stop them and they're not that far

657
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,328
From Berlin and the first territory they're going to take over happens

658
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
To be the ancestral home

659
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
A precious nobility

660
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
Including

661
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Kaiser Wilhelm

662
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,520
So nobody wants to see the Russians anywhere near Prussia

663
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
But they happen to be cut in air pressure anyway

664
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
So that's a problem

665
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Also

666
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,248
Everyone knows the French are going to want to retake those territories that the Germans took a generation before

667
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,880
Which is down at the franco-german border which means the French were going to attack there was a lot of forces you pull too many people away from there

668
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,208
The French to be breaking through into Southern Germany while the head of your

669
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
Sledgehammer still working its way

670
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:37,120
You around French like a terrible gamble cuz if you screw it up you could lose the war

671
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Remember two things

672
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,752
Schlieffen is writing the war plan and he supposedly came up with this idea

673
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
The conditions are differ

674
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,872
The German Army is different in size

675
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
So is the French army

676
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:55,552
The Russians have almost seen a complete collapse in 1905 of their hold Dynasty when they're falling apart they just lost the war

677
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
War against Japan

678
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
They're nowhere near as formidable as they'll be

679
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
10 years later write 9 years later

680
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
But that's when most casted

681
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
And the situations are different and he has to recalculate things and

682
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,656
The second part of that whole equation is it sleeping

683
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
Could afford to be a gambler

684
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
Because he doesn't actually have to do it

685
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Sleeping is a gambler

686
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
On paper

687
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,920
Multi is a guy like to make this work in real time

688
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
And not have the downside happen

689
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
And live through it

690
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Annie's more to pass

691
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
Maybe you would say more of a realist

692
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
And he won't

693
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Put

694
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
As many troops

695
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
What's in the sledgehammer part of the attack

696
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
As sleeping would have dictated you should

697
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
He walked into the other front

698
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
2 is greater degree and leave them

699
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
That wide open

700
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
But he can't

701
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,336
Assume that the war will be won so automatically

702
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,712
But you can just know that Germany will be safe and won't be broken true in all these areas you denuded in other words

703
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Most of the more conservative guy

704
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,648
But if this plan is true I'm going to keep saying that disclaimer so don't get in trouble if this plan is true

705
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,256
It puts Malta in a position of accepting a gamble of a plan

706
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Forgot he's not a gambler

707
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
But that's the plan

708
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,960
And in order to understand the sledgehammer side of this plan

709
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
You have to have some sort of conception

710
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Of the size of the armies involved

711
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,688
For comparison purposes and again sort of demonstrates how much things have changed

712
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,784
In a military sense and how they've exploded since Napoleonic time

713
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
If you look at

714
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
Assumptions made by people who study the Roman Empire

715
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
One of the favorite

716
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Subject

717
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
They will debate

718
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
Is how many human beings

719
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
We're in the military

720
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
Of the Roman Empire at its height

721
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
Do police and take care of

722
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
That massive ancient state

723
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
I don't mean anyone battle I mean the total military

724
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
Power of the Roman Empire at its height

725
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
And you will get numbers

726
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,456
Anywhere from 450 thousand men at the low end

727
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,016
About 750,000 men

728
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
The higher

729
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Now

730
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
The numbers of German

731
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
They're making their way through Bells

732
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,816
In August 1914 as part of the Sledge hammers head

733
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Is at least

734
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
750000

735
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,984
Some numbers put that up to 1.2 million

736
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
That means that

737
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,896
Flanking Force the head of the sledgehammers we keep calling at this moving through Belgium to smacked

738
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
The French like a door swinging on hinge

739
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
Is at least at Large

740
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
Is the entire military of the Roman Empire

741
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
And if those lower numbers are actually closer to the truth

742
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
For the empire

743
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
New Total military

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Capability

745
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
Then you might have a German Army moving through Belgium that's twice the size

746
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
The entire world

747
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
I totally justifies

748
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
All of the worst fears of these

749
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
Do people in the 19th century worried about that the kind of folks would call ahead conference in and write about peace and all that kind

750
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,552
And the people who understood what the growth in the military technology was going to do Ivan blocks ideas are about to be

751
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Proven

752
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
True in no uncertain fashion

753
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,696
These people were used to Napoleon

754
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Will Napoleon

755
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:21,120
Giant gamble of invading Russia may have had its highest 750,000 man across the entire front

756
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,936
You know from a giant front Russia

757
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
That's what you have moving through the

758
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
Tiny little road system in the railroad system of Belgium

759
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
Napoleon's Grand Army

760
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Is Your Flank

761
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Wow

762
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
I keep trying to remind myself

763
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:45,440
That what the Germans are trying to do here is not perhaps as much of a of a weird gamblers you might think I'm going also need to remember

764
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,536
That most of the people in the higher leadership positions in the German military

765
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
I've done all this before

766
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
In fact

767
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,264
They fought friends before it's probably the most important war that happened between Napoleon's times and the

768
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,848
The first world war and most people outside of Europe know nothing about the Franco

769
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Depression War

770
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Of 1870 1871

771
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,528
But essentially forget what it says you know when the history books cuz it makes it look like a nine-month war

772
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
Essentially the German smashed the French in a month and a half

773
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
It's a fantastically interesting conflict and it's shaped

774
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,584
The perceptions and views of these people in the higher leadership positions because they were Junior officers who fought in that war

775
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Bright

776
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
They watched

777
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,264
2 amazing things happen they watch the German armies

778
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Crap

779
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:38,944
An entire French army I like 8090 thousand men in one of the French fortresses that was there too

780
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
You keep the Germans from crossing the border

781
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
And then

782
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,368
The actual Emperor Franz himself a guy named Napoleon the third another one of those

783
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,512
Interesting roles of the monarchy dice leads a relief Army going to break the siege right and rescues other Army

784
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
Have another 80 or 90 thousand guys

785
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,704
And the Germans managed to surround the whole army with the emperor

786
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
And force them to surrender

787
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,592
Which kind of course means that entire Army that's also trap nearby have to surrender to

788
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,664
I mean the French fought on for a long time doggedly

789
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,272
The people of Paris rose up I mean there was a fantastic resistance at

790
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,088
What the war was over in a month and a half

791
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,904
That was the way the Germans wanted to do it again this time

792
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,720
And the people who did it last time

793
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
Are the ones in command of a lot of these

794
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,072
In a Coors and armies

795
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
And in the general staff

796
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Now

797
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,056
As the Germans try to make their way you know through Belgium and not have this important time schedule screwed up

798
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
The French on the other side

799
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,896
Are trying to figure out what the heck's going on

800
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,320
Part of what we modern people have to remember and I was trying to try to put myself in their positions very hard because we're in an era

801
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,976
Where the battlefield especially to Western powers and most especially to the United States the battlefield is totally visible for the

802
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
You can hide yourself in Foley and sometimes Maybe

803
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,376
For nearby we're going to have female thermal sensors and stuff

804
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,424
But the battlefield is visible to

805
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
We're used to this

806
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,312
Most of human history the fog of War as it's known as huge

807
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Because

808
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,992
It keeps you from seeing what's about to happen until it just is about to happen you don't get a lot of advance notice to plan

809
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
That's why aircraft stop

810
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Becoming really important

811
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Because they take the eyes

812
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Of the military

813
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Put them up in the air and it

814
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,744
Extend how far back you can see

815
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
If you see

816
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:35,168
You know Army is moving to another area you can safely assume oh I better move my Army to another area something's going to happen over

817
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
During this early part of the battle

818
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
No one is sure what's happening on the Allied side the furniture is worried about how they get the British over here to fight

819
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
With as many men as they can bring over as they are about where are the Germans coming in and in what sort of strength

820
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
You see the French have suspected for a very long time

821
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
That the Germans were going to do this outflanking move in Belgium

822
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
That was not totally unexpected

823
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
The part that may have caught them off-guard

824
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,912
Is what they were thinking you know the French through Belgium with

825
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,800
The guys running the French military this time working on their own War plans assumptions

826
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
Simply won't believe that the size

827
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
Moving through Belgium is as big as it is and let's remember

828
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,064
Molka will be criticized after the war by other German generals who are mad not bigger

829
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
I mean end of the French have

830
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Huge problem

831
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,256
Because they have one of the loosest agreements

832
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
I've ever run into in my life

833
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
4

834
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
In a military cooperation

835
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:44,288
Their battle plans call for the British army to guard their entire line we talked about

836
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,640
Align the French military line runs from Switzerland in the south

837
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
To Belgium in the North

838
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
Millions of men

839
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
In multiple arms

840
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
And by the way on the other side of the board of the Germans have the same thing

841
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
First time in human history

842
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,696
Did you had millions of men squaring off against millions of men

843
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
But the French

844
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
Left Flank

845
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,608
Is counting on having the British army there to Anchorage

846
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
That agreement

847
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,264
Has less paperwork attached to it than you would normally generate when you buy a house

848
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
For all intents and purposes as we said it's a handshake

849
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,784
Handshake deal that we will go to war with you if War breaks out and a handshake deal with only one government in a

850
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
Country where government can come and go

851
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
And we're public opinion isn't Unified

852
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
A nation that

853
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,976
You had centuries

854
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Use of antagonistic history with

855
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,584
And only like 5 or 8 years of

856
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
Your friendly cooperation

857
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
What's more when Britain gets into this war

858
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
And then the first thing that the British people here is we're going to send the troops that would defend us if the Germans decide to land on our Coast

859
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Flying to France

860
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,503
A question over how many troops to spare eventually the bef

861
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
We'll get two friends

862
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
With 70

863
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Thousand men

864
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
Five divisions

865
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
For Infantry

866
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
1 calorie

867
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
To give you an idea

868
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
I'm with 70000 manner

869
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
Five divisions means on this front

870
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
The Germans are

871
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Deploying

872
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,543
Like 85 divisions on the Western Front

873
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,991
70000 man seems like nothing that's the tiny little you know it's the army of a sea power isn't it that's the

874
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
Tiny little Force

875
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,927
That Bismarck a generation before that iron in blood German Diplomat had famously said when one of his aides and what are they

876
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
Lander Army on Arcos he says then I'll have them arrested

877
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
This is the army that was so small you can joke

878
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
About a resting

879
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,191
But here's the difference unlike all the other major armies of

880
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Participants in this war

881
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
The British army or professional

882
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Long

883
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Standing

884
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Regular for

885
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
With a lot of people in the

886
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
Especially the noncommissioned officer ranks who were life

887
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,623
First and who win this war started immediately called up there reservist

888
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:11,487
Guys who serve 10 15 20 years before had fought in places like

889
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
South Africa in the Boer War and they

890
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Turn of the century

891
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
The institutional memory

892
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
Of these units

893
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Was deep

894
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Quality Inn

895
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
These forces was in

896
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Tents that used to have

897
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,383
Unlimited Marksman practice and get financial rewards for

898
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
The Winning Edge

899
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:34,783
Did actually in a lot of the people in these units fought in actual combat with modern weapons

900
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,903
My favorite Source from this early. Is an Irishman

901
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
Who's actually fighting in the bet

902
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Name is John Lucy

903
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
And he's one of the few British side

904
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,447
Reporters I guess you could call him he's a soldier who writes from this very early.

905
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
Because he was right in the first wave

906
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
And he explains

907
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,431
You know the difference between his unit and the rest of the Continental troops and he does so in a very chauvinistic

908
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
Very proud fashion

909
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
But he claims

910
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Quote

911
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,903
The British Army in 1914 was more used to battle than that of any other Nation

912
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,767
He possessed the highest and bravest Traditions that can be engendered in a fighting force

913
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,071
And it's experience of wars with such

914
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,423
That our own regiment though a young one in the Army had so many battle honors

915
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
But they were difficult to memorize

916
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
And quote

917
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Bajan lose he's only 20

918
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,175
He didn't have a long service history under his belt but when the reservists arrive

919
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
He watches

920
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,807
Men who appear to be just regular folks off the street transform themselves

921
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
Into grizzled British veteran

922
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Quote

923
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,487
Are reservists came streaming in to make up our war strength

924
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,047
Cheerful careless fellows of all time

925
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
Some in bowler hats and smart suitings

926
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,447
Others in descending scale down to the Garb of tramps

927
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
Soon like us

928
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,055
They were uniformed and equipped with field kits

929
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
And the change was remarkable

930
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,455
Smart sergeants and corporals in beer ribbon Veterans of the South African War

931
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
Hatched out of that crowd of nondescript civilians

932
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,111
And took their place in duties as if they had never left the army

933
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
They were an excellent block

934
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
But their numbers increased our strength to an uncomfortable extend

935
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
And quote

936
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,095
What John was he found to be an uncomfortable

937
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Increasing of

938
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Numbers

939
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,983
When they arrived at the continents seem like a tiny little Trickle

940
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
British soldier

941
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
But the quality of this Army that came to be known as the old

942
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Contemptibles

943
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Was of the

944
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Higher level

945
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
Matching the top German unit

946
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
It was ironically

947
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
Under the command of a British general

948
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Name French

949
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
Cooking very much like the

950
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
Sir John French will lead

951
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
The bef

952
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
The British Expedition

953
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
On the continent

954
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Just in time to

955
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
Play their historic role

956
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
In what Sir Arthur

957
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Conan Doyle

958
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Called

959
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
The most terrible August in the history of the world

960
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
To be involved

961
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
In several battles

962
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
That are all called

963
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
The battle of the front

964
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
There's a bunch of little battles

965
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
That are all

966
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Wrapped up into this

967
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,975
One big event called the battle of the

968
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
The Frontiers

969
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
What really means it is

970
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,375
All the fighting that was going on along this front and there are several

971
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,959
Perry's encounter thrust it go on

972
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,311
I'm going to spend a little bit more time than I normally plan to for the rest of

973
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
The series on this battle because this

974
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Battle of the Frontiers is in so many ways

975
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
The most interesting

976
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
Moment of this war

977
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
First of all

978
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
It's what we talked about for a episode and a half

979
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,671
Now it's the Rubber meets the road MoMA

980
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
The testing moment

981
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,559
For all this military Theory and hypothesis it's been happening

982
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
In some cases

983
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Over the last hundred years

984
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
You get to see

985
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
If people

986
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:09,823
Assumptions about a distant weapon system would work or that tactic would fare

987
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
You get to see you know which of those

988
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Turn out to be correct and which ones don't

989
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
And

990
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
A lot of the time these armies will go into combat

991
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
Hamstrung

992
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
By decisions that were made a decade before

993
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Terms of

994
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
What's the Army's doctrines going to be

995
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,207
For the tactics or how they're going to be

996
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,511
You know dressed and equipped let me take the French

997
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,095
The French will go into this Modern War and it is almost

998
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,191
Impossible to understand this today cuz if there's a ludicrousness to it

999
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
That shows off

1000
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
Another century

1001
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335
You want to see the 19 century class

1002
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,175
With the twentieth century it happens in this battle of the Frontiers in August

1003
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
14

1004
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,527
The French go into combat with almost the exact same uniform

1005
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
The Grandfather's war in 80

1006
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
70

1007
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
A blue jacket with tails

1008
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
WYD

1009
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Red

1010
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,279
Pants that look like targets

1011
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
And acted like it too

1012
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,143
Their officers would have

1013
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
White

1014
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,727
Hats and white gloves I mean again targets

1015
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
They will send the Cavalry to go fight

1016
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
That look like

1017
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,687
When you can go look at your history book in 1914 and they often have pictures of his cavalry

1018
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
I told my friend who was always asking

1019
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
We know how to love to see a picture of Napoleon's cuirassier

1020
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
You know his famous Cavalry with the

1021
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
Breastplates in the horsehair plumed helmets

1022
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
You know when the Sabres in the whole thing I said you don't have to

1023
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:36,863
Wish for a picture of Napoleon's cuirassier they're going off to war in 1914 they look identical

1024
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
Armor and all

1025
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,079
That's the old world going off to war and you can see it visually

1026
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Think of how

1027
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,199
The French soldiers hamstrung by that

1028
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
The British have been using khaki

1029
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
You know for themselves

1030
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Since the colonial wars

1031
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
In the 1880s

1032
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
Aren't you going to go into this war

1033
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Looking like

1034
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
Walking

1035
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Peacock

1036
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Tana French soldiers

1037
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,447
The price for that still pay the price for not having much of the way of heavy artillery to again

1038
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
These were all ideas that you could logically backup

1039
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,615
The French decided they wanted to have more mobile Army so we don't need that big heavy cumbersome

1040
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,967
Maslow artillery to slow it down by the time that gets anywhere the battles going to be over anyway

1041
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Sounds great

1042
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
In theory

1043
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Till you try it

1044
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,623
And you find out your soldiers are in terrible trouble on the actual Battlefield

1045
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
Cuz they don't have any heavy artillery

1046
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
There's a reputation

1047
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
Can the French have military in the United States

1048
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,119
But it is inordinately influenced by the way the Second World War

1049
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,167
I always try to tell people

1050
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
You misunderstand France's military

1051
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Reputation.

1052
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
Casper hundreds of years

1053
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,383
They're considered one of the finest if not the finest land army in the world

1054
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
A hundred years before this time

1055
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
A little Corsican guy is using you know especially as the hardcore his armies to conquer the majority

1056
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
Give the world that mattered at this time

1057
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
And the one that

1058
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
Only the rest of the majority of the world is colonies

1059
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Did it with French troops

1060
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
They will often

1061
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Heroically

1062
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,983
Throw their lives down to try to overcome these deficiencies that they enter war with

1063
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
I think you could make it

1064
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
EK sedan all three War

1065
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,127
3 over 75 years the French and Germans fought with

1066
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
1870 to 1945

1067
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,527
At the average French soldier on the ground was hamstrung by his leadership

1068
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
In all three of those cops

1069
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,391
In the second world war and historically tragically

1070
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
But I would

1071
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,255
Suggest that the war out of those three

1072
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
In which French leadership

1073
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Perform the best

1074
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
Was in the first World War

1075
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
There are a bunch of different General

1076
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
Think second world war France

1077
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
Would have given their right arm

1078
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Led by

1079
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
A guy who is icon

1080
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
I always thought of him is like

1081
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
The French Churchill

1082
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
In what Churchill was to Britain in the second world war this guy is to France in the first

1083
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,671
And he has all these same stereotypically interesting anecdotes and characteristics The Churchill had been

1084
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Instead of them being stereotypically British

1085
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
Is Churchill's work

1086
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,791
Are stereotypically golf

1087
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
French

1088
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,423
You know Churchill had this thing with alcohol that was part of his image and part of the fun

1089
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
With this guy its food

1090
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,055
And that's because it fits perfectly with his physical

1091
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Sort of

1092
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
Image kiss you

1093
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
In every way

1094
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
He's tall

1095
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
He's fat

1096
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,807
Got a giant bushy white mustache in a plastic look on his face all the time

1097
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
Chakra

1098
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
If I mispronounce that

1099
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Again

1100
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
It's going to be the first of many my apologies

1101
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Still

1102
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,791
You're the lion of France

1103
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
A lot of French house

1104
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Interesting

1105
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:55,007
You know I've read a significant amount on this person and I'm not sure I understand him any better

1106
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,847
The before I started and once more I'm not sure these authors did either

1107
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
He is like a novel

1108
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Desk

1109
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
He is imperturbable good luck scratching the surface of figuring out what you have there and even is contempt

1110
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
One thing when you read quotes

1111
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,695
The people who knew him say about him is one they they say different

1112
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
+ 2

1113
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
Sometimes they didn't know

1114
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
What this guy was up

1115
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
2 min

1116
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
And sometimes you look at something and you wonder if he's just a little doll or slow or receive you know Sly like a fox and just hide

1117
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,335
And every time it's it's he's an interesting guy you could produce guy a long time

1118
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
And I'm still not

1119
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
Really get a good idea about what you're dealing

1120
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
The one thing you can say about him

1121
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Is

1122
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
He's got one of those qualities of generalship to

1123
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:43,135
It's just going to be a perfect match for what's needed at the time

1124
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
And I've always said that

1125
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,767
The generalship is absolutely an art and in the same way that art

1126
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,583
Tennessee's the manifestation of the artist

1127
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Personality so dope Translate

1128
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
Light it and its own unique waiting in the art form

1129
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
General ship is like that

1130
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Tattoo

1131
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
You can see all these different

1132
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
Kinds of generals wall have

1133
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
These different kinds of personalities

1134
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
And they come in that

1135
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,991
The key is to try to find your strengths and then

1136
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,343
In a figure out a way to make those drinks work for you on the battlefield take for example

1137
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
He's really aggressive

1138
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,719
These quick thinking hard pushing dashing sort of guys

1139
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
Presbyterian the famous

1140
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Guy who

1141
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
Basically created the German

1142
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,631
Tank approach in the Second World War

1143
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
He was that kind of guy

1144
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
The guy by the way who's commanding

1145
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,287
The most important Army on the German side in this

1146
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
The sledgehammer head Army first Army

1147
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,919
The guy just like this too hard driving aggressive

1148
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Kind of guy

1149
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,343
That sort of approach is perfect in some situations and in some arms but then he needs a bean-counter guy sometimes.

1150
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,487
That's what Von moltke is either bean-counter he sits there and plan everything out to the nth degree and make sure all that

1151
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,839
T's are crossed and the I's dotted you want of anything I'm those guys are very useful to

1152
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,423
The inspirational General like an Alexander the Great who get out there and

1153
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
Get your troops to perform

1154
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
Benefits of

1155
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,823
Heroism that may be a lesser man or woman couldn't have gotten them

1156
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
There's all these different kinds of General

1157
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,199
Jafra is the kind that doesn't ever go

1158
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
That's what he brings

1159
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
He refuses to pay

1160
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
He's almost

1161
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Frightful

1162
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
In situations

1163
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
But he's about to experience

1164
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:28,863
That they are not only stressful to the point of panic but the perhaps Panic is the right emotion to have

1165
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Are there historians out there

1166
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,031
Who suggest that we should not look at that as such a great quality to bring to the table

1167
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
Because

1168
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,663
It might be Jeffers own shortcomings and some of the other Arts of generalship

1169
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
That made it necessary for there to be a guy who wouldn't panic at the top to begin with wouldn't be

1170
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:51,647
Needing to panic if you'd have been a better player of that blind chess game that we talked about earlier

1171
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,951
And maybe Shoppers not that good at that game

1172
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
Hence the situation becomes

1173
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,839
Panic inducing Hensel leader that's very good at stopping Panic is

1174
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
Just what you needed the time

1175
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Anyway

1176
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
Might be yourself

1177
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
Reinforcing sort of thing

1178
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,983
But I think it's hard to deny

1179
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
The France would have given up

1180
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
A right arm and both legs

1181
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
Used to have this guy in the second row

1182
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:16,991
The reason that this guy is going to be so necessary this imperturbability is going to be so necessary

1183
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:23,391
Is because of how this first round in This heavyweight championship fight that's going to go on for 4 years is going to go

1184
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,255
If you going to use a boxing analogy here for this this going to be a boring fight

1185
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,911
At the fight goes on you know where things slow down to a dull Roar and everybody looking for tactical opportunities in

1186
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
But the first round is wild

1187
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,871
Massive Haymaker swings misses dropping the other guy for you know an 8-count I mean it's going to be a while

1188
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
First round

1189
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
And if you lose your head

1190
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,967
You can lose the war

1191
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:52,831
So having jafra at the at the French High command shows that the French are not going to lose their head

1192
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,111
I can't

1193
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
Help but think about the German

1194
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,303
Von moltke is a very interesting guy in the sense that he almost looks like a guy

1195
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
Who doesn't want to be there

1196
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,519
You know he is the nephew of one of the greatest heroes in German military history it's almost like he went into the fan

1197
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
Family business

1198
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,895
But whereas those guys thought about nothing but War all the time and remember

1199
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:21,247
Sleeping the legendary writer of the Schlieffen Plan is supposed to have died

1200
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:27,647
Still saying stuff about the Schlieffen Plan the last words on his lips are supposedly make sure to keep the right wings

1201
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,463
These are people who have no Hobbies

1202
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
Other than War

1203
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
Von moltke the younger is a guy who famously said that art

1204
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
And I think about this guy

1205
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
In the most

1206
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,239
One of the most stressful positions in all history once this

1207
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Breaks out

1208
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,823
Remember he has no illusions

1209
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,383
About what the stakes are he's the one who famously said

1210
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,943
That the war that he's launching

1211
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,527
Will decide the course of history for the next hundred years

1212
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,343
And it certainly have think of the pressure on that

1213
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
Think about the fact

1214
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,463
That his plan that he's operating with is a terrible Gamble

1215
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,583
And then watch how every flip of the coin so far in this conflict

1216
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
Has gone against them

1217
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:13,983
And if you're judging this fight based on who landed the latest punch

1218
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
Von moltke and the Germans are losing

1219
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
Right from the very beginning

1220
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
I think about the coin flips

1221
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Already happened

1222
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
Think about

1223
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
The Belgium one

1224
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
To begin with

1225
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
I mean you were hoping the

1226
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,647
When you invaded Belgium they just sort of stood by the side of the road and let you go through

1227
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
Maybe would feed you and everything right

1228
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:39,583
You would get that's what that's what your hope would have been a flip of the coin instead the belgians resisted you

1229
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,983
They destroyed the communication and transportation system you were hoping to use and then to make matters worse some of them were shooting at

1230
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,359
That you allegedly but your troops have been executing belgians which makes you look terrible on the world stage

1231
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
So that coin flip the wrong way

1232
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,015
Can you flip the coin again maybe Britain won't get involved when we violate

1233
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,879
The neutrality of Belgium right it's just a scrap of paper is a German Diplomat famously said

1234
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:07,231
Hope that landed on the wrong side of the coin to the British came in you lost that

1235
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,791
Another flip happens

1236
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,143
Starting on August 15th and the timetable going to get weird now.

1237
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:19,519
Because their stuff happening on multiple fronts that overlap with each other cuz while this is going on

1238
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,919
I know the first Maneuvers are going on in the west to but but on the 15th of August if your Von moltke watching how your

1239
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:31,295
Your planned attack is is going and you haven't even gotten your Sledgehammer head through Belgium yet

1240
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:36,927
So you're still a ways away from your attack doing anything but you got things starting to collapse around you

1241
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
On August 15th

1242
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,231
Discern

1243
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
Remember this is a moderate

1244
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
Fighting a great power you know some Serbian gunman killed the Austrian Archduke and that's why we're here

1245
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,311
Right when the one thing everyone was sure about is that no matter what happens in this conflict Serbia is going to get there but

1246
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:58,175
Cuz they're fighting Austria-Hungary is right next door and their Global power

1247
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
The austro-hungarian they're camped out

1248
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:05,599
Put him on a hillside by a river on on the 15th of August a hundred eighty thousand storms attack them

1249
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
The austro-hungarian Army has

1250
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
1000 people

1251
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Headed

1252
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,767
It's morale just collapse

1253
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,839
We told you before the serbs are one of those people

1254
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:20,703
Historically who in the military sense kind of punch above their weight glass

1255
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
They're ferocious Fighters

1256
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,567
They're aggressive aggressively LED

1257
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,943
And the austro-hungarian forces were apparently more riddled with problems than anyone knew

1258
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
And a lot of them will drown

1259
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,783
Routing across this River

1260
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,623
Pursued closely by 180000 Serbia

1261
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Sentry Army

1262
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,487
Think about what this does if you're Von moltke

1263
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,023
Got in terms of stress

1264
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:51,935
Because you're hoping that the austro-hungarians can help you keep the Russians off your neck until you're done

1265
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,079
In France remember you got to deal with enemies on each side of you you're hoping your ally right there is going to be able to help

1266
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,407
And yet they just got their tail kit

1267
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:05,503
I am moderate-sized power what's going to happen when they pay

1268
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
And then

1269
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
On the 17th

1270
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Of August

1271
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975
The biggest disaster at all

1272
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Von moltke

1273
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,559
And the Russians arrive

1274
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Early

1275
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,167
Talk about flipping the coin before the war assuming

1276
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,239
You can get all the stuff done before the Russians mobilize

1277
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
And then they mobilize

1278
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Early

1279
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,847
So by August 17th

1280
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,639
Are mochas has problems

1281
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Everywhere

1282
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,455
Where an enemy becomes a real question

1283
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Whether or not

1284
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
He's ever going to be able to use his War winning sledgehammer

1285
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
Because maybe he'll have lost the war everywhere else

1286
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:49,279
Before that even writing you can read from this time. 1914 to think that the war's almost already over

1287
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,375
Meanwhile on the 14th of August

1288
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
Jafra in the French launched an attack of the alsace-lorraine

1289
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
The first

1290
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Realtor

1291
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,847
They sent a token force in there on the 7th of August

1292
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
What you see

1293
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,175
Remember 7th of August is 4 days

1294
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
France Germany

1295
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
Declare war they send a token force in there

1296
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
It would messages from the French

1297
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
Leadership about

1298
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
Still here we're home you're back in the bosom of France all these wonderful things kisses picnic baskets flowers wine the whole deal

1299
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
In a welcome with open arms

1300
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,559
And then all of a sudden

1301
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
Little token Force

1302
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:28,447
With the roses and wine and everything has to run back across the French border because

1303
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,751
The German Force that's nearby is not a toy

1304
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Enforce

1305
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
On August 14th

1306
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:37,407
The day before the serbs smash that austro-hungarian army

1307
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,223
That's so discomforts Von mulka

1308
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
The French launch two armies

1309
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,063
Alsace-lorraine and it's serious

1310
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,087
Now it's on

1311
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Now we have

1312
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:51,231
Two of the best armies in the world clashing head-on with significant numbers of

1313
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,535
Anna French push the Germans back

1314
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
And the next day

1315
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
Play pushing back again

1316
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
And then the next day they pushing

1317
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Now

1318
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
It should be noted

1319
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,871
That while the rest of the world thinks this looks like just one more disaster for Germany side

1320
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:14,271
We have all these other problems that Russians are already in East Prussia and now look at the French the first time they launch a significant the tactic Germans are

1321
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Backing up

1322
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,879
But that's one thing I'm sure Von multa wasn't stressed

1323
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,463
Because that retreat by the Germans was all

1324
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
The Germans of course

1325
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
For decades new the French wood

1326
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Involve

1327
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:36,031
Alsace-lorraine in any war effort and so they put troops there who had orders to

1328
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
Retire

1329
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
Did you sort of keep the French engaged

1330
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,223
But move backwards as they move forward let them even into Germany

1331
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
Shoot them as they're pursuing you

1332
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Take your

1333
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,671
Toll on them if they're pursuing you but retire in good order take

1334
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Your guns with you

1335
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
I just sort of

1336
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
Pull them away from

1337
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,047
All the parts of the war that

1338
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
UC

1339
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,727
When the French figure out about the sledgehammer of also compared it to a door on a hinge

1340
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:11,615
Idiom all these German Army stretching from the Swiss border all the way up to Belgium and most of them are just there to keep

1341
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
Keep the French occupy

1342
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,991
The damage that's going to be done is going to be done by that door

1343
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
Soda in Belgium and Lux

1344
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
Convert

1345
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,855
Swings closed

1346
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
On top of the French Nation

1347
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,231
The other German Army's job is to keep the French in front of the monkey

1348
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
They can't turn around

1349
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,839
And move in a different direction and do anything

1350
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:37,471
But hammer and those French armies way down south in Alsace and Lorraine with your down by the Swiss border

1351
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:41,311
That you're pursuing German armies back into the interior of Germany

1352
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
Are just getting

1353
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Farther

1354
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,127
And farther away

1355
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
From where they can help

1356
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:49,503
Once the French realize they need every army they can get their hands on

1357
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
To deal with that

1358
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,551
Threat so

1359
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
Anmol cuz not upset about

1360
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
This is part of the deal

1361
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,439
And that starts on August 14

1362
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
1560

1363
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
17th Ave

1364
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
Continues the Russians are in East Prussia now

1365
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,095
The austrians have been defeated on their front

1366
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,703
Since the 7th of August but really big on the 11th and 12th of August

1367
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
The British expeditionary Force has been arrived

1368
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Driving on the car

1369
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,615
They keep saying they're not going to be ready to fight until maybe the 26th of August

1370
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,175
But the French would like them there sooner

1371
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
One Frenchman in particular

1372
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
Is desperate

1373
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,295
The pretty show up as early as possible

1374
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,111
This is the French General who is commanding

1375
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,671
The Army on France's Left Flank

1376
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
Bright

1377
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
The last

1378
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Army

1379
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,303
You know it's kind of facing sort of Belgium

1380
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
Where if you look to your right they've got

1381
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,703
Several armies millions of men all the way down to the Swiss border

1382
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,799
Totally protected from anybody penetrating our ranks and hitting Us in the flank

1383
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,871
What is that 5th Army under General name lanrezac

1384
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
Looks to the left

1385
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,943
Looks North

1386
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,479
There's nobody there

1387
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
Is open land

1388
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,927
Is maneuvering room for an enemy to get around his flanks and destroy him and roll the whole French line

1389
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
Turn up all the way down to switch

1390
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
So he's got a vested interest

1391
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
And being aware

1392
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,399
How many potential threats out there cuz he's going to take it in the flank

1393
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,751
In which one shows up and he perceives even before the war start

1394
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
She sending messages in July

1395
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,919
Did you offer saying we can all signs point to a German Advance through Belgium basic

1396
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,503
Which is one reason you knew the high command knew about

1397
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,295
That they just nobody knew how big it was

1398
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
Does General and rezac keep telling them

1399
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,183
Every couple of days he's sending messages to the high command going

1400
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,975
Uno latest reports are

1401
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:39,583
Oregon huge attacking me basically the way history will vindicate this guy

1402
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
Is he correctly perceives the power

1403
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,471
And destination of this German law

1404
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,519
Long before anyone else

1405
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,359
And one of the historical what-ifs in this time.

1406
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,687
Is one of Jeff read taking what he was saying seriously sooner

1407
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,735
Again maybe you don't need

1408
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
To be such a wonderful

1409
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,183
Stability Factor when Panic is all around you if you don't make a mistake like not listening to this General

1410
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,255
It would create the Panic inducing situation to begin with

1411
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
Jafra basically think the guy is panicking

1412
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,423
And then he starts saying you know as it becomes apparent that something is moving

1413
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Belgium Emil sports are going

1414
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Turn down

1415
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,895
He starts thinking this is going to be a good thing for the same reason is a good thing for the Germans to have those French go through alsace-lorraine and keep

1416
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,943
Advancing away from where the action is going to be

1417
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:33,087
Jeanfreau's ideas listen even if the Germans are going through Belgium with a large Force

1418
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
All the better

1419
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:39,743
Our plans going to be the cut that large Force off of this is a swinging gate or door

1420
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
We will hit it at the hinge

1421
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:46,655
And then we will roll up behind it all the way up to the water you know in the

1422
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:53,055
In the North Sea of the English Channel right there and then you're cut off and then this wonderful Luna Sledgehammer blow

1423
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
Becomes the surrounded

1424
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
Entrapped cream of your army

1425
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,223
So he turned a negative into a positive and basically would tell

1426
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
When rejected

1427
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
You have nothing to worry

1428
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,831
1 rezac.

1429
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Different

1430
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,647
I figured his chances would be

1431
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Improve

1432
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
Get that British force would hurry up

1433
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
And come up on his left

1434
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,351
So that even though the British might have an open left blank he wouldn't have one

1435
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
And

1436
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
It's at that

1437
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
Point

1438
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
Did the Battle of the Frontiers bro

1439
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,871
The battle of the Frontiers

1440
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
Is named that because it's

1441
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,735
The time where the general eruption of violence

1442
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,551
I'm On the franco-german Border hat

1443
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,135
And there are a lot of different encounters that are all

1444
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:44,255
A part of this larger, is essentially there is an umbrella term that covers all the viola

1445
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
On the franco-german

1446
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
Almost

1447
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
And it turns out to be

1448
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
A really important thing for the German war effort

1449
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
But it did

1450
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Because

1451
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,847
You know by about August 19th

1452
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,151
The German situation really is bad

1453
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,735
You said earlier but things have even gotten worse those Russians in East Prussia

1454
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,855
And it showing up sooner than expected had defeated some German forces that went out and try to deal with them

1455
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
All of a sudden it looks like that flight might be collapsing

1456
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,975
It's hard to get real excited about anything if you're molka

1457
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,255
Who's nickname

1458
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,351
Given to him by the Kaiser was something that translates loosely

1459
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,399
Too gloomy Gus

1460
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Anyway

1461
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
Not exactly

1462
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Optimus anyway

1463
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,031
He couldn't have been feeling too good about the situation

1464
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,567
On the 19th or 20

1465
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,151
He receives a request from one of his Generals in the feet

1466
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,967
It's the guy who is retreating

1467
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:41,343
From all those French forces retiring in good order taking his guns with them instead of drawing them away from the action

1468
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,743
He's one of the wonderful German royalty that part of this this isn't often the second where we didn't have

1469
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,791
We have all these guys like

1470
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,583
Prince Rupert

1471
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,863
Avaria

1472
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,399
And He commands

1473
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,447
The force is retreating

1474
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
He doesn't like retreating

1475
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:04,127
You don't get a lot of medals for retreating it's not exactly what he was hoping to do with an Army in this war

1476
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
Wework West

1477
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,199
Devon molca can I attack

1478
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,319
Now this goes against the idea what he supposed to do right he's the retreat or he

1479
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,135
He pulls his French Force away from where the sledgehammers going to hit

1480
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,183
What makes a pretty good case

1481
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,975
These French or ask

1482
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Can for it

1483
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
They're sitting ducks

1484
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:28,447
They've been sort of like getting more and more disordered and strung out after days of pursuit

1485
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,519
Doing nothing we've been shooting them with artillery and weakening them

1486
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,335
They're ripe for a Counterattack will crush them

1487
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,407
And this is one of several into

1488
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
It will happen

1489
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
Literally in the next few days

1490
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:44,831
Did some historians have pointed to four years at the moment when the Germans lost the war

1491
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
In this case

1492
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:51,999
Some historians say that mold cause response to Crown Prince rupprecht of Bavaria

1493
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
Lost in the war

1494
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
He told

1495
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Group rate

1496
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
He could Counterattack the

1497
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
4 strong out

1498
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Disorganized

1499
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
On August 20

1500
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
He dies

1501
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Now

1502
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
This is the time

1503
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,759
Where you get to see

1504
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
Perhaps from a soldier's perspective

1505
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,647
The thing that had changed battle and warfare the most

1506
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Really come into its own

1507
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
Machine guns made a huge dick

1508
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:28,863
Make no mistake about it and there were a lot of things that seem relatively benign when you look at them that maybe

1509
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Huge difference

1510
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,423
Just to like barbed wire

1511
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:36,031
What the element the technology in land Warfare had altered the most

1512
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
In terms of

1513
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,895
Something that would change the face of warfare and however

1514
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,455
Was fought and experienced by human beings on the ground

1515
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,991
Artillery

1516
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
Had come

1517
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Leaps and Bounds

1518
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
Beyond anything anyone

1519
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
Unexpected

1520
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
And it's artillery

1521
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
Did on August 20th

1522
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,463
It's the French

1523
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,511
When they're still in

1524
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
Tie column

1525
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
Marching

1526
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
And mustering

1527
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,911
And just sitting around I mean later in the war

1528
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,935
Ernst Junger

1529
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,239
German Soldier will write about

1530
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,031
The effect on a shell

1531
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,871
One single artillery shell Landing in a group of people that were just

1532
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,919
You're sitting around in a town square

1533
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
150

1534
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
Soldier comrade

1535
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,295
And you said the one she'll killed 70th

1536
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,063
Give them outright

1537
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,135
Now imagine if you're in March column right

1538
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Gathered around us

1539
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
A mess

1540
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,231
Center or

1541
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
Taking a

1542
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Religious

1543
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,399
Service in in the field or whatever when you're closely match with your buddies

1544
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
And then modern artillery

1545
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
And remember

1546
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,127
Part of this is the technology of the guns the other part of it is the science and engineering that goes into

1547
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:50,527
You're making artillery effective not your shooting a gun up in the air but you should see that the scientific calculator

1548
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:55,647
Soldiers on the grounds of the mathematics they had to do to make sure that everything was found in the right way and everything

1549
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
And that really differentiated by the way

1550
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,047
The good armies from the last good army the Russians had a ton of artillery

1551
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
Didn't have good engineering people

1552
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
Shooting it was often inaccurate and not effective

1553
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
The British and the French and the Germans had

1554
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
Exceptional

1555
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
Working their artillery numbers very effective

1556
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,823
And the German artillery was bigger

1557
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,151
And better than anything that the French had this is where they find out

1558
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:22,527
That idea that light mobile 75 millimeter artillery getting the job done in every situation

1559
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
Was horribly

1560
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,319
Flawed

1561
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,087
In fact

1562
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
It was outraged by the German pieces

1563
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
The Germans could hit it

1564
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,207
When they couldn't get the charm

1565
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
When the German Army under

1566
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
From Prince Rupert

1567
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
It's

1568
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
The French in accounting

1569
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,351
Attack on August 20th

1570
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,631
The artillery

1571
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
As historian

1572
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
Eric Brouse right

1573
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
It's quote

1574
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
The first Furious fighting

1575
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,103
Occurred in southern Lorain

1576
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,503
Where the French second Army having progressed 35km was hit at morang by the Germans six.

1577
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,575
Counterattack with Superior artillery fire

1578
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,159
From 105 mm and 150 mm howitzer

1579
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
The Mirage crushed

1580
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,767
Second Army formations that were assembling in tight rank

1581
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,583
For the day's March forcing it to flee

1582
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,423
And thereby compelling and exposed first Army to retreat as well

1583
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
And quote

1584
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,775
Now what Bros is talking about there is

1585
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,335
When the Germans crushed the French second Army

1586
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
And it has to retreat

1587
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,175
It creates a hole in the line

1588
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:27,551
And that's the most dangerous thing for any of these armies they want to maintain maintain an Unbroken

1589
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,903
Because if there are places that can be penetrated by enemy forces

1590
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,207
Those forces can move into those gaps

1591
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
And then if they turn right

1592
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
We're turn left

1593
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,303
They're eating another Army in

1594
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Terribly vulnerable

1595
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,447
Or they could continue to go deeper into the interior and strike at Logistics

1596
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
And supply

1597
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
Andrea Reyes

1598
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,311
I mean the whole point is don't allow

1599
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:53,151
You know what Gap to open up in your line and do whatever you can

1600
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
To create

1601
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,455
Or exploit

1602
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,015
You know your enemy doing something like that with air forces

1603
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
So when second Army gets

1604
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:05,183
Smashed and Haster Retreat backwards first Army has to go with him

1605
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,767
Just to make sure that the line stays unbroken and nobody can get

1606
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,791
Indoor interior

1607
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
Now

1608
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,167
There's a lot of different things you might be able to draw conclusion why

1609
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
What happened

1610
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
You know in Alsace and Lorraine

1611
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
Armies were hit by the Germans

1612
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
Jennifer decided

1613
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,127
That this allowed him to see where the Germans were we

1614
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:28,479
As mentioned earlier this is about playing chess without knowing

1615
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
You know where the other guys pieces are

1616
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:36,415
Part of what Shoppers got to do as a commander has some detective work he has a rough idea how many

1617
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,487
Forces the Germans have if he can identify

1618
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:43,327
You know where those forces are he can start to figure out where the rest are

1619
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,119
He figures if he's

1620
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,399
Getting so hammered

1621
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
Down in the south on August 20th

1622
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
And

1623
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
If he believed that General on his flank V army General that keeps telling in the Germans are making a major effort

1624
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:56,895
Belgium

1625
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,199
Where are all those troops coming from

1626
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
They have to be pulled from somewhere

1627
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
Hopper figure

1628
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,551
The Germans are weak

1629
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
At that point

1630
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,135
He decided that they have been pulled from the German Centre

1631
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,047
So they're strong down in alsace-lorraine by Switzerland the strong up in Belgium would have knocked down those Sports in there

1632
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,119
They're coming at us like a door on a hinge so they're weak in the middle

1633
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,655
Jennifer made a major mistake

1634
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,495
And the major mistake was assuming the Germans would treat

1635
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,799
The reserve forces the same way the French dip

1636
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:30,175
The reserve forces are those forces that are not as competent not as highly trained as the regular military

1637
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
French practice with those forces

1638
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
What's to keep them in the reserve

1639
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,903
Keep them back away from the action you use them to support people when you need more troops thrown in

1640
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,743
But don't put them anywhere vulnerable you could lose the war with an experience

1641
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,559
You're not up to standard troops like that

1642
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
German

1643
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
Totally integrate

1644
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:51,167
Did the reserves and their armies any plan for this for a long time

1645
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,007
They were using all their Reserves

1646
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:58,847
So they had greater numbers actually involved in all these combat

1647
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
Then Jeffers estimation

1648
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
And this will cost him dearly

1649
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
When he attacks the center of the German line

1650
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
In a battle of

1651
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Frontiers

1652
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
On August 20

1653
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
XXII

1654
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
In the center

1655
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,791
Is a weird area because if the left is up by Belgium in the right is down by in alsace-lorraine in Switzerland

1656
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,119
The Sinner is the part where the terrain is hard to fight in

1657
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
You know the

1658
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:28,287
Giant ardenne forest is there and it's hilly terrain with not a lot of Roads difficult country right

1659
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:32,895
The same country that everyone was so shocked when the Germans came through it with tanks

1660
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,711
In the second world war cuz it was thought to be impenetrable

1661
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,759
In the first World War

1662
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,807
That's where he's your friend decides to attack

1663
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,111
Cuz he's determined that they must the Germans must be weak

1664
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
What's more

1665
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,487
This is how he's going to deal now with this Sledgehammer issue

1666
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
If it really exists

1667
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
He's going to cut it off

1668
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:55,679
He's going to launch his attack at the German center right with that hingepoint is with a door swing

1669
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:01,567
Between the forces of the Germans that move and the forces of the Germans that stay stationary they should be at Gap

1670
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Mash Brew there

1671
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,687
Get behind them drive all the way up until you hit

1672
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,783
You know the North Sea or the English Channel and cut off that Sledgehammer head

1673
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
It's not a bad idea

1674
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
You can make it work it's like Judo

1675
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,303
He just took that great enemy advantage of so many good troops in one location or like a steamroller

1676
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
I'm turned it into a negative

1677
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,119
I could now you going to cut off

1678
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,679
The best part of the enemy Army surrounded in Chile

1679
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,495
In one place it's a great idea if you can make it work

1680
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
The French were totally in cave

1681
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
Making something like

1682
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,431
Because they hadn't learned what kind of War they were in yet

1683
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:45,087
That's what the battle of the Frontiers is going to be this first round of this fight where it where everybody's throwing Haymakers and getting some

1684
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,647
Smacked on the job going to teach a lot of lessons to people

1685
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
Jafra will fire

1686
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
More generals

1687
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,839
In this first month of the war than anybody ever fired in history and a lot of the other military Hulu similar things

1688
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:00,447
Because this is where we find out which generals can really fight in Wartime

1689
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,263
And which ones are more peacetime kind of generals

1690
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
And within a couple of months

1691
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
You'll have much more competent people

1692
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,455
You know at 8 at the helm in a lot of places which makes it a little less pain I mean right now

1693
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
It's

1694
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,807
The wild west out here and you have all kinds of different quality

1695
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,111
Do people take the Russian generals

1696
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,159
That we're going to deal with in a minute I mean

1697
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
If there's

1698
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
Variable Quality Inn

1699
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
This becomes a real

1700
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,303
Live-fire test for a lot of these people

1701
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,143
On the 21st

1702
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Of August

1703
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
On the 22nd of August

1704
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,519
Jumper launches his big offensive

1705
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
In the ardenne

1706
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,407
He assumes he's running into an inferior number of German forces

1707
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Calculations

1708
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,039
He's instead walking into a situation where he's facing almost

1709
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Equal

1710
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
Numbers of Truth

1711
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
Underdog in

1712
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
I'm waiting for

1713
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
And this is where

1714
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
The idea

1715
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,511
Bayonet attack

1716
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,095
And charging machine guns

1717
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,887
And not

1718
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:05,727
Digging in with your red Padme we didn't even mention the fact that none of these are

1719
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
None of them

1720
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,799
Are going into this war with helmets

1721
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,591
There are no helmets for

1722
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
They're wearing caps

1723
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:16,223
Okay you know how many people are going to die because of that mistake

1724
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
This is all kind of win that

1725
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,831
Romance in war

1726
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
It shot down

1727
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:22,879
Literally

1728
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
I mean to people live in 19th century sort of

1729
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,743
Worldview and

1730
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,791
And attitudes about honor and Duty in

1731
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:33,119
And the things that are expected for example officers in the field

1732
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
This idea

1733
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,447
French officers standing up

1734
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
With a sword

1735
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,543
In a white gloves and often the white hat

1736
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
In a storm

1737
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:46,687
Steel in a move that is absolutely suicidal and those Brave

1738
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,503
People must have known it imagine how the soul

1739
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Give conflicted annoying

1740
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
To do your duty

1741
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,623
And live up to the standards and expectations of your

1742
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
Countries in Europe

1743
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
During this time period

1744
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,231
You were expected to stand up there

1745
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
And

1746
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
Essentially face

1747
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
Sure death

1748
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,911
When you might survive simply by laying on the ground and throw away that white hat and just

1749
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,727
Just kind of the hide behind that tree or whatever it is not permitted

1750
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Is a romance

1751
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
Ansan certain standards

1752
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:16,128
This is a heroic deficit with the Elder Von moltke was talking about

1753
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,944
Recorded earlier we talked about how perpetual

1754
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
Peace was not even a good dream

1755
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:23,296
Because you lose all these wonderful values

1756
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Warfare brings out

1757
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
To him that officer

1758
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:32,256
Those officers those many hundreds of officers dying on these fields and their white gloves

1759
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
Because they wouldn't take cover

1760
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,072
Would you mean something beautiful

1761
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
An adverb

1762
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
Remember he said that

1763
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Quote

1764
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Used

1765
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,544
That in war man's noblest virtues come into play

1766
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,336
Courage and renunciation

1767
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
Fidelity to duty

1768
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,968
And a Readiness for sacrifice that does not stop at giving up life itself

1769
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,600
To him this is like The Charge of the Light Brigade over and over and over again

1770
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
Modern people look at this

1771
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
As foolish

1772
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,536
To wash it's a waste of that officers life and potential

1773
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,096
Use them in a way that will achieve

1774
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,936
A useful and we have to give up his wife sell it more dearly than that

1775
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
Two people

1776
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,752
Of the time.

1777
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,312
The dens really with this war

1778
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,152
There was value in what those officers were doing

1779
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
Simply by Dying Light

1780
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
And upholding the

1781
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
Standards

1782
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,576
You know that they were upholding by doing so

1783
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
A higher

1784
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
Fidelity to duty in Readiness to sacrifice

1785
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
Prices on mobile

1786
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Cassette

1787
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
One of the things that

1788
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,584
This war changes is that hold of you

1789
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,704
The people in 1918 at the end of this war would feel very similar

1790
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
To the way we do

1791
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
About

1792
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,848
Stupid it is to stand up in a hail storm of Steel and just

1793
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
Be a sacrifice your life for nothing

1794
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,736
The generation that does that in 1914 and most of which doesn't make it

1795
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Pictures of War

1796
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040
They have different

1797
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Way of looking

1798
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
An older one

1799
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,672
And that's why this war is often seen

1800
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
As

1801
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
A separation

1802
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
Origin history between one world

1803
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,536
Another

1804
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
The

1805
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,144
Running into this new world

1806
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,936
As part of this attack against

1807
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:19,520
Giant Center of the front through the ardenne forest and everything

1808
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,824
Comes off sounding like a dry affair

1809
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,896
Historians write about it not that they're dry but

1810
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,920
Listen history

1811
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
Sometimes takes

1812
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,504
The emotion in the blood and everything out of it

1813
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
I mean David Stevenson

1814
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,112
Have a great one volume work on the war here's how he died

1815
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,648
Defenses by Jaffa

1816
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,440
And the French to

1817
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,536
In a strike against what is certainly a week German center right

1818
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,328
Pieces quote

1819
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,632
The result was a multiple disaster

1820
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:50,752
The French forces entering the ardenne we're weaker than the Germans in reconnaissance cavalry

1821
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,848
Turn on the morning of 22nd August Mist grounded their aircraft

1822
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:59,200
Groping forward in Echelon along the few roads through the forest

1823
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,760
They blundered not in the weaker forces

1824
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,832
Put into 21 divisions against their own 20

1825
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,928
They're 75 mm field guns were ineffective in the hilly Terrain

1826
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,744
And poorly linked by telephone with the Infantry

1827
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,608
They were no answer to the German machine guns and field Howitzer switch rehab

1828
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,984
What does wreaking havoc mean

1829
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
Historian Peter hearts

1830
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Book on the gray

1831
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,968
And hard himself rights

1832
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
About

1833
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,296
The Stumbling into each other

1834
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
There are these

1835
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
I was in the middle of

1836
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,880
Forested Hills

1837
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Quote

1838
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:45,280
Any battles few people at any level of command had much idea of what was happening

1839
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
And for the troops on the ground

1840
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,864
It was all utterly baffling

1841
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,680
Pre-war tactics seem to have no impact

1842
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Bayonet charges let only the more Slaughter

1843
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,824
What calling up artillery support was often doomed to failure

1844
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
He says

1845
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,944
Quote sometimes the Gunners were too far behind

1846
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Sometimes to close

1847
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,296
Hand caught Under Fire from the longer range German gun

1848
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,088
Whatever the reason he writes

1849
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,904
The Infantry were often left in Desperate Straits

1850
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Funny quotes

1851
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
A captain

1852
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,768
103rd regiment who was caught in

1853
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
George Strait quote

1854
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,608
My company was sustaining heavy losses

1855
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,168
Evidently it's action was hampering the enemy

1856
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:28,288
Who concentrated the combined fire of his infantry artillery and machine guns on us

1857
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,592
We were surrounded by a heavy cloud

1858
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,920
Witcher X completely veiled the battlefield from our eyes

1859
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,712
Middleburg Irish Spring up

1860
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,552
Shouted Vive La France at the top of his voice and fell dead

1861
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:44,160
Among the men lying on the ground one could no longer distinguish the living from the dead

1862
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,232
The first were entirely absolved by their Grim Duty

1863
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
The others my emotions

1864
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,328
The wounded offered a truly impressive sight

1865
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,864
The quote continues

1866
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,400
Sometimes they would stand up

1867
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,192
Bloody and horrible looking

1868
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
Emmett's burst of gunfire

1869
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:03,872
They ran aimlessly around arm stretching out before them eyes staring at the ground

1870
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:09,504
Turning round and round until hit by fresh bullets they would stop and fall heavily

1871
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:16,160
Heart-rending cries agonizing appeals in horrible grounds were intermingled with the Sinister howling app

1872
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Projectiles

1873
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,720
Furious contortions

1874
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,560
Told him strong youthful bodies refusing to give up life

1875
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:27,168
One man was trying to replace his bloody dangling hand was shattered wrist

1876
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:32,032
Another ran from the line holding the bowels falling out of his belly and threw his tattered clothes

1877
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,592
Before long the bullet struck him down

1878
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,408
We had no support from our artillery

1879
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:43,808
I know there were guns in our division and in the Army Corps besides those destroyed on the road where were they why didn't they

1880
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,600
Arrived we were alone

1881
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,136
And quote

1882
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,720
27000

1883
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
Frenchman

1884
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,328
Will die on the 22nd of August

1885
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,704
Many many more will be badly badly wounded maimed and scarf

1886
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,800
Now let's put this in perspective

1887
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,896
A hundred years before this time Napoleon used to brag

1888
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
Opponents

1889
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,712
But you cannot stop me

1890
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,784
I spend 30000 lives a month

1891
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:18,368
As though that was a big deal and back when Napoleon said that it was

1892
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,696
The French had just lost 30000 live

1893
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
That day

1894
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,072
And their contact against the other major Army

1895
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,376
That had precipitated all those deaths

1896
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,400
Has only been at

1897
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,424
About 24 hours

1898
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
Where is Hmong

1899
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
What's tomorrow

1900
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
And the next day

1901
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,616
Already troops were dealing with

1902
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
You know a new phenomenon

1903
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,200
Created by this artillery

1904
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
The bigger heavy guns

1905
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,344
The extra ammunition and the fact that battles are going on for a long time now

1906
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,696
People stay in place for a while me and the people are staying under artillery barrage

1907
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,000
For longer and longer periods of time

1908
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,816
This is a frightfully upsetting experience

1909
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
As you might imagine

1910
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,912
And it begins to drive people insane

1911
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,704
Right as the war

1912
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Starts

1913
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
A French Sergeant wrote in his diary

1914
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,104
Offensives in the yard and on

1915
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
XXII

1916
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
A quote

1917
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,224
The gun's recoil at each shot

1918
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,832
Night is falling and they look like old men sticking out their tongues and Spitting Fire

1919
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,112
Heaps of corpses

1920
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,696
French and German are lying Every Witch Way rifles in hand

1921
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,768
Rain is falling shells are screaming and bursting

1922
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
Shells all the time

1923
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
Artillery fire is the worst

1924
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,656
I lay all night listening to the wounded Groening

1925
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,680
Somewhere German

1926
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,472
The cannonading goes on

1927
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:41,056
Whenever it stops we hear the wounded crying from all over the woods

1928
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
Two or three men go mad everyday

1929
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
And quote

1930
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,528
Man who turned out to be one of France's greatest

1931
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Public figures in the twenties

1932
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Century

1933
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
Was that these bottles to

1934
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,952
It been indoctrinated like everyone else in the romance

1935
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,024
And a heroism the ideas of the bayonet charge

1936
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,328
And the offensive and all these military

1937
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,376
Ideas from another age

1938
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,424
It took him one bottle

1939
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,472
To learn the lessons that it would take

1940
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,056
Commanders on all sides in this war quite a bit longer to learn

1941
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
Lieutenant Charles de Gaulle

1942
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
These battles

1943
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
I need experience in the

1944
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,200
Quote

1945
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,784
Suddenly the enemy's fire became precise and concentrate

1946
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:27,136
Second-by-second the hail of bullets in the Thunder the shells grew stronger

1947
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:32,512
Those who survived lay flat on the ground emits the screaming wounded in the humble Corpses

1948
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
With affected cam

1949
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,608
The officers let themselves be killed

1950
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
Standing upright

1951
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:41,472
Some obstinate platoons stuck their bayonets into their rifles

1952
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,520
Bugle sounded to the charge

1953
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,336
Isolated Heroes made fantastic leaps

1954
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,616
But all to no purpose

1955
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,920
In an instant it to become clear

1956
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
Did not all the courage in the world

1957
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
Could withstand this fire

1958
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
And quote

1959
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,600
The machines that it always been in Port

1960
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
On the battlefields of humankind

1961
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,952
Had to come

1962
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,976
The dominant

1963
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
What had become a tool

1964
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,096
To be used by man was now something

1965
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,424
That was so devastating in the hands of each other

1966
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,240
That the entire ideas about

1967
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,544
Warfare that have been in play

1968
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:20,384
In most societies during most time periods up till this era

1969
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
Are all of a sudden

1970
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
No longer viable

1971
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,040
The battle of the Frontiers

1972
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
In just

1973
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,600
Couple of days

1974
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,928
Manages to completely change the whole complexion of the

1975
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,744
What it seemed to be

1976
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
Leading up to the German defeat

1977
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,328
All of a sudden

1978
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,168
Looks like maybe the Germans are going to win this war

1979
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
And quickly

1980
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:49,824
Nobody expects the French to lose in a couple of days more than 75000 men killed

1981
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,384
And more than 250 thousand wounded

1982
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,664
That

1983
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,736
Everyone but the French especially

1984
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,040
And you have to understand how many people this is

1985
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,576
American Steel

1986
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,112
Celebrate

1987
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
In a morbid sort of way

1988
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,952
The famous Civil War Battle of Antietam

1989
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,024
Famously called the bloodiest day in American history

1990
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Warfare

1991
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
And partly because it's

1992
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,120
Civil War and everybody download

1993
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,472
American but don't casually levels for comparison purposes

1994
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,568
Are about 6000 little less than 6000 dead I think

1995
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,384
A little less than 20000 wounded

1996
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,944
6000 - 20000

1997
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:32,576
Compared to more than 75,000 dead and 260,000 wounded in the first couple of days

1998
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,392
Of action on the Western Front the French were just stunned

1999
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:41,280
And now if you're the German general put yourself in one most issues remember the stress we talked about

2000
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,584
And all of a sudden you are presented with a dilemma

2001
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:50,496
If you just did this to your opponent and you stun them in there on the roads and they look like deer in the headlights for a minute what

2002
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Do you do

2003
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:55,872
Do you stick with the original plan and say listen or not supposed to attack here

2004
01:30:56,128 --> 01:31:00,992
We have the sledgehammer going stick with the sledgehammer and just let the French recover in front of you because

2005
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
It's part of the plan

2006
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,296
Or do you say

2007
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,648
As the uncle of Von moltke so famously did

2008
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:11,488
But no battle plan survives first contact with the Enemy

2009
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,840
And look at this as an opportunity of Battlefield opportunity that presents itself

2010
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,752
Unmute to have to make some decisions here comes another place in the story which historians have argued ever since whether or not he lost the war

2011
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,848
And those who didn't believe you lost it earlier in the story

2012
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,152
I don't believe you lost it here a lot of German generals

2013
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,200
Writing Memoirs after the war you know

2014
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
Needle him about this

2015
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Savage

2016
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,552
Making bad decisions weakening the plan

2017
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,344
What we all have to understand about

2018
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,624
The plan

2019
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
Hasn't some

2020
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Normally thought of

2021
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,768
And some very good modern historians have done a great job of pointing this out

2022
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,840
Is it the plan with probably flawed from the get-go

2023
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:54,496
It was probably never meant to be implemented in the way a lot of these German general for traded and even more important than that

2024
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,664
Evidence seems to show that members of the general staff maybe Von molta included never thought the plan was going to win the war

2025
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Anyway

2026
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:09,344
Which means it becomes your plan for starting the conflict and then once everything is in motion you know you look for opportunities you try to

2027
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,648
Create some you try to exploit French mistakes that's

2028
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,928
Traditional General

2029
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Right

2030
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
What the french are doing on their side

2031
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,328
I'm So Gone Monica make some decisions based on having

2032
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,120
Slam the French so hard

2033
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
He's got

2034
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,704
Prince rupprecht of Bavaria down in the south

2035
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:30,336
Screaming that now that he's pushed the French back all the way to the French border why didn't why didn't you just slam them

2036
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
He could collapse the whole Southern flank and if the whole Southern flank collapses and you still get the northern plant collapsing

2037
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,088
Because of your Sledgehammer my gosh you recreated the battle of cannae

2038
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,368
Like the Romans and

2039
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,440
Hannibal all over again it's Henry generals dream

2040
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,280
A double envelopment a total surrounding I mean

2041
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,096
Yvonne molta were less of an art

2042
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,656
A fanatic and more of a military

2043
01:32:55,168 --> 01:33:01,312
In a hobbyist I would think he would find that irresistible who knows maybe he's just looking for opportunities to

2044
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,616
Outflank French forces as historian David

2045
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,152
Did Stephenson suggest here

2046
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Quote

2047
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,760
Molcas actions at this juncture

2048
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,808
Suggest that he was determined to protect

2049
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,344
Germany's territory

2050
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,648
Weather in East Prussia or Alsace

2051
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,464
But willing to strike wherever the enemy seemed weak

2052
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,024
Rather than staking everything on his right flank

2053
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
And quote

2054
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,400
Oldest taking everything on the right flank idea

2055
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:31,776
Is just what you do with no other better opportunities develop and when Crown Prince rupprecht

2056
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,360
Suggest attacking the French down in the South again

2057
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,920
Mimosa thinks about it and says okay

2058
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,272
And agrees to take some forces that would be used

2059
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,416
To bolster the sledgehammer head and instead use them on the total other side of the flank down south to help

2060
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Rupprecht

2061
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
In his

2062
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,488
Offensive against the

2063
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,512
French in the south

2064
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,328
The plan is now being diluted

2065
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Purest

2066
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,448
Annie maybe right I'm not taking side I'm just saying the traditional ideas

2067
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,752
Molka screwed up the war here now

2068
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:06,592
And some very good historians are saying not at all this is what you were trying to do

2069
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,432
I look for opportunities and exploit them without losing the war elsewhere

2070
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,200
Which

2071
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:15,808
Creates a situation though that molka himself even says after the war was a mistake

2072
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:21,952
Involves his attempts to try not to lose the war elsewhere but again if you put yourself in his position

2073
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:25,536
It's hard not to do this molka looks at the Western Front

2074
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,584
And it looks like it's going pretty well

2075
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:34,496
In the battle of the Frontiers and the end the battle in alsace-lorraine all these things seem to show that the Germans are better than the front

2076
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
As I said in the last episode this is

2077
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,360
In my opinion with the great armies of all time

2078
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:43,456
And what they just showed is that they dominate another grade Army

2079
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:50,112
You know pretty easily if you're on Multi you could sit there look at that and go okay with all of our calculations about the window maybe we don't need sun

2080
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
Dominance in numbers

2081
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,976
Your quality is such that maybe we could get away with taking

2082
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,768
A few troops from here

2083
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,608
I'm taking them to the east because the Russians are taking towns in East Prussia

2084
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
And that's what molt

2085
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
It did

2086
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,496
First he changed the commanders over

2087
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,544
Stack the guys he was having problems with

2088
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,944
And he puts an old retired guy who is more known for the franco-prussian war services and in fact calls him out of retire

2089
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,808
Time is so quickly that he has to put on his old blue uniform cuz he doesn't have one of the newer gray ones

2090
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,112
The blue ones take back to the earlier War

2091
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:26,720
It combines this older retired guy whose name is Hindenburg Paul Von Hindenburg

2092
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:31,328
With the hero from the German point of view of that attack against

2093
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,984
You know the Belgian city of liege in the Fortress there who banged on the door of the Fortress with the hilt of a sword and took the surrender the city

2094
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
Can I buy himself sort of

2095
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,312
Erich ludendorff

2096
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:46,944
Ludendorff and Hindenburg get this job or sent to the east of figure the situation out and then bun Monica

2097
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,272
Sends the Muse troops which you know historians later

2098
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,296
I really needed those troops

2099
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,576
The Western to send them

2100
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
Any Shonda Center

2101
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,136
But he didn't know that

2102
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:00,256
He said after the war was going to be the biggest mistake he shouldn't to send them because it'll turn out there by the time the troops get

2103
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,840
From the West to the east on the trains they're no longer needed

2104
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,424
Now you know I'm not a

2105
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Historian

2106
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,728
Historians

2107
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,544
Debate this and argue about it ever since so who knows

2108
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,848
Maybe we can all take a position on this

2109
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
Looking at it

2110
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:21,760
From the sources that I have looking at Von molcas decision here looks like prudence

2111
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
I'm in the

2112
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:26,624
Russians are taking towns in East Prussia forcing

2113
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,280
The little teeny German forces that are there to retreat it looks like they're going to be threatening Berlin while on the

2114
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,304
The Western Front

2115
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,376
It looks like the force you put there to Simply

2116
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,424
Keep the French occupied

2117
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,496
While the killing Force Maneuvers around their flank

2118
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
May have

2119
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,104
Defeated the French all by themselves what happens when you beat the French

2120
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,640
Before the killing thing even get

2121
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:53,760
And then some one wonders if you can spare a couple of cords for the Eastern Front

2122
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,064
Von moltke supposedly even ask

2123
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,648
One of the commanders of one of the armies that makes up

2124
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
This

2125
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
Sledgehammer

2126
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
Swinging gate thing

2127
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,512
You know that flanking for stats

2128
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
The size of

2129
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:10,912
End of Napoleon's Grand Army or the size of the Roman Empire's complete military the tide

2130
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,008
He asked the Commander II Army Von Bulow can you spare a few core

2131
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,056
For the Easton Von Bulow says yeah

2132
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:22,944
You know what he says yeah in part because he just smashed a French army in front of him during the battle of the Frontiers

2133
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
Which happened to be the poor 5th Army commanded by that one French General who saw the sledgehammer for

2134
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,672
Forming even before the war started for General in Glen Rose

2135
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,816
Because he argues with the high command to let him just shift his army a little bit to protect it

2136
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,376
It's like some historians think he saved Fifth Army

2137
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,912
From Total annihilation

2138
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,960
He does have to retreat though

2139
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,776
Move backwards once again to keep

2140
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:51,872
In line with the rest of the French forces that are retreating sort of all along the line

2141
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,920
Meanwhile

2142
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
Here come the British

2143
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:02,880
Now this is a source of contention and Legend like all this stuff isn't it funny how much of this early war is

2144
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:09,792
But the French have been badgering the British since the beginning of the war to move faster move faster move faster we need someone up here on our left

2145
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,864
Critical rights the French territorial

2146
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:19,008
Units together with your liking old man and reservists and stuff and put them out in the flight just so that there's something out there but

2147
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,800
Against what's coming

2148
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
I mean it's not

2149
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,920
Until they admit her either British up in the British Rush up and they

2150
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:30,016
Running to Belgium so that they can take the position on the Left Flank and protect

2151
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
Airport General Glenn rezax Army

2152
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,392
And before they even get there unrest is moving the other Direct

2153
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,464
Is backing up to stay in line with the French armies

2154
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,024
Exposing the British Army's flag

2155
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:47,680
Again you can read the British historians have been mad about that ever since being left in the Lurch by the French

2156
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,264
What's so funny is I read all these accounts like

2157
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,544
The Irishman to count

2158
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,824
Lucy's account

2159
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,200
I'm arriving in France and how much the French love them and he's wonderful welcomes and then you read other accounts

2160
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:02,784
Uniform later in the war where the soldier to go and get a fresh don't much like us

2161
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
We don't like them they don't like us

2162
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088
And the

2163
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:09,696
Leadership in the British army didn't seem particularly Pro French or vice versa

2164
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,512
There seems to be a lot of arguing between them

2165
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:18,912
And then some weird order although it's totally understandable by the head of the British military right before the bef goes to France

2166
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Complicate every

2167
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
Lord Horatio Kitchener

2168
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,128
British Legend from the colonial war never seen a guy like

2169
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,176
By the way I always look at this picture Wonder

2170
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,968
What he would look like without that

2171
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,808
Victorian era wax mustache thing he has going

2172
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,600
But he's a he's a fantastic

2173
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Six-figure

2174
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,136
Character

2175
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,160
In his own right

2176
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,488
What he famously tells the British commander who's going over to France

2177
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,768
Something to the effect of

2178
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
Look

2179
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:49,888
This 70,000 men is 90% of all we have

2180
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,472
France and Germany date that millions of men in the field

2181
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,008
This is our army

2182
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,288
Don't lose it

2183
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,592
Be careful

2184
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,408
The problem is he's in a war where

2185
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,712
Men are thrown into meat grinders

2186
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,504
In very large numbers

2187
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,528
The French

2188
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Will lose

2189
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:13,184
The equivalent of the British expeditionary Force often in this war in a short. Of time

2190
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,768
So the British are moving up into Belgium

2191
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:21,632
To have their first real contact with modern war they fought in South Africa

2192
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,912
Against a bunch of

2193
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,984
Boer farmers and Guerrilla Fighters

2194
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:32,128
Got an idea of what the rifle fire and all that stuff to do they haven't moved up against an army that can fight like take

2195
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,200
And then outnumbers the many times over

2196
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
They stumble into this Army

2197
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
Adam place

2198
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
Qunar

2199
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,392
The battle that shaping up will be a legendary British

2200
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,928
It's called The Battle of Mall

2201
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
And

2202
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,072
It will be mythologized in a very similar way to the

2203
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Dunkirk

2204
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
The affair

2205
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,656
In the second world war unit without

2206
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,984
When Germany smashes France in 1940

2207
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:04,384
The British managed to evacuate their army miraculously every ship that can float comes across in every little rowboat

2208
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:10,784
Comes across the channel take British soldiers away and the luftwaffe is held at Bay and and they can flip the Germans off from across the English Channel say hi

2209
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,064
Haha missed us

2210
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,112
Technically it's a defeat

2211
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
But you sort of

2212
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,440
I portray to spin it in a way that

2213
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,744
Makes it look like a glorious victory that ends up biting

2214
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
Airbnb in the rear end of a long run

2215
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,352
There's some truth to that right you can work with that

2216
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,888
Publicist a

2217
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,448
The Battle of mons is very similar

2218
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,520
One of those things that's technically no matter how you look at it

2219
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,568
A defeat but there are

2220
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,592
Heroic

2221
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
Naruto

2222
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,664
Come out of it

2223
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,456
To me it's like the moment

2224
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,760
Where the cloaking device is removed

2225
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,552
From the German flanking attack

2226
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,344
Cuz up till now there's been this

2227
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,368
Uncertainty about

2228
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:52,768
But is it coming and what strength is it coming in and how many men are we talking about here and where exactly is it going all these different kinds of things

2229
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,584
The British run into the tip of the spear

2230
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,168
They run into the most honored

2231
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,704
Of the armies

2232
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
Involved

2233
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
Chapter one

2234
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:07,872
It has the the important most important position the one that the great Schlieffen famously said

2235
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:13,504
Are the these guys should brush their sleeves against the English Channel meaning that that's how

2236
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,320
Why the flanking maneuver they should make through Belgium

2237
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:21,696
They should make it so wide that they actually almost touch the last man on the right touches his sleeve into the water

2238
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,304
Is commanded by one of these great German general

2239
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
A guy named

2240
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,144
Alexander Von kluck

2241
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,960
And punk Loop is one of these guys

2242
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:38,848
It's like Heinz guderian I think I said in the second world war he's an aggressive General he's a hard driver

2243
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:43,200
He sees as the initiative he gets you off balance he keeps pushing

2244
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,224
And he moved

2245
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
It's all about speed

2246
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:49,088
And deadliness when he gets to the place where you don't expect him yet

2247
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,208
Schematic 320000 men in Germany's first arm

2248
01:42:55,232 --> 01:43:00,096
Right next to him is Germany second Army also moving to Belgium also part of this out flanking maneuver

2249
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,656
260000 man under Von Bulow

2250
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:09,568
Van Heusen third Army below him as a hundred and eighty thousand men this is the flanking maneuver

2251
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,872
The British run into the

2252
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:15,456
German Army on the farthest Right Flight they only run into a part of it

2253
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,504
About a hundred and sixty thousand men

2254
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:23,392
Who are surprised to find the British waiting for them behind defensive positions

2255
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,488
A long 25 miles of a canal

2256
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
Which we call it

2257
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Defensive Ops

2258
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,840
Write this is something that

2259
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,400
Magnifies the power of the

2260
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,728
Defense cuz now the Germans have to cross this canal under Fire

2261
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,312
The British think they're going to face

2262
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
Accor

2263
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,104
Germans

2264
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
Maybe two

2265
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,224
Instead they're facing four plus cores

2266
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,552
And they're doing it in this kind of an otherworldly

2267
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
Setting

2268
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,648
Barbara tuchman is good for this kind of stuff is she explains

2269
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:02,048
But you know you might think that this is like the wonderful Belgian Farm Countryside in the canal with blue water going

2270
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,608
Through which explains that this is a mining town

2271
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:10,752
And the water that runs through this canal is more of a sludge and it's black and it gives off chemical fumes

2272
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:14,080
And she says amongst the flower gardens and vegetable gardens

2273
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,360
Are these slag

2274
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:20,736
He keeps that are pointed and look like tall witches hats all around the the landscape

2275
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:23,040
She says it doesn't look like a bad place for a modern

2276
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:23,808
Battle

2277
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,856
It's going down in history

2278
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:32,768
When one narrative and of course as in everything else you're going to get tired of me hearing saying this but is everything else will just where there's a whole nother

2279
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
Counter-narrative

2280
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,608
The original narrative is the Dunkirk one that that

2281
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,400
Turn this thing into something

2282
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
That is so

2283
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,216
Legendary

2284
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,776
That within a year or two legends

2285
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
Popular Legends will spring up

2286
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,616
That there are angels

2287
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,432
On the British side of this battle

2288
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
What you know

2289
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:57,088
To me I wouldn't push that rumor because even though it makes it look like God might be on your side

2290
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:01,696
If you got the angels on your side and you still end up having to move backwards in Retreat after

2291
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
The battle that doesn't speak too well about

2292
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
Define empower

2293
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,536
The particular Angels involve

2294
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
But let's not go

2295
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,584
Let's talk about

2296
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:10,912
You know the parts we can confirm about this battle

2297
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
It's a 25 mi from

2298
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,240
30 seventy thousand guys

2299
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,288
Most of it behind this canal

2300
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Reset

2301
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,896
And it's starts with encounter between Calvary

2302
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,664
Because remember

2303
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,272
You're trying to use these aircraft and then send the Germans are better than most attitude

2304
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
To look at things

2305
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:31,392
But everytime anything's Misty or foggy they can't see anything

2306
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:35,232
So it's still Cavalry that does this job

2307
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:41,888
And while you're cavalry's out front trying to be the eyes and ears of your army the enemy's Cavalry is out front being the eyes and ears of their arm

2308
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
And they fight

2309
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,496
This is what you normally have your reconnaissance forces get into it

2310
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:52,640
And so the first stuff that goes on here is the British eyes and ears and counted the German eyes and it wasn't there some calories

2311
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
And

2312
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,712
John Lucy are Irishman

2313
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,272
In the bef talks about this he says

2314
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,832
And we run into our Cavalry there some wounded people but

2315
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:05,184
State they beat the Germans in a little Cabaret engagement but the Germans are coming

2316
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
And so that the British and his

2317
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Unit

2318
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,888
I'll get ready they can kind of get scratch them out jig would be too strong of a word scratch themselves out a little depression

2319
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,936
In the soil when they wait for the

2320
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,984
Germans to arrive and I should point out something

2321
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,264
That

2322
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:23,104
Maybe I'm estimating here but I would say between 85 and 90%

2323
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,408
Of all the accounts you read

2324
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:31,040
From soldiers going off to war in 1914 and it doesn't matter which army you choose

2325
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,856
Most of it is overwhelmingly

2326
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,952
Positive in terms of the emotion that these young men feel going off

2327
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
Tour

2328
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:44,096
There were some Russian accounts especially when people are pulled off the farms and don't want to go do this

2329
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,912
But most of the young men going off to war here

2330
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,264
Are excited it sounds like an adventure the full Romance of War still in bloom

2331
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:57,920
To them this is excitement remember a lot of these people are pretty Drury lives and now all of a sudden they're caught up in

2332
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:04,320
In world affairs that are huge momentous biggest thing that's ever going to happen to most of these people right and they know in their they're caught up

2333
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:08,416
Any excitement they don't have a lot of negative stories yet that have filled it into the public Realm

2334
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:13,024
In explaining what happened to the guys who came before you cuz there are no guys that came before you

2335
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,352
Are Irish British expeditionary Force Soldier

2336
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,656
John Lucy is moving up

2337
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,680
Torrance Mall

2338
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,704
In

2339
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:24,288
The. Right around August 22nd August 23rd

2340
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,312
And

2341
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,104
Says that when he first

2342
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Heard the guns

2343
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
It was a

2344
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
Queer

2345
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:32,992
Thrilling sword

2346
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,016
The feeling that it brought

2347
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,064
But it also worried

2348
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,416
But maybe not for the reason we would think of as an adventurous

2349
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,464
Young man who finds all this

2350
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,536
You know interesting and exciting he had a different reason to be scared

2351
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,328
He writes about his unit

2352
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,608
Thumbs up

2353
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,888
Toward the

2354
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
Situation

2355
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:51,936
I was like

2356
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
Quote

2357
01:47:54,496 --> 01:48:00,128
We swap news with the nearest men in the ranks and learn that nothing exciting it happened to the Battalion in our absence

2358
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:06,784
Acceptable line of trenches have been dug as a defensive measure about a mile behind and then abandoned on the orders of

2359
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,136
Staff officer who wished the Battalion to move forward toward the town of moss

2360
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:14,208
Now visible through the slag heaps of many Minds

2361
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,256
On the right front of the marching regiment

2362
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:22,656
This dirty-looking factory town had no particular interest just then for us until suddenly above the sound

2363
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:26,240
How did the tread of our marching feet we heard the booming of field gun

2364
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,056
A queer thrilling and menacing sound

2365
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,360
About which there were many conjectures

2366
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,432
The most popular being that they were French 75

2367
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,480
And that they were giving the Germans hell

2368
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
This notion greatly depressed us

2369
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
We should really hurry up now otherwise we would miss the battle the French would get all the glory while we with our capacity

2370
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:51,584
34 deadly rifle fire and dash in the attack would miss that crowning moment of Victory culminating in

2371
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
In a sweeping bayonet charge

2372
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,912
Relentless in invincible

2373
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:57,984
The grand assault that would drive the enemy off the field

2374
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:00,800
So we damned the French were not waiting for us

2375
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
And quote

2376
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,944
There's that Romance of War again

2377
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,480
The Great Adventure

2378
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
Going to be fun

2379
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,784
We're going to be heroes

2380
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,856
And it's funny when he first gets to the line

2381
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,976
And his men take up positions and what they call me trenches these shallow little

2382
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:23,072
Kind of holes they're not too happy to not be moving forward and doing something offensive

2383
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:26,400
But they sit down there and then the first shells come by then

2384
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,424
And again

2385
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,728
They find it more interesting and they kind of

2386
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,752
Have fun with it

2387
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
He says quote

2388
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:38,688
The Salvo of shells passed over our heads and burst about 80 yards in the rear with a terrific Clyde

2389
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
Iran crash

2390
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,992
We were highly interested

2391
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:44,064
More came and still more all going over

2392
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:48,416
The heads of our curious men appeared above the trenches looking back to see the burst

2393
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,952
Look they shouted

2394
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,976
A black one

2395
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,768
Or one only

2396
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
Or

2397
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,560
More whites

2398
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:57,120
Some laughingly imagine themselves

2399
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:01,728
On duty at rifle ranges at home and shouted advice to the German gunners

2400
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,008
Washout

2401
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,288
Another Miss

2402
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:06,336
And lower your sights

2403
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:09,152
One wag simulating great Terror

2404
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:15,552
Cried send for the police there's going to be a row on here and another in mock despair oh mother why did I do

2405
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,576
Desert you

2406
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
Then the enemy Gunners shortened

2407
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:24,512
And the shells exploded above our trenches and the men already taken in hand for exposing themselves

2408
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,536
Crouch low

2409
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:28,096
So it's getting real

2410
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:28,864
Right

2411
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:33,472
But it shows you the attitude that they had at the time they having fun with it

2412
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,008
The Great Adventure

2413
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,288
And

2414
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,568
You read accounts

2415
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:43,968
From every major Army of this. I said the Russians have a little bit more people that were sort of dragged into the kicking and screaming

2416
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,552
In the country people always more than the urban people

2417
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,880
But the twenty-year-olds were marching off to do this

2418
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,952
It's hard to find a count where they're dreading

2419
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,720
Yet

2420
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,024
Adobe accounts down the road where

2421
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:00,352
You know everyone has a good idea where they're going and there's a lot more

2422
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:07,264
A planning for your own death and worrying about that kind of stuff right now as I said John was she's worried about missing

2423
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Define

2424
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,360
You don't have to worry cuz the funds coming to him

2425
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,944
Field Marshal Alexander Von Kluge

2426
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:19,552
Is aiming the German first Army the tip of the spear

2427
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,576
Write Adam

2428
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,648
And Alexander Von klook

2429
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,672
Is like

2430
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:30,048
The German general that Central casting in the TV Hollywood world would have put together

2431
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,096
Scarred face

2432
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,400
You know Iron Cross

2433
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:39,776
Carrying a soldier's rifle and a pistol at the same time while he's walking around

2434
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Fearsome is a great description of him

2435
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,640
Wear a French Observer

2436
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:48,736
You during the early stages of this combat you know right around now

2437
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,784
Ends of witnessing the arrival

2438
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,624
Avon clock somewhere and said it reminded him of Attila the Hun

2439
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,904
And he said quote

2440
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
An automobile drove up

2441
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,792
From it to send it an officer of arrogant and impressive bearing

2442
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:06,912
Destruct forward alone while the officer standing in groups in front of the Villa made way for him

2443
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,960
He was tall and Majestic

2444
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:13,568
With a scarred clean-shaven face hard features in a frightening glance

2445
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,384
It is right handy carried a soldier's wife

2446
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,992
And is left rested on the butt of a revolver he turned around several times

2447
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:25,600
Striking the ground with the butt end of his rifle and then halted in a theatrical pose

2448
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,904
No one seemed to dare to approach him

2449
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,208
And indeed you are a terrible error

2450
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:31,488
And quote

2451
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,584
And as we said earlier he's like the Heinz guderian of this war he's

2452
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,376
The hard-driving

2453
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:43,264
You know images is everything commanding 320,000 men commander of the first Army

2454
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:49,408
He's going to have problems with German generals who are not as aggressive and hard-driving as he is

2455
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:53,248
It's his army well about half of it

2456
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,784
That we're running to the British

2457
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:55,808
Atmos

2458
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,136
And the traditional story is that

2459
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,416
But they are in for a shock

2460
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,720
Because as we said earlier

2461
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:05,536
The British are good Rifleman but it may even this

2462
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,328
Just so you know even this is

2463
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,096
Contested

2464
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:11,168
In a second I'll read some stuff about the same battle from

2465
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:14,752
The military historian of Britain's Imperial War Museum

2466
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:17,312
Who will kind of go after every single point that

2467
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,592
Traditional in this narrative

2468
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,128
What traditionally

2469
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:22,176
Alexander Von kluck's forces

2470
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,480
Inside of an encounter battle

2471
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
Stumble Inn

2472
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,040
To the British line

2473
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:33,952
And take it on the chin and are hit by so much rifle fire that is so precisely aimed and so quickly

2474
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:37,792
In a fire that the Germans supposedly think they're under machine gun fire

2475
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,608
John Lucy's very proud of this moment

2476
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,168
And describes what happens to the Germans dust

2477
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
Quote

2478
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,800
Finally the shelling seeds do we put up our heads to breathe more freely

2479
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,848
Then we heard conch like sound

2480
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,896
Strange bugle calls

2481
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,176
The German infantry

2482
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:56,736
Wechat approached during the shelling was insight

2483
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
And about to attack

2484
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:01,088
Not a shot had been fired from our trenches up till now

2485
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:05,184
And the only opposition to the Germans have been made by our field gun battery

2486
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,232
Which was heavily engaged behind us

2487
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,792
And making almost as much clamour is the enemy shelling

2488
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:16,192
To my mind it seem that the whole Battalion must have been wiped out by that Dreadful rain of shells but apparently not

2489
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,728
Any answer he writes

2490
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,776
To the German bugles or trumpets

2491
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,336
Can the cheerful sound of our officers whistle

2492
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,360
And The Rifleman

2493
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:26,432
Casting aside the amazement of their strange trial

2494
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,712
Spring2action

2495
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:34,624
A great Roar of musketry rent the are varying slightly in intensity from minute to minute that's whole

2496
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,672
Company ceased fire and opened again

2497
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:43,328
The satisfactory sharp blasts of the directing whistles show that our Machinery of defense was working like the drill book

2498
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,400
Another recent Shelly head cause notice organization

2499
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:49,216
The clatter of our machine guns added to the den

2500
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,752
Thrust he writes

2501
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:55,360
The battle took the form of well-ordered Rapid rifle fire at close range

2502
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:59,456
As the field grade human targets appeared or were struck down

2503
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:04,832
The enemy infantry Advanced according to one of our men in Columns of masses

2504
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:10,208
Which withered away under the galling fire of the well-trained and Cooley LED Irishman

2505
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
Deleting Germans fired standing

2506
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,792
From the hip

2507
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:16,608
Let me interrupt him here now that's John Wayne Style

2508
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,888
Walking toward the enemy

2509
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,424
Shooting from your hip

2510
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,472
So they're coming toward the British

2511
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,752
Trenches doing that

2512
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
Deleting Germans

2513
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:28,640
I just said fired standing from the hip as they came on

2514
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:31,200
But they're scattered fire was ineffective and ignored

2515
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,224
They crumpled up

2516
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,528
Mount down as quickly as I tell it

2517
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:38,368
They're reinforcing waves and sections coming on Bravely and steadily

2518
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:41,696
To fall over as they reach the front line of slain and wounded

2519
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:43,488
Behind the deadline

2520
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:47,072
Speaker converging columns were being blown about by our field guns

2521
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
He then says

2522
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,192
Are rapid fire was appalling even to us

2523
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:58,336
And the worst Marksman could not miss has he had only to fire into the brown of the masses of the unfortunate enemy

2524
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,384
Who won the front of two of our companies

2525
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,736
We're continually and uselessly reinforced at the short range of 300 yards

2526
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,528
Such tactics amazed us

2527
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:10,880
And after the first shock of seeing men slowly and helplessly falling down as they were hit

2528
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:13,440
Gave us a great sense of power and pleasure

2529
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,976
It was all so easy

2530
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,536
He says the German attack

2531
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,560
Be broken off

2532
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,328
Quote

2533
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:22,656
The German survivors began to go back here and there from Moline

2534
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,704
The attack has been an utter failure

2535
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,544
Soon all that remained with the long line of the dead before us

2536
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,872
Motionless except for the limb movements of some of the wounded

2537
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
And quote

2538
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,992
As a person interested in military history

2539
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,272
This

2540
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:42,112
Era of the conflict is the one most interesting to me because

2541
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,904
It later in the war everybody's

2542
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,440
Pretty experienced

2543
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,720
And with what you're dealing

2544
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,792
It's at this point in the war that everybody's learning

2545
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:55,936
The reality of Modern Warfare at the same time through bloody hard experience the British expeditionary Force

2546
01:56:56,192 --> 01:57:02,336
And Von kluck's first Army are both kind of getting a real initial taste of what the new Weaponry can

2547
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
Yuan issue

2548
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,640
Heard from John Lucy

2549
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,688
The Irish riflemen in the bef

2550
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:11,808
He and his compatriots were actually appalled at how effective and deadly it was it's a whole different thing

2551
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
In a fiery live people

2552
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,880
In a parade ground

2553
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:17,952
But if you happen to emerge unscathed

2554
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,232
It almost

2555
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,512
Seems to

2556
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,096
In a bolster that idea that this is spawn heroic romantic

2557
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:29,984
Lynn McDonald in her book 1914 quotes a bunch of people who were there including Lieutenant Chapman

2558
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:33,824
As the British are dealing with the battle tails

2559
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,104
What's going on tour

2560
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,640
Compatriot of his and says

2561
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,664
About the

2562
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,736
Repulsing of the German human wave attacks quote

2563
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,064
They came at us over a bank directly in front of us

2564
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:46,624
And as soon as they topped it we let them happen

2565
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,208
The range was 70-yard so we were firing at them Point Blank

2566
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,488
I've never seen anything like

2567
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,144
Legs arms heads they were flying all over the place we absolutely smashed them they simply melt

2568
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
Getaway

2569
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:03,264
Turn the blighters got to machine guns into action at that distance we were like sitting ducks

2570
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,336
So we had to get out of it and by jove it was a close shave

2571
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,128
And quote

2572
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:11,712
As though it's a fun story

2573
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,480
Right

2574
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,528
There was a 16 year old

2575
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,832
Trumpeter and that's not unusual going back

2576
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,136
A very long time they always have boys

2577
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:23,232
Drummers and trumpeters isn't on ship still have

2578
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:28,096
React to her position in Britain's Navy called first boy second boy

2579
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,376
And they are their kids

2580
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,424
I'm 16 year old British Trumpeter laws

2581
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,984
Describes how he just

2582
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,544
Admire what the British were doing it

2583
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,616
It can never forgot the fire discipline of these Rifleman

2584
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:45,248
He said he was sitting there watching an officer Countdown the range of this advancing gray human wave

2585
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:48,576
And getting very nervous as it got closer and closer and closer

2586
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,880
Saying that the British

2587
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,904
Officer

2588
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:57,280
Was holding the rifle fire until the Germans got really close and he was counting down the rain

2589
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
Trumpeter

2590
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:01,632
Jay Naylor from the third division reports quote

2591
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
He was saying

2592
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
At 400

2593
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,728
At 3:50

2594
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:07,264
At 300

2595
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:13,664
The rifles Blaze but still the Germans came on they were getting nearer and nearer and for the first time I began to feel rather anxious

2596
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,432
Brighton

2597
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,480
They weren't an indeterminate Mass anymore

2598
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,784
You could actually pick out details

2599
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,320
See them as individual man

2600
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,112
Coming on and coming on

2601
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:24,416
And the officer still cool as anything

2602
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,464
Was saying at 2:50

2603
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,000
At200

2604
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,024
And then he said

2605
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,840
10 Rounds rapid and the chaps opened up

2606
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:34,144
And the Germans just fell down like logs

2607
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,680
I've never seen anything like it

2608
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,448
The discipline

2609
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:38,496
The fire discipline of these troops

2610
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,544
I've never forgotten that I was so impressed

2611
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:43,104
As a boy of 16 I was simply astounding

2612
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,920
I thought what a marvelous Army we are

2613
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,992
The attack was completely repulsed probably not for long

2614
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,064
But it was long enough for us to get the guns away it's saved us

2615
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:53,856
And quote

2616
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:55,904
Now

2617
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,976
I probably have more than 20 books sitting around me here

2618
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:05,632
Historians talking about the same event and it is amazing to go from historian historian historian to see the different ways

2619
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,936
This is viewed interpreted

2620
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,776
A perfect example is Peter heart's a wonderful book He's a

2621
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:14,336
Historian it Britain's Imperial War Museum

2622
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,408
And he's one of those contrarian to says all this is a bunch of Nas

2623
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,016
And let's understand quickly that it's

2624
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:28,672
It's normal in Wartime for this to happen there's not a single power involved in the conflict that wants to talk

2625
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,696
Talk about defeats

2626
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:34,304
Or bad things everybody wants propaganda victories everybody wants stuff that helps

2627
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,072
Recruiting

2628
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:39,680
You're looking for stuff that you can play up maybe if Peter Hart suggest

2629
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:42,496
That's what this miracle at malls is

2630
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,824
But he shoots down a number of the typical arguments

2631
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,896
Pointing out that the Germans handled themselves very well

2632
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:52,224
And in fact that the casualty numbers are what he thinks they are

2633
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,760
Probably deserve a victory

2634
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:59,392
At the Battle of maldon fact the French and the Germans both thought the British were defeated there at the time he writes quote

2635
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:06,304
When a monk Lux first Army smashed into Smith Dorian 2nd Corps at 6 a.m. on the 23rd of August

2636
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,632
The battle that ensued was the inter British military folklore

2637
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:16,032
The myth is one of a heroic successful defense with well-trained British tommies mowing down hordes of

2638
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,848
Germans repeatedly attacking in Mass formation

2639
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,896
Finally the British will be forced to retreat

2640
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:24,224
Only because the fickle friend should give it away on their right flank

2641
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,528
This view of the battle is a great yarn

2642
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:31,648
He writes but like the angels of mons at its heart it is the product of wishful thinking

2643
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,440
And quote

2644
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:39,072
He then goes on to deal with every single reality we've talked about it

2645
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:41,376
Shooting down each one of

2646
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,680
Again as best he can

2647
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,448
Controversy

2648
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,776
But he's a fantastic historian who's qualified to do this

2649
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:50,592
I should like to point out though

2650
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:54,944
But this was no different you know manufacturing a victory or playing up a victory

2651
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,784
And and magnifying the very real heroism on both sides

2652
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:04,160
There's nothing wrong with that that's pretty standard behavior for every military and every war you can think of

2653
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:05,952
Imprint sample

2654
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,488
Ilse

2655
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:10,560
Quote after the second cour being undefeated

2656
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:15,168
I'm forced to fall back only to conform with the French on their right flank this is pure nonsense

2657
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:21,056
He says the reality is that on many occasions the German seem to have been all too successful in forcing a retreat

2658
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,080
And quote

2659
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,104
In other words

2660
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,408
Probably the best army in the world

2661
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,712
He's operating that way in the field

2662
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:31,552
And it's disconcerting if you're on the other side for example he says quote

2663
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:34,624
It is undeniable that several of the British Battalion spot well

2664
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:41,024
But modern scholarship has revealed that the Germans maneuvered skilfully to secure a local superiority against the weak point

2665
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,048
Going to the British defenses

2666
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:44,608
Wherever possible they operated against the flanks

2667
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,400
Forcing the British to fall back

2668
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,960
Or risk being cut off and totally destroyed

2669
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:54,080
Throughout the Germans seem to have handled their artillery and machine guns with a great tactical dexterity

2670
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
Borne of long practice

2671
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,944
Operating them in tandem to dominate the British in the firefight

2672
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,272
Effectively rendering rifle fire of secondary importance

2673
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:08,928
The British were turned out of their defensive positions in a matter of a few hours and even failed to destroy several of the Canal Bridge

2674
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:11,232
And quote

2675
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,536
He then goes on to take issue with the

2676
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:16,864
The casualties that are often cited one of the things the British use it

2677
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,168
Claiming that this isn't a major victories

2678
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,216
How many more Germans they killed

2679
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:26,848
Versus the casualties they suffer themselves He suggests that even the interpretation of what those casualties are

2680
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,384
Are overblown

2681
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,408
Again

2682
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:31,456
This really doesn't matter in the

2683
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,224
Grand scheme

2684
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,016
Every nation was doing this

2685
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,296
For me

2686
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,600
What's most interesting is to watch these

2687
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,416
Nations and these military

2688
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:43,488
Trying to learn on the Fly while they're being shot at

2689
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:44,768
And Translate

2690
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:46,304
Years of theory

2691
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,584
Into practice

2692
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,656
By the 24th of August

2693
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:53,728
The French will change their mind about this whole idea

2694
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:56,544
Of you know the offensive at all costs when

2695
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,128
It offers forced to say listen we need to go on the defensive

2696
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:02,176
Which is in a like heresy

2697
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:05,504
Amir 5 6 7 8 days before

2698
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:08,320
The reality of the situation on the ground

2699
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:14,208
Is changing everybody's mind about another package we talked before the war we're going to be good yeah in practice not so good

2700
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,256
The British

2701
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:20,096
Whether you want to believe that they were forced to retire because the French left him in the lurch

2702
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,144
Or whether you want to

2703
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,984
In a belief as a heart does that the Germans were just really quite good

2704
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,544
Attorney influencing and employing

2705
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,592
Combined arms is it called

2706
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,872
To get the

2707
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:35,200
British an untenable position is it called it doesn't matter

2708
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:38,016
The British have to retire just like different they have to get out of

2709
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,576
The first Art Museum

2710
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:43,904
Leader Von kluck writes in his Memoirs the British fought accidentally

2711
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,976
But that if he had been allowed

2712
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,000
To sweep

2713
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:54,400
As widely around the flank as he had wanted to and has as he requested the time that the British would have been in no position to fight

2714
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,936
He would have outflanked them

2715
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,472
Smashed them from the rear

2716
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:01,568
Remember there will be a lot of finger-pointing after the war

2717
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:07,200
Over whose fault all of this stuff is in a lot of the generals were still alive will write things to defend their reputation

2718
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,272
The one thing

2719
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,040
Pachuca

2720
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:13,344
Actively say is going on here though

2721
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,880
Is it neither the British

2722
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,904
It was a French

2723
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:18,976
We're able to stop this movement through Belgium it's coming down on them

2724
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:21,536
And they're all retiring at

2725
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,328
This is the

2726
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,608
The part of this

2727
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,400
In the early War

2728
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
Narrative

2729
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,216
It's known as the great retreat

2730
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:33,824
The great Retreat is a wonderful example

2731
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:39,456
Of one of those moments where I try to get in the minds of these people and you know that's a fruitless

2732
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:41,504
Past mean there's no reason to

2733
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:46,880
Play with history and study history if you don't want to try to do that but we all have to recognize how impossible it is

2734
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:50,208
But at the same time you try to put yourself in their shoes

2735
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:56,864
If you are one of the commanders of any of these armies and you're over about the age of 58 59

2736
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,168
This entire Affair is beginning to look

2737
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:00,704
Horribly familiar to you

2738
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,984
What you're on the German side

2739
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,776
Wonderfully familiar to you

2740
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:06,080
It looks like 1870 1871

2741
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,872
It looks like 44 years ago

2742
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,896
It looks like

2743
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:14,272
You know when the Germans managed to surround to entire French armies and get them to surrender

2744
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:18,368
Sir John French the British commander

2745
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,160
Is already making plans to

2746
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:24,256
Get his army to the other side of Paris and then starting to think about

2747
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:30,656
The challenges the logistical challenges of getting the Army the British army out of France altogether is back to the safe

2748
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,936
Britain

2749
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,776
He's worried about a completely legitimate threat

2750
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:40,128
That the British could end up like two French armies ended up in the last war

2751
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:42,432
Completely surrounded by the enemy

2752
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,712
And forced to surrender

2753
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,272
Imagine if 90% of britons

2754
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:50,880
Military forces are on the continent and have to give up to the Germans and go into captivity

2755
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:54,208
That's quite a hostage situation you have

2756
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:57,024
Pretty easy to get a pretty good

2757
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:01,888
Armistice agreement wouldn't you think if you're holding 90% of the British army hostage

2758
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,448
In French

2759
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:08,544
It's confusing is that the British commander named frenchwood French is not confident

2760
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
In the French

2761
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,360
He hasn't been impressed

2762
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:17,760
You know with his dealings with them so far and he's complained a lot to his Superior who I think we said was the military leader in this

2763
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:19,808
Lord Horatio Kitchener

2764
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:22,368
Who happens to be a field Marshal but in fact

2765
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:25,440
At this time use a Cabinet member the secretary for war

2766
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:32,096
History X will feel the need to discard his bowler hat in his suit and tie and throw on his feet

2767
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:36,192
Field Marshal uniform jump on a destroyer go across the English Channel

2768
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
And

2769
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:37,984
Give

2770
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,312
French a little piece of his mind bolster his confidence a little bit

2771
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:44,384
The French has illegitimate worried

2772
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:49,760
This great Retreat that's going on is an extremely precarious moment because

2773
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,296
An organized

2774
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:55,136
Retirement can easily turn into a disorganized

2775
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,160
Panic route

2776
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,696
And everyone knows that

2777
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,720
In fact

2778
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,536
Only a couple of days after the battle of Mons

2779
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:05,376
British forces will be required to turn around and beat off

2780
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:08,704
German attacks against that which is wild when you consider

2781
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:14,080
That the Germans are trying to catch people that move away from them at the same maximum speed

2782
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,896
Your military history not like I am

2783
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,200
The one thing that's interesting to follow

2784
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,736
At this point in the war

2785
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,760
Is something that

2786
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:24,064
That is very unusual military

2787
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:29,952
Because if you were going to take a class on military history this is the point in the war where they would tell you

2788
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:34,560
If you're the Germans that you need to send out your mobile units now and destroy the enemy

2789
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:36,864
Why you have Cavalry right

2790
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,400
Can you go talk to her

2791
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:41,216
Genghis Khan or any medieval or ancient

2792
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:44,288
General in history they're going to tell you go get them

2793
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:50,176
Tanger Cavalry after them harassment disorganized and never give him a Moment's Peace cut off stragglers

2794
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,248
If you look at where people die

2795
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,808
In premodern warfare but even modern warfare

2796
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,088
They died in the pursuit

2797
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,392
The job of the battle is

2798
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,440
To get the other side to turn and run

2799
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,976
And when they turn and run

2800
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,000
You crushed

2801
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:07,328
Look at the Iraqi highway of death right

2802
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:11,680
With so many Iraqis died fleeing to wait what would they do when they were fleeing

2803
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,240
Throughout most of human history

2804
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:20,640
The Casual human Alexander the Great supposedly only suffered less than a thousand casualties in his entire career

2805
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,944
Although I don't know if I believe that

2806
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:27,040
Military store inside and the reason those numbers are soloist cuz

2807
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:31,136
Comparatively few people died in the Battle they died

2808
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:33,696
While being pursued after the battle

2809
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:37,024
And since Alexander never lost a battle his troops never had to face that

2810
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:40,352
This is the moment when the German cavalry

2811
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,376
2B Unleashed

2812
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,912
And finish the job

2813
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:46,752
The problem is we had this tiny little window in military history

2814
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:53,152
Who are the Cavalry is so vulnerable that even disorganized which the French and the British art by the way but even retreating for

2815
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:58,528
Horses can turn around form of firing line really quickly and destroyed

2816
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:02,368
Had a few Howitzer is in there and it will be Carnage

2817
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
Now

2818
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:05,184
In the next War

2819
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,976
Mechanized forces

2820
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,024
Armor and aircraft

2821
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:14,144
Recreate the ability to do what light Cavalry did before this.

2822
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,960
But in this weird little interim era

2823
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:20,032
The Cavalry can't pursue and Destroy forces like

2824
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:23,360
So the Germans have to do this same job with infant

2825
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,176
The problem is the German infantry

2826
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,504
Maximum speed is the speed of a marching man

2827
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,552
Which is the exact same speed

2828
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,600
Of the people they're trying to catch

2829
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:40,512
And yet nevertheless and even though the Germans have marched along way already they get darn near to catch a

2830
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:43,072
Several times in fact on the 26th of August

2831
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,864
The British have to turn around

2832
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,936
And try to get a little breathing space

2833
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,728
Tommy's German pursuers

2834
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:50,752
My

2835
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:57,152
UniFi you again can we get them to slow down cause them to form up and have to reorganize again and get a little

2836
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,432
Distance between

2837
02:10:58,688 --> 02:10:59,712
Us and Them

2838
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:03,808
On the 26th of August the British including our friend John Lucy from the bef

2839
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,832
Fight another battle

2840
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
What determines

2841
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:08,416
This time in about 11 hours

2842
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,696
The British suffered

2843
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:10,976
Thousand cash

2844
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:17,632
98000 casualties in the war that's about to happen isn't going to seem like that much in my goodness

2845
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:21,984
The French of supper 260000 wounded in the last few days

2846
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,056
Which of the British army which is historically small

2847
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:27,104
This is a naval Powers Army

2848
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:28,384
That's a lot

2849
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:30,176
In fact when

2850
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:36,576
Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray who's with the general staff behind the lines is informed of the eight thousand casualties a couple hours late

2851
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:37,856
Ecolab

2852
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,416
Just paints

2853
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:46,816
I'm going to show you need a hard-bitten military men but it shows you the scratching the tension that these people are under

2854
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,096
Can you add to that

2855
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:54,752
The fog of war no one knows what's going on and it's happening so quickly there's a huge amount of stress

2856
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,848
A German general shoots himself on August 20th I mean

2857
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:03,968
Aldi's administers the real Supreme tapped it separates the men from the boys as the old saying goes

2858
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,784
This is the moment

2859
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,320
Of greatest Danger

2860
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,904
Winston Churchill who is a high official with the Navy

2861
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:16,256
Write about this. In this retirement this great Retreat says quote

2862
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,328
The days of retreat

2863
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:22,400
We saw that the French armies of the right we're holding their own

2864
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:23,936
Call the center and left

2865
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:27,264
Was marching Southward toward Paris as fast as possible

2866
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,080
Well I run 5 divisions work for several days

2867
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,896
Poem lie in the very jaws of Destruction

2868
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:36,224
He says that the admiralty we received requests

2869
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:42,368
To ship the base of the whole Army from over at the cinemas here and with this complicated business we had to cope

2870
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:45,440
The process of retreat continue day after day

2871
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,744
A seemingly irresistible compulsion

2872
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,816
Was pressing enforcing backwards the brave Army zafran

2873
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:55,936
Why should it stop would they ever be able to turn if France could not save herself

2874
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,960
Nothing could save

2875
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:58,240
And quote

2876
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,032
The Germans are

2877
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,312
Mentor Paris

2878
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:06,176
And the Allied soon-to-be officially Allied armies are moving back in that direction

2879
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:07,712
Here's the thing though

2880
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,784
Remember the war plan

2881
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:16,160
You know that the French military leaders offer has not forgotten the plan even if the Germans get within sight of Paris

2882
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:17,952
You're going to lose the war

2883
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:20,000
If it's the same time that happens

2884
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,048
The Russians from the East

2885
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:25,376
Are Marching through the streets of the German capital in Berlin

2886
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,424
Jafra and the

2887
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:30,240
Whole Allied higher command realizes

2888
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,264
On the way

2889
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,592
The war can still be one

2890
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:37,408
Even with allied forces in the west retreating

2891
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:44,064
They just have to prolong this conflict long enough to let the Russians smack the Germans in the east in the war will be over no matter how

2892
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:44,832
Oh well

2893
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
The Germans in the western tv

2894
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:48,672
Enter

2895
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,464
Hindenburg

2896
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:52,000
And ludendorff

2897
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:55,840
Arriving even as all this is going on by train

2898
02:13:56,096 --> 02:14:02,240
In the East to take command of that one loan German army that got to hold off the Russian Steamroller as it approached

2899
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,592
Now the Russians biggest

2900
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:08,128
Victory at this point is

2901
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:09,664
The fact that there's an army there

2902
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,432
Where to fight at all

2903
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:13,760
Remember the entire German pre-war

2904
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:14,784
Plans

2905
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,320
Assumed a certain speed

2906
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:20,160
For everyone's mobilization in the Russian Tsar are the slow one

2907
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,464
And here they are you know in two weeks

2908
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:25,280
And they're already taking towns in East Prussia

2909
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:27,328
East Prussia by the way this area that was

2910
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,096
Concord

2911
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:32,448
In the 14th 15th century by the famous Teutonic Knights

2912
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,728
Which included

2913
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:34,496
A large fry

2914
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:36,800
Proportion of Germanic nobility

2915
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:38,592
Eventually will settle down

2916
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:43,456
In those areas and so this is where some of the historic German nobility

2917
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:47,296
You don't have their biggest states and everything the Kaiser himself feel this is

2918
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,832
This is historic

2919
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,392
German territory Within

2920
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:54,208
Abnormal number of the aristocracy there

2921
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:57,024
Important and it's a gateway to Berlin

2922
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,816
And it's not far from Berlin

2923
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:00,864
And the Russians managed

2924
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:04,704
Within like 2 weeks of the war start forget the six weeks that

2925
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,496
Guys like sleeping accounted on

2926
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,520
Within two weeks

2927
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,080
They've got half a million man

2928
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,360
Operating in that are

2929
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:13,664
And it got even more down south

2930
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:20,064
Against the austro-hungarian it's one of those things where I mean there's an author there's a professor name

2931
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,344
Sean mcmeekin was written

2932
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,928
A whole book called The Russian origins of the first World War

2933
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:28,256
Where he says the Russians are the ones who should bear the entire

2934
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:34,656
Lion Share the guilt for starting this war they wanted it they planned for it and part of the reason that they surprised everybody

2935
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
With your quick

2936
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,216
Mobilization is because

2937
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:39,520
They were ready for this war they wanted it

2938
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:42,848
And they put up 2/5 of their army in Poland which

2939
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,152
Which is right next to East Prussia ahead of time

2940
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:50,528
So that when the war starts when they have to mobilize people they're not coming from all over Russia there's a ton of them right there

2941
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,320
Good units to

2942
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:54,112
It doesn't make any difference

2943
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:54,880
The Russian czar

2944
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,184
An absolute

2945
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,952
Chaotic

2946
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,976
Disaster

2947
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,512
And

2948
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:03,072
You know if you look at Russian history Soviet history

2949
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,352
You just consider that

2950
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:05,888
A piece of Russian history

2951
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,192
That's so traditional it's crazy

2952
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:12,800
The Russians always start these wars as disasters

2953
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,848
In the Second World War

2954
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,176
They can hardly deal with the fin

2955
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,200
Scene Finland

2956
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:22,016
Which is crazy when you think about the disparity and everything

2957
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,040
Resources

2958
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:24,320
Is the size of the number 2

2959
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,088
Everything

2960
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,368
I can hardly do you

2961
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
With the fins in

2962
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:29,952
In the very early part of the second World War

2963
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:36,096
What's 6 years after the second world war starts their Fielding one of the greatest armies in human history

2964
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,632
Very typical

2965
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:43,008
Takes a long time to get started but they can be extremely formidable once they get going

2966
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:44,800
Hindenburg and ludendorff aren't going to

2967
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:49,152
When Hindenburg and ludendorff arrive in the east

2968
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:51,456
Remember these guys are

2969
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:53,248
Probably a little

2970
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:54,784
Orange call jet lag

2971
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,832
Train lagged Amin Hindenburg is

2972
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,648
66 or something and

2973
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:02,208
Just out of retirement a couple of days

2974
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,536
Ludendorff has been on the Western Front since about

2975
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:07,584
The start of the war

2976
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,632
Banging on the door of the Asian

2977
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:11,168
Accepting the surrender there

2978
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,472
A couple of days ago he's helping

2979
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:19,360
Push lanrezac Army back on the Western Front and now he is in the east

2980
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:24,224
Trying to get acclimated to what's going on there's a lieutenant colonel which is a pretty low rank

2981
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,504
For a guy to make the history

2982
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:27,552
Like Max Hoffman did

2983
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:29,856
On the scene though it was an expert

2984
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,392
On the Russian army

2985
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:36,768
And of course has been there the whole time so quickly feels ludendorff and Hindenburg in on the situation

2986
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:37,792
Which is this

2987
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:40,352
Is about a half million Russians nearby

2988
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:43,168
In about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Germans to deal with

2989
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,728
The Russians are divided into two armies

2990
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,776
The first and the second Army

2991
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:50,080
And they're making their way across

2992
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:52,640
A really difficult piece of terrain

2993
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:57,504
It's a series of lakes and forests and marshes and rivers

2994
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:03,136
But just is going to make these two armies have a hard time helping each other out

2995
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,720
In a while they're on opposite sides of this big train feature

2996
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:09,792
He also tells Hindenburg and ludendorff

2997
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:13,632
But they have a pretty good idea about what the Russians are trying to do

2998
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:20,288
Because the Russians have been broadcasting radio messages and Telegraph messages to each other without using any code

2999
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,080
They also find

3000
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:27,200
A Russian officers body after they kill them and it has the plans on it

3001
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:27,968
In fact

3002
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:32,576
There's so much information that's giving the Russian plans to the Germans

3003
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:35,392
But they start to wonder whether or not it's just a ruse

3004
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:40,768
Maybe the Russians are trying to trap us and they're just broadcasting all this to fool us cuz it's so obvious

3005
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,816
Who would make these kind of mistakes

3006
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,608
Well

3007
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:48,192
It's not the greatest time in Russian military history I wrote down a list

3008
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:48,960
12

3009
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:50,240
Mistakes

3010
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,824
They were made or or areas that the Russians were having terrible

3011
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,104
No problem

3012
02:18:55,360 --> 02:19:00,992
It's not only understandable because of the Russian tradition of starting Wars a little chaotically and disorganized

3013
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:04,064
But also because you know even the really best are

3014
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,856
Are trying to figure out

3015
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:11,744
You know how to deal with all this new technology in a hundred years of theory turning into fact the British and the French

3016
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,560
And the Germans are all dealing with this on the Western Front

3017
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,352
Understandable that in army

3018
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,376
That's all

3019
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:20,192
Really not up to those standards is dealing with it all

3020
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:26,592
2 in fact even though the numbers on paper say there's half a million Russians here they've been leaving

3021
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:27,360
Guns

3022
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:30,432
And soldiers all along the way to get here

3023
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:33,504
And their actual strength when they get the combats going to be a lot

3024
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,528
Less than it looks like

3025
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:37,344
The logistics and supply

3026
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:41,184
Situation is disastrous the troops in some cases already eating

3027
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:45,280
They have Rags instead of shoes on their feet some don't have rifles

3028
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:47,840
The two commanders

3029
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:51,424
A guy named Reynolds run in console command the first Army

3030
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,752
II Army's a guy named Samson. They hate each other

3031
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,568
Which is going to be a problem because

3032
02:19:57,824 --> 02:20:00,640
The plans that the Germans have become aware of

3033
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:01,920
Taralli different methods

3034
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:06,784
Say that the Russians are going to try a pincer movement on them is only one German Army in the region

3035
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,088
So this first Army will come from the north

3036
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:10,880
The second Army will come from the south

3037
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,928
Surround the German Army and destroyed

3038
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:15,232
What is the Commander's hate each other

3039
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,768
Telecommunications

3040
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:17,536
Is

3041
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:18,560
Awful

3042
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:24,704
And they have to pass this terrain feature for 50 or 60 miles that will keep them from working together

3043
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,752
Dispenser movements going to be tough

3044
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,312
The German reconnaissance

3045
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:30,080
Is

3046
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:33,664
So much better me the Russians aren't even using aircraft the Germans have

3047
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:38,016
Are airplanes and Zeppelin's up there watching what's going on

3048
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:40,320
The Germans have

3049
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:46,208
An advantage with railroads because railroads help armies move fast obviously but the problem is is that

3050
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:49,792
Attacking armies once they leave their railroads

3051
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:56,192
Almost never get the ability to use the railroads in the territory they're going through whereas The Defenders

3052
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:59,264
Territory can this is one of those things that makes

3053
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:04,896
The defensive more powerful than the offensive in this war the Germans are able to use railroads

3054
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:10,016
To reinforce points where they need to be the Russians are past their railroads now they're walking

3055
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,320
Finally

3056
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:14,112
The Germans know this

3057
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:20,512
They know the terrain and they know the geography this is an area where sometimes the German Army conducts peacetime maneuvers

3058
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,560
So they set a trap

3059
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:26,656
For the Russians and it's a very Napoleonic strategy indeed

3060
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:29,216
They're going to attack these armies

3061
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:34,080
While these armies are separated by this terrain and unable to help each other

3062
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:35,872
And smashed them individual

3063
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,920
They're going to nullify

3064
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:40,224
That disadvantage in numbers

3065
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,528
And the Russians

3066
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:45,088
You don't make this a lot easier cuz they don't know what's going

3067
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,624
They literally are

3068
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,672
Clueless as to what they're facing

3069
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:53,792
And the high command isn't helping the situation they're telling General samsonov at II Army

3070
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,864
Listen to We don't see any German forces we don't expect an attack

3071
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:59,168
I mean Samson I was taking his time

3072
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,728
Blind to what's going on around him

3073
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:07,872
We're at the Germans are moving very fast and seizing areas to the flank and taking up positions and setting a trap

3074
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:10,944
Message stories Michael nyberg and David Jordan

3075
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,736
You pick up the narrative

3076
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:15,296
About springing the Trap

3077
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,576
On the Russian second Army

3078
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,368
They write quote

3079
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:22,208
Nervous intense hours follow does the rest of the Trap was sprung

3080
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,864
By the morning hours of the 28th of August the Germans had control of almost all the main roads leading to Sampson Ops forces

3081
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,912
Combat began in the North

3082
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:35,264
When a Russian core advancing without support ran into a German course

3083
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,872
The Germans who were fully aware of the Russian presence and we're lying in wait for them

3084
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:41,152
Smash the Russian

3085
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:43,200
And sent them reeling back in panic

3086
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:47,296
Surprised at the unanticipated presence of German forces in the area

3087
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:50,368
Samsung off order to General withdrawal that night

3088
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:53,440
The full severity of the situation came slowly to

3089
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:56,000
As he realized that he was completely cut off

3090
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,792
Is man began to panic

3091
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:01,120
Throwing down weapons and running East as fast as they could

3092
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:06,240
Only to end up trapped by strong German forces already sitting on their lines of retreat

3093
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:09,312
Confusion and panic rained in the Russian lines

3094
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:12,128
Without supplies and without Communications

3095
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,408
Panic spread quickly

3096
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:19,296
Renan comes forces were more than 70 miles away and would obviously not provide any help at all

3097
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,832
How much money 9th of August

3098
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:23,136
Samsung off himself gave into the panic

3099
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:26,208
He told a staff officer the Tsar trusted me

3100
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:28,768
How can I face him after such a disaster

3101
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:30,560
He then headed off into the woods

3102
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:34,144
Are you committed suicide rather than face capture by the Germans

3103
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,680
He was one of the lucky ones

3104
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:42,336
Samsonov powerful Army of 150,000 men had suffered one of the most lopsided defeats in military

3105
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:45,152
History more than 30000 Russians were killed

3106
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:47,968
And almost a hundred thousand in a prisoner-of-war camp

3107
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:52,576
Where they faced a dismal future forced labor and appallingly bad conditions

3108
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:56,928
The Germans needed 60 trains to move all of the Russian equipment they capture

3109
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,208
German cars

3110
02:23:58,464 --> 02:23:58,976
Casualties were less

3111
02:23:59,232 --> 02:23:59,744
20000

3112
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:01,536
And quote

3113
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:05,376
The Germans had this fantasy of maybe

3114
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:08,704
Emulating the famous battle of cannae Hannibal's victory

3115
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:12,032
Total encirclement over the Romans in the ancient world

3116
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,336
But instead they got that in the east

3117
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:18,432
And right after defeating samsonov second Army

3118
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:24,320
Those troops that have been taken maybe a great cost very soon from the Western Front arrive

3119
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:29,440
Not in time for the initial battle Justice ludendorff had told mold get earlier

3120
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:31,744
But in time to take on

3121
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,560
The first Army of reading comp which the

3122
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,352
Germans then smash

3123
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:41,216
With similar nasty casualty numbers not reading comp will do a better job

3124
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:47,616
I'm pulling his forces back and saving his army from total Destruction he won't get totally surrounded like the battle of cannae

3125
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:50,176
But it doesn't matter the results are the same

3126
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:53,248
All of a sudden in shocking fashion

3127
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:59,136
The Germans have removed the threat of the Russians coming in and taking Berlin

3128
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:01,440
Before the Germans can take Paris

3129
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:05,792
All of a sudden the whole strategy that the French and British were

3130
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:10,656
In a delaying and operating under the assumption of if we can just hold on a little longer the Russians

3131
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:12,704
You'll solve this word problem for us

3132
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,728
All of a sudden

3133
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:16,032
The French and the British are going to have to

3134
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:18,848
Managed to be Victorious on the Western Front

3135
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,384
If they want to save themselves

3136
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,176
That helps not coming through

3137
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,736
In the West

3138
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:27,296
As the great Retreat continues

3139
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:29,600
You begin to see

3140
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,904
What the level of humans suffer

3141
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,184
Spring is going to be in the sky

3142
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,232
Have to keep reminding myself

3143
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:38,560
Talk about this you know the old Joseph Stalin line is so true

3144
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:40,864
One death is a tragedy

3145
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,144
A million deaths

3146
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,168
Esthetician

3147
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:44,960
Annies numbers

3148
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,752
We will constantly throw out in this

3149
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:49,056
Conflict which are enormous numbers

3150
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:51,104
They failed to register at

3151
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,896
Why you become numb

3152
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:57,248
Take what the last several days on the Western Front

3153
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,272
I've done to France

3154
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,320
So we said 75000 dead

3155
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:02,880
More than 250 thousand wounded

3156
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:07,232
In a couple of days how would our modern medical establishment deal with

3157
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:08,512
Places like that

3158
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:12,864
Forget what it's like on the ground that's why you need these reports that come from people

3159
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,632
Who were there

3160
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:16,960
In one of the most famous books ever written

3161
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,520
Now it can be told

3162
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:21,824
A British reporter named Phillip Gibbs

3163
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,104
Went over to the continent

3164
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,896
Right when this whole conflict breaks out

3165
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:26,688
And he reported from it

3166
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:28,480
You know during the Great retreat

3167
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:34,880
Now what he reported that made it into the media is not what he put in the book cuz what do you put in the bookie can't he couldn't tell

3168
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:35,648
Tell during the war

3169
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:38,208
This is the kind of nasty stuff

3170
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:40,256
That none of the government would allow me

3171
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,024
Republished

3172
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:41,792
It was too raw

3173
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:42,816
Yuan to real

3174
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,608
That's why Gibbs named his book

3175
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:47,680
Now it can be told cuz after the war he wrote it

3176
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:53,312
He described the conditions during the Great Retreat and the human suffering and he reminds us

3177
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,592
You know what

3178
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:57,152
It means to have that level of

3179
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:59,456
Death and destruction and injuries

3180
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:02,784
What kind of injuries were talking about remember this is like having

3181
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:06,112
What 5/8 football stadiums

3182
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:11,232
Were the people in a few days injured and we're not talking about hangnails

3183
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:13,280
And sprained ankles here

3184
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,120

Ramya at night head, French army in retreat

3188
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,872
There were dead and wounded on their wagons

3189
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:31,200
Cuirassier stumble did they let their tired horses

3190
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:33,504
Crowds of people with white faces

3191
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:35,296
Like ghosts in the dark

3192
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:39,136
Stared at their men retreating like this through their City

3193
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,184
I knew that the enemy was close behind

3194
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:45,536
No sampa do Whisperer the woman and gave a wailing cry

3195
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:51,424
People were fighting their way into railroad trucks at every station for hundreds of miles across northern France

3196
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:54,496
Women were besieging a place for the sake of their baby

3197
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:58,080
There was no food for them on journeys of 19 hours or more

3198
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:59,104
They fainted from

3199
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,128
From heat and hunger

3200
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:03,456
An old woman died in her corpse blocked up the laboratory

3201
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:07,296
At night they slept on the pavement in cities invaded by Fugitive

3202
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:14,208
Epernay in Belgium and it Dunkirk on the coast of France there were Columns of ambulance is bringing in an endless

3203
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:14,976
Tide of wounded

3204
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:18,560
They were laid out stretcher by stretcher in station yards

3205
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:20,352
500 at a time

3206
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:23,168
Some of their faces were masks of clotted blood

3207
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,472
Some of the bodies were horribly torn

3208
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:27,520
They breathed with a hard snuffle

3209
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:29,056
A foul smell came

3210
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:33,664
Headshot red they were swelling over the station hallwood disinfecting fluid

3211
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,712
After getting through with one day's wounded

3212
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:40,064
The French doctor in charge and received a telegram from the director of Medical Services

3213
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:42,624
Make ready for 40000 wounded

3214
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:44,928
It was during the first battle of the Marne

3215
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:46,208
It is impossible

3216
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:47,232
Set a French doctor

3217
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,304
400000 people were in flight for man

3218
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:52,608
Into which big shells were falling

3219
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:57,216
As English correspondence flatten themselves against the walls and said God in heaven

3220
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:04,128
250000 people coming across the Shelf in rowing boat sailing crafts and rash invade

3221
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:05,408
Did one Village in Holland

3222
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:06,688
They had no food

3223
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:08,480
Children were mad with fright

3224
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:10,784
Young mothers had no milk in their breast

3225
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:15,392
It was cold at night and there were only a few Canal boats in Fisherman's cottages

3226
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:17,440
Is henan them were crowds of fugitive

3227
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:20,000
The odor of human filth exuded from the

3228
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,536
As I smell it now

3229
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:23,072
And it sickens me and remember

3230
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:24,608
And quote

3231
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:27,936
This is a human tragedy

3232
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,728
Of monumental

3233
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:30,496
Portions

3234
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:33,056
I have to keep telling myself it's just getting started

3235
02:29:33,824 --> 02:29:35,616
The French of lost in a couple of days

3236
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:42,272
What do United States more than the United States lost in terms of killed and wounded in the 10-year involvement they had in the Vietnam War

3237
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,808
In a few days

3238
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:46,112
That right there should put the

3239
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:48,928
Lie to the idea that the French are somehow

3240
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,208
Nicholle Tom

3241
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:52,768
In what American surrender monkeys

3242
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:57,120
They're not surrendering their standing and dying on French soil

3243
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:01,984
You know for the sake of just buying their comrades a little extra time

3244
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:04,800
Francis showing not only that the French can take a punch

3245
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:07,360
Which I think everyone at this time. Was fully aware

3246
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:09,664
Wanted Modern nation-state

3247
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:10,432
Can

3248
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:12,480
It's a mixed blessing now

3249
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,784
In the same way that

3250
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,064
Boxer say that

3251
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:20,672
A clean early quick knockout is more merciful than a long punishing fight

3252
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,464
There are historians who say

3253
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,536
Maybe it would have been better for European

3254
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:29,376
Culture civilization standards their golden age if you will

3255
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:30,912
The Germans who just won this war

3256
02:30:32,704 --> 02:30:38,080
You would had sort of a Changing of the Guard of the great Powers the Germans moving into a more prominent position

3257
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:41,664
Remember there are new country only about 44 45 years

3258
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:44,224
In existence and they've been moving up the

3259
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:45,504
In a power chart

3260
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:48,832
Ever since with a bullet as they say in radio but it works here 2

3261
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:52,672
Maybe this just seems like a natural progression of things

3262
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:59,328
And if you could save all the casualties that we know are coming in a multi-year long Carnage fast with

3263
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,352
U2 later

3264
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:07,776
And maybe save countries from communism and Nazism maybe prevent a second world war in the cold war after that

3265
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:12,128
Me the Dominos that fall if you talk about this war maybe ending here

3266
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,152
Well you can play

3267
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,176
Brevard County

3268
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,200
You can see

3269
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:19,808
Knowing how bad it's going to get and how bad it already is why some historians have wondered how

3270
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,832
Anything

3271
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:22,624
It wouldn't be better

3272
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:24,416
Then what they're going to experience

3273
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:31,840
If you are friends you may say to yourself we would never have wanted to live under the German boot in a victory was all-important

3274
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:33,376
But what if you could

3275
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,144
Have all those French

3276
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:34,912
Who died

3277
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:36,448
In the rest of the story by

3278
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:39,264
If you can avoid the Second World War

3279
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,056
When does it become worth

3280
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:43,360
Same thing to the Germans I mean

3281
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:44,896
You look back and say what if we could

3282
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:45,664
Could have those p

3283
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,968
What if we can have that wealth back

3284
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:50,272
But what if we could have

3285
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:51,808
That time

3286
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:55,392
And where we were in 1900

3287
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,720
Call crying over

3288
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,488
Historical

3289
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:00,256
Spilled milk

3290
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,024
But it doesn't prove

3291
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:03,072
Historians from doing that all the time

3292
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:05,120
And has even less of a

3293
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:07,424
Intubation on people like

3294
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,216
Yours Truly who are historians at all

3295
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:13,056
The question of what decision should have happen

3296
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,336
Is obviously

3297
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,616
Historically moot point

3298
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:17,408
The question of what's going to have

3299
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:19,712
Is about to be determine now

3300
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:23,552
And one of the things that soda makes this battle what it is

3301
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:25,856
Shaping up his battles even the right word for

3302
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:28,672
Is it everybody kind of knows it's coming

3303
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:31,744
It's either coming or the war's over

3304
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,096
Basically the Germans are moving forward across almost the entire law

3305
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:39,936
Line and the French and British are moving backwards across almost the entire life

3306
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:41,984
Fine and at some point they got to turn

3307
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:44,032
They got to make a stand

3308
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:46,336
They've got a punch the Germans in the nose

3309
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:51,200
Or there's nothing that's going to stop them in the problem is is it everybody's at the end of their rope

3310
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:56,832
Everybody has been marching and fighting for Daisy's units that weren't missing a buckle

3311
02:32:57,088 --> 02:33:02,208
You know in parades across Belgium at the Germans started this war missing a heck of a lot more than that

3312
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:04,000
Hazard the other Allied armies

3313
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:05,536
This is why

3314
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:06,304
It's so important

3315
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:07,072
If you can actually get

3316
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:08,096
Fresh troops into the

3317
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:08,864
The combat

3318
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,400
Who don't look the way

3319
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:15,008
In a free example these soldiers that have been in contact now for almost 2 weeks look

3320
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,568
At one point during his inspections

3321
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:22,176
Jeffers riding around and he runs into some French soldiers and Barbara tuchman describes

3322
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:28,576
The Experience quote on the same day August 30th jafra visited the front of the third and fourth Army

3323
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:31,136
To look for forces he could have signed to Foss

3324
02:33:31,648 --> 02:33:32,160
Another French

3325
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:33,952
Talking content

3326
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:37,792
On the road he passed the retreating columns would fought in the yard in

3327
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:39,328
And on the heights of the muse

3328
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:41,632
Red trousers had faded to the color

3329
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:42,400
Pale brick

3330
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:44,704
Coats were ragged and torn

3331
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,496
Shoes caked with mud

3332
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:49,824
Eyes cavernous in faces dulled by exhaustion

3333
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:52,128
And dark with many days growth of beard

3334
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:55,968
20 days campaigning seem to have aged the soldiers as many years

3335
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:59,040
They walked heavily as if ready to drop it every step

3336
02:33:59,296 --> 02:34:01,600
Emaciated horses with bone sticking out

3337
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:05,184
And with bleeding harness sores sometimes dropped in the shaft

3338
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:07,744
We're hurriedly on harness by the artillerymen

3339
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,072
And dragged off to the side of the road so as not to obstruct away

3340
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:13,376
Guns look old and blistered

3341
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:17,728
With barely a few patches of there once knew gray paint showing through the mud and dirt

3342
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:19,264
And quote

3343
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:23,104
Are Irish friend from the bef John Lucy

3344
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:25,408
Entitles a whole chapter of his book

3345
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,688
Sleep marching

3346
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:29,760
He talks about how there were people that we just stopped

3347
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:30,784
At the side of the road

3348
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:35,648
And not care if the Germans were going to capture them they wouldn't move for anything everybody was

3349
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:36,928
Exhausted

3350
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:37,696
And

3351
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,744
You know we had talked about how the Russian

3352
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:46,144
Supply and Logistics and all that was falling apart because they weren't one of the best armies out here trying to cope with a new modern reality

3353
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:50,240
Will the Germans probably are the best army trying to cope with a new modern realities

3354
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,288
And their Logistics aren't keeping up

3355
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:53,056
Either

3356
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:59,456
I mean perfect example is the number of shells that they're using in the number of bullets they're using is so far greater than anything

3357
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:00,480
Anyone have predicted

3358
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:01,760
They're running out

3359
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:03,040
The rationing

3360
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:09,184
Some of these generals are are limited to a few shells a day for their gun it makes it very difficult to fight the kind of battle

3361
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:13,792
That you know on paper the German pre-war planned

3362
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,072
Pencil depended on

3363
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:22,240
This is where the operational plans design before the war whether you want to call in the Schlieffen Plan to sleep in bulk

3364
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:25,312
The plant or just whenever it was the German general thought they were going to do

3365
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,640
Doesn't ever take into account enough

3366
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:30,688
The human element in the variables

3367
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:32,992
It's wonderfully planned

3368
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,016
And

3369
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:38,112
T's crossed and I's dotted but there are things you just can't know

3370
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:41,440
You can't know how tired people are going to get how quickly

3371
02:35:41,696 --> 02:35:45,792
You can't know how many times they can fight battles before they can't fight anymore

3372
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:48,096
And you can't predict when they were going to be things

3373
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:50,400
Like hold up some food

3374
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,424
And supplies

3375
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:55,520
Asleep in molka plan or whatever you want to call it

3376
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:58,336
Is falling apart do to the human variable

3377
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:00,640
The number one human variable is

3378
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:05,760
Klook and Von Bulow first and second Army troops cannot March 15

3379
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,808
Or 20 miles a day

3380
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:09,344
Every single day

3381
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:13,952
While fighting battles and getting far ahead of their supplies and not eating them in there just

3382
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:19,072
They're worn down by the time they reached this stage in the war these vaunted you know

3383
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:20,608
Tips of the spear

3384
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:23,168
Are worn down to a Dominus in fact

3385
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:25,728
They're almost down to 50% strength

3386
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,800
What's more remember they had units pulled from them

3387
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:33,408
Uniform over the last several weeks most took some and put them down south and gave them to Prince Rupert

3388
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:36,736
He sent a couple to the east to help against the Russians

3389
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:41,088
Just when you kind of want some nice fresh troops to throw into this thing they aren't there

3390
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:44,928
The troops you do have though

3391
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:48,256
Are very excited about the prospect of ending this war

3392
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,536
And capturing Paris

3393
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:52,608
A member of on klook staff

3394
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:54,400
Talks about how

3395
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:56,704
Getting nearby Paris

3396
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:59,264
Has re-energized exhausted men

3397
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:00,544
Quote

3398
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,080
Our soldiers are worn out

3399
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:05,408
For 4 days they've been marching 40 kilometers a day

3400
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,688
The ground is difficult

3401
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,224
The roads are torn up

3402
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,504
Trees felled

3403
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,320
The fields pitted by she'll like strainers

3404
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:14,624
The soldiers staggered every step

3405
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,928
Their faces are plastered with dust

3406
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:18,464
Their uniforms are in rags

3407
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:20,768
One might call them living rag bag

3408
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:22,816
They march with closed eyes

3409
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:26,144
And singing chorus to keep from falling asleep as they March

3410
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,448
The certainty of Victory close at hand

3411
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:30,496
End of their triumphal entry into Paris

3412
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:31,520
Sustains them

3413
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:33,056
And whipped up their enthusiasm

3414
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:35,104
Without the certainty of victory

3415
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,384
They would fall exhausted

3416
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,176
They would lie down with a r

3417
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:40,992
To sleep at last no matter where no matter how

3418
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:44,576
Had to give their bodies a drunken this like that of their souls

3419
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:45,856
They drink enormously

3420
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:48,416
But this drunkenness also helps to keep them up

3421
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:49,952
Today after an inspection

3422
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:52,000
The general was furiously angry

3423
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:54,304
He wanted to put an end to this Collective debauch

3424
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:57,120
We just persuaded him not to give severe orders

3425
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,912
It is better not to be too strict

3426
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:01,216
Otherwise the Army could not go on at all

3427
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:04,800
For this abnormal weariness abnormal stimulants are needed

3428
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:06,336
In Paris we shall remedy all

3429
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:08,640
And quote

3430
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,200
Indeed

3431
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:12,992
When they saw signs

3432
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:14,528
Saying that Paris was

3433
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,344
2022-23 miles in the distance

3434
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:20,160
It was as though they been giving a B12 shot

3435
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:23,488
1 German officer

3436
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:24,512
On September 3rd

3437
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:25,280
Bro quote

3438
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:28,608
One of our battalions was marching wearily forward

3439
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:29,376
All at once

3440
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:31,168
While passing a Cross Road

3441
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:32,704
They discovered a signpost

3442
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,984
On which they read

3443
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:34,752
Paris

3444
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:36,288
37 km

3445
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,848
It was the first sign post that had not been a race

3446
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:43,200
I'm seeing at the Battalion was as though shaken up by an electric current

3447
02:38:43,456 --> 02:38:44,224
The word

3448
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:47,296
Paris which they have just read drives me crazy

3449
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:49,600
Some of them Embrace The Wretched signpost

3450
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,880
Others dance around

3451
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:54,976
Prized yells of enthusiasm accompany these mad actions

3452
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:58,048
This signpost is there evidence that we are near Paris

3453
02:38:58,304 --> 02:39:00,608
Without a doubt we shall soon really be there

3454
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:02,912
This notice board has had a miraculous effect

3455
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:03,936
Faces light up

3456
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:05,984
Weariness seems to disappear

3457
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,520
The marches resume

3458
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:08,288
Alert

3459
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,056
Cadence

3460
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:11,616
In spite of the Abominable ground in the forest

3461
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:13,664
Songs burst forth louder

3462
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:14,944
And quote

3463
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:18,016
One can only imagine the disappointment

3464
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:19,552
Those soldiers must have

3465
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,856
I felt and probably a little bit of bewilderment

3466
02:39:22,368 --> 02:39:23,648
When on August 31st

3467
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:25,184
They change course

3468
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:27,232
Instead of heading toward Paris.

3469
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:29,792
Make a sort of a left hand turn

3470
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,328
So then

3471
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,864
They're going to march by Paris

3472
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:34,656
I'm going to see it on there right

3473
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:40,800
And supposedly according to the accounts some of uncooked soldiers were able to see the Eiffel Tower

3474
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:41,568
In the distance

3475
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:43,360
Imagine the

3476
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:46,688
Confusion and disappointment in

3477
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:51,040
That must have been some bewilderment like what are we doing their parents were right there

3478
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:54,112
Believe me the government in

3479
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:55,392
Paris realizes

3480
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:59,488
On September 2nd a flea they had to Bordeaux which is as far away

3481
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:01,536
As you can get from where the Germans are

3482
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:02,304
Without

3483
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:05,120
You're not being in France anymore

3484
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:05,888
Costa Mesa

3485
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:06,912
The Bay of Biscay

3486
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:09,216
So they leave a lot of refugees leave

3487
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:15,104
And the soldiers who think okay the city is basically wide open for us and we're heading in a different direction

3488
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:17,920
This turn

3489
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,712
Body soldiers

3490
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:21,760
A different direction will create

3491
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:23,040
A million questions

3492
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:25,600
And a million opportunities

3493
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:30,976
And it will make this story almost impossible to understand if you're even able to

3494
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:32,512
This point

3495
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:36,352
The battle that is shaping up here is the most complicated

3496
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:37,632
I've ever encountered

3497
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:40,192
It takes forever

3498
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:46,592
To really try to understand this and then once you think you got it you can't figure out how to explain it to anyone it doesn't even

3499
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:47,616
Really meet the

3500
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:49,920
Definition of Battle at all

3501
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:52,224
What's understand wife

3502
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:52,992
Possible

3503
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:56,064
Remember we've been comparing this little conflict here

3504
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:57,600
2/8 heavyweight

3505
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:58,368
Fight

3506
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,672
And you know they often have three knockdown

3507
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:05,024
Which means you know if you're knocked down three times in any one round the fight over

3508
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:08,608
The French at this point been knocked down twice in the first round

3509
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:12,448
There's nothing seemingly to keep it from happening again

3510
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,728
Except

3511
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,032
That giant of a man

3512
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:18,592
Who comes into his own now

3513
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:22,944
You're the first World Wars version of the second world war Churchill

3514
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:24,480
But for friends

3515
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:26,016
Joseph

3516
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
Chakra

3517
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:30,368
This is where he makes his name this is his moment in history

3518
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:35,232
This is his Destiny right here you know his Churchill had said I felt like I had lived

3519
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:37,280
My whole life just for this moment

3520
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:41,120
Jafra is exactly what friends needs now and what they missed in 19

3521
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:41,888
40

3522
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:42,912
This is when he

3523
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:43,936
Take charge

3524
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:47,520
And performs miracles in his one of his generals later said I don't know what we would

3525
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:53,920
As we said earlier it's possible they're only in this situation because of poor decisions

3526
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:58,272
By the guy earlier during The Blind chess-playing Side of this thing

3527
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:00,320
But now when everyone panicking

3528
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:03,136
And the French government is moving as far away as they can

3529
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:08,768
And the British commander on the scenes pretty sure the war's already over and is worried about how he gets his army out of here

3530
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:13,632
And the Kaiser slapping everybody on the back of his Churchill says is in the Haram mood

3531
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:16,448
And everything looks really good for the Germans at this point

3532
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:19,776
And the French could easily lose hard here

3533
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:20,544
Except

3534
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,336
Jafra is taking charge

3535
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:25,152
And starts by firing

3536
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:26,176
Generals that are

3537
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:30,272
Within about a week or ten days

3538
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:32,320
Afires 140 of

3539
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:35,136
2 of 5 army commands

3540
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:37,184
9 core command

3541
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:40,256
38 of 82 divisional General

3542
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:42,816
Who's replacing them

3543
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:44,352
With much

3544
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:45,376
Much better

3545
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:46,400
People he even said

3546
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:47,936
A lot of these guys were great

3547
02:42:48,192 --> 02:42:51,776
Professor Snape taught at the Academy well another word good peacetime General

3548
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:58,176
He's replacing them with people who've already demonstrated in this short. Of time that they can get the job done their Phi

3549
02:42:58,432 --> 02:43:00,224
Fighting General their names are famous their phone

3550
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:01,504
The pathan

3551
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:02,784
Theguardian

3552
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:05,600
And they're going to help

3553
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:08,416
Turn the tide here

3554
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:10,976
As soon as they get some troops to work

3555
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,280
And that's what she offered does next

3556
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:16,352
It gets involved in figuring out ways

3557
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:18,912
To get troops to The crucial points in the Bible

3558
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:23,008
Changes his strategy right after the battle of the Frontiers

3559
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:26,592
You know to have all this offensive operations he has people sit down

3560
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:33,504
And hold off the Germans on the defensive while he figures out a way to get enough troops to the important place to me

3561
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:34,528
Make things happen

3562
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:37,600
And during all of this

3563
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:40,160
The guy is absolutely

3564
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:41,952
Freakishly huh

3565
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:44,512
Which is exactly

3566
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:48,096
What France needs this time remember we said the art of generalship

3567
02:43:48,608 --> 02:43:49,120
He's kind of

3568
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:49,888
Bringing

3569
02:43:50,144 --> 02:43:54,752
What qualities you bring to the table to bear at the right time and of course there's a little luck involved

3570
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:56,032
In that too

3571
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:57,312
This is Jaffa

3572
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:58,080
First time

3573
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:02,176
And while all the Panic was going on

3574
02:44:02,944 --> 02:44:03,712
EJ Meyer

3575
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:04,736
Says

3576
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,272
Shaffer was in

3577
02:44:06,528 --> 02:44:07,040
Perturbed

3578
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:10,112
Quote in the midst of it all

3579
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:11,648
Jaffa remained impassive

3580
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:13,440
Maddeningly silent

3581
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:14,208
Call

3582
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:20,608
No matter how alarming the situation how terrible the emergency the tall and Rotunda generalissimo

3583
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:21,888
Never seemed Disturbed

3584
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,704
He became famous for the care he always took

3585
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:25,984
To have a good lunch

3586
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,008
Followed by an app

3587
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:30,336
End the day with a good dinner and always get a full night's

3588
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:33,152
Sleep in bed at 9 back to work at 5

3589
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,712
Even when things seem to be at their worst

3590
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:36,736
My rights

3591
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:41,856
He made his staff understand that under no circumstances was his rest to be disturb

3592
02:44:42,368 --> 02:44:45,952
Between mealtimes and bedtimes he was steadily on the move

3593
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:50,048
Using a big touring car driven by a Grand Prix racing champion

3594
02:44:50,304 --> 02:44:52,096
To make repeated visits to his General

3595
02:44:52,352 --> 02:44:53,888
Especially those on the left

3596
02:44:55,936 --> 02:45:00,288
Does he was able to keep himself in touch with events and observe his subordinates in action

3597
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:01,568
And quote

3598
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:02,592
And Fire

3599
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:04,128
Obviously

3600
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:06,944
But what this is doing is steadily creating

3601
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:09,504
The better leadership in key positions

3602
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:12,832
Learning from mistakes and taking real-time knowledge knot

3603
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:14,112
Theory and applying it

3604
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:15,904
Taking men

3605
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:17,440
Phuket inspired

3606
02:45:17,696 --> 02:45:18,208
Troops

3607
02:45:18,464 --> 02:45:18,976
In Hope

3608
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:20,000
The situation

3609
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:23,840
Course Joshua doesn't command all the Jenner

3610
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:25,376
In this war

3611
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:26,400
Decide

3612
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:28,704
He's fighting a coalition battle in

3613
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:32,288
British Army that makes up a part of his battle line

3614
02:45:33,056 --> 02:45:33,568
That is

3615
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:34,336
Hesitant

3616
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:36,384
About involving itself

3617
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:38,944
In anything involving combat at the MoMA

3618
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:41,760
Sir John French

3619
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,552
The ironically named leader of the

3620
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:45,088
British expeditionary Force

3621
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:46,112
Doesn't trust

3622
02:45:47,648 --> 02:45:53,792
He thinks he's already had his flank exposed once and then put in great danger he doesn't see any evidence that the French can be

3623
02:45:54,048 --> 02:45:55,328
You trusted to win this war

3624
02:45:56,608 --> 02:45:58,912
I mean the Germans and basically thrown

3625
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:00,448
On the Schlieffen Plan

3626
02:46:00,704 --> 02:46:02,752
If there ever was one out the window here

3627
02:46:03,264 --> 02:46:09,407
An attack along the entire franco-german border which is that area that is so well protected by French for

3628
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:11,455
Did the Germans thought it worth

3629
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:14,015
Violating Belgium's neutrality

3630
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:16,319
I'm bringing the British into the war

3631
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:19,647
Just so they could avoid that area and those forts

3632
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:25,023
Well now you know three weeks into the war they were attacking along that entire front and if they break through

3633
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:27,327
They will completely surround the French and destroyed

3634
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:35,007
The problem is at those forts were originally avoided for a reason they're formidable and all of a sudden the French troops in that

3635
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:35,775
Terraria

3636
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:39,103
Are doing a pretty decent job on the defensive they're still losing lots

3637
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:41,663
The people but all of a sudden they get a chance to find out

3638
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:45,503
That this war that we're going to call the first World War

3639
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:50,879
Is the one where the defense has the temporary dominance over the offense in the French

3640
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:57,279
In the last battle only days ago we're doing bayonet charges in advancing in close order and all those things you're not supposed

3641
02:46:57,535 --> 02:46:59,583
How to do standing up during the shrapnel attacks

3642
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:01,631
Now they get a chance to be the one

3643
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:02,655
Behind the machine gun

3644
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:03,679
And behind

3645
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:08,543
The field guns firing behind them into Germans advancing in the open

3646
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:11,871
While the French Gunners beat themselves little holes that are almost

3647
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:12,639
Deep enough to be

3648
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:14,431
He called trenches already

3649
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:16,479
And see what the power of Defense

3650
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:17,503
Means

3651
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:18,783
Enough for that

3652
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:25,183
The good news is they don't get overrun by Germans the bad news is it looks like they can spare a few troops

3653
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:29,023
Which is which offer is doing now this is where the real Miracle comes in

3654
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,071
The guy can scrounge troops from everywhere

3655
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:38,751
He pulls them off of the line and all these battles near the French Fortress line with a French need every man they've got shot first

3656
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:41,055
I need them elsewhere

3657
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:41,823
More

3658
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:48,223
He's taking newly returned wounded back he's got in a colonial troops coming on boats he's taking people from

3659
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:51,295
On the Far Western Anthony he's using the rail system

3660
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:54,623
To get them to him important concentration points fast

3661
02:47:55,647 --> 02:47:59,487
He creates a new Army he called the sixth and he puts it over by the

3662
02:47:59,999 --> 02:48:05,631
The flank of the British expeditionary Force creates another one called the night he puts it over as a reserve kind of by Paris

3663
02:48:05,887 --> 02:48:09,471
He doesn't want to have an Army in Paris which is a great Fortress actually

3664
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:12,031
But the government of France makes him have one

3665
02:48:12,287 --> 02:48:13,055
So they put

3666
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:16,895
Shoppers old Commander galliani

3667
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:18,175
In charge of it

3668
02:48:18,431 --> 02:48:24,575
And put him in Paris and basically everyone thinks you just going to stay there and you know man the walls with his man that's the plan anyway

3669
02:48:26,111 --> 02:48:29,439
Day after day more French trains are arriving in more troops

3670
02:48:29,951 --> 02:48:30,463
AR

3671
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:34,815
EOD training and moving over to the front over by Paris facing

3672
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:38,655
Another projected direction that the sledgehammer is going to fall

3673
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:43,263
Remember they're losing troops everyday they're down to half their original strength and here's

3674
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:44,031
ShopRite

3675
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:48,639
Everyday bringing in more French troops to face it all the sudden the numerical advantage

3676
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:49,663
Begin to diminish

3677
02:48:50,943 --> 02:48:51,711
And then

3678
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:53,247
On August 31st

3679
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:54,527
Aircraft

3680
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:55,295
Yes

3681
02:48:55,807 --> 02:48:59,391
Aircraft again starting to make an impact already in this early 20th century War

3682
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:00,927
Aircraft notice

3683
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:02,719
That the Germans have changed Direction

3684
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:08,095
The same thing we told you that those troops must have been bewildered by

3685
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:09,631
All of a sudden they're not heading to

3686
02:49:09,887 --> 02:49:10,399
George Harrison

3687
02:49:10,655 --> 02:49:11,423
What's going on

3688
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:15,007
And more importantly when they change direction

3689
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:17,055
They present their flanks

3690
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:18,591
To the

3691
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:20,639
In a newly-created force

3692
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:21,919
Especially the one

3693
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,687
In Paris

3694
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:25,503
Chance

3695
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:26,527
Brick counter

3696
02:49:27,295 --> 02:49:29,087
A chance to turn around

3697
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:31,391
You know the entire great retreat

3698
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,415
An attack

3699
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:36,511
Jafra needs to convince Sir John French of the bef

3700
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:40,607
That now is the time the opportunities there we need you

3701
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:41,887
And he gives one of the

3702
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:45,983
These great speeches this is the way he recorded himself and remember

3703
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:48,287
Sir John French doesn't speak French

3704
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:49,055
And

3705
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:50,079
The offer doesn't speak

3706
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:50,847
English

3707
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,639
And the translator

3708
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:56,991
Is another British general guy named Wilson who is much more diplomatic

3709
02:49:57,247 --> 02:50:00,319
And like the French much more than Sir John French.

3710
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:01,599
There's some

3711
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:03,391
Fun moments there too

3712
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:04,159
Here's what

3713
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:06,975
Shoppers on account of his encounter with French

3714
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:09,791
To try to convince him that now is the time to strike this was harappa

3715
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:12,863
Opportunity flop chant all the cards are on the table

3716
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:14,143
Shows that

3717
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:15,935
There was another side to this man

3718
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:17,215
And he wasn't just the

3719
02:50:17,471 --> 02:50:23,359
Impenetrable Obelisk will you couldn't figure out what that plastic look on his face men sometimes

3720
02:50:23,615 --> 02:50:25,407
He could be positively churchillian

3721
02:50:25,663 --> 02:50:26,687
And this was one of them

3722
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:29,247
He told French a suspicious

3723
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,551
And pessimistic French

3724
02:50:31,807 --> 02:50:32,319
Quote

3725
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:36,671
I put my whole soul into the effort to convince the field Marshal

3726
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:39,487
I told him that the decisive moment had arrived

3727
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:41,279
And that we must not let it Escape

3728
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:45,887
We must go to battle with every man both of us had and free from all reservations

3729
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:49,215
So far as the French army is concerned I continued

3730
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:50,495
My orders are given

3731
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:56,639
And whatever may happen I intend to throw my last company into the balance to win the Victory and save France

3732
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:59,711
It is in her name that I come to ask you for British assistance

3733
02:50:59,967 --> 02:51:02,527
And I are Urgent with all my power I have in me

3734
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:07,391
I cannot believe that the British army will refuse to do it Sharon the Supreme price

3735
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:09,951
History would severely judge your apps

3736
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:11,743
Then as I finished

3737
02:51:11,999 --> 02:51:14,815
Carried Away by my convictions in the gravity of the moment

3738
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:16,863
I remember bringing down my fish

3739
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:18,911
Start a table with student my elbow

3740
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:23,263
I'm trying miss you and the Marshal the honor of England is at stake

3741
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:24,543
Up to this point

3742
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:28,895
French and listened imperturbability to the officer was translating what I said

3743
02:51:29,151 --> 02:51:30,943
But now his face suddenly red

3744
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:33,503
There ensued a long impressive silence

3745
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:36,063
And then with visible emotion he murmured

3746
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:38,111
I will do all that I possibly can

3747
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,903
Not understanding English

3748
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:42,207
I asked Wilson what's your John had said

3749
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:45,279
He merely replied the field Marshal says yes

3750
02:51:46,047 --> 02:51:50,143
I had distinctly felt the emotion which team to grip the British commander in chief

3751
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:53,471
Above all Hydra Mark the tone of his voice and I felt

3752
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:55,775
How to get all the witnesses to the scene

3753
02:51:56,031 --> 02:52:00,127
But these simple words were equivalent to an agreement signed and sworn to

3754
02:52:01,151 --> 02:52:02,687
T which was already prepared

3755
02:52:03,199 --> 02:52:03,711
Was that answer

3756
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:05,247
And quote

3757
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:09,343
Barbara tuchman of course relates in a little bit more dramatic

3758
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,111
She says

3759
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:14,463
Did it tear welled up in Sir John French's I

3760
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:19,327
And it rolled down his cheek before he said I don't know how to tell him just tell him we'll do everything we can

3761
02:52:20,607 --> 02:52:21,119
Tornadoes

3762
02:52:21,375 --> 02:52:22,911
Critical dramatic moments

3763
02:52:23,935 --> 02:52:27,519
In history when you want that you want the guy who would have been the real bat

3764
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:28,287
First house

3765
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:29,055
Hardcore history

3766
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:32,639
Did Warren HG Wells would have to be Churchill wind it

3767
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:33,919
And in his thumb

3768
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:36,735
Account of the first world war was full of

3769
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:41,087
Churchillian bias all the things that you normally get with him what's fun about it is

3770
02:52:41,599 --> 02:52:43,391
Is no one explains it like he does

3771
02:52:43,647 --> 02:52:44,671
Even with the biases

3772
02:52:45,183 --> 02:52:45,951
And he was there

3773
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:48,255
Churchill's histories are always

3774
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:50,303
A combination of romance

3775
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:52,095
History

3776
02:52:52,351 --> 02:52:53,887
And if he's in them

3777
02:52:54,143 --> 02:52:55,935
In a personal Memoir 2

3778
02:52:57,215 --> 02:52:58,239
I love the way he sort of

3779
02:52:58,495 --> 02:52:59,007
Explained

3780
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:00,799
How many things had to line up

3781
02:53:01,055 --> 02:53:02,591
Right all along

3782
02:53:02,847 --> 02:53:03,615
Another War

3783
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:07,199
For this opportunity to be presented to the general

3784
02:53:07,455 --> 02:53:07,967
In Paris

3785
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:09,503
Cease

3786
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:11,551
Fun clocks first Army

3787
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,087
Turn their flank to him

3788
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:15,647
Churchill

3789
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:16,927
Quote

3790
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:23,327
Assuredly no human brain had conceived the design nor had human hands set the pieces on the board

3791
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:27,423
Several separate and discrepant series of events had flowed together

3792
02:53:27,679 --> 02:53:28,191
First

3793
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:30,751
The man galliani is on the spot

3794
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:33,823
Fixed in his Fortress he could not move toward the battle

3795
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:36,383
So the mighty battle has been made to come to him

3796
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:37,407
Second

3797
02:53:37,663 --> 02:53:39,199
The weapon has been placed in his hands

3798
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:40,735
The army of Metairie

3799
02:53:40,991 --> 02:53:42,527
He was giving him for one purpose

3800
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:44,063
The defense of Paris

3801
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:45,599
He will use it for another

3802
02:53:45,855 --> 02:53:47,391
A decisive maneuver in the field

3803
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:49,695
He was given him against the wishes Opera

3804
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:52,255
It will prove the means of jafra salvation

3805
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:53,279
3rd

3806
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:54,303
The opportunity

3807
02:53:54,815 --> 02:54:00,959
Swinging forward in Hot Pursuit Of as he believed the routed British and demoralized French will prison

3808
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:06,335
And his whole right flank and rear as he passes Paris to galliani and minori in his hand

3809
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:10,431
Observe not one of those factors would have counted without the other two

3810
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:12,991
All are interdependent all are here

3811
02:54:13,247 --> 02:54:14,271
And all are here now

3812
02:54:14,527 --> 02:54:17,087
Galliani realize the position in the Flash

3813
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:19,391
I dare not believe it he explained

3814
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:20,927
She's too good to be true

3815
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:22,207
But it is true

3816
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:22,975
Churchill right

3817
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:24,511
Confirmation rise

3818
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:25,791
Hour-by-hour

3819
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:27,839
He vibrates with enthusiasm

3820
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:29,375
And quote

3821
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:31,935
This is what sets up

3822
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:32,703
The famous battle

3823
02:54:35,007 --> 02:54:37,311
The most complicated battle you'll ever find

3824
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,407
The battle of the Marne is so hard to understand

3825
02:54:41,663 --> 02:54:42,175
For a couple of reasons

3826
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:46,271
The first one is just like the battle of the Frontiers that just recently happened

3827
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:48,319
Beast World War 1 battles

3828
02:54:48,575 --> 02:54:50,111
Are modern and scaling

3829
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:57,535
They are so much larger and so much longer than battles in the past worth I mean a hundred years ago Napoleon is being defeat

3830
02:54:57,791 --> 02:55:02,143
Seated at Waterloo a giant battle involving three Global powers

3831
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:06,239
And you could drive from one end of the battlefield to the other in no time

3832
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,799
You could see one side

3833
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:10,079
From the other

3834
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:11,103
But those little

3835
02:55:11,615 --> 02:55:13,663
Telescopes they would just put to their eye

3836
02:55:14,431 --> 02:55:18,271
The battle started in the morning and was over at the end of the day I mean

3837
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:19,807
That's a hundred years ago

3838
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:22,111
Now the battles last

3839
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:25,439
4 will this one will last for officially a week

3840
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:26,975
But really last longer than that

3841
02:55:27,487 --> 02:55:30,815
The battlefield is at least a hundred miles long depending on who you believe

3842
02:55:31,071 --> 02:55:32,607
Or the entire front

3843
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:34,399
You know according to other history

3844
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:36,191
You could legitimately

3845
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,215
Have fought

3846
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:39,007
At the Battle of the Marne

3847
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:40,287
And not know it

3848
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:46,431
Turn to a buddy that fought there with you saying that where we at the Marne was it was our fighting officially part of that

3849
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,199
Or not

3850
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:52,831
Because really it's a catch-all term for all the fighting that is going on

3851
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:55,903
When was really the Marne is all about happens which is

3852
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:58,463
That the great Retreat ends

3853
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:01,279
And the French and British armies turn around

3854
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:03,583
And launched into contact

3855
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:09,215
Got to be fair there are there parts of the front that have never not been in con

3856
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:10,751
In the south

3857
02:56:11,007 --> 02:56:16,127
They've been fighting pretty much since minute one and it's never stopped that's why if you told them that they were in the battle of the Marne

3858
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:19,455
They might not even understand it because they've never not been fighting

3859
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:22,015
Historians like

3860
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:26,623
Eric brose suggest that the battle of the marne is everything it was fought

3861
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:28,159
In this one area

3862
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:29,695
In from the center of

3863
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:30,975
France

3864
02:56:32,255 --> 02:56:33,023
He described it this way

3865
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:33,791
White quote

3866
02:56:34,047 --> 02:56:38,143
What has come to be known as the battle of the Marne should really be thought of as the Battle of France

3867
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:44,799
4 altogether 56 Allied and 43 and 1/2 German divisions engaged one another in a

3868
02:56:45,055 --> 02:56:45,823
Titanic struggle

3869
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:48,127
How long a line stretching from Paris

3870
02:56:48,383 --> 02:56:49,663
To the Eastern Frontier

3871
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:51,199
And quote

3872
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:54,015
Innocence would really happen

3873
02:56:55,039 --> 02:56:57,343
Is the opportunity that was presented

3874
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:58,879
Buy an open flag

3875
02:56:59,135 --> 02:56:59,647
As we said

3876
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:01,951
Fun clocks first Army turns

3877
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:03,487
Chose his flank

3878
02:57:03,743 --> 02:57:04,255
To Paris

3879
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:06,303
Paris now has an army

3880
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:08,863
I can hit him in the flank and here we're going to have a battle

3881
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:15,263
But that just becomes the opportunity that everybody was waiting for before they turn these armies around anyway

3882
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:17,055
This had to happen at some point

3883
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:18,847
This is France's last throw

3884
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:20,639
Everybody knows that

3885
02:57:20,895 --> 02:57:21,663
This has to occur

3886
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:27,807
The problem is is that the commanders who are actually with the troops not these guys at the General headquarters in the

3887
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:31,903
The highest staff officer the ones were marching with the actual soldiers

3888
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:33,439
Are Apollo

3889
02:57:34,207 --> 02:57:36,767
That this is being considered with the exception of a couple notable

3890
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:37,535
Commanders

3891
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:41,631
In one Commander one General supposedly looks like he's been hit in the head with a club

3892
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:44,447
When somebody said that they were going over to the attack

3893
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:48,287
His troops have been retreating for days and days and days

3894
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:51,359
At an amazing Pace their closer in rags there

3895
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:57,247
Weapons hardly fire their shoes are falling off their feet they can't stand cuz they're so sleepy and then you get the word

3896
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,527
Did you going to attack

3897
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:02,111
But several of these French generals that

3898
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:04,159
Jafra has Putin Commander

3899
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:04,927
Tough

3900
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:07,231
Hardcore fighting General to mean

3901
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:08,767
Ferdinand Fox's right

3902
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:11,071
During this encounter

3903
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:13,375
Quote attack whatever happened

3904
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:16,191
The Germans are at the extreme limit of their efforts

3905
02:58:16,447 --> 02:58:19,007
Victory will come to the side that Outlast the other

3906
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:20,287
And quote

3907
02:58:21,055 --> 02:58:22,847
The French General who takes over from

3908
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:26,431
Glenn Resnick at the 5th Army when juffer fires him

3909
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:32,831
Famously comes to the phone like one second after he takes command hears from a commander in the scene that says it's him

3910
02:58:33,087 --> 02:58:34,623
Possible his troops are falling down

3911
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:37,439
Why are they can't march and he says March or die

3912
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,767
Eyedropper issues his famous

3913
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:42,815
Notice to the armies

3914
02:58:43,327 --> 02:58:45,887
When he tells them that the great attack is beginning

3915
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:49,471
And it's a classic stand or die exhortation

3916
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:52,799
This is France leaving it all on the table

3917
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:55,103
Jafra announces

3918
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:57,151
The turnaround in the attack

3919
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:03,039
Really the recommencement of contact along the entire bottle line and we've seen

3920
02:59:03,295 --> 02:59:08,159
How deadly on a day-to-day basis contact with the enemy in 20th century Warfare is

3921
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:09,183
Announces it

3922
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:09,951
Tousley

3923
02:59:10,463 --> 02:59:10,975
Quote

3924
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:13,535
We are about to engage in a battle

3925
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:15,839
On which the fate of our country depends

3926
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:18,399
And it is important to remind all rank

3927
02:59:18,655 --> 02:59:21,215
That the moment has passed for looking to the rear

3928
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:25,567
All our efforts must be directed to attacking and driving back the enemy

3929
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:28,895
Troops that can advance no farther must at any price

3930
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:32,223
Hold onto the ground leave Concord and died on the spot

3931
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:33,503
Rather than give away

3932
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:37,855
Under the circumstances which phase has no active weakness can be tolerated

3933
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:39,391
And quote

General in charge of Paris gallieni

3936
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:45,791
And I think I pronounce his name

3937
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:47,583
Every time I've said it

3938
02:59:48,607 --> 02:59:49,631
But yeah

3939
02:59:49,887 --> 02:59:51,167
Famously is a spy

3940
02:59:51,679 --> 02:59:52,959
The general of 6th Army

3941
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:55,263
What their plans are if they're overrun

3942
02:59:55,519 --> 02:59:58,591
Noah Paris gets overrun the enemy of the runs and where we going to go

3943
02:59:59,103 --> 03:00:00,127
Annie looks again

3944
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:02,175
Says

3945
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,199
Nowhere

3946
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:05,247
This is it

3947
03:00:07,807 --> 03:00:11,391
Imperial War Museum oral historian Peter Hart describes

3948
03:00:11,647 --> 03:00:13,439
The Crux of the battle of the Marne

3949
03:00:14,207 --> 03:00:14,719
About it

3950
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:15,999
Well as anyone can in

3951
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:17,023
In the short space in Word

3952
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:18,815
He says quote

3953
03:00:19,071 --> 03:00:23,167
What followed was a complex battle that defies easy explanation

3954
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:28,287
By this time the German right-wing was actually outnumbered by the French divisions rushing up from the south

3955
03:00:28,543 --> 03:00:34,687
At the German first Army tried to turn to face the assault from the French 6th Army along the line of the river or

3956
03:00:34,943 --> 03:00:40,831
A huge Chasm of some Thirty miles opened up between Von cook and the second Army on his Left Flank

3957
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:47,231
Amidst the chaos the men of the bef having dutifully about turned found themselves advancing Allah

3958
03:00:47,487 --> 03:00:49,279
Alongside the French 5th Army

3959
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:50,303
Into the gap

3960
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:52,607
Between the German first and second armies

3961
03:00:52,863 --> 03:00:54,143
There was no great battle

3962
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:55,679
No huge drama

3963
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:57,983
What's a penetration between their armies

3964
03:00:58,239 --> 03:01:00,287
Threatened utter disaster for the Germans

3965
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:04,383
And on the 9th of September vodka order his right-wing to retreat

3966
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:06,175
And quote

3967
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:08,479
Now

3968
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:09,247
Peter Hart

3969
03:01:09,503 --> 03:01:11,039
It's a great reputable modernista

3970
03:01:11,807 --> 03:01:12,575
And that's about it

3971
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:14,879
As wonderful a passage There Was You

3972
03:01:15,647 --> 03:01:21,023
Ever hope to get from one of those folks but seat hit they would jettison some of their wonderful history ocity

3973
03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:27,423
And throw a little grandchildren drama maybe little exaggerations and romance in there you could get something like

3974
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:31,263
This from Churchill describes the same thing as only he can

3975
03:01:31,775 --> 03:01:32,799
And he says this

3976
03:01:33,055 --> 03:01:38,175
About the British army along with the French advancing into this crucial Gap that will change

3977
03:01:38,431 --> 03:01:42,527
This whole conflict and turn the battle of the Marne which let's be honest

3978
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:48,927
The French are once again taking it on the chin when they're in full contact with the fabulous German Army this is what will decide the UK

3979
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:49,695
Occasional

3980
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:52,255
And Churchill puts it in churchillian term

3981
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:57,375
Quote no human genius plans that the British army should Advance into this Gap

3982
03:01:57,631 --> 03:01:59,423
A series of tumultuous events

3983
03:01:59,679 --> 03:02:02,239
Cast them into this position in the line

3984
03:02:02,495 --> 03:02:03,263
When they advanced

3985
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:07,871
There was a gap in front of them on the whole front it was the line of least resistance

3986
03:02:08,127 --> 03:02:10,687
Along it they bored and punched

3987
03:02:10,943 --> 03:02:14,271
And it led into the Strategic vitals of the German right-wing

3988
03:02:14,783 --> 03:02:20,927
Hi Destiny blind fate regulated the none too vigorous but nevertheless decisive movements of this pretty

3989
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:21,695
Army

3990
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:22,975
It Marches On

3991
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:27,839
Wondering what has happened to the monster which is pursued it with whip and yell since mods

3992
03:02:28,351 --> 03:02:32,447
Von Bulow finds his right-wing being rolled back by V French army

3993
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:37,823
And himself cut off continually for his right hand to comrade fluke by the British advance

3994
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:41,151
Klook just as he's got himself into a fine position

3995
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:42,431
The fight manga read

3996
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,455
Find his left

3997
03:02:43,711 --> 03:02:44,991
And all the rear of his left

3998
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:47,295
Hopelessly compromised and expose

3999
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:48,575
And quote

4000
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:57,023
It's a crazy moment it reminds one of of of warfare in the 18th century they used to call

4001
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:03,423
Positional Warfare where a lot of the fighting was simply trying to you know March around the flank or get to a point where you

4002
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:07,775
Forester enemy into a place where they had to retreat just because of positioning

4003
03:03:08,287 --> 03:03:09,311
By accident

4004
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:10,847
As Churchill

4005
03:03:11,103 --> 03:03:11,615
So

4006
03:03:11,871 --> 03:03:12,895
Eloquently put it

4007
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:14,431
The British army

4008
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:16,223
At almost accidentally

4009
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:18,783
Probed its way into the German liver

4010
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:22,623
Doesn't get much better than that in terms of

4011
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,391
Bhai drama

4012
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:26,719
And it completely obscure is

4013
03:03:27,487 --> 03:03:31,583
You know the Soldier's perspective on the ground of which we have very little

4014
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:33,375
More and more

4015
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:38,239
First-hand account especially from the German side will be made available as the war goes on

4016
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:41,823
I keep having to tell myself that a lot of the people fighting in these battles

4017
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:43,871
Will never make it home

4018
03:03:44,127 --> 03:03:45,151
To write their memoirs

4019
03:03:46,175 --> 03:03:52,319
These are people who don't get to go home until either the war is over or they're so vitally injured they can't fight

4020
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:56,415
Anymore and a lot of the German soldiers on this front who might leave memoirs

4021
03:03:56,927 --> 03:04:01,023
Someone Like Yours Truly might be lucky enough to have translated into English

4022
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:03,071
Leave their bones on somebody

4023
03:04:04,863 --> 03:04:05,631
Nonetheless

4024
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:11,775
And one thing is clear I remember reading an account once and there's lots of accounts like these and you can specifically find them

4025
03:04:12,031 --> 03:04:14,847
In Publications that came out not long after the war

4026
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:20,479
I remember I have one in my house actually in many of you do too it's in a great series of books written just after the war

4027
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:23,295
And you read it and it's an account of this

4028
03:04:23,551 --> 03:04:27,391
Unbelievable battle it sounds like something out of the Lord of the Rings or some

4029
03:04:27,647 --> 03:04:29,695
Napoleonic thing with charges

4030
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:36,095
10000 Cavalry mowed down by cannons he's amazing heroic moments German heroism free

4031
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:37,119
French heroism

4032
03:04:37,375 --> 03:04:38,911
Really thrilling moving stuff

4033
03:04:39,423 --> 03:04:40,703
And it turns out that that

4034
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:42,495
That's just one of the little battles

4035
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:46,847
Well I mean comparatively that form something called The Battle of Nancy

4036
03:04:47,615 --> 03:04:50,431
The Battle of Nancy is just something that formed apart of

4037
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:51,967
The battle of the Marne

4038
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:54,527
There are individual

4039
03:04:54,783 --> 03:04:55,295
Stories

4040
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:59,135
Many battles whose names have been forgotten by almost everyone

4041
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:00,415
The Forum

4042
03:05:00,927 --> 03:05:01,695
The whole

4043
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:03,231
The battle of the Marne

4044
03:05:03,743 --> 03:05:04,255
Is it

4045
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:10,911
Human tragedy is we said earlier about with the civilians are suffering on a mass scale in the drama and the suffering and the heroism

4046
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:13,727
And the stories that would break our hearts if we knew them

4047
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:16,543
Are going on up and down the line from Switzerland

4048
03:05:17,311 --> 03:05:21,919
To the Belgian Border in fact they're going on in the Eastern Front to we haven't even talked about

4049
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:25,247
The simultaneous events that are happening while this is going on

4050
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:31,903
The armies of ludendorff and Hindenburg in the East are wrapping up their conflict are against rent in comps Army after tannenberg

4051
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:32,927
In

4052
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:34,975
Delicia which is over

4053
03:05:35,999 --> 03:05:42,143
Kind of weird austro-hungarian Poland and Russian interest meet there a terrible battles going on the austro-hungarians are getting smash

4054
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:47,007
Smashed in a way that they will never recover from and this is all happening at the same time

4055
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:49,567
Part of what makes this conflict

4056
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:50,335
So

4057
03:05:50,591 --> 03:05:52,639
Disorienting for everyone who's facing it

4058
03:05:53,151 --> 03:05:56,735
How quickly it's all happened when you think about the second world war for example

4059
03:05:56,991 --> 03:05:57,759
Realize

4060
03:05:58,271 --> 03:06:01,599
That there's no big fighting between the major powers

4061
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:03,647
For about 8 months after

4062
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:06,719
The second world war is declared Hitler goes into Poland Poland

4063
03:06:06,975 --> 03:06:10,559
That's all quick and relatively painless

4064
03:06:10,815 --> 03:06:12,351
By World War standards

4065
03:06:12,863 --> 03:06:14,655
It'll be eight months before the Germans

4066
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:18,751
In a real big contact with French and British armies

4067
03:06:19,263 --> 03:06:20,799
This war is 3 weeks old

4068
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:23,615
And all the major participants of class

4069
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:24,639
Head on

4070
03:06:24,895 --> 03:06:27,199
There's more than a million people dead

4071
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:29,503
This is the worst nightmare

4072
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:32,319
Of every pre-war prophet

4073
03:06:32,575 --> 03:06:33,343
Predicting

4074
03:06:33,855 --> 03:06:39,999
And what was going to happen when you combined the mass armies that the Napoleonic era Unleashed on steroid

4075
03:06:40,255 --> 03:06:41,279
By the way

4076
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:43,839
With the modern technology and weapons

4077
03:06:44,095 --> 03:06:46,143
And systems that were being developed

4078
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:47,679
All through the 1800

4079
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:49,727
This is a great

4080
03:06:49,983 --> 03:06:50,495
Filter

4081
03:06:51,007 --> 03:06:54,847
When you lose more than a million people in the first blink-of-an-eye

4082
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:56,127
And the Warriors now

4083
03:06:56,383 --> 03:06:58,687
Obviously going to last a while

4084
03:06:59,199 --> 03:07:02,527
How many people are going to die before this thing reaches a resolution

4085
03:07:03,551 --> 03:07:04,319
What is a resume

4086
03:07:06,879 --> 03:07:10,207
Again to simplify it what really happens is when the entire

4087
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:12,767
French and British line turns around

4088
03:07:13,023 --> 03:07:15,071
And smashes back into the German line

4089
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:16,863
There's one spot where

4090
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:17,887
They just penetrate

4091
03:07:18,143 --> 03:07:20,447
There's nothing really in front of them and that's the spotted

4092
03:07:20,703 --> 03:07:21,215
The bef

4093
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:24,031
The British expeditionary forces French forces go through

4094
03:07:24,543 --> 03:07:25,055
And

4095
03:07:25,311 --> 03:07:26,847
She had Von klook

4096
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:31,711
And Von Bulow not already been fighting somebody they could have turned

4097
03:07:31,967 --> 03:07:35,807
And crushed these forces that were penetrating into that Gap

4098
03:07:36,831 --> 03:07:37,855
But they are fighting other

4099
03:07:38,111 --> 03:07:39,903
The people that's known as pinning the enemy

4100
03:07:40,415 --> 03:07:45,791
Klook is fighting those forces that are coming at him from Paris Von Bulow fighting other armies so they can't

4101
03:07:46,047 --> 03:07:49,631
And if they do turn then the Army's they were fighting or hitting them in the back

4102
03:07:50,143 --> 03:07:50,655
They're trapped

4103
03:07:51,423 --> 03:07:52,959
The only thing they can do

4104
03:07:53,215 --> 03:07:57,055
To alleviate this open flank issue is to pull back

4105
03:07:59,615 --> 03:08:00,639
Von moltke

4106
03:08:01,151 --> 03:08:02,431
When all this is going on

4107
03:08:04,991 --> 03:08:06,527
And if you ask me

4108
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:07,551
Understand

4109
03:08:07,807 --> 03:08:08,319
Tolisso

4110
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:10,367
This is a guy who's been under

4111
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:12,927
Tremendous pressure already

4112
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:13,951
And

4113
03:08:14,463 --> 03:08:16,511
As he watches this plan

4114
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:20,095
So important that for years and have been known as

4115
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:21,887
Dare Todd bday

4116
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:24,959
When this plan is finally used in a whatever the heck

4117
03:08:25,215 --> 03:08:29,055
Plan was really this the day means the day that the Germans launched the war

4118
03:08:29,823 --> 03:08:31,615
He's watching it collapsed in front of his eyes

4119
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:34,431
Realizing also

4120
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:35,711
That this

4121
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:39,039
We'll all be blamed on him he's coming apart at the

4122
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:42,879
He writes to his wife

4123
03:08:43,903 --> 03:08:44,671
As all of this has been

4124
03:08:44,927 --> 03:08:45,439
Becoming clear

4125
03:08:45,695 --> 03:08:46,207
Quote

4126
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:51,583
I cannot find words to describe the crushing responsibility that is weight upon my shoulders

4127
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:54,911
During the last few days and still weighs on me today

4128
03:08:55,167 --> 03:09:00,031
The appalling difficulties of our present situation hang before my eyes like a dark curtain

4129
03:09:00,543 --> 03:09:01,567
Through which I can see nothing

4130
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:03,871
And quote

4131
03:09:04,895 --> 03:09:07,199
One of Von moltke staff officers

4132
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:09,247
A colonel named Bauer

4133
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:11,039
Broke quote

4134
03:09:11,551 --> 03:09:17,439
Desperate Panic seized severely the entire Army would be more correct the greater part of its leaders

4135
03:09:17,695 --> 03:09:20,255
It looked at its worst at the Supreme command

4136
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:22,047
Mocha completely collapse

4137
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:25,375
He sat with a palette face gazing at the map

4138
03:09:25,631 --> 03:09:26,911
Dead to all feeling

4139
03:09:27,167 --> 03:09:28,191
A Broken Man

4140
03:09:29,471 --> 03:09:30,239
And quote

4141
03:09:32,287 --> 03:09:33,055
Churchill was

4142
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:33,823
Sympathetic

4143
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:34,591
What he wrote

4144
03:09:34,847 --> 03:09:35,359
Quote

4145
03:09:36,383 --> 03:09:38,431
Everything now converged upon molt

4146
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:39,711
Who was Molech

4147
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:42,015
He was the shadow of a great name

4148
03:09:42,527 --> 03:09:44,575
He was the nephew of the old Field Marshal

4149
03:09:44,831 --> 03:09:46,111
And it has a DeCamp

4150
03:09:46,367 --> 03:09:47,903
He was an ordinary man

4151
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:49,183
Rather accordion

4152
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:53,535
A man about the palace agreeable to the emperor in the palmy days of peace

4153
03:09:54,047 --> 03:09:56,607
The sort of man who does not make too much trouble with the sovereign

4154
03:09:57,119 --> 03:09:59,167
Who knows how to surprise his own personality

4155
03:09:59,423 --> 03:10:00,191
What there is of it

4156
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:01,727
A good harmless

4157
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:03,775
Respectable ordinary man

4158
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:07,359
And onto this ill-fated being crashes the brutal

4159
03:10:07,615 --> 03:10:08,383
Remorseless

4160
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:14,271
Centripetal impingement of tides and impulsions under which the greatest captains of History might have Blanche

4161
03:10:15,295 --> 03:10:15,807
Input

4162
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:18,111
Molcajete later written

4163
03:10:18,623 --> 03:10:19,647
While he still live

4164
03:10:20,415 --> 03:10:21,439
That in the moment

4165
03:10:21,951 --> 03:10:22,719
Supreme price

4166
03:10:23,231 --> 03:10:23,743
Grown

4167
03:10:24,255 --> 03:10:24,767
Quote

4168
03:10:25,023 --> 03:10:25,535
Nervous

4169
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:32,191
Lots of sources report

4170
03:10:32,447 --> 03:10:33,471
Von moltke

4171
03:10:33,983 --> 03:10:36,799
Went to the Kaiser at this point Sid Majesty

4172
03:10:37,311 --> 03:10:38,079
We just lost a war

4173
03:10:39,871 --> 03:10:40,639
I've never been able

4174
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:41,663
Confirm that.

4175
03:10:42,943 --> 03:10:43,711
And truth be told

4176
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:45,503
They didn't lose the war

4177
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:52,927
What's just happened is the chances for an early knockout blow an outright German victory

4178
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:54,719
That's what's been

4179
03:10:55,231 --> 03:10:56,767
I'm going to say compromise because

4180
03:10:57,023 --> 03:11:00,095
It's an open question whether or not the Germans blew this

4181
03:11:00,863 --> 03:11:02,655
Where the French simply rallied

4182
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:04,447
And gained the victory

4183
03:11:05,727 --> 03:11:11,359
There are lots of mistakes on the German side that people will point to basically insinuating it without those mistakes

4184
03:11:11,615 --> 03:11:12,639
The French go down

4185
03:11:13,151 --> 03:11:14,431
And yet look at the

4186
03:11:14,687 --> 03:11:15,199
Fact

4187
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:18,271
But they were still there after suffering

4188
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:20,831
Unprecedented

4189
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:22,623
Asian punishment

4190
03:11:24,927 --> 03:11:25,695
And forget about

4191
03:11:25,951 --> 03:11:31,583
Stop for a minute and understand the condition that those armies are in before they turn around at the Battle of the Marne

4192
03:11:31,839 --> 03:11:34,655
They are falling apart dead on their feet

4193
03:11:34,911 --> 03:11:37,983
In a wearing rags and unable to keep their eyes open

4194
03:11:38,495 --> 03:11:39,775
And that's who

4195
03:11:40,287 --> 03:11:42,591
The general from the first Army Von kluck

4196
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:46,175
That's who he singles out when he talks about the part

4197
03:11:46,687 --> 03:11:47,455
You know this

4198
03:11:47,711 --> 03:11:48,991
War so far this

4199
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:49,759
Surprise him

4200
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:51,551
He wrote quote

4201
03:11:52,063 --> 03:11:55,903
That men will let themselves be killed where they stand is a well-known thing

4202
03:11:56,159 --> 03:11:58,207
And counted on in every plan of battle

4203
03:11:58,719 --> 03:12:01,279
But that men who have retreated for 10 days

4204
03:12:01,791 --> 03:12:04,351
Sleeping on the ground and half-dead with fatigue

4205
03:12:04,863 --> 03:12:08,447
Should be able to take up their rifles in attack when the bugle sounds

4206
03:12:08,703 --> 03:12:10,751
It is a thing upon which we never counted

4207
03:12:11,007 --> 03:12:13,567
It was a possibility not studied in our warqaad

4208
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:15,359
And quote

4209
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:18,687
So he was obviously

4210
03:12:19,455 --> 03:12:19,967
Impress

4211
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,991
There's no way to

4212
03:12:21,759 --> 03:12:26,111
Denying endless we don't want to shortchange the British expeditionary Force either they

4213
03:12:26,367 --> 03:12:28,159
Prove to be potentially

4214
03:12:28,415 --> 03:12:29,951
Crucial to this whole thing and

4215
03:12:30,207 --> 03:12:33,535
As Churchill Point outside the providentially at the right place

4216
03:12:33,791 --> 03:12:35,071
And at the right time sometime

4217
03:12:35,839 --> 03:12:38,655
But this is one of those victories where you just have to

4218
03:12:39,167 --> 03:12:40,447
Tip your hat a little bit

4219
03:12:40,959 --> 03:12:41,727
The French achieved

4220
03:12:41,983 --> 03:12:43,263
This is Monumental stuff

4221
03:12:43,775 --> 03:12:49,407
It is truly heroic it's a little like the Alamo for Americans but on an enormous scale

4222
03:12:49,663 --> 03:12:50,943
And at the same time

4223
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:52,735
I want to remember the Germans

4224
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:53,503
In all this

4225
03:12:53,759 --> 03:12:55,295
To every set earlier

4226
03:12:56,319 --> 03:12:57,855
They get a bad rap

4227
03:12:58,623 --> 03:13:01,951
From a lot of us because of the second world war and rightly so

4228
03:13:02,463 --> 03:13:06,047
But a lot of that is connected to the first world war in a funny way I see them

4229
03:13:06,303 --> 03:13:08,863
You don't have to bring up some sort of Science Fiction reference

4230
03:13:09,119 --> 03:13:10,143
Show me where did that come from

4231
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:12,959
But they're a little like Anakin Skywalker this

4232
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:17,055
This nation that's new and young and has so much promise and potential

4233
03:13:17,567 --> 03:13:21,407
HG Wells have the greatest name for them I've ever heard at this point he called them

4234
03:13:21,663 --> 03:13:22,431
The best

4235
03:13:22,687 --> 03:13:24,735
And the wickedest nation in the world

4236
03:13:24,991 --> 03:13:29,087
You know the militarism that's so scared him and his socialistic sensibilities

4237
03:13:29,599 --> 03:13:35,743
Was balanced out by the fact that the Germans were so admirable in so many respects what the Germans called culture

4238
03:13:35,999 --> 03:13:39,583
Their music and their and their writings in their sophistication

4239
03:13:39,839 --> 03:13:40,351
And

4240
03:13:40,607 --> 03:13:46,495
And there's science my gosh in their education Wells is overflowing with all these wonderful things to say about Germans

4241
03:13:47,007 --> 03:13:51,871
But they've got this flaw and it's this militarism in there the best in the wicked is people in Europe in

4242
03:13:52,127 --> 03:13:58,015
And somewhere along the line Anakin Skywalker turns into Darth Vader in the poor Germans get that to be

4243
03:13:58,527 --> 03:13:59,039
They are

4244
03:13:59,295 --> 03:14:00,319
Image for the

4245
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:01,855
In 20th century

4246
03:14:02,367 --> 03:14:03,391
You wonder again

4247
03:14:03,903 --> 03:14:05,695
What's the enormous Stakes of this

4248
03:14:06,463 --> 03:14:07,487
German

4249
03:14:07,743 --> 03:14:09,279
Really defeat our

4250
03:14:10,559 --> 03:14:12,095
If a mole can the Germans have been

4251
03:14:12,351 --> 03:14:12,863
Victoria's here

4252
03:14:13,631 --> 03:14:15,679
The entire German history in the 20th century

4253
03:14:15,935 --> 03:14:16,447
Is different

4254
03:14:16,703 --> 03:14:19,519
And perhaps much much much more positive almost certain

4255
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:20,543
Like for Germans

4256
03:14:21,055 --> 03:14:22,847
And for everyone else too I think

4257
03:14:24,895 --> 03:14:25,919
Very interesting what ifs

4258
03:14:27,967 --> 03:14:32,319
And it's important to remember that when you think about these soldiers dying on the ground in these nameless

4259
03:14:32,575 --> 03:14:33,343
Awful battle

4260
03:14:33,855 --> 03:14:35,135
Whether they be French British

4261
03:14:35,647 --> 03:14:36,415
German or

4262
03:14:36,671 --> 03:14:38,207
Very soon a lot more people from

4263
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:38,975
Canada

4264
03:14:39,231 --> 03:14:41,023
And South Africa and Australia

4265
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:44,863
And Indochina I mean this is going to become an international I-4 soon

4266
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:46,399
All these people

4267
03:14:46,655 --> 03:14:48,447
Are good people caught up

4268
03:14:48,703 --> 03:14:52,031
Religious people caught up in in in the grand plans

4269
03:14:52,543 --> 03:14:54,335
And grinding wheels of

4270
03:14:54,847 --> 03:14:55,359
Of nation state

4271
03:14:56,639 --> 03:14:59,199
They went into these conflicts for reasons that are

4272
03:14:59,455 --> 03:15:00,735
Understandable today

4273
03:15:01,503 --> 03:15:02,015
Patriots

4274
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:04,063
Doodie love of country

4275
03:15:04,575 --> 03:15:06,367
Take your family all those kind of things

4276
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:11,231
They also went for reasons that were really important still in the 19th century

4277
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:13,023
But there were a little different today

4278
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:14,303
Glory

4279
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:16,351
Heroism Romance

4280
03:15:16,863 --> 03:15:19,423
As I said they still exist but not quite like they did

4281
03:15:19,935 --> 03:15:20,447
Back

4282
03:15:20,959 --> 03:15:23,775
You know from the beginning of History until right around this time

4283
03:15:25,055 --> 03:15:26,335
September 1914

4284
03:15:26,847 --> 03:15:28,127
A general name Vaughn ball 4

4285
03:15:28,895 --> 03:15:29,407
Talk about

4286
03:15:29,663 --> 03:15:30,431
The changes that the

4287
03:15:30,687 --> 03:15:31,199
Dispersed month

4288
03:15:31,455 --> 03:15:32,735
The first World War

4289
03:15:33,247 --> 03:15:36,831
In created in that facade of romantic War when he said quote

4290
03:15:37,087 --> 03:15:39,647
If war was once a chivalrous duel

4291
03:15:39,903 --> 03:15:41,439
It's now a dastardly Slaughter

4292
03:15:42,719 --> 03:15:43,231
And quote

4293
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:46,303
The suffering on the ground

4294
03:15:46,559 --> 03:15:49,119
Regardless of which side you're on is pitiable

4295
03:15:50,143 --> 03:15:51,167
And horrific

4296
03:15:51,423 --> 03:15:54,751
You know I always try to make sure and I hope auntie

4297
03:15:55,007 --> 03:15:55,519
Successful

4298
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:57,311
It would never exploitive

4299
03:15:58,079 --> 03:15:58,591
Of the

4300
03:15:58,847 --> 03:15:59,359
Of the

4301
03:15:59,871 --> 03:16:01,151
Terrible things that are going on today

4302
03:16:01,407 --> 03:16:02,175
The people need stories

4303
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:03,199
Tell

4304
03:16:03,967 --> 03:16:06,783
The reason that I use them is because for me

4305
03:16:07,295 --> 03:16:10,623
These stories intrigue me because I always put myself

4306
03:16:11,647 --> 03:16:12,927
And I try to imagine

4307
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:15,743
Handling these things and

4308
03:16:16,255 --> 03:16:19,839
As a person who's interested in the extremes of Human Experience

4309
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:23,167
There are almost no exceptions

4310
03:16:23,423 --> 03:16:25,727
The stories we talked about in this program I can imagine it

4311
03:16:26,495 --> 03:16:28,799
And I just feel like I would Wilt under

4312
03:16:29,055 --> 03:16:30,847
The pressures that these people

4313
03:16:31,103 --> 03:16:31,871
Live through

4314
03:16:34,175 --> 03:16:34,687
I mean

4315
03:16:34,943 --> 03:16:35,967
When you talk about

4316
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:38,783
Being interested in the extremes of human nature

4317
03:16:39,039 --> 03:16:39,807
And wondering

4318
03:16:40,319 --> 03:16:42,623
What I would do in the same situation

4319
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:43,647
I think about

4320
03:16:43,903 --> 03:16:46,975
The worst places in the world you can think of a man if there's a

4321
03:16:47,487 --> 03:16:47,999
Three or four

4322
03:16:48,255 --> 03:16:49,279
45 list out there

4323
03:16:49,535 --> 03:16:52,095
One of them on my list is the Western Front

4324
03:16:52,607 --> 03:16:53,631
In the first World War

4325
03:16:54,143 --> 03:16:56,959
And we're about to get there and it is about the worst

4326
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:57,727
Experiencing

4327
03:17:06,175 --> 03:17:08,479
I was joking only Hardcore History Twitter feed

4328
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:10,783
By the way you can follow it at heart

4329
03:17:11,039 --> 03:17:11,551
Core history

4330
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:14,367
That it's taking us longer

4331
03:17:14,879 --> 03:17:16,415
To get the episode you just heard

4332
03:17:16,671 --> 03:17:18,463
Released and to you

4333
03:17:18,719 --> 03:17:19,231
By the way thank you

4334
03:17:21,023 --> 03:17:21,535
Appreciate it

4335
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:25,119
Then the amount of time it was actually covered in the episode itself

4336
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:28,191
And I think if you were

4337
03:17:28,447 --> 03:17:31,775
Crunching the data and projecting outward based on how long

4338
03:17:32,031 --> 03:17:33,311
To show you just heard was

4339
03:17:33,823 --> 03:17:39,967
You probably figured that it's going to take it about 250 episodes to cover the first world war and God forbid we go afterwards

4340
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:42,271
Where did the 1919 in the trees and all that

4341
03:17:42,527 --> 03:17:43,807
Will be doing this the rest of our lives

4342
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:45,599
We're obviously not going to do that

4343
03:17:47,391 --> 03:17:49,695
Episode you just heard focused on

4344
03:17:49,951 --> 03:17:51,231
To be honest

4345
03:17:51,487 --> 03:17:53,535
A series of events the pre-war stuff

4346
03:17:53,791 --> 03:17:55,583
And the first 10 opening moves

4347
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:57,375
It's common in almost

4348
03:17:57,631 --> 03:17:58,655
All the approaches of the

4349
03:17:59,167 --> 03:18:02,239
For war because they set the stage for what comes afterwards for example

4350
03:18:02,495 --> 03:18:03,263
Already

4351
03:18:03,775 --> 03:18:05,823
You know as the story ends the trenches

4352
03:18:06,335 --> 03:18:07,359
Are cropping up

4353
03:18:07,615 --> 03:18:08,383
Organically

4354
03:18:08,895 --> 03:18:10,175
Along the Western Front

4355
03:18:11,199 --> 03:18:16,319
It's the iconic image of the first World War I trenches of always been known fortifications always been known going back

4356
03:18:16,575 --> 03:18:17,599
Back to ancient history

4357
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:19,391
But never on this scale

4358
03:18:19,647 --> 03:18:20,671
Never this long

4359
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:22,207
Never in positions

4360
03:18:22,719 --> 03:18:26,047
Another world as an almost immobile as it never under the source

4361
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:28,607
Two conditions it's going to create an almost unique

4362
03:18:30,399 --> 03:18:30,911
Experience

4363
03:18:31,167 --> 03:18:31,935
The people who have

4364
03:18:32,447 --> 03:18:32,959
Go through it

4365
03:18:33,727 --> 03:18:35,263
And again something fascinating when I

4366
03:18:35,519 --> 03:18:36,031
I consider

4367
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:36,799
How I

4368
03:18:37,055 --> 03:18:37,823
Myself would have

4369
03:18:38,079 --> 03:18:39,359
Hayden similar

4370
03:18:41,151 --> 03:18:43,455
But it's going to make the battles

4371
03:18:43,967 --> 03:18:44,991
Somewhat similar

4372
03:18:45,759 --> 03:18:47,295
You know so you'll be able to say

4373
03:18:47,807 --> 03:18:48,575
A little bit about

4374
03:18:48,831 --> 03:18:54,207
The big ones but not have to go too much into the experience over and over again because it becomes similar

4375
03:18:54,463 --> 03:18:55,231
In each of the battle

4376
03:18:55,487 --> 03:18:57,279
All the people fighting in the trenches in one battle

4377
03:18:57,535 --> 03:19:01,119
Often have similar sorts of day-to-day experiences from people fighting

4378
03:19:01,631 --> 03:19:02,143
In the trenches

4379
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:02,911
In another

4380
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:09,311
So we will have the opportunity as the program moves along to zoom in and zoom out as needed

4381
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:11,871
This is going to allow us though

4382
03:19:12,383 --> 03:19:18,527
To focus on a bunch of other things including how the generals managed to deal with the fact that they're no longer operate

4383
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:19,807
Meeting with pre-war plans

4384
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:23,391
They have to actually think now learn apply they're thinking

4385
03:19:23,647 --> 03:19:27,999
In novel ways we're going to find out how flexible these 19th Century men are

4386
03:19:28,511 --> 03:19:34,399
As they try to adjust on the fly in real time to the challenges of 20th century Warfare

4387
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:36,959
Which no one's ever really tried yet

4388
03:19:37,983 --> 03:19:42,847
They're going to have to contend with and we are going to deal with questions like changes in the air

4389
03:19:44,127 --> 03:19:44,895
Changes at sea

4390
03:19:45,919 --> 03:19:47,199
Changes involving

4391
03:19:47,455 --> 03:19:51,039
Wmd and things we're still dealing with today

4392
03:19:52,063 --> 03:19:54,879
