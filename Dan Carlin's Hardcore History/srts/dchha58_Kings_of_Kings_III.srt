How to get 10% off

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,128
I'm a notoriously bad

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Topic

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,504
And I traditionally pick something that I think I can do much more quickly than

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,272
Can

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,624
And then when I get into the middle of it I feel compelled to do the topic Justice

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,440
And we end up traditionally with a very long series of

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
Shows

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
What you're about to hear

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,352
Is the equivalent of like a double album

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
Buy a music band or something

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,008
We are essentially giving you Parts 3 and 4

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,104
I would probably should have been realistically speaking a four-part series

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,896
Achaemenid Persian Empire

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
With an obvious focus on their Wars

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
The Greeks in the makedonia

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
If you missed part one and two you probably want to catch those before you catch this one but there's so much military history in this way

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,280
Because I knew I'd be crucified if we didn't go into loving detail

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
About what

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,376
To several of the best battles in ancient

24
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Military history

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
So we do that

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Imma give you what

27
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
Is probably twice the length of what a good

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
Hardcore History show should be

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Let it last

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
And hopefully

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
It doesn't become like one of those double albums I grew up with what you listen to it you think that they could have cut half that thing you just put up one really good single album

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
The way I look at it

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
This is one of the Great

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
It's a small world history

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
And if anything it probably merited more attention that I gave it but as I told you I'm a terrible topic

36
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
And I'm always trying to recover

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
After I make my poor choice

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
So without further ado

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Part 3 and really part

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
For also

41
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Final

42
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,456
Summer series on the great Kings of the ancient achaemenid Persian Empire

43
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Kings of Kings

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
December 7th 1941

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
A date which will live in infamy

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Call nist time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Spirulina

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Whether or not their president

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Remember that we are not descended from fearful men

50
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
Hardcore history

51
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
Earlier we had posed

52
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
The question

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
About whether or not absolute

54
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Power corrupt and absolute

55
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
In

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Kind of world

57
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Most of us come from

58
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
It's sort of taken as a given that you don't want to trust app

59
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Depression

60
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Power Brokers

61
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
History right

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
But look at history

63
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
In the story of the

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Achaemenid Persian Empire

65
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
If you look at all the different key

66
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Which is what we're doing

67
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
There are a number of them that almost certainly had

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
What amounted to Absolute

69
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Power

70
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
And several of them

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
To at least it didn't just not abused it

72
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Seem to

73
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Can almost be

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
The Prototype

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
That you would want

76
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Can an absolute

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Monarch

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Really two different kinds of product

79
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Have to because

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,744
Founder of the achaemenid Persian Empire Cyrus the Great was like the warrior king

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
His version

82
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Is Empires version of a kind of an Alexander the Great and probably the greatest conqueror before Alexander the Great social

83
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
The Prototype right King Arthur

84
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
But then

85
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Did you get

86
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Psoriasis

87
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
A king or two later and dries is like the gifted

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
Administrator person who's a genius

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Maybe at

90
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Organization and

91
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Structure and

92
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,535
Handling things you know from a cost-benefit ratio I mean the Greek writer said his own people called him a shopkeeper

93
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Huckster is another name given sometimes

94
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
Basically a shopkeeper as we said in the last

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
For the program

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
At the shop is Walmart you have a shopkeeper your CEO and you said dries was like the CEO of Persia core because

97
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,455
Persia kind of seemed to almost have like a subcontractor relationship

98
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Aura

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Subsidiary

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Lysa subsidiary

101
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
3 person car with their various attributes and provinces

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,975
Absolute power corrupts absolutely one would think that

103
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
You wouldn't have a Cyrus the Great

104
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,839
So you wouldn't have a dries and they wouldn't have done so well so

105
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
Obviously there are exceptions to the rule

106
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
But those kind of people don't come along every day in any society

107
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
I mean often times

108
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
The great Empires throughout history of managed to sustain themselves

109
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
You know with occasional great leadership how many great leaders

110
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
You must you have show up

111
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,063
Overture e 250 or 200 years to keep the empire in good Stead

112
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Supposed to

113
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Pens

114
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
On the variables write the outgoing conditions

115
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
Things are pretty stable you can have a Caligula

116
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Nero no problem but if the barbarians have been smashing up the

117
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
In the borders of the Empire now for twenty or thirty years you better have

118
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
A Diocletian and Hadrian

119
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
While the Persian Empire gets off to a really strong start

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Cyrus the Great

121
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,919
His son came by sea was probably better than the sources describe

122
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
That weird maybe sort of Magi King lasted for 5 seconds and then to Rice a grain to make

123
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Buy a bunch of other Nobles

124
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,511
When something weird happened to his predecessor to take over the gig based on competency cuz he was competent as heck

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
But then about four or five years

126
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
After the Battle of Marathon

127
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
We just talked about

128
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
When the Persian

129
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
Amphibious Landing forces expelled from Europe

130
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Athenian with some

131
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Do you need help

132
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
Herodotus give this passage where he says that dries is mad and now he will punish the Greeks and personally

133
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
But this guy's in his sixties

134
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Remember

135
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Yeah they say that

136
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,487
30 is the new 20 or whatever it is will back then

137
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
In a 60 is the current 70 or older and he's in his sixties and he's been on the throne for more than 30 years

138
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Competently an awesomely

139
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
Reorganizing the Empire and making the structure so strong and interesting the he's a fabulous fabulous character and if your Grease

140
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
You better not Overlook what he can do to you

141
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,735
When he leaves the Army in person which seems to be the plan but then he dies which was not part of the

142
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
What's more

143
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,159
The army that he was putting together to go punish the Greeks now

144
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Which were told

145
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Involve like all of Asia in the hole

146
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Area of the near East

147
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
How do you side with them like a bunch of bugs

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
But then

149
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
You know he faces

150
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,151
The big problem for most Empires throughout history

151
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,807
There's really only two big problems that they face one is that something will Swampert destroy them from without an enemy force or another

152
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Nation state

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
For that you will

154
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,463
Collapse from within due to revolt and Rebellion

155
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
A lot of times the two of them work together

156
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
Assyrians had to deal with this all the time

157
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
The Persians did too even though the Persians are supposed to be sort of the

158
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
Kinder gentler near Eastern

159
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Ancient nation state

160
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
But remember we're grading them on a curve

161
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,199
And the curve was set by a bunch of people who if you were bolted against them

162
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,575
They would cut your skin off you while you're still alive and you can go to the British Museum today

163
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Stroll over to their ancient Assyria section

164
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
And you will see

165
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Stone released at the Assyrian government paid for commission

166
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Horse Soldiers

167
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,191
Skinning alive that person was the governor of that City who rebelled against us

168
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
For the benefit of anyone

169
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
Who views YouTube didn't have to be there at the time

170
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
For the next 3000 years

171
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,735
You could see why all of these ancient empires were so draconian

172
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
Two Rebels and traitors because that was such a huge threat to them how do you keep

173
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
You know people in line

174
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,231
When you give them a city to go ruling and you take the Army and go back home

175
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
What to keep them from just saying haha fooled you I'm going to side with the Egyptians now or I'm going totally free or whatever

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
Well we will do the most horrific things to you if you do that

177
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Go to any premodern society

178
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
And you want to see the nastiest things they can do to people

179
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
They pull out the really

180
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Awful

181
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Executions and tortures when they're dealing with Rebels and traitors

182
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
You go back to

183
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
In England for example in the Middle Ages had one

184
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Where

185
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
The first thing that they would do to you

186
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
Is rip out your intestines and barbecue them in front of you

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,959
Are you are alive while all this is happening which makes this a three-dimensional experience you are feeling smelling

188
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Seeing the whole nine yards

189
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
And if they're doing this

190
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
Particular execution

191
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
Go to the nth degree than they will hang you but they will cut you down

192
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Let you down before you die revive you

193
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Do it a few more time

194
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Enable tie

195
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Each of your limbs to a separate horse

196
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,463
And those four horses will pull your four limbs in four different directions

197
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
That is called being drawn and quartered

198
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Usually reserved

199
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Rebels and traitors

200
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Assyrians

201
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
Had all sorts of things that they did and

202
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
Collective punishment was the rule of the day

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
So if you were entrusted with in the Syrian City and your job was to keep it

204
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
In a loyal and all that and you

205
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Stab the king of Assyria in the back

206
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
He wasn't just going to cut your skin off you were going to get to watch

207
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,183
People you love die in front of you mean there's a reason they call some of those punishments biblical

208
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Cuz if those are is right

209
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
Kill your family in front of you then I will blind you so that was the last thing you see wow

210
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Was Sarah Wright in the Assyrians were

211
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Amongst the roughest practitioners

212
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
But they held together

213
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
A big Empire for a long time that

214
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Persians have always been sort of

215
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Portrayed

216
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
As an attempt to see if you can get away

217
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
With leniency what do we say knife in you with leniency

218
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
At least compared to the way the Assyrians ran the show

219
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
And see if that made people more willing

220
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
To live under the rule right of the Assyrian artwork was so horrific

221
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
Some of the experts think because they're trying to tell people this is what will happen to you

222
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,079
If you were about to try to get out of the Empire if you look at the Persian stuff that has survived

223
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
There is no artwork like you Siri and stuff

224
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:34,271
The Persians do not have any artwork or or lease or stone carving showing them torturing anyone

225
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
They actually have Persian officials holding the hands of people that are recognizable before you can date them you can go

226
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Oh look they're holding the hand of a carry in there

227
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:49,887
Older holding up assideans had that is by Design the Persian propaganda

228
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
As opposed to be a Syrian propaganda

229
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Is that the people who are in their empire

230
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Like that

231
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,639
But they enjoy being in the Empire that is mutually beneficial that it's an Empire by choice

232
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
Keeping you here you want to be in the Persian Empire it's good for everybody

233
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
As we said the earlier show the person who dolphin sell that too

234
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
Donations before they went to war to do we really have to

235
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
To do this

236
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,279
It'll listen you join us and everybody will be better off I mean that's the way they sold the empire

237
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,119
In terms of its propaganda it's it's carved in stone propaganda

238
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
And they generally compared to the in a curve of that era and that area were generally pretty lenient unless of course

239
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
You rebelled against them

240
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
Who told that story and story and maybe

241
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
From Herodotus describing what happened to the Egyptians

242
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
20 earlier Persian king took over the Egyptians

243
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
An Egyptian had to be punished for mistreating some diplomats

244
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
Erotica sez

245
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,327
And this would be very person to do that all the nobles were gathered for the aristocracy of Egypt

246
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
Not the poor people who had nothing to do with the decision making

247
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,519
Upper-crust brought them in and then brought their children in in front of them

248
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
And executed the boys 2000 of them

249
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Including

250
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Is the king of Egypt kid

251
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
And sold an equal number of girls into slavery

252
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
We have wondered

253
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
That sounded

254
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,415
Remember that still a scene in my head what's the movie scene like that how do you recreate that for the film

255
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
Nonetheless that kind of collective punishment Was Not Unusual at all

256
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Which makes you wonder

257
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
You know if if that's what faces you

258
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
Let's just say you're the governor your name is borrow

259
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,543
And you run a Syrian City that's about the Persians have taken over and they've come in there

260
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,383
Find a bunch of documents with you and you maybe prick your finger with blood in you

261
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
Put at the bottom of the. Yes I will be loyal to the Persian Empire and then for some reason my dad a good reason who knows

262
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Uribel

263
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
And the person come back because what are the odds

264
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
But that rebellious city is going to manage to

265
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Avoid being recaptured

266
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
And the Persians do something horrible to you and your family when you know you let your imagination run wild the Persians have punished

267
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
I called the boats for example are sometimes called the ordeal of the boats

268
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Which is

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
Top three always on my top three worst execution methods of all time

270
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Along with

271
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Also the death by a Thousand Cuts of the Chinese that wasn't

272
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Diabolic

273
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
I was thinking Myself by the way you know what this Persian

274
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Penalty somebody had to come up with this

275
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Somebody invented this

276
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Wonder if they'd be proud to find Alison

277
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
2500 years later we're still talking about

278
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
But the message supposedly again this comes from Greek author so who knows

279
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:40,383
But the method was to get a couple of boats like canoes or flat bottom boats or whatever you no small affair

280
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,735
But that fit together to put one upside down on the other one you have like a perfect little

281
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
And it would stick the person to be executed in the bottom boat

282
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Then they would

283
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,183
Put the top coat on top of the but they would leave the head the hands in the feet out

284
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
According to the authors

285
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
And then they would feed the person in the boat a lot of milk and honey and then smear it all over their face

286
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
And then you leave them in the Sun

287
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Or set the boat adrift on a calm lake in the Sun

288
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,103
And sources differ on what was worse but apparently your face would get covered with insects attracted by the milk and honey

289
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
But also of course you're stuck in that boat so

290
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
You do what nature requires you to do

291
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,831
And the worms and the bugs and everything basically

292
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Eat You Alive

293
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
According to the ancient Greek author Plutarch writing

294
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
It took one guy 17 days to die

295
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
That's

296
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
Who came up with that idea

297
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,983
But if that's what you know faces you if your city rebelles

298
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Why on Earth would you ever do that

299
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,687
So I think about our ancestors I can't decide if they're just unbelievably badass

300
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Or if maybe

301
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,391
You know our whole concept of what's horrible has been changed by softening * I mean

302
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
Are the countries that still execute people consider the

303
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
Penalty to be the deprivation of life right one

304
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,607
When you're executed United States a lot of stay still just put you to sleep

305
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,959
And you're being punished by losing the rest of the years that you otherwise would have had

306
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
In the ancient world of the Middle Ages

307
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
Death is not the punishment

308
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,687
That is the byproduct the punishment is the pain you suffer on the way to dying

309
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,831
Just getting your head cut off in some of these places if you were Rebel is cheating Justice

310
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
So maybe we who put

311
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
Are executed criminals to sleep maybe to us the ordeal of the boats is unbelievable but maybe to the people of the time

312
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
I need to go

313
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
I'll take it over being flayed alive

314
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Braiding everything on a car

315
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Right

316
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,871
Nonetheless the whole reason that the Greeks are fighting right that they get drawn into war with Persia to begin with

317
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,175
Have to do with revolts that happened

318
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
In Greek cities

319
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
On the coast of modern-day turkey

320
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
The ionian

321
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
So you have that did well you know but it must not happen too often

322
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
No in the next

323
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
Do years right after the Battle of Marathon maybe and maybe even tied to the outcome of mean the Persian get asset

324
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
Look back at Marathon all the sudden Egypt revolts

325
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
And whereas the Greeks and that whole Greek World in Europe

326
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
Is like the fringes of the backwaters of nowhere

327
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Right

328
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,943
Egypt has been described by a bunch of historians as the crown jewel

329
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
Of the achaemenid Persian

330
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
And like there

331
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,855
Cultural equals in Babylonia

332
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Next to impossible to rule successfully

333
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,023
Egyptians and the Babylonians are notoriously difficult

334
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Kadabra

335
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,911
Part of it is because these are popular societies are Urban societies with crowds and

336
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,519
And I mean in Egypt for example right after this are there will be a lot of documentation about how

337
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
If you don't pay enough attention to the general public on the ground they Riot and they start burning and destroying stuff tomorrow I've been places

338
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Lake Alexandria

339
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Which doesn't exist yet of course but

340
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Legendary

341
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,135
Sending the Babylonia mean that there's so many people in such a small area

342
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
You got to watch the crowd control a little bit

343
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
Loss of both those places have unbelievably high levels of

344
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
Cultural achievement and they're aware of

345
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Their heritage

346
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Egypt

347
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,007
In a lot of places you have to do nothing but look toward the horizon

348
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
And see

349
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Pyramids

350
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
There are 2000 years old

351
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
In this era

352
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
When they're almost as old to the achaemenid Persians

353
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
As he commanded Persians are to watch now

354
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
And if you're Egyptian

355
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,511
You're thinking to yourself who are these barbarians who just appeared on the scene look at my ancestors were building

356
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
In mythical time

357
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
Can you imagine what a person in for

358
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,191
90 BCE thought about something

359
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,543
2018 conceptualize something two thousand years before that we have to leave in

360
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
I don't even think they could get their mind around the whole

361
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
The pyramids

362
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,527
Both the Babylonians Egyptians very well-developed

363
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,903
Religious hierarchies with tons of different priesthood religion that they were very powerful and influential

364
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Anytime you can speak for God

365
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
That's some credibility you can use against

366
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Anyone

367
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
Which of all these places difficult to control

368
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
And when Egypt for bells

369
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Herodotus says

370
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
The driest essentially finds out about it right around the same time he finds out

371
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
About what happened

372
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
At Marathon in Greece and here's the way the ancient screenwriter

373
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Showrunner

374
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
Herodotus colorizing history

375
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,343
Really for the first time ever with personalities and dialogue

376
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
And you know significant plot development

377
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
This is what Herodotus writes about it and this comes from my

378
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
Purvis Edition and by the way it says hello

379
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
What he means grease or Athenians

380
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
The Wright School

381
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
Weather report of the Battle of Marathon reached Jiraiya's

382
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Some of his bass fish

383
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
Would already been thoroughly exasperated by the Athenians attack on Sardis

384
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
Hina reacted with a much more intense Fury

385
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
And became even more determined

386
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
To make war on have less than he had been before

387
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,183
At once he began to issue commands and to send Messengers throughout the cities of the empire

388
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
With instructions to each of them

389
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,303
To provide a great deal more than they have provided previously

390
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Including horses

391
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Warships

392
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,495
And transport boats the announcement of these orders through Asia into commotion for 3 years

393
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,615
Have the best man were enlisted to serve in the Army had to make preparations for war against hella

394
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,735
Then in the fourth year the Egyptians have been enslaved by Campisi's

395
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Revolted from the Persian

396
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,879
Which only increased psoriasis desire to go to war but now against both people

397
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
And quote

398
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
As we said though before he can do those things

399
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,631
This ruler who would be in charge of the Persian Empire in Uber competent way

400
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
For more than 30 years

401
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Dies

402
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Generally considered to be around

403
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
64 years old

404
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,711
Keeping with the mysterious nature of the early achaemenid Persian kings

405
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
History doesn't record how to rise die

406
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:18,464
That's pretty common by the way I mean the founder of the Empire that was the greatest figures in all world history

407
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
The Great

408
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Tony knows how he died you might have died in bed

409
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Unnatural death

410
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Of course

411
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
The traditional story is

412
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
He was killed

413
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
Is body found on the battlefield

414
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
The head chopped off and shoved into a wine skin filled with human blood by a vengeful homicidal

415
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Central Asian Queen

416
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
What you don't know right

417
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
His son can buy sees a guy who gets the first

418
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
You know absolute power corrupts absolutely

419
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Treatment on the part of the Greek writers

420
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,024
He could have stabbed himself with a sword tip accidentally gotten gangrene died

421
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,096
Or could have been something more nefarious you don't know

422
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,192
The next Persian king is the one who was either

423
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Cyrus's other Sunday

424
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,080
Heir-to-the-throne or some usurper some Magi from outside the

425
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Royal Line

426
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,456
We know how that one died because the person who killed him by hand

427
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Bragged about it for the rest of his known

428
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
That is that guy just

429
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
Died after ruling version for 36 years

430
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
His name was derived

431
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
The Great

432
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
Psoriasis

433
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,096
As a guy who came from outside the direct Royal Line himself

434
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,936
Seem to have done a pretty good job trying to make sure

435
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,776
That the right son got the job and it was all understood who was going to get it

436
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
Although the ancient altar of allude to

437
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
Some potential problems

438
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
Cuz these Persian kings first of all like a lot of ancient Kings don't just have one wife they have several legitimate why

439
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,880
And then they often have a ton of concubines

440
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
Some of these Persian kings will have more than a hundred children

441
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
Find that funny when they talk about

442
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,656
You know often the Persian kings will put close family members in charge of important things

443
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
They had a lot of them

444
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
In this case

445
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Steve

446
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
In a potential pool

447
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,896
Successors seem to have only included those of the legitimate wives

448
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
And then it seemed to boil down to two boys

449
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
The first one was

450
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Psoriasis oldest son

451
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,416
The second one was derives his oldest son born

452
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,256
After he became king this is something that's important I guess

453
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
If you're worried about something to do with the

454
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,912
Mythical Blue Blood nature in the religious conception again

455
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
You're a different guy after you become king and the child you sire after that point might have something

456
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
That the one you sired before you work

457
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,432
Didn't have any this is kind of the way a logical

458
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
Debate on the subject ghost 2500 years ago at least

459
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
That's the way Herodotus would have explained

460
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
So the guy who gets

461
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
The gig

462
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,720
Is the oldest son born

463
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
After Jiraiya's becomes king

464
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,072
His name in Persian

465
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Will sound something like

466
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
Tasha yes sir

467
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
Remember of course that's an approximation I am

468
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Multilingual

469
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
In my ability to mispronounce

470
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Names for mini lights

471
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Which is

472
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,968
Severe that in mind of course he's known to history by different name and he's probably

473
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,552
The most well-known and famous King of the achaemenid Persian

474
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Dynasty

475
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
By the name of Xerxes

476
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
He also happens to be

477
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
Grandson

478
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,168
Of Cyrus the Great the founder of the Empire this King Arthur like figure

479
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
Remember

480
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Durant ISD

481
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
Perhaps usurper himself with smartweed said he kind of like a married into Henry Ford's family vanilla

482
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
He was running the Ford auto company

483
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
Well this would be like Henry Ford's grandson

484
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,088
Psoriasis was careful to marry Cyrus the Great daughter

485
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
When he became

486
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
The leader of Persia

487
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,768
This kid's mom this is his mom is Cyrus the Great's daughter

488
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,424
The Royal bloodline of this Uber competent guy may be chosen strictly on Merit for me

489
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Select pool of aristocratic oyster is the grade

490
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
Cyrus the Great a a mythical figure already

491
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
In Persian Society were told

492
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
That they based

493
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,736
Their views on male handsomeness

494
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:31,392
Based on Cyrus's sort of design whenever he look like that's the uberman and anybody who's got that kind of knows and that kind of harem

495
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
Like Cyrus you look the more perfect you are

496
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,536
So this is an amazing characters of the Beast Cyrus's grandson

497
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,888
Let's just say there's a lot of Promise in this kid a lot of hype and high expectations

498
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Are you going to live up to that

499
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
Xerxes is also hindered historically speaking by the fact that

500
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
The portrayal of him fits nicely into into a couple of different narrative

501
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,760
Which of the way this story has always been told one involve the idea of decline

502
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
The other involves the idea

503
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,648
Of a life cycle where decline is the last day

504
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
Only recently have historians really

505
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,816
Thrown out or mostly thrown out this idea that there

506
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,376
There's a life cycle of Empires if you will

507
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
The idea that once upon a time you have people who are poor and their poverty makes them sort of tough in the

508
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,920
Toughness of their poverty in the values and the discipline in the Spartan lifestyle

509
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,040
Create the kind of people who can conquer or amass territory to create an empire

510
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,856
Which brings in lots of money in affluence and then eventually

511
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
You know you hit the sweet spot

512
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,488
Will you have the best mixture of the old rocking discipline values

513
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Did you had when you were poor

514
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,864
But also the cultural advancements and what not to come

515
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
With some affluence in some leisure time and all that

516
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,776
And then eventually you know the the life cycle of Empires

517
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Culminates with the downhill slope with Voltaire called the silk slippers wooden shoes going upstairs

518
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
Slippers going downstairs

519
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,344
The luxury in the affluent bringing on decadence in the decadent Springs on softness of luxuriant weakness

520
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,416
And then in this hobbesian survival of the fittest kind of

521
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,744
World that you get taken over by the new poor people on the Block

522
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,584
Find the values your ancestors used to possess

523
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Xerxes is often seen and often portrayed

524
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Is the beginning of sort of the rich kid

525
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Era of Persian kings of the ones who

526
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,920
Didn't have to earn in Empire they grew up in that right I grew up as a king son

527
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
And it's just a little

528
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,600
Right sure they taught me how to ride I had to throw the spear and they they made me run five miles and and do all these things that prove.

529
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
I was taught but I'm still the rich kid son

530
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Richest man in the world son

531
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Any idea

532
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
Xerxes his failings are

533
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,632
Multitude of things by the way but the classic

534
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,472
Stereotype of Xerxes is the guy who couldn't stay out of the harem

535
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,128
Love the women hung out in the Harem all the time and like to drink his wine who is drinking a lot of wine hanging out with a lot of chicks

536
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
And dissipating as they would have said

537
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,480
Amongst the old boxing trainers

538
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Dissipating

539
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Week

540
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,624
The beginning of the downhill slide in the Persian Empire

541
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
The decline if you will

542
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Begins you know

543
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:20,608
The Pierre breandan others will all point out the list of the high-water mark of the empire for using the old line way of measuring this

544
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,448
Is it expanding in territory or is it contracted in territory

545
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,312
Well the height of territorial expansion is right around the time Xerxes takes over

546
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
And it never will be that big Again by the time it works he leaves so who do you blame for all that was historically speaking at

547
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Hard not to look for a carport

548
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Where does the buck stop in

549
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Absolute monarchy well

550
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
Whether or not its advisors or generals were really calling the shots

551
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,560
The buck usually stops with the absolute monarch in this case that Xerxes

552
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Once again

553
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,424
The poor guy deserved or not get stuck with the bill

554
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,776
And blamed for being the first of the Persian kings to rule

555
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
As the Empire has crossed the

556
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
You know peak of its performance in his beginning the downhill slide up the first of the kings use voltaire's analogy to behead

557
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
Heading down the stairs of civilization

558
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
Height in silk slippers is

559
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Traditionally

560
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Xerxes

561
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Is Rehabilitation

562
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,512
Has been going on for almost

563
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
Well just say 50 years with Peter Green in 1970 I remember reading that book

564
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,424
But even before that

565
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:34,080
Right after the second world war with writing his history the Persians and Xerxes was called misunderstood in Moline

566
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Find figure

567
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
But here's how green put it

568
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,248
In 1970 the book it's pretty long in the tooth now when you realize how many things

569
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
They discovered about ancient Persia but even back then

570
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,928
Trying to recapture Xerxes historical reputation

571
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
From

572
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,304
2400 years of media where he become a stock character basically

573
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Green rights quote

574
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
Are traditional picture of Xerxes is a caricature

575
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,056
Put together from hostile and finklea contemptuous Greek propaganda

576
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,152
We see him as a small blubbering effeminate Oriental

577
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,248
A cowardly desperate ruled by his women and his eunuchs

578
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Cruel and Victory

579
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
Spineless in defeat

580
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Persian sources

581
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,184
No doubt he writes equally Prejudice in the opposite direction

582
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Reveals a very different man

583
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Tall

584
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,072
Regal and handsome he stands in the persepolis release

585
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:32,192
And his Proclamation have a ringing dignity which Echoes down Through the Ages

586
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
I was quoting the proclamation by Xerxes quote

587
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
A great God is Ahura Mazda

588
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Who created this Earth

589
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Who created man

590
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
Who created peace for man

591
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
And who made Xerxes King

592
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,528
One king of many

593
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064
One Lord of many

594
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,440
I am Xerxes the great king King of Kings King of lands containing many men

595
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,744
King in this great Earth far and wide

596
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
Son of Darius the king

597
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Aniki meaning

598
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
A Persian

599
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
Son of a Persian

600
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
An Aryan of Aryan seed

601
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
Winter why is my father passed away

602
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
Buy the wheel of a horror Mazda

603
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
I became king

604
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
And quote

605
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
You know it's easy to say

606
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
Did all this stuff you have from these Greek writers for example is all movie making and it's all falsify to me where different

607
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,416
Herodotus of dialogue come from after all he think he was working for transcripts

608
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:31,072
So it's easy to say all that stuff should be thrown out because all these people in the story rather than being historical figures are more like

609
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Characters

610
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
But if you do that what do you replace it with

611
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,056
Tina Brown says that many times in his book if you get rid of Herodotus cuz he's so inaccurate what do you replace it with

612
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
The only time you appreciate the guys when you lose them cuz

613
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,760
He will after 479 BCE and then

614
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,064
There's not even Herodotus anymore

615
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
So it's

616
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,768
It's part of what makes the job of a historian fascinating to think of those people that historians having to tease out

617
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,352
The facts in the haystack of fiction

618
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
You know that are these stories and these plays and what not to try to figure out could this be true could that be true and then can they check it summer

619
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
Or else again some other evidence they may have

620
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
I mean it's a detective story as we said in the earlier part of this Tale

621
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
Mean take for example

622
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
The fact

623
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
That you begin to see some significant for Trails of women

624
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
In the story in the Persian Empire

625
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
Are witches great cuz everyone knows

626
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,744
Women get the short end of the stick in so much historical writing

627
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,120
But you have to ask yourself as a detective don't you if you're a historian which I'm not

628
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
Is why all of a sudden

629
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,496
Do you see women when you didn't see as many of them before

630
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,896
Are they there because there's a legitimate reason to have them cuz they're always is right we all understand it's half the population there was 30

631
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Some Authority somewhere

632
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
Were they there because

633
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,064
The Storyteller requires them as a tool to do something else

634
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
In this case it's very easy to see how sometimes

635
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,464
These Persian women who sometimes are shown as like Dragon Lady

636
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
Wright motor really scary

637
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,632
I mean on the level of Alexander the Great's mother Olympia's who is another wonderful carry

638
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
But she's all real

639
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,824
As far as I can tell but I mean these murderous dragon ladies are they there because they really were these murderous Dragon Lady

640
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Court women were like

641
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
Were they there because they play Into The Stereotype of the Harem in the women beginning to dominate the men and these Persian men are

642
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,880
Sitting there drinking and drunk and they don't even care what's going on in the women are needing them for their man

643
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,536
Wonder Woman Herodotus has doing that though

644
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,608
Is somebody that there's nothing you could do to color

645
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,680
Her greatness any other color but magnificent

646
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
This is one of the greatest figures

647
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,824
Certainly maybe the greatest female figure in the history of the Persian Empire

648
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
At only the barest facts of her are known but the barest facts by themselves are testimony to in

649
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Amazing life

650
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,088
The person who specialist shines through

651
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,416
When all you really have are few names and dates and facts

652
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
Her name

653
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
What's a Tulsa

654
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Or at least that's what the Greeks called

655
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
She was Xerxes as mother

656
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
Herodotus basically says

657
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,264
The main reason Xerxes was chosen over anyone else's because of the influence of Batwoman

658
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:25,920
But that she would have that influence should surprise nobody listen to the fact that comprises woman's life

659
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
And look at how it shows

660
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,272
A woman who was at like

661
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,880
The sauron's eye level of the historical

662
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Focusing Vortex I mean

663
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
She's Cyrus the Great's daughter

664
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,376
That's like being Napoleon's daughter chinggis Khan daughter Julius Caesar's daughter

665
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
You name it

666
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,264
And she's there when the Empire's being one informed and or I mean

667
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:58,176
That's the vortex of history in that part of the world to me as we said he's probably the greatest conqueror in world history up to that point and this is

668
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
This is girl

669
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
And she's there Wallet app

670
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
She will then marry his successor

671
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
Cyrus's successor

672
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Embassy

673
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,072
Not only will she then be married to her brother

674
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
But when can buy cease dies

675
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
Remember we had that very weird situation where Maybe Can't Buy sees his brother look the legitimate Heir takes over or maybe

676
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,176
Seizes the throne either way whoever it is that gets on the throne

677
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
He marries a Tulsa to

678
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
So she either marry her real brother again

679
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
She married the

680
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
Fake usurper

681
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,464
Whose blood shouldn't have contaminated her super royal blue blood at all

682
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
And the guy who may be killed

683
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Her brother

684
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
She been married

685
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Darius the great when he takes over

686
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
And remember

687
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,240
When he takes over he either did so by killing

688
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,568
The real heir to the throne brother husband

689
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,688
The Magi guy who seized the throne in which case he saved her from that

690
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
In a low level

691
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
Person who should never have been anywhere near the kingship

692
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
No matter which of those stories are true that's an amazing life right there

693
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
I look at it this way

694
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,024
This is a woman was either the daughter the mother or the wife

695
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Of the first

696
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:23,168
5 Kings of the achaemenid Persian Empire which by the way includes their greatest Kings

697
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,520
Wouldn't surprise anyone if she had a little influence at court would it

698
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
We can tell by reading about her

699
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
The little bit that seep through the she's not like some shrinking violet Prize or something it just gets passed around you can

700
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Tell that she's valuable

701
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,184
For what she knows that she's raised in this environment as I said you know when you're in the center of that vortex

702
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
All this history being made

703
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:53,632
Mitsubishi sounds like a political animal like someone who knows how to move the levers of power and influence

704
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,984
Rule through husbands and Sons and he's a fascinating character she's probably

705
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
The most famous powerful character

706
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,640
The female character in achaemenid Persian Empire history

707
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
The fact that so little is still known about her

708
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Just shows you

709
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,808
How much does Sarah is still sort of covered in a gray mist

710
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
With only the most bright and luminary characters

711
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,744
You know dimly appearing from the other side but a Tulsa is one of them

712
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
Atosa Sun

713
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,656
Xerxes will sort of have the opposite problem of his mother whereas

714
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,240
We have some facts and not enough color to flesh it out with her

715
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,360
With Xerxes whatever facts you have are so overwhelmed by the color

716
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,944
It's difficult to figure out who the guy you're dealing with really is

717
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,808
Way back in the early 1960s historians like a r burn

718
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
Pointed out that

719
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
There are some good qualities of Xerxes that even creep into the original sources like Herodotus

720
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Monroe quotes

721
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
Xerxes lives in the Greek tradition is the arch enemy

722
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
Presented naturally in an unfavorable light

723
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,800
Herodotus more generous to the enemy than later writers alone presenting in the round

724
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
Is Xerxes has a Persian love of natural beauty

725
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,712
He enjoys being munificent on a princely scale

726
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,016
He can forgive surrendered enemies

727
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,088
Even though surrendered in atonement for a war crime

728
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
He weeps for compassion over the mortality of mankind

729
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,000
He is easily roused rage by opposition

730
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,096
He is cruel when crossed even those lately favored

731
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
He has uncontrolled in Lost in it hard a coward

732
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
It is a well-conceived literary portrait

733
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
The character of an oriental Prince

734
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Born of good stock

735
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,664
Brought up to rule but not to tolerate opposition or Endura setback

736
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
There may be much truth in

737
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
And quote

738
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
You're my favorite erotica stories about

739
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,368
Xerxes is the one where

740
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
He tells the Spartan of the Spartans trying to reconstruct their damaged, I guess you could say for lack of a better

741
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:01,120
Edward we told the story a while back that when the Persians in the Spartans first got together

742
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,520
The Persian symptom diplomats in the After Earth and water which is the traditional token of submission in the Spartans

743
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
So you can get yours and water down there which of course kills them

744
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,968
But this is like a violation of the ancient world's version of international law

745
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,064
The gods frown upon treating diplomats like that

746
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,904
And supposedly the Oracle start giving the Spartans all these bad

747
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,488
Pronouncements for a while and they try to figure out okay how are we going to

748
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,840
Repair this karma for lack of a better word and basically they come up with this idea

749
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
But if they send a couple of Spartans

750
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,448
To the king of the Persians and he can do with

751
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
Them what you want

752
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Presumably he's going to kill them and we're going to even the score here

753
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
Did the Spartans ask for volunteers and some older

754
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
Wealthy Spartans maybe looking to

755
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,064
Find one last thing they can do you no further duty to the state volunteer to go be the sacrificial victim to show up

756
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,672
Xerxes court and say they're there to repair the karma and pay the karmic bill

757
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,768
For the death of the Persian diplomats and Xerxes says go home

758
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
Because you think I'm going to violate international law

759
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
A little like your parents saying two wrongs don't make a right that's kind of the way Xerxes it portrayed which is a pretty cool way to be all

760
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,872
Although there's perhaps a more intelligent way to look at it maybe Xerxes is thinking to himself

761
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Wait a minute

762
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
So they kill diplomats and get Bad Karma and now they want me to do the same thing no thank you I'd rather keep my

763
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
Karma untainted thank you very much go home this morning

764
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,232
That's a good portrait of Xerxes cuz otherwise he's mostly Voldemort

765
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
Or Darth Vader in the story

766
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
Other part of the fun is

767
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,448
He's like Darth Vader Who besides his black ominous getup happens to be wearing

768
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,800
Voltaire silk slippers at the same time so it's a little bit.

769
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,360
Little bit of a softer version perhaps in

770
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
And maybe something a little bit more luxurious

771
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
And wealthy and maybe just a hint of decadence um

772
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
More than the earlier Kings who came before him

773
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,624
Wechat the way it's always portrayed

774
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,280
I'm sure the Egyptians would not have thought that the Persians were any softer than they had been when Xerxes takes the Army his father

775
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,328
There was gathering to go punish the Greeks

776
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,656
And uses it against the Egyptians wood recently revolted

777
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,336
The literary Traditions have Xerxes being the first of the uncool Persian kings cuz if we said

778
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,480
Cedar reputation for soda coming in there and saying so you can keep doing business the way you want to keep your religion keep your way of doing things

779
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,832
Are there any new Boston town to order a hands-off all of a sudden Xerxes by the

780
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
In the writings of the Greek starts to look like the jerk

781
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:38,560
Goes into Egypt and start saying no more of this you don't get through this your way any more taxes room take more people for

782
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Building projects in

783
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
Egyptians are mad

784
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:48,288
But in a way you can kind of see the Persians point-of-view if they've been lenient with Egyptians all this time and Egyptians are still a pain in the

785
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,384
At what point does the pressure ratchet up to finally get tough on these people

786
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
Looking it up in the Persian point of view

787
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,295
Maybe you would say you're selfish and we tried to leave me in the Pro for these people time and time again

788
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
And they keep rebelling

789
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,695
Or maybe the whole thing is made up and it's all Greek propaganda and Xerxes ever did any of this

790
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,791
Would you know he crushed the Rebellion I don't need your PIN stay good for

791
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
A short period of time

792
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,983
The Judean this way also have revolted during this. The Babylonians Revolt twice

793
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
When you think yourself what

794
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Revolting

795
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,687
Punishments are going to happen to all these people who Revolt you would think the revolts would be fewer and farther between but they're not

796
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:33,087
And it should be pointed out that this is just the stuff we know about in Persia's West trying to

797
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,927
Divine history Persians like trying to Divine the history of the Moon

798
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,583
There's a light Side of the Moon that you can see and that's the side of Persia that faced Greece in the written about extensively

799
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,679
And it was near Babylon and Egypt in the other societies that kept Good Records

800
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,007
And then there's the Dark Side of the Moon which is everything

801
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
To the east of Persia which is a huge expanse of territory going up into modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan

802
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Just like that

803
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
That's almost

804
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Completely invisible

805
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,783
In terms of the historical record

806
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,183
The Persians may have had amazing battle and dealt with monstrous revolts over there we just don't know

807
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,583
Xerxes crushes efficiently the Revolt in these very important places in the Persian Empire

808
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
Egypt and Babylonia

809
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
My favorite story and Babylonians perhaps what you might call

810
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,055
The final solution to the Babylonian problem but it's not what you might think

811
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,175
They found during archaeological digs I guess a receipt

812
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Maybe you could call it

813
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
For a

814
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
Statue taken from Babylon

815
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
When the Revolt is crushed

816
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:43,487
By Xerxes the statue is the famous statue of the Babylonian God Marduk

817
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
Supposed to be solid gold

818
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,399
13 ft tall somewhere between 800 and 1300 lb

819
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:57,055
And this is the statue that anyone who wanted to be the ruler of Babylonia had to grasp the hands of

820
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
That was called grasping the hands of Marduk

821
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
Very important religious ceremony

822
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,039
When the Persians took that statue and apparently melted it down

823
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,647
They eliminated the ability of Marduk to grasp anybody's hands ever again

824
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
Hahaha we got your God

825
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
Isn't that what we said in the last version of the tale

826
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,167
The politics of dealing with the gods of local communities is fascinating fascinating aspect

827
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
Annie's early societies

828
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,567
And now what were the Babylonians going to do if they wanted a new local ruler

829
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,407
Mardels hands have been melted forever

830
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
I suppose if you're Babylonian that

831
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,599
Is a pretty big black mark next to Xerxes name forever in your book isn't it

832
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,463
What he hates God understand

833
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
After crushing these revolts

834
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,935
Xerxes will turn his attention now to finishing a job his father began

835
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,031
The job of conquering this Troublesome people

836
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Who inhabit

837
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
The European mainland

838
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:11,551
People that after the Battle of Marathon have had a good 10 years to prepare

839
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
For the return of the Persians remember

840
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
You might think of the Battle of Marathon is an Athenian or a Greek Victory but really all that they had done there is Perry

841
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
Persian blow

842
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
The Persian second blow should have come a lot sooner but they have the death of a king who's been on the throne for 36 years that'll throw off your

843
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Game a little bit

844
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:34,335
Then the succession then the crushing of multiple revolts not Ten Years After the Battle of Marathon

845
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:39,199
The Persians are ready for blow number two and blow number two is going to make Blow number one look like a cat

846
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,063
The preparations for this next Invasion will take

847
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Years

848
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,927
And will be visible to all the Greeks could not have been surprised

849
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,767
Some of the things that the Persians were doing just

850
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
The way for the next time they showed up

851
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,399
In a war hard to hide me for example

852
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
The last time the Persians were there

853
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,031
They had problems crossing the peninsula around a certain Mountain

854
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
Your feet have been wrecked

855
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Right at the tip of the point of the peninsula

856
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
So this time

857
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
It's been three or four years ahead of time

858
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,039
Digging a canal more than a mile long right through the

859
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
The neck of the peninsula right at the base

860
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Even have to go around the next time

861
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
Ancient author said two triremes can pass side-by-side

862
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:29,119
In the canalon apparently they can find remnants of it today

863
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,751
But that's the kind of thing that takes thousands and thousands of people and years and

864
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
The Greeks would have no

865
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
In addition unlike the last assault

866
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,967
In which culminated at the Battle of Marathon which was essentially an amphibious Landing

867
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,575
Which is kind of cool for this. When you think about the capabilities I mean moving Army

868
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,671
Shippan landing and supporting them and all that that's really cool but this time

869
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:58,559
They were going to go with more the old-fashioned route which leads a lot more historians cuz there's no agreement on this

870
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
To think that the second time the Persian come around this time LED in person by Xerxes the great king of

871
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Kings

872
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,823
This time it's a full invasion this is not a punitive Expedition

873
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
This is not something to

874
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:17,503
In a scare the locals all although history NPR Breon points out that this also would have been something

875
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,343
That the new King Xerxes would have used as a way to show the flag

876
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,207
And it's all the peoples your March the Army through their territory on the way to some other goal

877
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
And it has the subsidiary effective

878
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
Reminding the locals

879
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
You know who their King is

880
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
Dissuade any attempt to change that situation

881
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
Nonetheless if they're going to invade by land this time so they can take what is reported to be the largest army that

882
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,967
Did ever invaded anywhere in the world up until this time although let's remember these people did not know anything about the Chinese so

883
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,319
Take that out of your equation who knows how those numbers would have stacked up

884
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Unless you can't move in army that

885
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Over the sea

886
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:02,815
So you going to move it over the lad you going to attack Europe from Asia there's only one problem as you probably divined

887
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:08,447
There's water that separates Europe from Asia it's not very much and it's a strip but it's famous

888
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
The Dardanelles

889
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
The Greeks called it

890
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Palace Spa

891
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,407
Wide enough and with a strong enough current though to give anybody fits

892
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,991
Can't build a solid Bridge wouldn't last

893
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
Got to figure out a way around the problem

894
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,599
Diversion start doing that too

895
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,695
They begin to build floating Bridges across

896
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
At least two spots

897
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
The divide Europe from Asia

898
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,351
I think the narrow is like 1700

899
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,423
Yards around there but I think there's one that's like two miles long

900
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
The first bridge is destroyed

901
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,311
By the current in the storm so Xerxes has the

902
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,639
Men Who Built it the other ones in charge

903
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Beheaded

904
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
Within told

905
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:57,087
In a wonderful piece of her autistic that is a lot of color and that may have been true but who knows what the reason is

906
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
We're told the Xerxes orders

907
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,951
The water itself to be punished

908
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
For such activity

909
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
He has his men

910
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:11,679
Wade into the water this is from Herodotus though take it with a grain of salt this Monday just been a great movie scene who knows

911
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:17,311
But he says that Xerxes has been with the water with whips brand the water with Hot Irons

912
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,639
Throwing Federation like handcuffs into the water

913
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,991
And skull the water all the time while doing it for essentially being naughty

914
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
This is what Herodotus write

915
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,111
Xerxes did after finding out his first attempt

916
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,183
To build the bridge have been thwarted by a storm

917
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Herodotus quotes

918
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,535
Xerxes was infuriated when he learned of this

919
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,631
He ordered that the hellespont was to receive 300 lashes under the whip

920
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,447
Another pair of shackles was to be dropped into the sea

921
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,775
And I've also heard that he sent others to Brand the hellespont

922
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:53,407
In any case he instructed his men to say Barbarian an insolent things as they were striking the hellespont

923
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,479
I was quoting what the men were saying is they with the water

924
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Quote

925
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
Bitter water

926
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,367
Your master is imposing this penalty upon you for wronging him

927
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,927
Even though you had suffered no Injustice from him

928
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,999
And King Xerxes will crush you whether you like it or not

929
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,351
You just for just cause after all didn't know human offers you sacrifice

930
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
You are a turbid and Briny River

931
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
And quoting a neurologist says

932
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
Dusty order that the sea was to be punished

933
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,127
And also that the supervisors of the bridge over the hellespont where to be beheaded

934
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
Change quotes

935
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,783
Xerxes look like a bit of a nutjob there don't you

936
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,463
And maybe he was absolute power corrupts absolutely sometimes rides are cheese may have thought that made a difference on the other

937
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
And I always try to think of

938
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,863
These people is cynical just to see if there's a cynical answer for some of the stuff and I mean

939
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
Theoretically look at how

940
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:53,311
Bad it looks for the King of Kings is bridge to be destroyed by something that would appear to be an act of God to the logo

941
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,383
Almost certainly turned out to watch everything

942
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
Maybe the way you pacify the Rubes

943
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
And you

944
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
In a quell any worries that somehow

945
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
Maybe God's not happy with the King

946
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
Is the blame it on the water

947
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
And punish it

948
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Parsley

949
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,279
Maybe this was a public relations stunt

950
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
2

951
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631
Make the people know that the water was acting out of turn

952
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
And it won't do it again

953
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,519
Xerxes gets to work on the bridge again and they end up

954
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,383
Building at least one maybe two across the water using boats

955
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
We're told what they do is they put these boats

956
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:37,343
Side by side by side with the bow facing the current and then they last them all together they were

957
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,647
Boats strings of boats together

958
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
Then they lay planks

959
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
Across the boats and then they put sides up

960
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:49,375
Product assist to keep the animals from looking over the side and seeing the water and getting spooked

961
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
Then they put dirt down and pack it down

962
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:57,823
And all of a sudden you have a floating Bridge something they can handle the current because it can move up and down and be flexible

963
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
All of a sudden there's a bridge

964
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,199
Between Asia and Europe that a giant

965
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Nasty

966
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
Persian Army in Cross

967
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,415
With all its Cavalry and baggage and supplies and everything

968
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
These are the kind of engineering feats

969
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,839
That the Persians and the entire

970
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,935
Part of the world whose Heritage they were the inheritors of

971
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
Could do so well

972
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,751
Military engineering

973
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
And the Greeks were

974
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,431
Justifiably scared but it's important to point out

975
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,271
The best stories always emphasized there is no grease at this point

976
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,087
And there is no sense of national Greek

977
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
Consciousness

978
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,951
The people thought of things more in terms of the city-state they were from

979
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,767
Which is why they had so many problems with each other

980
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:53,119
A lot of this story that were telling here was actually created after the fact

981
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
As part of some historians think of

982
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:01,567
I'm a literary creation of a past Unity that may or may not have ever existed

983
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
But that this

984
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,199
Event which is really to the ancient Greeks the equivalent of like

985
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
Their second world war in terms of the

986
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
Interest in the fascination and how disruptive and important a thing it was and how how people talk about the long after

987
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,487
How many books and movies and everything we still sell on that event

988
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
This in part explains

989
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,399
You know why it's so exaggerated in there so much meth built on top of it so hard to

990
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,519
Tweeze the little facts from the fiction and then throwing all the western civilization stuff come

991
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
In a long after that and

992
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,359
Becomes hard to discern what really happy

993
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
But you can certainly tell

994
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,735
The Greeks are not foolish and they can see odds

995
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:45,599
And when they're not even really Greeks but in this case Athenians on one hand

996
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:50,463
We're spartans on the other hand thebans or are guys or corinthians

997
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
In other words

998
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
The Persian Empire against Greece is no contest the Persian Empire against some Greek city-states

999
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
Is less than Oconto

1000
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
In fact even seen this

1001
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,871
In the traditional sense of Greeks against Persians

1002
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,223
Is probably not accurate archaeologist Warwick ball who's trying

1003
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
Against

1004
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,783
All odd cuz of the sources

1005
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,343
To look at this more from a Persian point of view

1006
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
Would point out that in the end

1007
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,183
You have more Greeks

1008
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
Fighting on the side of the Great

1009
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
King of kings of Persia

1010
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
Then with his Brethren the Greeks

1011
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Supposedly fighting for Greek freedom

1012
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
So things may be a lot more complicated

1013
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,519
Ten thousands of years of historical

1014
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Tweaking

1015
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
Make it appear to be today

1016
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,711
One of my favorite part of the story though happens now

1017
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:49,855
When the Greeks do what people in this era did when you're worried about something and you need advice

1018
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,903
They went to the Gods

1019
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:58,047
And the Greeks go to the most famous of all the Oracles in this part of the world

1020
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Delphi

1021
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,423
The speak to the representative of Apollo

1022
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,007
Who kind of channels the voice of the god

1023
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Threw herself

1024
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:14,175
It's one of the fascinating parts of this this are in human history

1025
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,015
I think in when we were talking about Babylonian earlier and we talked about

1026
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:23,903
Magic 8 Balls and Ouija boards and how weird it was to almost have that side

1027
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,999
Are the metaphysical be so connected to things like policy decision

1028
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
Should we invade this country or not

1029
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:36,703
Shake a Magic 8-Ball sources say yes ask again later

1030
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
Outlook is positive immuno

1031
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
It is

1032
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Crazy soda to the modern mind

1033
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,407
But once again there are multiple ways of viewing it

1034
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
Some of them much more cynical that

1035
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Could suggest that some of this stuff

1036
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
Was only

1037
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
Metaphysical

1038
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,415
To maybe the rank-and-file on the ground maybe the sophisticated people working this

1039
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
Eric langill

1040
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
I totally different way for example

1041
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,583
The kings of Persia traditionally gave lots of good stuff to all the order

1042
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,655
Liam play any favorites and they covered all their bases

1043
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,935
Why taking a chance

1044
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
And the Oracle of Delphi

1045
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,079
Channeling the voice of the god of Apollo

1046
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:20,735
Was friends with the Persians that the Persians were friends with the god Apollo and they proved it many times in material ways

1047
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
The Oracle of Delphi was

1048
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
Usually Pro Persian

1049
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
In this case the Athenians go to basically say

1050
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:33,791
Okay we know the great King's coming back and we're trying to work together to figure out some ideas and

1051
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,887
You know maybe we should have a Navy maybe we should have an army maybe we should work with the Spartans mean

1052
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
Let's ask a little advice go to the

1053
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
Pythia Indigo in this Temple

1054
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
There's a woman there

1055
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Supposedly

1056
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,711
They are matronly didn't like 50 years old cuz once they used to be like teen virgin and it didn't work out too well

1057
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,783
So they just dressed he's 50 year old women like

1058
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
Teens

1059
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
Put them on

1060
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,183
A tripod that was in a cauldron Maybe

1061
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
I don't know exactly but one of those

1062
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
Accounts of the disc called and had like little air holes

1063
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
In the bottom

1064
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607
So that the fumes

1065
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,191
From a crack in the earth that they were placed over

1066
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,543
Could seep up through the cauldron into their nostrils

1067
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,615
And allow them to channel the god

1068
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,711
This is a fascinating thing you could go into oracle's forever

1069
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,527
I love diodorus siculus as a

1070
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,367
Account of how they even found this was a crack in the earth he says in it

1071
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,487
A sheep from a Shepherd fell into the crack in the shepherd went in to look for the sheep and all of a sudden

1072
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,303
You know he could see the past and he could see the future and he was

1073
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,071
Well

1074
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:43,423
It's wild stop and historians and scientists ever since I've been trying to figure out

1075
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
Assuming it's true

1076
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
What the heck made this woman the pythia she was causing it was associated with snakes by the way so that makes it more exotic and

1077
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Interesting and weird

1078
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:59,807
Yeah what she was on what she was taking what she chewing Laurel leaves are Oleander leaves or something or

1079
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
Was there something to this idea of

1080
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Crack in the Earth

1081
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:09,279
That she's sad over and the fumes did it to her told the hair stood on end skin change color they spoke in tongues

1082
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Songs

1083
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,887
Suspiciously sometimes you couldn't understand a word they said and they have these handlers

1084
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,959
You know who kind of interpreted here's what she saying

1085
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:21,055
And sometimes even with the interpretation you had to go back

1086
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
2

1087
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,175
You know your city and it was like reading a fortune cookie and you had to start a debate with that said that's really how

1088
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
Helpful they have to do that a lot with an okay here's what she said what the heck does that mean I think it means this woe course you would you want to do that anyway

1089
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,671
I think it means that we'll of course you would that your point of view so many things like that sometimes

1090
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
In this case

1091
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,815
When you things basically say you know what we do about the Persians were coming back

1092
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,679
The Oracle gives one of its most fire and brimstone and scary

1093
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983
Pronouncements I've ever read

1094
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,823
Her giving or unless you want to stay at the Apollo

1095
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
The Oracle says

1096
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
Why is it so idle

1097
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,271
You poor Wretched Man

1098
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
To the ends of the land you should flee

1099
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,415
Leave your homes leave the heights of your circular Fortress

1100
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,231
Bonita the head nor the body remains in it

1101
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Place

1102
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,791
Ignore the feet underneath

1103
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,583
Northern hands northern middle

1104
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
Is left as it was

1105
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Now all

1106
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Skewer

1107
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,215
Forecasting it down

1108
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
Aspire

1109
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,823
An Aries so sharp on the heels of Assyrian chariot

1110
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,639
And he will destroy many cities with Towers

1111
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
And not yours alone

1112
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,527
I need to the devouring fire he will give the temples of Eternal gods

1113
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,319
Witching out dripping with sweat

1114
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
And shaking their fear

1115
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,439
As blood gushes Darkly from the top of their roofs

1116
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
Foreseeing the force of

1117
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Compelling disaster

1118
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
Step out of the shrine

1119
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
And shroud over your heart

1120
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
The evil

1121
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
What's to come

1122
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,263
I'd gone to the god Apollo to ask

1123
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,823
What they should do in the face of

1124
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
Persian invasion

1125
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,199
When the god Apollo in no uncertain terms told them

1126
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
Run for their lives

1127
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,367
As you might imagine the Athenians are horrified

1128
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,975
But that response in imagine if you really took this seriously how horrified you could be by

1129
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,791
Somebody just prophesized your doom

1130
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,351
They're encouraged to go back

1131
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,911
Try to get another

1132
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,007
So they may be like a follow-up question in in a roundabout way

1133
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
And they're given one of those cryptic fortune cookie type responses which they take back to Athens and everybody starts.

1134
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
Are you over

1135
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
The bottom line though is

1136
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,367
That it results in Athens deciding to build a Navy

1137
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,695
Time it comes at the expense of Athens deciding to

1138
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,767
Supporting Army was sort of an either-or proposition

1139
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:55,679
But Athens will be known forever afterwards at a great Naval power this is where they develop

1140
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,751
Really for the first time and they do it 2

1141
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,079
Your take on the great king or at least give them

1142
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
There's some ability to cope it's

1143
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,991
Because not only does the great king have a massive Army

1144
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
So were told

1145
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,831
Give a massive Fleet as well

1146
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,671
This time it's a battle Fleet as opposed to maybe an amphibious Landing

1147
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,975
Toledo Supply Fleet although some historians think it's

1148
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Supplied the army

1149
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
All the Army was marching

1150
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,911
No wonder I was helping the Army was and nobody knows how big the fleet was

1151
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,751
Herodotus as

1152
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:36,895
One of the many exaggerated will claim that when all the people and their servants and everyone else is added up

1153
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,711
Xerxes Army is more than 5 million men

1154
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
This fleet has more than

1155
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,807
A thousand ships

1156
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
As we said earlier

1157
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,975
Everybody knows those numbers are wrong but nobody knows what numbers are right

1158
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Everyone has a way of argue

1159
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,959
But even if we play with relatively low Ball numbers and just say

1160
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,007
50000 soldiers

1161
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,823
Fifty thousand people is your average size

1162
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,895
College football stadium is it a pretty good-sized

1163
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Football stadium

1164
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
Xerxes Army

1165
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
We'll be on the road for a long time

1166
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,599
Imagine trying to keep 50000 people

1167
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
In a stadium

1168
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
Marching

1169
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
Hundreds and hundreds of miles alive and well and ready to fight at a distant location and imagine

1170
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,375
I'm trying to do that 2500 years ago

1171
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
Xerxes Army will cross

1172
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
Hellespont over the bridge

1173
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,311
Erotic just says it took

1174
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,871
7 days for the whole Army to cross

1175
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
He runs down famously takes

1176
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Images of Herodotus

1177
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,527
He runs down every

1178
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:51,391
Contingent in the Army and he says 46 Nations took part

1179
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,487
There's a reason they call the Persian king the king of kings

1180
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
Because he ruled over a bunch of people

1181
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,887
Still have their own Kings they just answered to the Persian king

1182
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,495
Their kings were sometimes called

1183
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
Going to put them on or take them off at will

1184
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Herodotus says that they all showed up

1185
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Enero

1186
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
Traditional

1187
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
Local garb

1188
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,647
Ready to fight in their traditional ways write the Assyrians the last great military Empire this region would eventually

1189
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Turn them all into a serious it would look like Roman legionary they be uniform and they would all fight the same way the Persians

1190
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,655
These units fight at whatever they were good at if you had a bunch of croatians

1191
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
And they were nasty if you met him in the forest in the Hill Country

1192
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:43,871
Will you bring them along and when you have somebody up in the hills giving you trouble you send the Thracians to go deal with them right

1193
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,943
I have some Apache Scouts I keep them in case I'm fighting Apache

1194
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
Herodotus goes down this list

1195
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:56,671
And what strikes you when you read it and he goes into what they're armed with and what their clothing look like and what their facial features and ethnic features look like

1196
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,999
Is that the Xerxes is bringing people's from

1197
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,071
Three different continents with him to attack Greece

1198
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
From Europe Asia and Africa

1199
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
He's got sub-Saharan African troops

1200
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:16,127
Ford roeske says in leopard and lion skins with Antelope horn Spears

1201
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,199
Painting half their body white with chalk the other half

1202
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
Red

1203
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
I'm carrying six-foot-tall kanebo the supposedly only they could pull back to they were so strong

1204
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
But with

1205
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,767
Stone tipped arrows

1206
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:38,143
I need hose down the list of all these exotic peoples and historians have been wondering ever since

1207
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,983
What this mean to be people all get out there and fight

1208
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
Is it symbolic instead in meant to convince people all along the way in a grease and everybody along the way look at the Majesty of the

1209
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,735
The great king look at all these exotic people he has a zoo

1210
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,319
And all these people are the animals in the great king is the zookeeper

1211
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
They're all in their most

1212
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:02,719
You know colorful feathers and look at my Army is In Bloom maybe it's like that

1213
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
Some historians have suggested

1214
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,863
All those people could be hostages

1215
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
For the good behavior the rest of the Empire right how many revolted they've been dealing with and you're going to take this enormous Army and the

1216
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,567
King of kings and take them to Europe

1217
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,639
Doesn't encourage everyone to revolt well

1218
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
What if you have two or three thousand

1219
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:30,367
You know of the sons of the nobility of all those places with you on campaigns that's what the guarantee of good

1220
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
Behavior

1221
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
So that's been

1222
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Theorize

1223
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,023
The core of the army of Persian

1224
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,143
And related people's the ones who won the Empire the ones who hold the empire

1225
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
The very dangerous group

1226
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:51,359
Berserk cease has around him so he may have all these subject people but the people that are going to Bear the brunt of

1227
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
This thing

1228
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:57,247
Are desperately good fighter even though history in the Greek time is portrayed the Minnesota

1229
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,343
Driven Along by the Lash

1230
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,159
And nothing more than the slaves of the soap

1231
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Slipper wearing Darth Vader

1232
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
Listen determinant number of people

1233
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,887
Gather all through 481 BCE and was now modern-day turkey

1234
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:18,495
In the spring of 480 BCE they will cross from Asia into Europe

1235
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,031
Begin

1236
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:25,663
If you're looking at a map to to go around a body of water and now descend on Grease

1237
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,431
From above

1238
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
From the north

1239
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:33,855
Perhaps it is a sign of exactly how disunited the Greeks are

1240
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:41,279
That would the Persian preparations that advanced and the Persian army bearing down on them the Greek still

1241
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,559
Will have a hard time

1242
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
In a crafting together any sort of Unified

1243
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,703
Approach to dealing with the Persians rent in fact

1244
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,775
And if you tell the story the old-fashioned way

1245
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:58,175
There's a lot of politics going on right now is the Greek try to form this alliance system in what cities are going to stay out what cities are going to go in

1246
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,247
Eventually only about 10% will join.

1247
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
Buy Persian Alliance

1248
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
But you can understand why I look at how

1249
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,159
These city-states would have to bury their even recent

1250
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
Differences with each other

1251
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,255
Take Argos

1252
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:17,375
For instance who just fought a war with Sparta where they lost 6,000 people

1253
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:23,007
Now they're going to join an alliance of going to be General by a Spartan General

1254
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,223
A lot of States Argos included will remain neutral against the Persian and a lot of states will join the Persians especially in the North End

1255
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,039
Can't blame him because of the north is where the Persians are

1256
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,135
Easy to flip the Persians the bird from down south

1257
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,927
You know where Sparta is

1258
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Little different if you're up in thessaly

1259
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,255
With the purge

1260
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:48,863
Persian diplomacy with that much more effective would happen to have the Army there with it

1261
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
Especially if it was all

1262
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,215
Decked out a lot of feathers and warpaint a very exotic looking for

1263
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,239
What three continents

1264
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,615
This Royal Army is like a loaded gun

1265
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,663
Cocked and pointed down

1266
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,711
In a towards the mainland

1267
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,111
Sometime around this time. The Athenians begin evacuating Athens

1268
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
A lot of it by seeing

1269
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
Herodotus

1270
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:18,559
Makes it seem like a desperate effort to get the women and the children and the elderly in the slaves off

1271
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,655
The mainland it off to these islands where they can hopefully be safe because the

1272
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,263
Understanding uses if the Persians break into Central Greece which is

1273
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,103
You're part of War Athens is feed places like that too

1274
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
A scientist do

1275
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,991
Remember the Oracle kind of said they needed to run well

1276
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,063
They're taking it seriously they know that

1277
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,879
Yeah they're on the Persians

1278
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,439
Naughty list and probably the number one

1279
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,327
Naughtiest Greek state in the eyes of the Persians and if the Persian get into Central Greece there's nothing there.

1280
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
Removing right on Athens

1281
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
So the Greeks end

1282
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,495
A force to block the

1283
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Now

1284
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,383
We get into areas now that are much are you by the experts

1285
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,223
And I am not qualified to even have a favorite position

1286
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
Amongst mm

1287
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:14,623
The problems would have stems from Herodotus you know you were lying on this guy cuz you don't have anyone else

1288
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,719
Coloring drama and story he's awesome

1289
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:25,119
But when it comes to real military detail that you can reconstruct and make sense out of afterwards

1290
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Not so awesome

1291
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Heavily criticized

1292
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
This and that and the other thing and so

1293
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:35,615
Everything has to be taken with a grain of salt he may not even really

1294
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,919
Understood well some of the military real

1295
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
What is here

1296
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,551
His ability to write though what probably amounts to some of the

1297
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,599
This this guy is the guy who wrote

1298
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
The oldest surviving

1299
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,303
Battle scenes of the sort that we would know in literature and entertainment

1300
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,375
Movies and everything else ever since I mean this

1301
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,447
Herodotus histories is chock-full of battle scenes

1302
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
Buy a screenwriter

1303
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
An orphan that afro

1304
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
The one he has for

1305
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,919
Thermopylae is part of the reason Thermopylae has become

1306
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
The greatest military Last Stand in history

1307
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:16,319
Let me think about how many of those there must have been throughout the entire

1308
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,879
Length and breadth of human affairs

1309
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:24,511
Thousands and thousands of great Last Stand stories but if no one survived to write the account them

1310
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,631
Do they like that proverbial tree falling in the forest does it make a sound if no one's there to hear it

1311
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,447
And you also have to get it

1312
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
By the way

1313
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
From the sympathetic point of view

1314
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,591
What's going to be the Battle of Thermopylae

1315
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:45,759
It's going to sound very different if it's a Persian oral historian describing it to his audience then if Herodotus is describing it to Agra

1316
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Week 1

1317
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
The moment with the Great

1318
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,951
Including in his Entourage and exiled Spartan King

1319
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,511
Arrived in front of the hot Gates

1320
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,375
The blocking position that the Greeks have taken up on land Thermopylae

1321
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,983
Cuz you're writing the Persian history of this

1322
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
You basically say

1323
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
Within a week

1324
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,103
The great king forced

1325
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,455
This position outflank turned this position that was the strongest engine

1326
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:21,087
While at the same time killing the Spartan King a bunch of his elite soldiers

1327
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,415
1000 or more other Greeks and a bunch of other Greeks ran away

1328
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
You can add to that

1329
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
That your Fleet

1330
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,327
Thought a Greek blocking pleated place called Art Museum

1331
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,887
We're told on like the same day

1332
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,679
Both sides were

1333
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
Roughly handle

1334
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
Is the way historians like

1335
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
The great term

1336
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,103
But the Greeks ran away

1337
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:50,015
Now they may have gone down to Athens because Athens at this point is evacuate

1338
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:56,415
This is part of what also brings home the stakes of all this and it makes us

1339
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:02,559
Sympathetic forever with the Greek cause on so many levels because all the story elements are in their favor

1340
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,095
And when your

1341
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
Can you get refugees and women and children and old people jumping onto ships to Fleet offshore Islands because they will

1342
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,335
Die or be enslaved or something if they stay

1343
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
Hard not to have some sympathy

1344
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
When the story is about

1345
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,759
You know 6 ft 5 in tall Giant

1346
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,343
About to go beat up a four foot tall man

1347
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111
Again

1348
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Are natural

1349
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
Sympathies tend to go to the underdog

1350
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,023
The fact that you a lot of us

1351
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,607
The Greeks are the home team for Western Civilization as we said earlier

1352
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,167
And there are a lot of reasons

1353
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,727
To not see the story The Way

1354
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:46,847
The majority of people during this time. Not on the Greek side would have

1355
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:54,527
Which is that the Greeks made what would have seemed like a relatively feeble effort to stop the great king at the pass of Thermopylae and the

1356
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
Breaking brush them aside

1357
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:03,231
In the ancient sources say he suffered 20000 dead

1358
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
Look at the out of proportion

1359
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Casual

1360
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
Spartans in there

1361
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,375
Allies called

1362
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:15,263
It's before buying remember he puts the Persians it over 5 million men

1363
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,079
Do the math that means that they

1364
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,943
Turn the strongest defensive positioning Breeze kill the Spartan King is

1365
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,759
Guard basically and a bunch of other Greeks

1366
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,111
At the cost of less than half a percent of his total Force

1367
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
Most military commanders would take that any day

1368
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
Wants to

1369
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
Persians are through

1370
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:40,607
Thermopylae there in the Central Greece and now the loaded weapon

1371
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
Is right up against the head

1372
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
Places like affirm

1373
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Thieves

1374
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
Central Breeze

1375
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,591
Now that story is much much better as you might expect

1376
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
If you're listening to Herodotus tell it

1377
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,455
Because we just told

1378
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,271
You know the equivalent of the story of the Alamo

1379
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,063
From the Mexican side

1380
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:06,719
Which is we got a little delayed at the Alamo they killed a bunch of our guys no big deal but I'm with children last one of them we moved on

1381
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:14,911
From the Greek point of view this is an inspirational account and it starts were told to be inspirational from the get-go

1382
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,959
It had an effect on the war effort

1383
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
But then it's been one of those

1384
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
Things that have inspired people ever since

1385
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,431
Herodotus says he's learn the name of all 300 Spartan

1386
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
Who fell at the Bible

1387
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,831
You could have gone back and told those people we'd still be talking about them

1388
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
2500 years later I wonder what they react

1389
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
She would be

1390
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Nonetheless

1391
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:45,119
We would be remiss if we suggested they had only been 300 Spartans at this battle in the Persian show up and are blocked

1392
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Thermopylae

1393
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,935
There are thousands of Greeks

1394
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
On the other side of the

1395
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,263
Now here's the thing to understand this past

1396
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,055
Doesn't look the same today

1397
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
That you go look at it now it doesn't look that

1398
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Composing but

1399
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,455
If you go look at the Recreations of people have mocked up about where the water used to be

1400
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,735
Which is receded

1401
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,831
You basically have a narrow strip of beach between the mountains in the water

1402
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,671
In some places the Ancient Order said it was so narrow you could hardly fit

1403
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,535
A horse-drawn cart through at the normally like a hundred yards I saw one

1404
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,071
Mockup suggesting

1405
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,863
In any case the point

1406
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
That makes it useful

1407
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,495
Is nullify so many of the person's advantages If there really are more Persians

1408
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
I can't really use those numbers 10

1409
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
Can't get around

1410
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
In the past like that the main person Advantage their Cavalry can't get around that you can basically have a solid line

1411
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,807
Kind of armed and armored men

1412
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Stretching from the mountains to the Sea

1413
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,279
It's a solid body of truth there's nothing you can do but go straight at it and going straight out of his what the Greeks were best

1414
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
With the Persians

1415
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
We're beginning to

1416
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
Trouve

1417
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,399
At least one facing Greeks

1418
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
They weren't pasta

1419
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
Now

1420
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:58,335
If you have a long memory you will recognize that we have now come full circle

1421
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,383
Go to where we actually began this Tale

1422
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
The story of

1423
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,783
In my mind's eye I see all these Spartan troops as

1424
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,111
A manifestation of Clint Eastwood somehow

1425
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,463
Herodotus has Xerxes and his

1426
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,351
Advisor who happens to be an exiled King of Sparta himself as a pretty good advisor if you're looking at Spartans

1427
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,703
Going over the finer points

1428
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,543
The Spy said he went and looked at the past and saw these

1429
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:32,895
Long haired Warriors combing their hair and doing bodyweight exercises

1430
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,575
Xerxes turn to the Spartan king of 50 people the small group of people they're not going to try to contest the past are they and that's when

1431
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
Yes they are

1432
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Kill me if I'm a liar

1433
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
This dramatic tail

1434
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:56,191
But the resistance of these Greeks dying for any number of themes that have been heaped upon this events

1435
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Since

1436
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,799
Fidelity to the state

1437
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
Loyalty to their comrades

1438
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,199
Sacrifice for the greater good

1439
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,783
Freedom of your PS2 online and all the themes are

1440
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,063
Heaped upon one another

1441
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,439
Why it's so difficult to see this in the person point of view can from the prison front of you none of these themes are here

1442
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,839
The heroism of Davy Crockett means nothing to Santa Anna's Mexican right

1443
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:32,031
Remember it's Plutarch 450 years later or thereabouts who says the response that lie

1444
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,079
King of the Spartans remember

1445
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
That we have two of them

1446
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,383
This one maybe

1447
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
You can call the spare

1448
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
Official lamb

1449
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,063
Is a descendant of Heracles supposedly who is a descendant of Zeus so

1450
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,903
This is a Spartan Kings got Zeus's blood in his veins nobigdyl

1451
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,231
But supposedly according to Plutarch

1452
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,303
The Persians are from the typical Persian deal you guys

1453
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
And join us we make you the kings of Greece you have more than you ever had before you profit we profit it's all good

1454
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,263
Just lay down your arms in the

1455
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:08,127
Answer the wonderful answer you see them blazing done caps today cuz long different causes

1456
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Including

1457
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
Second Amendment Firearms causes here in the United States

1458
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,783
Adopted the phrase molon labe

1459
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
Translated the hundred different ways

1460
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
Come and take them

1461
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Is a

1462
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Standard

1463
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,535
Lay down your arms

1464
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:30,655
Maybe we can add come and take them from our cold dead hands

1465
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,983
But if you're looking at this from the Persian point of view

1466
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,775
That's exactly what they do

1467
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,591
The chill Clint Eastwood

1468
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,919
And the other Clint Eastwood's and all the other Greeks warned Clint Eastwood

1469
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,527
And they pry the weapons from your cold dead hands and they move on

1470
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,671
And if you're ready Clint Eastwood defender back in the Greek city-state to go yet but they killed

1471
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:56,767
10 Persians for everyone they lost Niger the Persian king Hugo so what

1472
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
I have lots of

1473
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,423
That side of the Persian

1474
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:08,799
Intimidating qualities is not really been brought out here who cares

1475
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,407
I will spend 20 lives

1476
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,711
To take you down how's it feel

1477
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
I mean it

1478
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,319
If you look at it the right way this is brutally intimidating

1479
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:25,183
And since historians can't agree on what the Greeks strategy was

1480
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,559
They can't really determine how big of a deal Thermopylae was in terms of a disaster

1481
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,423
But since a lot of historians think it might have been an attempt

1482
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,959
2 block

1483
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,055
The Persians and keep them out of the rest of grease on land and there was

1484
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Happy sad

1485
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,663
A corresponding blocking forces

1486
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,967
C2 with cape Art Museum

1487
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,879
If that force was intended to Halt the Persians like these historians think so that the supplies could begin to run out in The Purge

1488
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:59,743
Army could starve and go straggling back to Persia like Napoleon straggling out of Russia

1489
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,303
That's a good strategy by the way

1490
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,839
But if that's the strategy

1491
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,679
How else but as a horrible failure do you judge

1492
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:12,287
The inability to hold that most defensive position in all of Greece

1493
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,616
For a week really only 2 or 3 days or actual fighting

1494
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
If we're honest with ourselves

1495
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,992
Degree skip blown out at Thermopylae

1496
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,320
Nephrologist is being honest with us

1497
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:27,648
The Persians to be unusual step of decapitating

1498
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
You know the

1499
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,512
Descendant of Heracles and sticking his head on a stick

1500
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
As they marched

1501
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,584
Out of the mountain passes

1502
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
And into Central Greece

1503
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,520
You can almost hear the background

1504
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,312
Juneau Empire music

1505
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:51,712
And the heavy breathing of Darth Vader as you know he he walks through the pass while rides on his chariot

1506
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
The silk slippers

1507
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,832
Don't handle the rocks in the road very well you

1508
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
Herodotus is version of the fight of Thermopylae which would have been heard by Greek audience members within the living

1509
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,816
In memory of those events

1510
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
Is somewhat more colorful detailed in

1511
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,960
More heroic certainly meaning

1512
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,776
In Herodotus is tailing it may be true

1513
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,432
The Greeks are holding their own in fact they're beating the Persians every time the Persians attack the past their beaten back by Greek

1514
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Horses

1515
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,576
It's only because some Trader shows up and betrays the Greek cause 4 Gold

1516
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
Persians are always

1517
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,952
Getting people to betray their people for gold imagine that

1518
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,000
And the trailer shows

1519
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,608
You know the forces of King Xerxes a secret path behind the Greek defenses

1520
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,680
Xerxes sends troops behind the Greek rear

1521
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:48,544
And in one of the versions of this Leonidas is able to get the other Greeks to

1522
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
Head back

1523
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
In safety

1524
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:56,992
To their cities to fight another day and sort of defends The Retreat to the last man who becomes the rear guard

1525
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
It's another version of this story

1526
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,368
If you don't buy into the idea that this was an attempt to

1527
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
Hold the Persians until there

1528
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:09,280
Supplies ran out then maybe you buy into the through the dishes of delaying action in which case

1529
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,936
The death of the Spartans achieve something they left the rest of the Greeks getaway this is the second world war Dunkirk evacuation

1530
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,984
Ancient Greece in a Spartan King

1531
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,544
And 300 of his man and a bunch of other Greeks

1532
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,872
I don't want to cover the retreat for the rest of the Greek army and that may be true

1533
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:28,992
Administering pointed out if the person Calvary get to the other side of the mountain

1534
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:35,392
And there's a whole bunch of Greek hoplites from miles in front of the retreating they're going to have a field day spearing those people in the back so

1535
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
Could have saved a lot of lives here

1536
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
Herodotus's account of course is much more colorful

1537
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,328
He has the Persian king

1538
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
Setting up a

1539
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Throne

1540
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,424
Maybe you can call it in mobile phone

1541
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,496
And he sets it up what he can watch what's going on here

1542
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,568
Supposedly like to watch all these encounters on land or sea

1543
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,360
Even so degrading

1544
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,664
Describe

1545
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,712
Phoenicians get a demerit for their performances

1546
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,016
Let me know if that kind of thing

1547
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,320
And Herodotus says he's sending in

1548
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,136
Unit after unit to fight the Greeks and they all get

1549
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,160
Beaten back

1550
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:11,744
But they're short Spears can't help with the Greeks

1551
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:16,864
And it finally the king decides to sending his Guard unit The Immortals

1552
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:22,496
But his Immortals run into more than their match when they run into Spartans and

1553
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:23,776
If what

1554
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,568
Herodotus says is true

1555
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:32,480
Anyone who's ever been out on a field trying to do Maneuvers with other human beings and having all work together can understand what if

1556
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,624
Beat this would be an advantage in combat

1557
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,952
After the medes and the kissing hands get destroyed

1558
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:47,328
Badly handled by trying to assault the Greeks in the past years when Herodotus is colorful account

1559
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,680
Of The Next Step turns out to be wild Xerxes the great teen watches quote

1560
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,520
Since the medes were suffering extremely rough treatment

1561
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,800
They now withdrew

1562
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:01,664
And the Persians under the command had Arnie's on the king called The Immortals

1563
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,712
Came forth to take their place

1564
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,784
It was every expectation that they at least would prevail

1565
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,856
Open a joint battle with the Helens the Greeks

1566
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,648
They fared no better than the meat

1567
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,208
LED they suffered the very same setbacks

1568
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,864
The fighting continued to take place in a confined space with the Persians using shorter Spears than those of the

1569
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,704
The Helen able to derive any advantage from their Superior numbers

1570
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,496
Black Adam onions

1571
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
Meaning of Spartans

1572
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,312
But remarkably well

1573
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,664
Proving that they were experts in Battle For Fighting among men who were not

1574
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,760
Especially whenever they would turn their backs and Fain flight all together

1575
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,576
And The Barbarians seeing this would pursue them

1576
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,368
With much clattering shouting

1577
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:47,744
The Barbarians to catch up with them and then suddenly turn around to face them

1578
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,304
At which point they would slay countless numbers of

1579
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,120
All the Spartans do cells however

1580
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,656
Only a few fell bear

1581
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
Finally the Persians retreated

1582
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:01,056
Since despite all their efforts to attack by regiments or by any other means

1583
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,616
They could not gain any ground in the past

1584
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
It is said that during these assaults

1585
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,456
The king who was watching

1586
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,784
Left up from his throne three times in fear for his army

1587
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,160
Descended the contest that day and on the next two barbarians Didn't Know Better

1588
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:25,376
That's a feel for how Herodotus portrays this and he goes through all the details I mean eventually Leonidas

1589
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
Killed

1590
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,728
It will be a fight restroom over his body to retrieve it

1591
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
Eventually

1592
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,336
Are the Spartans will Retreat up

1593
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:39,968
Choke point with your the wall and they will be down to fighting with their bare hands in their teeth

1594
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,272
It's this gripping accounting

1595
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:46,112
It's hard to look at it from the Persian side

1596
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,512
And see anything but the bad guys in the story fits the Cowboys and the Indians are the Indians in the 1950

1597
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,280
He's right

1598
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
Are the Zulus I mean you know

1599
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
Filling the gap

1600
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,912
Annie's kind of stories there's always these

1601
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:05,568
Defenders sitting there fighting Doom. Doing it for some greater cause and a whole bunch of ants

1602
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,640
This story is Herodotus tells at the Persians are the ants

1603
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:13,504
But the bottom line is no matter how heroic it was

1604
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,832
In the summer of 480 the answer and Central Greece

1605
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,880
Any burning Athens

1606
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,232
This is the real net result

1607
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,024
I'm losing the battle

1608
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,792
Thermopylae

1609
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,632
Set the Persians break into the Open Country of Central Greece

1610
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,776
Many of these cities are already going over to the Persians a bunch of other ones due to

1611
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:43,200
Important places like thieves are on the Persian sign all these cities will now provide troops to his army

1612
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,784
To use for the rest of this campaign it's starting to look like the war's over isn't it

1613
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,832
This is a mapa Bedford isn't it

1614
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,904
The cities that don't cooperate

1615
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
With the Persians

1616
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
Are destroyed

1617
01:26:55,744 --> 01:27:01,632
Potatoes destroy potatoes the city that fought 10 years before this time against this King of Kings

1618
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,680
With the Athenians the Battle of Marathon

1619
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
Long memories

1620
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Gone

1621
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
Thespian

1622
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:13,152
You just lost a bunch of thespian hoplites with the Spartans at Thermopylae destroyed

1623
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
Daffins

1624
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:22,624
All the homes of the Acropolis the few people who would not evacuated with the rest of the population were killed

1625
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,184
We're told Xerxes sins

1626
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,512
A message back to his capital in Asia

1627
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,864
But she left three months previously remember over that bridge of boats

1628
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,704
Essentially telling his people that when it comes to these Athenians

1629
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Mission accomplished

1630
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
How something happen

1631
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,872
In the story

1632
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,664
That will totally

1633
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
Change the complexion of everything

1634
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:55,904
But it's hard to figure out exactly how it happens or which stories are true or what-have-you all you can say with any soda

1635
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Truax

1636
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,840
Persians will get involved in a naval battle with the combined navies of the Greeks were fighting

1637
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,936
They may have been tricked into the sink

1638
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:14,848
A bunch of historians think that it's the major mistake Xerxes makes in this whole campaign cuz he didn't even need to fight a naval

1639
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,712
You talk for hours about what will become the battle of salla

1640
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,088
Historians argue about whether or not it's one of the most important battles of all time

1641
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,928
Others will say that this battle of plataea which were going to get to

1642
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,744
Is instead the most important so what's up

1643
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,024
Tomato tomahto

1644
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
Historian

1645
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
I'm here but

1646
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,376
The Battle of Salamis involves a character

1647
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:43,008
How much is character actually corresponds to the historical figure named Themistocles

1648
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
Is anyone's guess but the character is

1649
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
Fantastic

1650
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Annies

1651
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:56,320
Note after the second World War I rent for events in history that were suggesting it after the second world war this entire Greek Persian story

1652
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,136
Captains of the second world war analogy and in that

1653
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
Version of things

1654
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,464
Themistocles is Churchill

1655
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,024
But what that doesn't capture

1656
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:10,144
Is it there such a wonderfully clever tricky roguish lovable

1657
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,544
Does the right thing in the wrong I mean he's Hans Solo rather than Winston Churchill if we're going to stick with our Star Wars

1658
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
Xerxes is Darth Vader

1659
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
Themistocles is Han Solo

1660
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,712
But he's trying to get in Herodotus a story anyway

1661
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:30,112
The Greek stuff to pull together because this is one of the reasons you know the war is almost over.

1662
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,416
Look out for their own interest right

1663
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,464
All the Greeks below

1664
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:40,864
Something called the Isthmus of Corinth which is another one of these natural choke point in the geography they're all trying to build a wall

1665
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Cross that and defend themselves

1666
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,240
Which is great if you live south of that like Sparta and corentin

1667
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,264
Are ghosts real

1668
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,080
Not so good if you live north of it like Athens.

1669
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,432
Cuz the Persians are already there so this is when there's a lot of

1670
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,832
Very wonderfully roguish bargaining going on with Themistocles is using the Athenian Fleet as a

1671
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:04,672
Basically saying what half of your Fleet Is Us

1672
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,768
If you don't do more to help us when we're leaving

1673
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,816
And then where will you be

1674
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,352
At the mercy of the Persian Fleet

1675
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,680
Bunnelby wonderful jousting going on

1676
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
You're my favorite

1677
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,544
Comeback line to his is when the Admiral from Corinth

1678
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
Points out that you don't even have any standing

1679
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,480
Do we having this conversation is for people about the fate of city-states and you don't have one anymore

1680
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,016
Meaning Athens is gone

1681
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
The Great Wall

1682
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,136
A traditionally in the righteous version of the story

1683
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:41,536
Are wonderful Han Solo lovable Rogue who tricks you into doing the right thing supposedly tricks the Greeks

1684
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,560
In the fighting

1685
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
The Battle of Salamis

1686
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,680
And if that's true think of how

1687
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
Wild that is in then according to Herodotus admits to it

1688
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:56,128
Tell him afterwards that's right you're surrounded and I did it so guess what we're fighting hahaha

1689
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,736
If you go look at a map this is one of those battles to look at a satellite image

1690
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,576
Where it's obvious what happens just by looking at the

1691
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,880
You don't have to figure out too much because there's a

1692
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:10,208
An island off the mainland of Greece and then there's a

1693
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:15,328
A body of water but quite small between the island and the mainland that's where the Greek Fleet is

1694
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:20,192
But there's an entrance to that Strait of water on one side and an exit on the other

1695
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,752
Themistocles

1696
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:28,896
Tell somebody eventually afterwards I send my slave over to King Xerxes to say

1697
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:32,736
The Greeks are all getting ready to pack up and go home if you attack now they're dead meat

1698
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,784
Xerxes

1699
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,832
Surrounded the Greeks

1700
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:41,696
Right blocked the channel that they would use for their Retreat and then came at them front Ali

1701
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,536
And Themistocles in Herodotus takes credit for this

1702
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,328
You didn't want to fight

1703
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,680
But now we're surrounded and you're going to get killed so you might as well resist anyway and we're going to win

1704
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,496
And they did

1705
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
That's a pretty great story

1706
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
And they were writing

1707
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,944
Popular entertainment about it

1708
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,504
Less than ten years after

1709
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,880
Herodotus was still a preteen

1710
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,416
Earlier

1711
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
Greek

1712
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,024
Homemakers are screenwriters were winning awards for

1713
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,584
Fairport Trails of the Persians

1714
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,608
The place is like the bad

1715
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
Los Alamos

1716
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
Basculas who's one of the all-time great

1717
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Which was a

1718
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,520
Veteran of the Battle of Marathon

1719
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,848
And may have been a veteran the Battle of Salamis to

1720
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,152
Therefore may be an eyewitness

1721
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,712
Certainly

1722
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
Performing his

1723
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:41,088
Plays for an audience of veterans and eyewitnesses

1724
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:49,024
Many times to Athenians who in 472 and right around there when aeschylus was doing this we're still at war with the

1725
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,096
Great Kings was very interesting the way this whole thing is portrayed by

1726
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,448
The aeschylus has this story by the way of Themistocles

1727
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:02,592
You're sending a false message to the king of the Persians saying that the Greeks are ready to leave to so when

1728
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:08,992
Herodotus is a preteen that's the reason already being performed onstage so who knows interesting character

1729
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,344
Winston Churchill slips a message to Hitler

1730
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,184
They're all going to be gone you can invade Britain tomorrow no one will be home

1731
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
If you look at that satellite map

1732
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,584
Of the battlefield if you will win this battle occurred

1733
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,120
And you think of

1734
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
Hundreds

1735
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:30,240
And hundreds of ships on each side in that little teeny area

1736
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,312
You don't have to be a genius to imagine what happens

1737
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
And

1738
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:36,896
Play writer is like aeschylus

1739
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
Mention it

1740
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
But so does everyone else

1741
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:45,088
It's a place where it's very easy for the ships also to become fouled and disorganized together

1742
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:53,536
The Persians come in apparently expecting a bunch of disorganized and ready to leave greeting instead the Greeks are formed up

1743
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:58,656
Which is interesting if you think about some of these complicated Maneuvers these ancient fleets are supposed to be performed

1744
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:04,032
It must have taken hours and hours of preparation to make sure everyone was lined up just the way you wanted

1745
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,616
This is a fascinating. Of

1746
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,456
Naval History not necessarily my strong suit by the way

1747
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,808
But the big ships on both sides were called trireme

1748
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,648
About 40 yards in 40 m long

1749
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,976
170 to 200 rowers on board

1750
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:27,840
And where is this thing had a sale for normal travel or is it

1751
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,120
Orated

1752
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,936
Method for normal travel apparently in Warfare

1753
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
Didn't use it

1754
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
So this is a

1755
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,288
Human-powered machine

1756
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,848
And because of the

1757
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Which hold

1758
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,992
400 300 500 lb bronze Beach

1759
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
At the prow of the ship

1760
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Ram

1761
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,136
But it's like a giant human-powered missile

1762
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,280
And so they would Ram each other in this era

1763
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:03,680
They would share they would give a go by really closely and Shear the ORS off one side which you can only imagine

1764
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,728
What that must have done to the poor or rich people

1765
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:13,920
And a lot of times they would try to turn it into a seaborne version of a land battle until they get these

1766
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,528
Chips all together and use the Marines that were on board essentially your soldiers

1767
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,600
The final land battle on board these Wooden Ships

1768
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,928
That's Themistocles

1769
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,976
To plan we're told see that the

1770
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,816
Persian Fleet is superior not just in numbers

1771
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:37,216
But in order they have better rollers they have guys would let more experience because they took over established

1772
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,496
Athletes remember they sort of

1773
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:44,384
That's one of a subcontractor or a wholly-owned subsidiary sort of approach to some of these Empires like

1774
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:51,040
Are these cities that are Phoenicians and have such great seafaring Traditions the Phoenicians may have been the greatest seafaring people.

1775
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:51,808
Ball time

1776
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
So when the Persians get control of these areas

1777
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,672
Essentially say okay you're working for us now

1778
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:01,536
You just keep running a great Fleet we like everything about it but we're going to tell it where to go and what to do

1779
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,376
The Greeks who just establish their flea recently

1780
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,960
Still getting up to speed in terms of okay this is the proper way you

1781
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,264
You do this maneuver 8cm mean

1782
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:17,920
I just that developing the muscles you kind of forget that element of it how long could these people you know when you're fighting a battle

1783
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,248
Continue to pull the oars before they just exhausted

1784
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,576
And what if one side is better at that than the other

1785
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:30,464
Why did you win they're in better shape they've been pulling mowers for 20 years they've got muscles that these opinions haven't even develop

1786
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,488
Who knows

1787
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,424
Besides Phoenicians the Persians are using Egyptian fleets they're using ionian Greek Fleet it's a bad situation

1788
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,216
When you're outnumbered and out skilled

1789
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,056
But apparently Themistocles in his

1790
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:50,944
Council of strategist have recognized that if you could pull this giant Persian Fleet

1791
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:57,344
Into that little narrow area you could turn it into a land battle and they were confident that the land battle would go better for them

1792
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
And it did

1793
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:04,000
But you might imagine from such a confined space where you have hundreds and hundreds of ships

1794
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,840
They got very disorganized very quickly in that sort of the mental image you have

1795
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,888
In his play Persians

1796
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,424
Or the Persians

1797
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Aeschylus

1798
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
Has a messenger

1799
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:20,384
Speaking by the way to that wonderful Persian Queen is directly related or connected to the first five Persian

1800
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,224
Kings atossa daughter of Cyrus the Great Chiefs or the main character

1801
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:27,808
This messenger the tells her what happened at salamis is another one

1802
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:32,928
And then I love when they go and they conjure up the ghost of Darius

1803
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,488
Obi-Wan Kenobi

1804
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:41,888
Marlon Brando Superman's dad some hologram who comes up to say what's going on now

1805
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
It's wonderful

1806
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,568
Dispersion messenger gives and

1807
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:53,920
How did the Battle of Salamis as seen from the Persian point of view

1808
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
Of course with words

1809
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,760
Put into his mouth

1810
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
Buy a Greek playwright

1811
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:03,648
Greek playwright who may also have thought in that bottle there for your kind of getting an eyewitness

1812
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,672
Count

1813
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,440
Weird song

1814
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,464
The dramatic way

1815
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,512
And it would certainly have been for

1816
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:11,072
Forum for people who have fought in that battle so

1817
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,656
Can't fudge too much without the audience catching on

1818
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,704
Going to watch this

1819
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,752
Persian character describes

1820
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:23,872
In the onset of the Greek Fleet showing up nicely ordered and organized

1821
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,152
The trumpets blaring

1822
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,040
He says it on the Persian side they can hear this really loud voice but what he really means is he can hear the war-cry of all the Greeks

1823
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,832
You know yelling in unison

1824
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,392
Lennie describes

1825
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,720
An apocalyptic scene and when you think of the hundred

1826
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:42,048
Hundreds of ships on both sides in these narrow Waters

1827
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,400
It's not hard to imagine that relatively apocalyptic scene

1828
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
What color

1829
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,752
Is the ocean at this point right

1830
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,080
Persian messenger

1831
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,360
Maybe

1832
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
Using adjectives

1833
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,712
The mind of a man who actually saw

1834
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
The battle of Somme

1835
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Says quote

1836
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
And the trumpets shriek blazed

1837
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,928
True everything over there signal

1838
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,744
Instantly there

1839
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,304
We heard the rhythmic rattle slap

1840
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,376
It seemed no time till they all stood in sight

1841
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,912
We saw them Sharp

1842
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:23,008
First the right-wing clothes drawn strictly ordered let out

1843
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,568
And next we saw the whole Fleet bearing down

1844
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,872
We heard a huge voice

1845
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,176
Sons of Greece go

1846
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:36,576
Free Fatherland free children of our fathers God

1847
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
Fathers live

1848
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
Fight for all we have now

1849
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,768
Then on our side shouting Persian Rose to a crest

1850
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
We didn't hold back

1851
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,584
That instant

1852
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,656
Ship rammed bronze-clad Becon ship

1853
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,960
It was a Greek ship started the attack

1854
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,776
Shearing off a whole Phoenician Stern

1855
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,360
Each Captain steered his craft straight on one other

1856
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,432
At first the wave of Persian Fleet roll firm

1857
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:07,552
But next as our ships jammed into the Narrows and no one could help any other

1858
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,880
And our own bronze teeth bit into our own strikes

1859
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,184
Whole or Banks shattered

1860
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
Did the Greeks ships

1861
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
Seizing their chance

1862
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:20,352
Swept encircling instruct and overturned our Halls

1863
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,168
And saltwater vanish before our eyes

1864
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,704
Shipwrecks build it

1865
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,240
And drifting Corpses

1866
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:29,824
Shores and briefs filled up with our debt

1867
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,432
And every able ship under purchase command broke order scrambling to escape

1868
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,224
We might have been tuna

1869
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,320
When they did fish for they kept on spearing and gotten us

1870
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,880
Which Splinter doors and bits of wreckage

1871
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:46,208
While moaning and screams drowned out the sea noise

1872
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:49,024
Till the night blackface closed it all in

1873
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
Losses by thousand

1874
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:55,168
Even if I told the catalog for ten full days I could not complete it for you

1875
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,704
But this is sure

1876
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,032
Never before in one day have so many thousands died

1877
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:01,824
And quote

1878
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,408
Nobody knows how many people died

1879
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:09,248
At the Battle of Salamis nobody even makes a halfway

1880
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
Serious gas about

1881
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:15,648
Nobody knows how many ships fought there nobody knows how many ships were lost its

1882
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:20,768
All you can figure is somehow the Persians probably were defeated because you could see what happened after

1883
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,608
When I was a kid growing up studying the stuff

1884
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,168
It was always portrayed as the shadow

1885
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,448
Defeat

1886
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:34,336
Unexpected shattering defeated the Persian navy that completely changed the complexion of the war

1887
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,408
More modern-day historians of course

1888
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:39,456
Are questioning this isn't that the

1889
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,248
Some theme of this whole story

1890
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,320
Led by God like George cawkwell in

1891
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:50,464
JF Lazenby Amino question whether or not salamis was anywhere near as big of a defeat as it's portrayed

1892
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,144
I do love the story we won't get into it but once again that another Herodotus story that Themistocles tries to send the great king another

1893
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:02,240
Message to cleverly get into do something else he shouldn't do I mean this Han Solo

1894
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
Discontinued

1895
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,056
One of the

1896
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,384
Historians reading says you know you can't decide whether the guy is

1897
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,664
Wiley

1898
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:16,320
So like clever and Wiley or is he treasonous or some combination of the two and apparently it makes it sound like the Greeks couldn't

1899
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,088
Always decide

1900
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,976
The traditional portrayal of Xerxes has him sort of running back

1901
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,768
To modern-day turkey

1902
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,304
Hoping to get

1903
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,448
Back there before the Greeks destroy the bridge of boats and trap him in Europe

1904
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,752
Weather not text you again

1905
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,776
Anyway guests

1906
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
Lots of arguments

1907
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,360
There are some halfway decent

1908
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:44,224
Accounts of why maybe this whole thing makes total sense and it has to do with a change

1909
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
In Persian policy

1910
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
The policy is going to be

1911
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,112
For sale land battle

1912
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,208
Remember up until this point the Greeks really hadn't want to

1913
01:42:54,464 --> 01:43:00,608
Land battle against these guys in a straight-up fair fight in the Battle of Marathon have been one of these things were maybe the Greeks attacked while the

1914
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:03,680
Persian getting back on their ships to leave not very representative

1915
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,984
All of the various

1916
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,544
Clint Eastwood's have been molon labe

1917
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,336
At Thermopylae

1918
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,152
So maybe a straight-on fight with it

1919
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,688
Persian army

1920
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:19,296
Would settle this thing once and for all of the arguments Herodotus has the Persians making to the king

1921
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:25,696
Is listen we didn't get defeated at the Battle of Salamis those Phoenicians ionian Greeks and Egyptians did

1922
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:31,840
The Persians are still undefeated in the field against these Greeks in a straight-up fight

1923
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:38,496
Xerxes moves off to what's now modern-day turkey in Asia Minor

1924
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:42,080
He will leave an army behind

1925
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:48,480
He's the lord of the ants with all these millions of insects that just swamp over

1926
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:55,136
In the small number of Greeks well that are soaked slipper Darth Vader lord of the ants left some ants behind

1927
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,952
Definition eating Grease

1928
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:06,912
Under the general mardonius who was a relative of Xerxes remember that this is kind of an incestuous maybe even

1929
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
Literally sort of

1930
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:10,240
Persian Elite

1931
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:16,640
It's all married with each other and related to each other in this case the guy is mardonius who also has a history cuz 10 years before March

1932
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:21,248
Adonis was one of the generals who invaded Greece the first time his dad right

1933
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:25,856
He'll give mardonius an indeterminate number of ants

1934
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,928
Remember all the numbers from the ancient sources are wildly inflated

1935
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,256
So there's millions and millions of Persians and he divides this

1936
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:35,328
You have merely hundreds and hundreds of thousands now but really

1937
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,728
Most historians going to be pretty comfortable with anything in the 42 60,000 range although this varies

1938
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:46,080
Herodotus says that mardonius was basically allowed

1939
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,384
To pick the cream of the army so

1940
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,784
You know a way go all the bright feathers and exotic colors and stone tipped arrows in Antelope horn things and you know you keep the amor

1941
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,832
Photos in the garden Calvary in

1942
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,112
The troops who are

1943
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:01,184
In a Persian related in oef let's not forget the

1944
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,744
Skitty and Central Asian horse Archer types

1945
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:04,768
And with

1946
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:08,608
Fifty thousand or so with those guys you should be able to take the Greeks out

1947
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,728
Mardonius is going to pursue what kind of a waiting strategy

1948
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,776
Going to get the Greeks to fight

1949
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:21,408
Going to find a nice piece of ground that's just perfect for the way the Persians fight

1950
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:24,992
And wait for the Greeks to come to them and if they don't

1951
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,064
He's going to damage things until they do

1952
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,856
Most notably

1953
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,880
Athens

1954
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:38,816
Told it after the Battle of Salamis eventually the Athenians have been evacuated from Athens to save their lives return to their home

1955
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,608
Palm City start with building things

1956
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,192
Well when the campaigning season resumes

1957
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:48,032
After the winter and we're in 479 BCE now

1958
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:51,360
The Persians from the north of Greece simply swoop down

1959
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,640
Take Athens again

1960
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,992
Basically the attitude is we just going to keep

1961
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:00,064
Destroying things that are important to you until you come out and fight

1962
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:04,160
I remember lying I'm going to butcher right now but somebody wants to do the only way to stop

1963
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:10,816
50 or 60,000 people working in concert anywhere is with an equally powerful force and the Persians Arkansas

1964
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:14,144
Trolling the whole part of greece with thebes and everything north

1965
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,704
Themes being good calorie count

1966
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
By the way

1967
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,104
And traditionally as usual the Greek states are fighting amongst themselves

1968
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,712
And once again according to Herodotus it involves whether or not the southern Greeks

1969
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,112
Want to go north of that wall that they built at the choke point at the Isthmus of Corinth which looks like a pretty good defensive position

1970
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,928
The problem is some of the major Greek States

1971
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,488
Are north of it where the Persians are

1972
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,816
The Greeks were south of that wall

1973
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:49,472
Once again having this debate about do we really want to go north of the wall to wall such a great defense

1974
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,520
North of the wall on the Persian side of things

1975
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:58,688
Having to do crazy bargaining and threatening using the fleet as a bargaining chip in once again Themistocles playing the Han Solo

1976
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,456
Parole

1977
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
At one point

1978
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:06,880
In Appling the big takeaway and maybe even saying we will go and side with the Persians if you don't come up here and fight

1979
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,952
And we'll take the fleet let them use our feet against you

1980
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:17,632
If this is to be believed Themistocles in the Athenian several times or even offered that standard Persian

1981
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,192
Dealing be good for you it'll be good for us just join the end

1982
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:26,848
Righty the deal according to the Mystic please cuz he's telling the other Greeks look at what the Persians are offering us if you can have your seat

1983
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,176
I think you said you can have the government of your choice

1984
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,736
Which is the typical Persian offer long as you're

1985
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:37,344
Loyal to the king and pay your taxes I don't care if you have a democracy or monarchy or whatever long as you're quiet

1986
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
At the Mystic least through Herodotus has been saying also choose one of the territories around you which one would you like the best

1987
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:48,096
Thermal throw that into great for everyone right we all game

1988
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,424
So you even at this time

1989
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:55,008
Through the biosources your hearing the Persians trying to make a deal

1990
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,568
Must be really fight about

1991
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,592
I don't care how much

1992
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
What harm you've given us

1993
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,992
Will give you your city and more land than you ever had and it's the same deal they're supposed to have off at the Spartans at Thermopylae

1994
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
They may not all be true all the time but you don't get this many mentions of it in history less it kind of was the pot

1995
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:19,328
The Assyrians that previous major Empire coming from that part of the world

1996
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,168
Would probably not have offered you a deal of this kind at any time

1997
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,472
Certainly not this late in the game

1998
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:29,056
With this many casualties already suffered in this many dead people

1999
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,104
Going to have to atone for

2000
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:37,504
And in this case eventually Themistocles and maybe it's part of his genius by hooker by crook

2001
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:42,112
Has by 479 BCE and army of combined

2002
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,440
Greek hoplites remember different city states

2003
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:48,512
Heading on up toward the area where Thebes is

2004
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:52,864
To have it out with the spider who sitting up in the web up there just waiting for him

2005
01:48:54,144 --> 01:49:00,032
There will be Spartan hoplites there they will be Athenian hoplites there and the eventual encounter will happen

2006
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,616
You're kind of a symbolic place when you think about it what happened

2007
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
At plataea

2008
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,456
Tortilla with a city

2009
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,992
A little teeny City that help

2010
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,296
The Athenians the Battle of Marathon

2011
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,344
Kick the Persians out the first time

2012
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:17,184
The TV with the little city that when the Persians arrived in this latest encounter

2013
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,256
Didn't submit to them that was destroyed so this is where the battle

2014
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
It's going to happen

2015
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,632
And the parameters for this encounter

2016
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:32,032
Have been in large part determined by the needs and the capabilities of the Persian cat

2017
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:38,944
We're in the Strategic place we are cuz this is the good Cavalry country in Greece that's where the Persians want to fight

2018
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,504
What the actual Battlefield

2019
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,296
Will be chosen

2020
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,344
Why were the Greeks decided to Stan

2021
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,392
They choose a spot

2022
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,672
Where there

2023
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,744
You better protected from that Cavalry they

2024
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,768
Appear

2025
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,304
From the mountain

2026
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,840
Through the mountain passes

2027
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:58,144
Marching up from the south

2028
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,704
And when they run into the Persians

2029
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:04,544
They do so from a position High atop these Hills

2030
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:08,384
The Persians are camped on the plane below

2031
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,712
Which stretches out in the distance it's wonderful Cavalry country

2032
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,040
They are behind River they have a camp built

2033
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:19,392
So they've got a pretty good defensive position they'd love to have the Greeks Advanced on them

2034
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:25,280
The Greeks and picked out a pretty strong defensive position of their own up in the hills and they'd like the person to come up to them

2035
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,608
Lost Begins the

2036
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:31,936
Free battle jockeying for position an advantage

2037
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
And there's a lot of it and it goes on for days

2038
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
And

2039
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:41,920
You know once again it's a good time to remind you that you're getting the Dan Carlin version of the story because this is so argue about

2040
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,200
Autumn Oaks historian to work

2041
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:48,576
Recreating as best they can you know where things happened and so much has changed since in

2042
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,904
I'm just going to stake out sort of abroad

2043
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:56,768
View of this for clarity reasons and understand that there's a ton of disagreement about everything

2044
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,912
Basically though what happens if the Greeks try to stay in The High Ground and lower the Persians up there

2045
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,192
And the Persians

2046
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:09,824
Trying to Skirmish with the Greeks and get them to either break apart go home or come down to fight them

2047
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:14,176
And all through the narrative we have

2048
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,456
Herodotus

2049
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
The ancient screenwriter

2050
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,296
Colorizer

2051
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,112
And this is his crowning Glory moment

2052
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:26,720
Writes his whole history to talk about any of these events and this is

2053
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,256
The climactic battle

2054
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,584
It's also my favorite battle

2055
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,888
In the entire history of the achaemenid Persian Empire

2056
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,240
Because you can color in Herodotus In Living Color

2057
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,520
2500 years

2058
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,056
Dad but you know what I mean

2059
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,592
We have

2060
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,640
Really the only

2061
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:48,224
Colorize story of the Persian army at its height

2062
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
I love this Army

2063
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:54,368
After this. It will change and not be the same in before this.

2064
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,160
You really don't have any

2065
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,464
In a few for how it operated

2066
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,280
In this battle you get to see this Army move

2067
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
And fight

2068
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,960
Is a lot of disagreement to about how the Greeks fought in this battle

2069
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,752
In the last

2070
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:13,056
Discussion we had on this I mentioned

2071
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:16,896
In some of the historians like handspan Wiest who suggests that the

2072
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:21,504
Idea that we've always had about how the Greeks fought during this. Is misplaced

2073
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,832
And if they don't fight that way till after this.

2074
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:27,392
And the one we're going to now is sort of like

2075
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:33,792
In a while they're in transition from an old style that you know they would have recognized in Homer's Iliad

2076
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:40,448
To the style that will come to be known in the future after this. The region Phalanx style where everybody stays in the rain

2077
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
Banks under penalty

2078
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,288
And you know you move is a body

2079
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:50,432
Because there's so many stories here if they're more than stories where people will spring forward from the ranks and do stuff

2080
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:55,552
Or move backwards fluidly back toward their online which is much more like the fighting

2081
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:58,112
From the heroic Greek era of Homer's time

2082
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:03,488
It would sure explain a lot it been weeks is right about this because

2083
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:07,072
Herodotus describes this all the time he begins to lay out

2084
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:11,936
You know what will become his version of like a Saving Private Ryan type

2085
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,240
Battle scene and it's worth pointing out

2086
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:17,824
This is like the first battle scene stuff

2087
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:24,480
But we have to admit will set the stage for all the the movies and plays and books and every

2088
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,248
Even afterwards

2089
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,368
You start by pointing out that the Greeks and the Persians are trying to

2090
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,464
You know maneuver each other out of position and he talks about the skirmishing that's going on

2091
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,744
At one point

2092
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,328
The Persian Commander mardonius ends cavalry

2093
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:45,216
To go up into the hills and try to mess with the Greeks you don't know what for and historians all disagree

2094
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:49,312
A lot of things though sometimes a general does something just to see what will happen

2095
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:52,640
REITs how will they respond if I go up there and shoot them

2096
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:56,992
Maybe they'll start dying in large numbers which would be good

2097
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:59,296
Or maybe their morale will suffer

2098
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:02,624
Which would also be good or maybe they'll just leave which would be good too

2099
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:06,720
I can't catch my cavalry

2100
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:12,608
Calvary basically dominate this field cuz they're the best Cavalry in Asia just calorie country

2101
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,168
But the Greeks have no calories at all

2102
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,472
The only Cavalry in Greece

2103
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,008
Really worth its salt

2104
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:21,824
Are in places like thieves and thessaly up in the north

2105
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,872
And there on the Persian side

2106
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,968
There are Greek cavalrymen in this battle they're just fighting

2107
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,504
On the Persian side

2108
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:34,112
At one point erotica starts the narrative in

2109
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,136
And the

2110
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:38,720
The Greek line which is been put together sometimes

2111
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:41,024
You know sounding like a bunch of

2112
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:47,424
Petulant four-year-olds arguing about who gets to stand on this part of the line in the wicked just stand on this part of the line and its crew

2113
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Crazy how

2114
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,496
We have to remember in and

2115
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:57,152
History of Eyeglass and bean ever Tire of reminding us that it's accepting the Spartan these Greeks are militia troops

2116
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,968
Are farmers for the most part

2117
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:04,576
They fight sometimes in a lot of these guys would have had battle experience when they're not fighting

2118
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,856
They're not fighting

2119
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:08,928
They're back on the farm they're living their lives

2120
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,720
They are militia

2121
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,864
What's more their militia from their own city-states and they consider themselves essentially

2122
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,216
To be of that city state as opposed to this larger concept of a Greek idea

2123
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:26,080
And so when the Spartan start giving him orders there likely be a lot of grumbling and it 1 Point

2124
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
The

2125
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
Groupon Greeks are called megarians

2126
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,016
To end up on the Flank In This Creek formation up in the hills is being

2127
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,040
Hammered

2128
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,856
By the Persian Cavalry that is shooting them full of arrows

2129
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,416
I don't want to be hammered anymore

2130
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,464
And they send a message

2131
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:45,280
To the high command essentially sang

2132
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:47,328
If you don't remove us we're leaving

2133
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,168
This is the way Herodotus describes

2134
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,472
And how really the the

2135
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,008
Fighting begins to shape up

2136
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,080
He talks about the Greeks he mentions them

2137
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:04,736
And he talks about how the Persian Commander mardonius can't get these Greeks out of the Hills

2138
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,528
Quote

2139
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:12,928
Since the hellions refused to come down onto the plane mardonius sent against them his entire Corps of calvary

2140
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,232
Under the command how much deseos

2141
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,792
On the hellions call Matt Castillo

2142
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:20,096
And it was very prominent among the Persians

2143
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:23,168
He wrote in the sea in the horse with a golden bit

2144
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:26,240
And adorned by many other kinds of beautiful ornaments

2145
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:30,080
The horsemen rode out against the hellions and charge them by regiment

2146
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,616
One after another

2147
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,712
Doing significant harm to them in insulting them as they did by calling them women

2148
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
And quote

2149
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:41,344
I remember Peter Greene had a footnote or he said

2150
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,416
One wonders if they had asked a Greek

2151
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,208
In their own Army

2152
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:51,072
What the word for woman was so that the enemy could understand the taunt

2153
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:54,144
So then Herodotus says

2154
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:57,472
You know that the megarians of the ones getting hammered and by the way

2155
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:03,872
The every said earlier the way that these Persian Cavalry seem to a fault as a lot like Huns and Mongols and stiffens and all these people

2156
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,456
Uno Attack you in little teeny packets of horse archers

2157
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:09,248
Hoping to break your

2158
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,272
Formation

2159
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:16,928
If you attack them to try to get back at them they just would have drift away from you and your formation breaks up and then they can turn on you and cut you apart

2160
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,952
Piecemeal

2161
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,768
If you don't you just have to sit there

2162
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,352
And take the arrows until you lose so many people you're in trouble

2163
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,936
Or until your morale breaks you think no more of this

2164
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:31,264
Maybe a combination of the two affected the megarians

2165
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,312
For being Skirmish by this

2166
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:36,128
Persian general of the cavalry

2167
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:38,432
Mustachios and Herodotus rights quote

2168
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,736
Now just by chance

2169
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:45,344
The megarians happened to be deployed in the most vulnerable position to be entire Battlefield

2170
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,672
And it was they who received the brunt of the cavalry's assault

2171
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:51,232
Because they were so hard-pressed by these attacks

2172
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:54,560
The magarian set the herald to the generals of the Helen

2173
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,352
Who conveyed this message to

2174
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
Quote

2175
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
Escorting a message now

2176
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,216
The megarians have this to tell you

2177
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:06,080
We who are your allies cannot continue to confront the Cavalry of the Persians alone

2178
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,896
In this position that we've occupied from the beginning

2179
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:11,968
So far we are resisting by tenacity and Valor

2180
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,248
Though we are hard-pressed

2181
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:18,624
But now you should know that we shall abandon this post if you do not send others to replace us there

2182
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:19,904
And quote

2183
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,720
So you can already see that

2184
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:29,120
Yes yes yes the Spartan is the commander-in-chief of all of these city-state units are basically keeping their own

2185
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,936
Freedom to make choices

2186
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,216
To themselves

2187
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:39,616
We're not going to stand here and get killed for all of you we've taken enough casualties of somebody else's turn now

2188
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:47,552
Herodotus says for a long time now I have been wondering if there's some

2189
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
Favoritism for the Athenians in the upcoming parts of the story cuz all of a sudden Herodotus starts to favor the Athenians

2190
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:57,024
Quite a bit he even makes the Clint Eastwood Spartans

2191
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:03,424
Look a little wimpy next to them at one point saying we'll maybe you should you guys should fight the Persians Avenue View Farm before 10 years ago

2192
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,448
We don't even know him

2193
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:09,312
We can fight the thebans were fighting with the person we beating them anytime

2194
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,848
You have to be careful it's

2195
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:16,480
Apparently the megarians ask for help in the only people that say yeah we'll go over there and help him or some Athenians

2196
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,552
Who also have the only archers

2197
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,576
In the whole Greek god

2198
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,112
So the

2199
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,648
Athenians Somerville

2200
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:27,232
And these archers go over to the flag with a megarians are hard-pressed

2201
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:31,072
And now you get a feel for how chaotic it is

2202
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
Is there

2203
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:36,192
Herodotus is colorizing is really good he's able to give you a sense now

2204
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:39,520
The danger in the panic in the dust in the

2205
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:45,920
Chaos go look at her video modern video of a riot somewhere that gets really out of hand look at the k

2206
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,992
Chaotic element that where the point of contact between the two sides

2207
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:56,160
Athenians with their archers decide to go help the megarians on the flank and he says quote

2208
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:02,560
These were the man who undertook this task and they stationed themselves that you're with right in front of the other Helens were there

2209
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,864
Taking along their archers for support

2210
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:09,984
The battle they fought their went on for some time until it ended in the following way

2211
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,544
Is the Cavalry was attacking by regiments

2212
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,640
The horse of Misty cos remember he's the Persian general of the cavalry

2213
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,200
Which stood out in front of the Rat

2214
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
Was pierced in Its Ribs by an arrow

2215
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:26,112
Heading pain in the horse reared up on its hind legs and through mistc up to the ground

2216
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,672
As soon as he fell the Athenians attacked him

2217
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:33,280
They took his horse and killed Mis deseos as he was struggling to defend himself

2218
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:37,120
But at first they were unable to kill him because of the way he was armed

2219
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:41,472
Since he was wearing a breastplate made of golden scale next to his skin

2220
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,264
And over the Crimson tunic

2221
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,336
The accomplished nothing is they struck against the breastplate

2222
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:50,176
Someone realized the reason for this and jabbed him through the eye

2223
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,224
At which point he collapsed and died

2224
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,248
And quote

2225
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,296
Yuan to real

2226
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Feeling there

2227
02:00:57,088 --> 02:01:01,440
Of this guy struggling for his life I mean he comes a little too close to the Greek lines

2228
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:08,096
Intersource throws him when he gets hit by an arrow you fall down in this relatively heavy armor that might have hurt him

2229
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,400
And when he hit the ground and a bunch of Athenians

2230
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:12,192
Sprint towards you

2231
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:18,592
Have you tried award them all off and then jabbing your chest as hard as they can but they can't see the fish scale style armor

2232
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:20,384
Because you got it under your tunic

2233
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,432
Adventure Time One realizes it

2234
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,224
Stabbed you through the eye

2235
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,272
We're told that

2236
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:31,392
The unit that he was commanding didn't realize that they lost him right away Herodotus is quote

2237
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:35,232
The rest of the Cavalry was it first ignorant of all this

2238
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:40,608
Because if they had turned around and we're riding away in retreat no one had seen how he fell from his horse

2239
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:42,400
And subsequently died fighting

2240
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:46,752
But they immediately missed him after they stopped for no one was there to come in them

2241
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:50,592
Once they realize what happened they cried out and Rally's one another

2242
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:53,152
I've been charged back to retrieve the corpse

2243
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
And quote

2244
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:02,880
Apparently what happened is dispersion Cowboy that was attacking anyone little dribs and drabs as soon as they realize they lost their General

2245
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:07,232
We're told form into a solid unit and charge the flying to go get the body back

2246
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,048
Another giant conflict

2247
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:16,448
Ear drops over the body which is crazy but you see this a lot of Ancient Warfare and no one likes to lose a body of anybody obvious

2248
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,008
Remiss.

2249
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:21,568
First of all when you lose these officers it's

2250
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:24,128
Traumatic sometimes it's never good

2251
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:29,248
Ancient Warfare Sometimes the best plane you can have it kill the officer or kill the king

2252
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,808
Whole armies have been known to disintegrate

2253
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:33,088
If you kill the leader

2254
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:39,232
In this case if you buy what Herodotus is saying he really gives the impression that these units were kind of left

2255
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:42,560
Unable to know what to do without the commander

2256
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:45,120
So go get the body seems to be the default position

2257
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:47,680
How many people are you willing to lose to

2258
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,960
Recover a cadaver

2259
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:55,104
Apparently a lot the Greeks and the Persians by quite a while over this body to greet end up with the body

2260
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:59,456
And then go and put it on display for morale purposes of course around it is right

2261
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
Quote

2262
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,880
Helen's gained much courage from the fact that they had stood up to the attack of the Cavalry had repelled it

2263
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:10,464
The first thing they did was to place the corpse on a wagon

2264
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:14,304
And have it drawn past the armies various units and their assigned positions

2265
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:19,936
They just played it in this way because the body of Misty cos was worth seeing for its size and its beauty

2266
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:22,240
And the men left their ranks in order to see it

2267
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:23,776
And quote

2268
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:27,616
Can you get a real feel for the ancient

2269
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:34,528
Then we're told that after this happens the Greeks decide to advance a Little Closer

2270
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,808
Come down

2271
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:40,160
Gina from the real heels into the Foothills and see if maybe something else doesn't begin to happen

2272
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,208
Everybody trying to

2273
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:46,048
And see if you can get the other guy to attack in a position of weakness

2274
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:50,144
This again that was where the Persian Cavalry comes in

2275
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,192
If it gets to go around the Greek flag

2276
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:58,592
Begins to go after the water supplies in the rear begins to go behind them and start to attack some of the supply column

2277
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:01,408
They're coming through the mountain passes behind the Greek position

2278
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,968
Both sides are probably pressed

2279
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,248
It'll be a lot of

2280
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,880
Depending on which historians who believe the Persians may only have a few days worth of food here

2281
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:15,232
Before they have to retrieve but we don't know they also have Friendly Greek cities right behind them

2282
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,536
The Greeks who should have tons of food

2283
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:21,888
Are now having it intercepted by Persian Cavalry in their rear so who knows

2284
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:25,216
You know what the actual needs to attack were

2285
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:31,360
Captain Greeks Advance farther down toward the Foothills we're told that they get into some trouble

2286
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:35,456
I need to change their position so the retreat to a more defensible place

2287
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,760
Where the water supply was better defended or what not

2288
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,368
And this is where things get Wiggy

2289
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,928
Because how the heck

2290
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:45,952
Does Infantry

2291
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,488
Retreat

2292
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:50,048
Within visible range of the enemy

2293
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:53,120
Well the Greeks decide to do it

2294
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:53,888
Finite

2295
02:04:54,144 --> 02:05:00,288
Which makes more sense if you think about it and they also decide to do it apparently in stages you don't want to give it away right to the Persians

2296
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,056
Removing

2297
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:07,456
So the Greeks begin withdrawing backward two more defensible position this is how the story delete betrayed

2298
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:12,576
Dubai morning time when light comes up and you can see what's going on in the Hills above you

2299
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:16,160
The Persian sea that some of the Greeks have gone away

2300
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,976
Some of the Greeks are in the process of still leaving

2301
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,768
And some of them are still there

2302
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,840
But the entire battle line is disrupted

2303
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,728
Have you looking at this from the Persian point of view

2304
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,520
And you've been in this

2305
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:36,128
Face off with the Greeks for almost 2 weeks in the hot July Sun

2306
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,712
And you've been doing damage to each other

2307
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:42,016
True skirmishing and cutting off

2308
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,808
Attachment and all kinds of other things

2309
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,928
And you're receiving reports of dissension in the ranks and quarreling among the Greeks

2310
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,512
Herodotus emphasizes a lot of this

2311
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,560
Even the Spartans on the day of the

2312
02:05:55,072 --> 02:06:00,192
You're changing location or arguing should we stay or should we go in different people on different sides and mean

2313
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:05,824
The Greeks look like they're a mess and some historians think that's what the Persians were expecting

2314
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
That eventually

2315
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:10,688
The pressure of all this would dissolve

2316
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:16,576
Rather ad-hoc and not altogether solid Coalition of Greek States

2317
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,856
Some of whom

2318
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,136
Dislike others

2319
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,232
What this means on the battlefield though he's

2320
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,560
Nearly two weeks of tactical constipation

2321
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,376
Her over in the space of a morning

2322
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,424
And everything starts moving again

2323
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:35,776
The Persian Commander mardonius

2324
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:42,176
Is said to have ordered his Persian troops including his own guard Cavalry maybe a thousand strong across the river a dub

2325
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:42,944
Idle speed

2326
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,992
To catch these lean Greeks

2327
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,064
Herodotus Ben says that all of the

2328
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:54,464
Subject peoples as soon as they see the general in the Persian troops on the double moving forward across the river

2329
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,512
They put up their standards and follow along

2330
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:01,120
Rochester shouting jostling maintaining no

2331
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:05,472
Show the formation or discipline of all and why they're running away we're chasing

2332
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,800
Would like the animal kingdom feel when you're too

2333
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,568
Predators

2334
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:15,712
Facing off at one another and swiping the air and growling at a bank if one of them turns around and moved in the opposite direction

2335
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:20,320
There's almost this primeval need to chase on the part of the other animal

2336
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,112
That's what this feels like a little bit

2337
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:24,416
By the way what would the proper response be

2338
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:29,024
In a cold sober situation if you saw the enemy moving off broken in front of you

2339
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,560
Pursue right

2340
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,096
That's what the Persians do

2341
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:40,288
I can't help once again looking at this like Herodotus is movie and it's sort of a buddy film here and he's got

2342
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,824
Three groups

2343
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,104
Of Greeks

2344
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,456
The Greeks of split into three separate columns and removing in three separate directions

2345
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:54,880
One of the Greek groups and one in the middle is sort of made up of all of the 50 states

2346
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:58,976
Prodigious is not focusing much in the movie extras if you will the big players

2347
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,304
But the other two columns

2348
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,864
That are retreating in different directions or

2349
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:07,680
Repositioning themselves if you want to put it that way

2350
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:11,520
Are the two stars in this Herodotus buddy picture if you will

2351
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:17,152
In a 1in my mind is a little Michael Caine if I'm sorry a lot of analogies and metaphors today I can't help it.

2352
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,688
Athens is the

2353
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:22,528
Guy with the sense of humor in the fun guy in the clever guy and he speaks real well and

2354
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:23,808
Michael kalish

2355
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:24,832
At a younger age

2356
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,928
And the Spartans are Clint Eastwood as we said in the two of them together the

2357
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:30,464
The Slick sly

2358
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:36,864
In all the girls love him clever Michael Caine mixed with Clint Eastwood and get them out of trouble with the you know the Magnum at the last minute

2359
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,424
Run silent Run Deep End

2360
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:45,056
It's an interesting sort of body film industry said Herodotus maybe a little bit biased towards the Athenians

2361
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:52,224
But he says that when the Spartans realize that they are the principal Target of the Persian Pursuit

2362
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,272
Did the king want them

2363
02:08:54,528 --> 02:09:00,672
They send the message to the Athenians basically the whole Persian army were coming help you or something like

2364
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:02,976
That we know you'll come and help us are you the great Defenders

2365
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:08,352
And Herodotus the Athenians session

2366
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,888
Intercepted

2367
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,936
By other Greeks

2368
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,752
People who are fighting

2369
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:18,336
For the great speeds is probably the Great

2370
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:21,664
Greek state that sided with the great king Argos is another

2371
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,712
Leaders of thessaly also been

2372
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:30,112
But the theban hoplites are great if you're making a top 3 list of great hoplites in Greek history there's only three

2373
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:33,184
City-states that are on it and they switch places all the time

2374
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,720
Sparta

2375
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:35,744
Athens

2376
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:42,400
And thieves and sometimes thieves is number one the Athenians get waylaid before they can come to the aid of the Spartans were facing the

2377
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,424
Persian

2378
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,984
When the theban Phalanx smashes into them

2379
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:52,640
They will conduct their own private battle now and that's what this battle of plataea turns into separate battle

2380
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:58,272
The main one the other one that get the Lion's Share of the screen time

2381
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,552
Is when you have the

2382
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:05,952
If I'm acting battle between the Spartans and the Persian part of a Persian army the core including the general March

2383
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:09,024
Is horse fighting in the combat

2384
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:13,120
For a military history not like yours truly it's awesome

2385
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:19,520
And when you read about how it works once against me let me just show you one of the things that

2386
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:26,176
Blow my mind and you can take whichever side you think is more likely in terms of your interpretation and it doesn't matter what

2387
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,480
Still amazingly cool whichever side you pick

2388
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,040
When the Spartans warm up

2389
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,344
You realize it's going to be a fight here

2390
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,672
And they're ready for this combat they begin to hold

2391
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:41,024
Religious sacrifices somewhere near the battle line

2392
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,864
Right we're already going into who the hell knows

2393
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:51,264
How these troops formed up in a sense of was there an open space in the Middle with a priest could come with the sacrificial animal and do the deed

2394
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:57,664
Forged that happened behind the battle line was it relatively safe Union places on the battle line anyway

2395
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:03,552
We're told throughout this entire almost two weeks both sides are sacrificing

2396
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:08,672
I'm looking at the entrance of animals and basically doing their Magic 8-Ball tests all the time

2397
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:12,768
Is this a good day to cross the river and

2398
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:18,400
Herodotus is the reason that both sides. They're for so long as they both sides were both getting

2399
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,704
Almonds that said listen

2400
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,776
Decide that will win this battle is the one that stayed on the defensive

2401
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:26,848
Turn Advanced first right

2402
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,432
The Spartans are back here

2403
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:33,504
Not just Consulting the Magic 8 Ball

2404
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,600
For big decisions right when you go to the Oracle of Delphi

2405
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:40,672
The people of Argos that's a big strategic decision

2406
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:46,048
But the minor tactical ones to quickly kill that go and see if we can charge the Persians that are

2407
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,352
100 yards in front of us right now what

2408
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:50,400
Still can't charge him okay we'll sit here

2409
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:53,216
This is what Herodotus says happens

2410
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,616
It's fascinating to speculate whether these leaders who are

2411
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:02,944
Beijing and maybe what you could call a prophecy hunt

2412
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:05,504
Here by slaughtering animals and asking for

2413
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:07,040
An interpretation

2414
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,064
Please what did the sign say

2415
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,880
I mean do they buy into that themselves

2416
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:15,232
What does chicken wonderfully clever manipulation of things like religious but

2417
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,560
Going to help them do something that's very

2418
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:25,216
Terrestrial in nature and historians disagree about this forever you go back a hundred years in the very logical very

2419
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:31,616
Most expected monocle is in his eye huntsdale Brooks as a cost

2420
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:32,384
Rubes

2421
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:36,480
There's a lot of other modern-day historians for example the same look at all the evidence

2422
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:41,856
Are other major things that these people refuse to do with the sign seem to be against it

2423
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,880
So it might be

2424
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:43,904
A little bit

2425
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:50,304
You're letting our modern lenses look at this and end color the way we see things maybe these really Pius preach in the spa

2426
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,072
Spartans

2427
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:53,376
Often considered to be very pious

2428
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,168
Maybe they really

2429
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:58,496
Not using this is a tool to achieve aims

2430
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:03,104
Maybe they were really waiting until the entral said it was okay

2431
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,152
Courtauld

2432
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:07,456
Did the Persians come running up

2433
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:14,112
Thousands and thousands and thousands of these guys running up the front ranks carrying wicker

2434
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:17,952
Shield this is the modern interpretation with a rock that says by the way I should have

2435
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:23,584
Did the front rank had these almost manhi size but not very heavy cuz they're made of wicker Shield

2436
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,376
That they would the front ranks with wood

2437
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:31,008
For Moline and when you put these things on the ground they almost form like a wall all the way up and down the line

2438
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:35,104
And behind them thousands and thousands of archers were running up

2439
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:41,504
And getting into like close formation these more archers that ran in the impact and ran around and and acted like

2440
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,832
These were guys who got into basically kind of close order

2441
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:47,136
And lined up behind the shield started

2442
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:53,792
Raining there's no other way to put an arrow down on the great remember there's two things that this person

2443
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,072
Which we talked about

2444
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:57,376
The archery

2445
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,192
The volume of Persian archery

2446
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:05,056
Is as high as any army in history I mean they basically if you if you have them in your head

2447
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:10,688
Images of what the Battle of Agincourt look like with the English longbows raining arrows down on the French

2448
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,736
This is that and more

2449
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,064
Which hold it

2450
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,088
The Greeks

2451
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:22,464
The meaning the Spartans and they're with their wisdom of the Greeks that are working with them or kind of friendly with him called the tgn

2452
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:26,560
We're told that the Spartans in the standing there

2453
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:31,424
Taking this Arrow fire we just we had talked about earlier if you if you do the math

2454
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:38,080
We are potentially talking about you know the high hundreds of thousands maybe into the millions of arrows in a very short. Of time

2455
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:42,944
What does it take to get people to stand under that kind of Arrow fire

2456
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:47,808
Leaving maybe what would you say a hundred yard who knows no man's land in between

2457
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:53,696
When you're armed with the kind of weapons that are really only useful if you get right up next to somebody

2458
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:58,304
Takes a lot of discipline doesn't it the Spartans are sitting here waiting for the intro to read right

2459
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,840
We're told that they are

2460
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:03,424
Friends these two genes in any formation

2461
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,240
One would guess right next to them can't wait any longer

2462
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:08,288
Not going to put up with the casualties

2463
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:10,080
Stoically any longer

2464
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:16,224
Which are the story we talked about in the Spartans is Clint Eastwood Clint Eastwood playing Batman

2465
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:22,624
Will these tegean play the role of Robin in the story they can't wait they lose their temper its order portrayed at HR

2466
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,952
Charge toward this line of Persians the guys holding the shield

2467
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:30,048
Lancaster charge down there

2468
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:32,608
They're going to get slaughtered aren't they

2469
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:34,144
Robbins going to die

2470
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:37,984
All of a sudden Herodotus dinamita moment of drama has

2471
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:44,384
Spartan leader puffiness in raising his hands to the heaven calling on your local DMV or close by

2472
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,664
Shrine or something like that

2473
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:52,064
Please give us a good signs boom they killed the goat down at the Persian line

2474
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
The following

2475
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,368
IGN

2476
02:15:56,416 --> 02:16:01,024
Tears away the screenwriter in his own words from the de selincourt translation puts it

2477
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:02,816
Quote

2478
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:07,168
Once more as they were about to engage with mardonius and his men

2479
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:08,448
Meaning of spark

2480
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,008
Perform the ritual of sacrifice

2481
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,056
The Omens were not favorite

2482
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:16,640
And meanwhile many of their men were killed and many more wounded

2483
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:23,040
For the Persians had made a barricade of their wicker shield and for the protection of it we're shooting arrows in such numbers

2484
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:25,600
Set the Spartan troops were in serious distress

2485
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:32,000
This added to the unfavorable results of the sacrifice at last cause pus Aeneas to turn his eyes

2486
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:33,280
To the Temple of Hera

2487
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:35,328
And I call upon the goddess for her age

2488
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:39,168
Her not to allow the Greek to be robbed of their Hope of Victory

2489
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:44,544
Then why the words were still upon his lips the sacrificial victims promise success

2490
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:48,128
At this the Spartans 2 would laugh move forward against the enemy

2491
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:51,712
Who stopped shooting their arrows and prepared to meet them face-to-face

2492
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:52,480
And quote

2493
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:57,856
Now what this meant is that the Persians are putting aside the weapon

2494
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,648
That they're best at

2495
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:02,976
Pulling out hand-to-hand weapons

2496
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,256
Weather at a disadvantage

2497
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,400
Not just that it seems and this becomes a recurring theme You Hear About Forever afterwards

2498
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:15,008
It seems that the missile weapons of the Persians were singularly ineffective

2499
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,544
Against the Greek hop

2500
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:20,128
Did archery fire

2501
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:26,016
Doesn't seem to do very well against close-order troops with big shields who are armored

2502
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:32,416
That's a bit of a mystery cuz Herodotus keep saying that they're suffering but we give the casualty numbers at the end of the battle the Greeks of supper

2503
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:37,280
Historians Like Richard Gabriel

2504
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:40,096
You know I've been involved in test studies were they

2505
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:46,240
Try to figure out who did you mathematical calculations and test studies and penetration surveys and all kinds of things to try to figure out

2506
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:51,616
And how effective things like archery fire would have been and he says against Greek hoplites in close formation

2507
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:52,640
Not very effective

2508
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:56,224
If the arrows won't penetrate the armor of The Shield

2509
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,552
For the most part they're looking for a little teeny gaps

2510
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:01,088
And there aren't very many of those

2511
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,976
Greek playwrights in the Contemporary during this period will

2512
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:11,072
Continually refer to the victory of the spear over the bow

2513
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,632
But usually could have talked about

2514
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:15,936
The advantage of the armor to

2515
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,984
I need did Herodotus mention

2516
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:19,520
Think about

2517
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,568
If something is subtle

2518
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,872
Because there are no weapons involved

2519
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,432
As having an NFL game

2520
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:31,808
And mandating that one team can't wear helmets are shoulder pads in this game

2521
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:39,232
What do you think it's going to look like at the end of the game if one team gets to have helmets and shoulder pads

2522
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,512
And the other doesn't

2523
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:44,608
How many people die are their deaths in this game

2524
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,912
You begin to see the difference

2525
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:53,056
You know an advantage and end from a distance when the Persians are shooting at you which is their Style no big deal

2526
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,616
Once the Spartans close.

2527
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:59,456
Gap that no-man's land between the big deal

2528
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:03,040
And this is the sort of moment and I've said this I think

2529
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:05,088
Since I began talking about history

2530
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,696
This is one of those moments that just fascinates me where I asked stand there and I try to figure out

2531
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,000
You're a Persian

2532
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:18,400
You're in this line you've been shooting at these people for a long time and now they run at you in a giant block of

2533
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:21,472
Men let's just play with a nice round number

2534
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:27,872
And say 10,000 but it seems to have been more than that and Peter Greene says the Spartan line was three-quarters of a mile

2535
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,640
Nia Long

2536
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:33,504
So a line of men maybe a track steep

2537
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:36,064
With 10:40 or so Spears you know

2538
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:37,344
7/12

2539
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,112
Spears

2540
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:41,696
Charges that you and they're basically shoulder-to-shoulder

2541
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,768
And you stand there

2542
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:52,192
By the time is like the Napoleonic wars in the u.s. Civil War and stuff almost nobody will stand there

2543
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:54,496
During a bayonet attack

2544
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:57,056
Big hidden things about the. Of me

2545
02:19:57,312 --> 02:20:01,920
The real historians will say nowadays it. Do the evidence seems to show that no one stood around for Bayonetta

2546
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:08,576
Nobody nobody would face Cold Steel yeah but in this. Facing Cold Steel is what it's all about

2547
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:11,648
And even then a lot of people didn't

2548
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:14,464
There are a lot of stories about hole

2549
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:19,072
In almost whole armies running away sometimes before contact

2550
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,632
Think about what's involved and think about

2551
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:24,704
You know what you have to have happen to make it all work

2552
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,752
Just because you're brave

2553
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:30,336
And just because your friends are Braves standing around you what happens if

2554
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:36,480
The 10000 Spartans in a with their 10ft Spears like a giant pin-cushion start charging at you

2555
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,064
And half the people around you run away

2556
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:46,720
What the other half do by the Greeks thought that the god of fear Phobos ruled the battlefield

2557
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:47,488
That before

2558
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,816
Because Panic could take over at any time like a herd creature

2559
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,144
As the Spartans charge you

2560
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,680
How do you stand there

2561
02:20:56,192 --> 02:21:02,336
And accept the charge especially if you're not at least arm simile you're going to pull out your little short-sword you're not going to have any

2562
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:06,688
Armor for the standard Persian infantry behind the front line not going to have any helmet

2563
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:09,760
Maybe a quilted jerkin if you're lucky

2564
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:12,320
You're going to get steamrolled

2565
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:16,928
The front rank of these formations as we talked about earlier the current

2566
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,464
In a line of thinking

2567
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,328
Is that this is a block of men maybe 10 ranks deep but it's the first rank

2568
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:29,728
Actually kind of equipped in a way that might allow them to give a good account of themselves in hand-to-hand combat all those big show

2569
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:31,520
Dealzer carrying are wicker

2570
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:35,104
Shows you the kind of warfare the Persians usually engaged

2571
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:39,456
They're helping to keep their formations safe from missile fire

2572
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:43,552
The Greeks are coming at you with a big old heavy spear head

2573
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,576
In a with a

2574
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:45,856
Impetus

2575
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:50,720
That a charge provides behind it all the Spartan sometimes Advanced nice and cool

2576
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,000
Uno's

2577
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:56,352
And once that front rank is dead

2578
02:21:56,864 --> 02:22:00,448
The Spartans of broken into a formation that is not prepared

2579
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:03,264
This kind of fighting at all it's one NFL team

2580
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:08,896
With helmets and pads and oh yeah big ol Spears facing another NFL team to know how much Notepad

2581
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:10,176
And short swords

2582
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:16,576
Between the prospective you have to

2583
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,368
Erotica suggest

2584
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:20,160
Dispersion does he said

2585
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:22,208
We're not inferior in Courage

2586
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,256
They were not inferior

2587
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,048
In Valor

2588
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:29,888
And let's remember they're fighting not just Greek they're fighting Spark

2589
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:31,424
And they're not just fighting

2590
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:38,336
As we said some Spartans they're fighting Sparta this is the military strength of the Cities

2591
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:42,688
State of Sparta and these Persians are not inferior Robin his Valor

2592
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,736
But he said that they liked on

2593
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:47,296
You basically said they're not equipped

2594
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:52,928
This kind of fighting but you get a sense of the desperation the other Greek states are petrified of Spartans

2595
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:55,744
And now the Persians are finding out why

2596
02:22:59,328 --> 02:23:01,888
Spartan formation smashes into the Persians remember

2597
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:07,776
D Spears with your only about 2 in wide width there 10 ft long and 2 in wide you can see how

2598
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,056
Likely they are to

2599
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:16,480
All the Greek sources talk about breaking Spears all the time even if you go into a nice soft human body with your spear trying

2600
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:18,016
How to get it out of that body like

2601
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:22,624
Break the spears of the Spheres are gone very quickly but yours have Herodotus describes

2602
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:24,160
The moment of impact

2603
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,952
From the de selincourt translation

2604
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:26,720
Quote

2605
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,560
First there was a struggle at the barricade of Shield

2606
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:34,656
Then the barricade down there was a bitter and protracted fight

2607
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:37,472
Hand-to-hand close by the Temple of Demeter

2608
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:41,312
For the Persians would lay hold of the Spartan Spears and break them

2609
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:44,384
Encouraging strength they were as good as their adversaries

2610
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,176
But they were deficient in armor

2611
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:48,992
Untrained greatly inferior in skill

2612
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:54,112
Sometimes tingly sometimes in groups of 10 men perhaps fewer perhaps more

2613
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:57,184
They fell upon the Spartan line and were cut down

2614
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,488
They pressed hardest

2615
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,256
He writes

2616
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:02,816
At the point where mardonius the general

2617
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,096
Farting person

2618
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:08,192
Riding his white charger and surrounded by his thousand Persian troops

2619
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:09,472
Flower of the army

2620
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:14,848
Walmart oneus was a lie they continue to resist and to defend themselves

2621
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:17,152
And struck down many of the lack of pneumonia

2622
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,688
But after his death

2623
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:22,528
And the destruction of his personal guard the finest of the Persian troops

2624
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:26,112
The remainder yielded to the lack of ammonia into a flight

2625
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:28,416
The chief cause of their discomfiture

2626
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,696
Was their lack of armor

2627
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,512
Fighting without it against heavily armed Infantry

2628
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:33,536
And quote

2629
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:36,864
Truthfully

2630
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,400
If you read that

2631
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,960
Maybe from the Persian point of view

2632
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:44,032
You see that the Persians stood up

2633
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:45,056
To the Spartan

2634
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:49,408
Desperately breaking their Spears

2635
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:52,480
With their bare hands we what would you do what your move

2636
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:56,832
If a 10000 or 15000 hoplites bear down on you

2637
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:59,392
Even do some Jujitsu move or something

2638
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:06,816
Okay soon as the spirit comes forward I'm going to break it I mean you don't even have that opportunity you're facing

2639
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:11,424
15 spearhead pincushion coming at you

2640
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:13,472
What's your plan

2641
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,776
I don't even know how you begin to

2642
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:16,544
Process

2643
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:23,712
Okay what am I going to do now they're ten feet away okay what am I going to do away I mean

2644
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:25,248
See how the pressure would have built

2645
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,272
You know

2646
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:32,672
It's like the torpedo coming at the shipping to go Utah 60 yards away 50

2647
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,000
Human beings are amazing

2648
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:37,792
Anybody could stand

2649
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:44,704
What's interesting is Herodotus said the Persians didn't just stand up to it that they were putting up with the death and destruction

2650
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:49,312
An equalizer of the lack of armor and everything

2651
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:54,432
Until her General was killed mardonius fighting right out there in the thick of things

2652
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:58,528
As we said earlier there's something about these ancient battles where both

2653
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:03,392
There's something expected about that he's he's not there because he's

2654
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:09,536
He's a war lover otherwise I'll be back in a working on the maps in the back room doesn't work like that in this. They're often outfit

2655
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:13,120
And when they die

2656
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:14,912
It's often catastrophic

2657
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:20,032
In this case the story traditionally is a low temperature a long time afterwards

2658
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:22,592
Spartan in the formation

2659
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:24,640
While the combat is going on

2660
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:27,456
Lazenby describes it as what must be

2661
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:31,040
Because in comprehensible chaos

2662
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:36,416
And picks up a rock and throws it at mardonius and fractured skull and kill them

2663
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:40,768
And you know I've been thinking about this if you think about

2664
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:42,816
A formation of men like that

2665
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:49,472
How close could anybody get without tons of stuff being thrown at them I mean very soon there must have been every

2666
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:55,872
Rock that was nearby every stick anything that could have been picked up and thrown at the enemy must have been gone in this case it's not so

2667
02:26:56,128 --> 02:26:56,896
So hard to imagine

2668
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:59,456
Are tons of stuff being thrown

2669
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:04,320
If mardonius came too close to the Spartan lines and it sounds like he was fighting in the thick of things

2670
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:07,136
Sakimichan and then we're told

2671
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:13,280
But his thousand man Cavalry bodyguard is erotic just called it the flower of the Army's wiped out to a man

2672
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:16,352
All that together

2673
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,168
Collapses the morale

2674
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:21,216
Persian troops fighting the Spartans

2675
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:23,008
Let me begin to route

2676
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,824
Now the rest of the army

2677
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:32,224
Remember these are people who might not have chosen to be there if they had any choice but they're not perversions their subject peoples of the

2678
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:32,992
The Persians

2679
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:37,344
What's more there also people who were defeated by these Persians were now running

2680
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,136
And the people who defeated them

2681
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:40,672
Are coming your way

2682
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,952
What would you do

2683
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:44,768
They turned around and ran to

2684
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:49,888
Headed back to the safety of their fortified camp on the other side of the river

2685
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:56,032
All this is going on the Athenians in a hard-fought battle beat

2686
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:58,848
Beef evens the allies of the Persians

2687
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,920
Send them back to Thebes they go running back to Thebes

2688
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:03,968
The Greek army

2689
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:07,296
Led by the Spartans but eventually joined by the Athenians to round

2690
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:11,904
Is fortified camp and eventually break Massacre the Persians in there

2691
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:14,976
Erotic testing the other sources basically say

2692
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:17,792
It wants the walls were basically torn down

2693
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:23,424
The people inside resigned themselves to die in the sounds like they just put up almost no

2694
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:26,496
Resistance up at that point which is interesting

2695
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:28,800
In terms of human psychology to

2696
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,128
If you're in that situation with the right move

2697
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:37,504
Have you surrounded a beating you in the battle you're stuck in that

2698
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:40,320
Stockade and then when they break in

2699
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:44,672
You plan to sell your life dearly take out as many of the enemy as you can

2700
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:50,304
Do you just try to figure out the easiest way to get this death over with so that it's not

2701
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:51,584
Terrific

2702
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,120
What are you

2703
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:56,192
Entertain fantasies of capturing maybe I'll live through

2704
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:59,520
Think of how many people in human history

2705
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,312
Tipping in that situation

2706
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,080
Before

2707
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:06,944
The Battle of platea was such a

2708
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:12,832
Monumental Affair in terms of size it had to be so much bigger than anything that the Greeks

2709
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:17,440
Could conceive I mean their battles and infighting was on a much smaller scale than this

2710
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:20,256
Did the Carnage must have been

2711
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:25,888
And no one knows how many Persians were killed because nobody knows how many Persians even fought the bat

2712
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,192
Don't know the numbers that fought as hard to

2713
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:28,960
Determine cash

2714
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:37,152
Traditionally the Persians are portrayed as losing a majority of their man in the fighting than losing most of the rest

2715
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:43,040
In the slaughter at the fortification and then losing some more on the way home to some thracian tribesmen that ambushed them

2716
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:47,136
And then finally be starving tattered remnants go stumbling into the

2717
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:49,184
Provincial capital of Sardis

2718
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:52,256
Like Napoleon's Grand Army

2719
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,536
Leaving Russia

2720
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:57,888
Thermoball numbers for the Persian forces at

2721
02:29:58,144 --> 02:30:01,472
Platia work and then

2722
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,520
Unqualified

2723
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:06,080
I put the 10 to 12 thousand men

2724
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:12,736
Of course the high numbers are Herodotus and 300,000 If there really are 300,000 men more than hundreds of thousand

2725
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:16,064
The Pershing corpses litter the battlefield it seems unlikely

2726
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,368
But the estimate range

2727
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:24,512
Does anywhere from like 50000 220000 somewhere in there is probably a good number

2728
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:30,400
On the Greek side if the largest army they've ever put together it involves multiple city-states

2729
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:34,752
50080 thousand men is the range that people throw out there

2730
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:38,848
No problem you have with these numbers just so you know and it screws up the casualties to

2731
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:41,920
Is that you have people who are

2732
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:42,944
Temp service

2733
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,736
And she lets

2734
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,784
Enslaved people whose job it is

2735
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,856
The carry the soldiers stop and cook his food and that kind of thing

2736
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:54,976
But on the day of the battle often times especially in Desperate situations they're handed the spear

2737
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:57,792
You know when someone to stick that into

2738
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:02,400
Does that all the sudden make you a fighting man you get the count now in the overall numbers did they

2739
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:03,168
Count

2740
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:06,752
What Herodotus and others do casualty numbers for the Greeks

2741
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,800
Fishing ridiculously low

2742
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:12,640
But some historians have pointed out that they might not have been counting some of those other people

2743
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:16,224
Number to Rodger said there were seven Helix for every Spartan

2744
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:20,064
Tens of thousands of people that maybe nobody decided to count

2745
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:23,904
But it came time to adding up the important people who died in this battle

2746
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:33,376
Now what's more they will be another battle that will happen traditionally happens at the exact same time 40 is going on

2747
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,400
Probably happened to

2748
02:31:34,656 --> 02:31:40,288
A little bit afterwards probably but you know maybe even a little bit before they don't know but they do think it was around the same time

2749
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:41,824
Call the Battle of Nicholas

2750
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:45,920
I'm basically what happens is the remnants of the Greek Fleet

2751
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:52,832
That were victorious in the Battle of Salamis go find the remnants of the Persian Fleet that lost the Battle of Salamis they're going to have this Naval Base

2752
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:59,744
The person who defeated again

2753
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:07,168
If you actually read the rundown of it it sounds very much like the Battle of plataea all over again the hoplites charging tearing down the wall

2754
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,448
Olive wicker Shields

2755
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,752
And absolutely ripping apart the

2756
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:17,408
Lightly armored archers in the middle of these Archer blocks and a Cavalry once again mysteriously missing

2757
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:20,224
The Persian fighting very well until the officer dies

2758
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:27,648
Basically acts as sort of a last kick in the rear end platea throws the Persians out of European

2759
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:28,416
Greece

2760
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:35,072
And the Battle of miqueli kicks him in the rear end on the way out at the! Basically saying and don't come back

2761
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:35,840
Back

2762
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,656
I think it's certainly does though

2763
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:41,472
Is answer the question of the Battle of Marathon

2764
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:43,776
Continue as before this. Did not

2765
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:45,312
Which is

2766
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:47,616
The question of the Tactical

2767
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:54,016
Superiority of the Greeks in these battles and

2768
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:59,136
And things that that involve very high-level stuff either decisions or trends

2769
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:01,952
But sometimes they can boil down

2770
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:08,096
Two things that seem like they should be mine or tactical Battlefield superiority questions and

2771
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:10,400
Sometimes people will think no really

2772
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:13,216
But then you say listen how big of a deal was it

2773
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:17,568
In the age of discovery that one side had firearms and the other didn't

2774
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:21,664
Or machine gun or artillery I mean there are times when

2775
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:26,528
One side superiority on the day of the battle or the year of the war

2776
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,320
Determines how everything else goes

2777
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:31,648
These two encounters plataea

2778
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,184
And mentally

2779
02:33:33,696 --> 02:33:37,024
Show that the Persians can't handle the Greeks for some reason

2780
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:40,864
At least not in these situations and historians ever since I've been trying to

2781
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:44,448
Answer the question you in this great giant upset in history

2782
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:48,288
Without a doubt the greatest

2783
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:54,688
Event in European related military history up until this time right now and maybe for a long time afterward

2784
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:58,272
How did the Greeks do it why did they win how did the Persians lose

2785
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:03,136
There are several theories on this and there is wonderful to watch the historians

2786
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:09,280
You put forward their debating points on why they think it's one of the other and it's possible it could be several of them working together

2787
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,816
I'll go over like 4

2788
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:17,216
And some of these theories started with the Greeks themselves and still have their adherence today

2789
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:20,032
The first one is one of those The Speaker versus the bow

2790
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:24,640
The idea that the Greeks had a lot of history and still today

2791
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:26,688
But you look at the equipment differin

2792
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:32,832
Herodotus writes about it to one side had armor the other didn't once I have these long Spears the other one side head

2793
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,880
Your heavy Shield the other really didn't

2794
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:40,512
The Greeks also had a subtext to this sometimes it wasn't just

2795
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:44,608
The one side had Spears in the other head bows but the different kinds of men

2796
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,144
Are created

2797
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:50,496
You know when you're in Archer versus when you are a close combat infantryman right

2798
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:56,128
And that when it came time to an actual Clash of Spears the Greeks were

2799
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:58,432
Melee fighters in the Persians really weren't

2800
02:34:58,944 --> 02:34:59,712
Certainly not

2801
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:05,600
To the degree the Greek for the Greeks can't win without doing that the Persians can you get a different mentality or so

2802
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:07,136
Some people will claim

2803
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:14,560
People disagree with this Theory will point out quite rightly that the problem is if you want to stay at the equipment

2804
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:21,472
Why can't you just make these people when you see how dominant they are at the Persians look at Greek hoplites and say wow they're real

2805
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:23,776
Really affected why don't you just go make their own

2806
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:26,848
Because you can for some reason

2807
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,640
Just put a Greek helmet

2808
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:29,920
And Greek armor

2809
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:35,040
And a Greek spear in the Greek shield on a Persian Soldier have them fight like European Greeks

2810
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:38,112
This is a huge question I've always had in my mind why

2811
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:40,928
Jen tried all through history

2812
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:44,512
Famously imitation legionaries during the Imperial Roman period

2813
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:50,400
When Rome is dominating the entire world of the Mediterranean at that point it's only natural

2814
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:56,032
If somebody would say listen I want what they've got going to make me some of those and grab a Roman Centurion

2815
02:35:56,288 --> 02:36:00,640
You know pay him some money they equipped or troop like them like Romans but they don't fight like Roman

2816
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,408
Why not

2817
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:04,480
Maybe the same reason today that

2818
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:08,576
And some of the great militaries will go give their stuff and training

2819
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,600
Two other

2820
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:12,416
Countries militaries in yet when they have to fight

2821
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:16,000
They got the good stuff they've got the top training but they don't fight the same why

2822
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:21,632
We talked in the past about this really hard to quantify and very scary in terms of

2823
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,680
They're kind of moves in the areas where you can

2824
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:26,240
You know get into ethnocentrism and bigotry

2825
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,776
The kitchen to the question of tok

2826
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:32,896
How do you quantify toughness to how do you research it some people had reputations

2827
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,944
For being extra

2828
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:39,296
Nasty and warfare and part of it was just reputational rights intimidating

2829
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,112
Herodotus has the Persian General at one point

2830
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:48,512
When he doesn't think the Spartans are performing particularly scary turn of the Greek guy goes maybe you're just afraid of them cuz they're only

2831
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:50,048
Good compared to you

2832
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,584
Something like that

2833
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:54,144
But there are people all throughout history

2834
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:57,984
Whose neighbors were terrified of them because of what they could do

2835
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:03,872
The question is why what why why did they do what they did Apache Zulu's Greeks in this.

2836
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:12,064
Some of the original sources will have insane of the everyone knows that Greeks are great Fighters what's a great fighter how do you make a great fighter

2837
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:15,392
What's that a combination of and how much of it is something internal

2838
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:17,696
And what about

2839
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:20,768
Societies like the Spartan one which is supposedly

2840
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:24,864
One where the cultural characteristics are all designed to make somebody

2841
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,912
You know more that way

2842
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:30,496
A tough a better fighter whatever

2843
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:33,312
Thing to get your mind around isn't toughness or

2844
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:35,616
Whatever word is a better word for

2845
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,432
What makes one side a great warrior in the other not

2846
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:41,760
Some historians will say that this is a cultural question

2847
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:44,064
Some cultures

2848
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:46,880
Have a military tradition designed

2849
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:47,904
Around

2850
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:50,464
Physical contact with the Enemy

2851
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:52,768
Write the Greek culture is designed

2852
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:57,888
To have a military encounter in a you get to history like Victor Davis Hanson who is not without controversy

2853
02:37:58,656 --> 02:38:00,448
What you call it a Western Way of War

2854
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:07,104
This decisive battle will you walk right up and slugged the other guy in the mouth in the good part about it is at the end somebody wins and somebody

2855
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:11,712
But then there's the East which has a different military tradition

2856
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:13,248
Much more

2857
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:15,808
San Soo kung fu

2858
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:17,088
And we're going to look for

2859
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:23,488
Open flank and get around you were going to wear you down with missile fire supply lines

2860
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:26,560
The Wharf are you ever going to shoot you from a distance with

2861
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,840
In a missile weapon

2862
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:29,376
Wear you down

2863
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:33,472
And what that means is the Persians could win

2864
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:38,080
Against the Greeks on the battlefield as long as they never come in contact with them

2865
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:40,128
Because until they do

2866
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:41,664
There is fighting

2867
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:43,200
Go to their strength

2868
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:44,992
The Greeks can't win

2869
02:38:45,248 --> 02:38:46,528
Without coming into contact

2870
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:48,576
With the person but the minute they do

2871
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:50,112
Their armored for it

2872
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:53,952
They're equipped for their train for it they may be hardened by

2873
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:56,256
Generations of people who

2874
02:38:56,768 --> 02:39:00,608
Promote the very things it takes to win in hand-to-hand encounter

2875
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:06,240
Another word in Greek may have a culture of melee and once melee fighting happens there in their element

2876
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:12,384
But then is much less controversial and weird and hard to quantify

2877
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:18,528
Reasons that are thrown out for why the Persians may have lost also in the Occam's razor wanted poor decisions

2878
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:21,344
Poor decisions at every level from

2879
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,392
The king decided to do things you know

2880
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:29,536
Let's go to war here to the Tactical Battlefield spur-of-the-moment ones made by the General on site and everything

2881
02:39:31,072 --> 02:39:33,376
Some historians ijf lies and being run down

2882
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:37,472
In all the ways in which the Persian had this thing one

2883
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:43,872
It was over in the morning you wake up at the Battle of plataea and all those Greeks are moving off in other directions and then

2884
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:46,432
Has broken in the running away it's done

2885
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:48,480
Right at Lazenby makes it sound like

2886
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:50,016
How do you blow that

2887
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:52,064
But they did

2888
02:39:53,856 --> 02:39:58,720
A story that comes right after this. He's one of the biggies and one of the Great

2889
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:02,048
He basically says I'm paraphrasing you the Barbarian blew it

2890
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:03,072
Got it

2891
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:06,144
Sapporo decisions is often

2892
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:08,448
In a thrown out there is a reason that the Persians

2893
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:15,616
Fell victim to one of the great military upsets in all time now the next possible theory that was one that could explain to

2894
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:21,504
Some of the poor decisions example Hill talk about Supply brand

2895
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:27,648
The question of trying to supply an army over these distances this must have been the edge of the of the rain

2896
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:28,928
A Persian

2897
02:40:29,184 --> 02:40:30,208
Power projection

2898
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:35,072
Trying to keep an army of tens of thousands of people fed supplied

2899
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:39,168
In all their equipment being repaired and everything that it takes for more than a year

2900
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:41,728
Difficult to do

2901
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:47,104
Herodotus tells a story of a king who happens to be a direct ancestor of Alexander the Great

2902
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:51,968
Who supposedly comes to the Greeks before the Battle of plataea and that the person's only have 3 days of food left

2903
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:56,064
If anything like that were true

2904
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:57,600
Think about how that would

2905
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:58,368
Impact

2906
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:02,208
The decisions by the Persian General

2907
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:04,512
If you only have three days left of food you can't wait

2908
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:08,352
So maybe you do something that otherwise would have been considered a poor decision

2909
02:41:08,608 --> 02:41:10,656
I must have people who were judging you knew

2910
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:13,472
You know what the supply constraints working on you might have been

2911
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:16,032
Supply is

2912
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,824
And extremely light

2913
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,640
Certainly impacted every level of the campaign

2914
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:26,784
Finally there's a school of thought in this one goes all the way back to ancient Greece to and still has it

2915
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:33,952
Adherence and a lot of people think certainly even if it wasn't the main reason it played a role in it what about the idea that the Greeks just wanted it

2916
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:34,720
More

2917
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:36,512
Do use of sports phrase

2918
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:43,936
In the Persians are sitting here trying to add a relatively small and poor territory to their already ginormous Empire

2919
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:46,240
How motivated are you

2920
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:53,152
The professionals I mean you know the king reward people who do well images a whole lot of good reason carrots and sticks operating on them

2921
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:55,968
Fighting for their lives

2922
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:57,248
And their freedom

2923
02:41:57,504 --> 02:42:01,344
Had to keep their families potentially from being enslaved

2924
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:04,672
People have to live under if you have to live under someone else nonetheless

2925
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:06,464
Why people don't want to do that

2926
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:11,328
And I freedom in or at least the right to be ruled by your own people

2927
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,608
Is important to you

2928
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:19,008
You probably feel more strongly about it and adding this poor little territory on the fringes of the Known World here already China

2929
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:21,312
The idea that the Greeks were fighting for more

2930
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:25,920
Certainly Rings true when you look at a lot of other conflicts throughout history where

2931
02:42:26,432 --> 02:42:28,736
One side seemingly should steamroll together

2932
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,016
And I don't

2933
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:33,344
Carlotta mother

2934
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:34,368
Pact

2935
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:37,184
Dick's has even thrown out there and maybe as we said it's a

2936
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:39,744
Junction of several of these things working together

2937
02:42:41,792 --> 02:42:43,072
The bottom line though is that

2938
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,400
You know when I was growing up there was a long tradition

2939
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:48,704
And 40 years ago the history that were written

2940
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,008
Portraying these victories of shattering

2941
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,032
And

2942
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:58,432
Persian history is having this watershed moment in the year 479 right before 479 are on the rise

2943
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:05,600
After 479 are on the decline 479 like the year they're at the top of the ladder right the wooden shoes are going up the ladder the

2944
02:43:05,856 --> 02:43:08,416
Silk slippers coming down in there with the top of the ladder in 479

2945
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,440
Right before the fall

2946
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:14,048
In the Greek narrative now

2947
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:18,912
And you're going to see the Greeks go on the counteroffensive and take the war to Persia

2948
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:26,080
Golden what's now turkey and the islands in the Aegean and raise the flag of revolt and free all these Greek people from

2949
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:27,872
Persian control

2950
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,944
Here's the thing though

2951
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:34,016
This war is only over

2952
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,320
If the Persians wanted to be

2953
02:43:36,576 --> 02:43:39,392
They have to kind of say okay we're not going to fight anymore because

2954
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:45,280
The Greeks have a problem that the Persians didn't have we said how amazing it was at the Persians could feed and supply

2955
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:47,584
Pisces Army's over these long distance is what

2956
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:50,400
As an example of how amazing it is the breach can't do that

2957
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:53,216
They can't go in

2958
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:59,872
In a launch an attack in sending the Fenian Army into Mesopotamia and feed it and who they just can't

2959
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,640
Do that

2960
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:06,784
Ability to destroy the Persian Empire militarily is not in the Greek

2961
02:44:08,064 --> 02:44:10,112
Now what they can do theoretically

2962
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:14,208
Is start a rolling chain of Revolt maybe that acts

2963
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,232
Like a

2964
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:17,280
Line of dominoes and begins to

2965
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:22,912
Get the Persian Empire just would have seen the shake itself apart Like An Earthquake and there are revolts that happened

2966
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:26,752
There are several historians I would think that

2967
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:30,080
It's logical to assume that Persian losses against the Greeks

2968
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:33,664
Anchorage places like Babylon and Egypt and all the

2969
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:35,456
Usual Suspects to revolt

2970
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:38,272
And that would have been something that they

2971
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:43,904
The Persian king and the generals everybody that that would have concerned the great lie stuff on the peripheries

2972
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:46,208
Little bit more like nibbling

2973
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:50,048
And here's the thing you know if you look at it

2974
02:44:50,304 --> 02:44:51,840
Over the Long Haul

2975
02:44:52,352 --> 02:44:57,216
You could make a case that and we're trying to look at this from the Persian Viewpoint the Persians will end up winning

2976
02:44:57,472 --> 02:45:00,288
This whole thing to declare Victory now

2977
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:03,104
Is a little like declaring victory

2978
02:45:03,872 --> 02:45:10,016
It on the second world war in 1942 just going home I mean sure the Persians lost these battle

2979
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:13,344
Because of these tactical advantages of the Greek so what are they going to do

2980
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:15,648
Going to come back and fight

2981
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:16,416
Differently

2982
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:22,816
And when you look at Persian strategy here you can really see some of the advantages that the Persians have

2983
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:27,424
If the creek don't the Greeks had tactical advantages on the battlefield the Persians have

2984
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:29,472
Advantages of a much higher level

2985
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:35,616
They might not be able to raise any inventory that could compete with Greek hoplites head on

2986
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:38,944
But they have a much more powerful and versatile weapon at their disposal

2987
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:40,480
Kohl's

2988
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:42,272
What

2989
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:49,184
And maybe you can't make your own hoplites out of your own people but you sure can higher The Originals

2990
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:51,488
And the Greeks

2991
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:56,096
Begin to play a large role in the Persian military and what's more this is really

2992
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:59,936
An explosion in Hellenism where we begin to see the mixture

2993
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:06,591
At a much higher rate and it always been going on between Greek and the Persian Persian things in degrees because you get these mercenaries at Wilshire

2994
02:46:06,847 --> 02:46:07,871
Then come home

2995
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:12,223
The other thing the Persians do with this gold

2996
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:16,063
Is they begin to encourage the Greeks to kill each other

2997
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:20,927
Two things now go away in the story that will change the story greatly

2998
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:23,487
The first thing that goes away

2999
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:25,023
Create cooperation

3000
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:29,887
And the terrible threat of Darth Vader right in Greece

3001
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:37,823
Heading corrida bunch of city-states that weren't that friendly with each other to drop their antagonism some work together when Darth Vader

3002
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:39,871
Relieve the antagonism come right back

3003
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:42,175
Most famous lie between

3004
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:44,479
Sparta and Athens

3005
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:48,063
This begins to be something

3006
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:52,159
The Persian gold we'll figure out a way to exploit and encourage

3007
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:57,023
Persian might not be able to kill Greeks on the battlefield very effectively

3008
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:58,815
If platea and

3009
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:00,351
Nicola Rennie

3010
02:47:01,119 --> 02:47:04,191
Laboratory tests but they sure do a good job at killing each other

3011
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:06,495
The Persian Gold Canyon

3012
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:09,823
The other thing that goes away at this point in the story and

3013
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:13,663
You could argue he's the most important person in the story

3014
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:15,199
Is our story teller

3015
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:20,319
This is where Herodotus history and his movies over and

3016
02:47:21,087 --> 02:47:23,135
You miss him terribly

3017
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:27,231
Earlier we'd set his during periodic said something to the effect of

3018
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:31,583
Arata's gets all this criticism for not being more factually accurate in yet

3019
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:35,167
He's all you have and you really miss him when he's gone and now he is

3020
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:39,519
And this person that we have used to have color eyes the stories at the very beginning

3021
02:47:40,031 --> 02:47:41,823
He's gone a lot of the color goes with him

3022
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:45,407
And we are left with some of the old

3023
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:52,319
Ways of putting a story together the opposite of The Wizard of Oz that went from black and white to color in the middle of the picture we had color the whole

3024
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,343
Wayne all of the sudden

3025
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:56,159
It goes back to black and white without Herodotus

3026
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:03,071
That when you're talking about the ancient past black and white generally means the sort of things that archaeologist

3027
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:03,839
Confine

3028
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:06,143
Whether you're talking about

3029
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
Carvings

3030
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:08,703
Or artwork

3031
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:11,263
Score records

3032
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:13,567
Or letters or what have you

3033
02:48:14,847 --> 02:48:19,711
But there was always something missing from the equation when that was all you had

3034
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:25,599
The sort of things that you realize once Herodotus appears on the scene and you get this other side of History this one word

3035
02:48:26,111 --> 02:48:31,487
You really get these human parts and dialogue and themes and and drama

3036
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:33,279
When he's gone you miss it

3037
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:38,399
And you're left with wholly inadequate

3038
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:43,007
Replacement with make you appreciate Herodotus even more and they fall into a couple of broad categories

3039
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:45,567
One category I like to call the hard to believe

3040
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:49,407
TCS falls into this category

3041
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:50,943
Was a Greek doctor

3042
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,735
Work for the Persian kings

3043
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:59,391
Lived in Persia went to the dinner parties had Persian friends says he saw the Persian historical records himself

3044
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:03,487
Should be the best of the best in terms of helping us understand

3045
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:07,839
The workings the inner workings and then Persia's point of view

3046
02:49:08,095 --> 02:49:12,447
In my copy of a TCS which is the Lloyd Llewellyn Jones and James

3047
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:13,727
Robson version

3048
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:15,263
Those two

3049
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:18,847
Write the prologue and this is what they say about

3050
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:20,639
TCS history

3051
02:49:22,431 --> 02:49:22,943
Quote

3052
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:28,063
Is history of Persia was completed at a time when the Greeks were fascinated by Persia

3053
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:30,111
And seems on one level

3054
02:49:30,367 --> 02:49:34,719
To cater to a contemporary Greek interest in Persian wealth and opulence

3055
02:49:34,975 --> 02:49:38,303
Powerful Persian women the institution of the harem

3056
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:41,631
Kings and queens Unix and secret plots

3057
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:42,655
And quote

3058
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:46,751
That's why perhaps a lot of the rest of the history

3059
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:49,567
Of the achaemenid Persian Empire looks like that

3060
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:53,663
Because the people telling you the story are giving you the story that way but

3061
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:55,455
In all fairness to that guy

3062
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:57,503
That's the level he was

3063
02:49:57,759 --> 02:50:02,623
Having contact with the Persian Empire that's the level he saw it and if Herodotus is giving you a

3064
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:07,487
Geopolitically focused history you know a film on the Epic Grand scale

3065
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:11,071
I got it she's just giving you more of a John cassavetes film

3066
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:17,727
And it's all going on in one room and it's black and white and dark and really drink a lot of wine and then confessing you know what they really want to do

3067
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:18,495
Each other

3068
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:24,127
History as seen through a very different lens. Both of these

3069
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:26,687
Guys who wrote the TC Spokane reading table

3070
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:32,831
Want to make the case that they think this is a legitimate attempt by TCS to write a Persian history from the inside

3071
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:39,231
Nonetheless this is a guy who you don't let's be honest if he makes it hard to believe he'll write a story for example about how

3072
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:45,887
The events that led up to the Persians taking over Egypt originally couple Kings before this time

3073
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:49,983
Happened because the King of Persia heard that Egyptian women were the best

3074
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:51,263
And having sex

3075
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:52,031
In the world

3076
02:50:52,287 --> 02:50:52,799
So he wanted

3077
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:55,615
Yada yada yada ipso facto and all the sudden

3078
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:56,639
In Aldi

3079
02:50:57,151 --> 02:50:58,687
Persians are taking over Egypt

3080
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:01,247
You have to take the stuff with a grain of salt right

3081
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:05,855
But sometimes this is all you're left with now different category of people

3082
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:06,879
Then the

3083
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:08,415
Hard to believe

3084
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:11,743
Are the people who are writing about a completely different subject

3085
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:16,863
And they just happened to as part of their story include some facts that are relevant to yours

3086
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:22,495
What are the best historians of the ancient world a guy who starts writing right after Herodotus and thucydides or through Kennedy's

3087
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:23,775
He's one of those guys

3088
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:27,103
He's writing a story about the Greeks fighting with each other

3089
02:51:27,615 --> 02:51:28,127
But there's

3090
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:34,015
In a sidebar information about the Persians occasionally so their stories go in there to grab every little nugget

3091
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:39,135
If they try to put it in a semblance of jigsaw puzzle with he's considered a really good historian

3092
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:43,999
Each one of those little foxy throws out there like gold does just not very much of him cuz he's not really

3093
02:51:44,255 --> 02:51:45,279
Writing about Persia

3094
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:51,679
The final category also includes some great historical writers

3095
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:55,263
It's those who are writing from a long time later

3096
02:51:56,543 --> 02:51:59,359
Take Plutarch for example but there's a bunch of other ones

3097
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:04,223
He's writing from 5 to 600 years after the Persian Wars

3098
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:08,575
And I tend to forget that because you think oh you know ancient Greek writer

3099
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:12,671
Yes but he's writing in the second century BCE of the modern era

3100
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:16,511
Annie's writing about events happening in the 5th Century BCE

3101
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:19,583
It is far enough in his package farther in his past

3102
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:23,423
Then the Europeans discovering the Americas easy an hour

3103
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:27,775
How much did a person in the ancient world somebody

3104
02:52:28,287 --> 02:52:32,639
That we would consider having lived a very very very long time ago how much did he know about

3105
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:35,711
His ancient path I'm by Marvel that they knew anything

3106
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:39,039
And that there was some where this guy could go

3107
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:44,671
To read primary sources which is why historians pay attention he was working from the original

3108
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:46,463
Work of blah blah blah blah blah

3109
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:47,231
Really

3110
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:51,839
That original work is still available how many times is that scroll been recopied over the arrow

3111
02:52:52,351 --> 02:52:56,191
Ancient people had an ancient history of Their Own

3112
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:57,727
Some method of

3113
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,519
Preserving and transmitting it

3114
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:01,055
Wild to me

3115
02:53:01,823 --> 02:53:06,175
None-the-less 500 or 600 years is a long time for a story

3116
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:08,991
To get Legends build up around it or Miss

3117
02:53:09,247 --> 02:53:12,831
Or shall we use all those wonderful words from Academia we've been throwing out

3118
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:13,855
Motif

3119
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:16,415
Tropes stereotypes

3120
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:20,767
But you know even the motifs in the stereotypes

3121
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:25,375
Literary conventions of those days can tell you something

3122
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:28,447
About the events if the person who's writing them

3123
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:31,519
Is close enough to the one of the great things about Herodotus is

3124
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:32,287
She comes

3125
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:36,383
A generation after the events he is writing about he interviews people who were there

3126
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:37,919
Who have some clothes

3127
02:53:38,687 --> 02:53:40,735
Your connection TimeWise to them

3128
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:44,831
And so when he gives you some sort of

3129
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:46,623
Theme for the story

3130
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:50,719
Whether or not the theme is true the way he uses it as one thing

3131
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:53,791
But it tells you something about the people living in that era

3132
02:53:54,047 --> 02:53:57,887
And the way they portrayed or thought about or remember these events

3133
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:00,191
Herodotus and his movie

3134
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:01,471
If you will

3135
02:54:02,239 --> 02:54:03,263
With a little story

3136
02:54:03,519 --> 02:54:04,543
In the story is about

3137
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:09,919
The guy the legendary King Arthur type figure who founded the Persian Empire

3138
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:16,319
And the story is about the Persians coming to him early on and basically saying now that we've won this great Empire we should move

3139
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:20,671
From the poor country that we come from to one of these more luxurious areas with

3140
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:23,231
In a good food and wine and you know

3141
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:26,047
Another word for moving up in the world look straight up to a bigger

3142
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:27,583
Your housing

3143
02:54:27,839 --> 02:54:28,351
Property

3144
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:31,167
Virus gives him a moral less

3145
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:34,495
The way this is intended to be conveyed is

3146
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:39,103
The story that Herodotus just told you show you how they went from

3147
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:42,687
An Empire who revered he's kind of values

3148
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:46,527
The one that had forgotten them and paid the price he just related to you

3149
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:51,391
He says in response to this proposal by his people that they trade up to some better proper

3150
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,951
Aranas and this movie with this

3151
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:54,719
Quote

3152
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:58,047
Cyrus did not think much of this suggestion

3153
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:00,863
He replied that they might act upon it if they please

3154
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:06,751
But added the warning but if they did so they must prepare themselves to rule no longer

3155
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,543
But to be ruled by others

3156
02:55:09,055 --> 02:55:10,847
Soft countries he said

3157
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:12,383
Breed soft men

3158
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:18,271
It is not the property of anyone soil to produce fine fruits and good soldiers to

3159
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:20,831
The Persians had to admit Herodotus rights

3160
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:21,855
That this was true

3161
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:24,927
And it's Cyrus was wiser than they so they left him

3162
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:28,511
And chose rather to live in a rugged land and rules

3163
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:31,839
Vented cultivate Rich Plains and be subject to others

3164
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:33,375
And quote

3165
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:37,471
Well by the time Herodotus wrote that

3166
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:39,519
The Persians lived in Aki

3167
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,543
Occupied some very rich

3168
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:41,823
Planes indeed

3169
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:46,431
And the theme of a growing Persian decadence

3170
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:48,479
Starts with Xerxes

3171
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:54,367
And becomes one of the most dominant parts of the entire narrative and not just

3172
02:55:55,135 --> 02:55:56,927
Decadence but also decline

3173
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:02,559
One of the weirdest metrics I think that's ever develop but it's natural to see how

3174
02:56:02,815 --> 02:56:03,839
Nitronic

3175
02:56:04,607 --> 02:56:08,703
Is this idea that you could trace the rise and fall of civilizations 2

3176
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:13,055
How they're doing in terms of territorial acquisition and retention

3177
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:20,479
Is the Roman Empire Rising whether they still conquering territory and expanding if so then they're Rising the minute they stop

3178
02:56:20,735 --> 02:56:23,039
Expanding start to contract they're falling they're in Decline

3179
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:26,623
Of course.

3180
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,647
Ignores the

3181
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:29,183
Empires that

3182
02:56:29,439 --> 02:56:30,719
Like a stock market

3183
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:33,279
Expand and contract based on their Fortune

3184
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:34,559
I'm thinking of China

3185
02:56:34,815 --> 02:56:36,095
Were the byzantines for example

3186
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:40,959
Going to watch the Persians in that sense to sort of fall of the Roman Empire model

3187
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:46,079
Expand like the blob in the science fiction movie that we talked about earlier to a certain point

3188
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:49,407
And once they stop it's all about trying to hold on to what you have

3189
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:54,527
In the old especially 19th century way of viewing things that's a sign of an Empire in Decline

3190
02:56:55,295 --> 02:56:56,575
The idea

3191
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:57,343
That this

3192
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:59,903
Decadence and decline of reached a point where

3193
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:05,279
We no longer have the wooden shoes descending the staircase we're well into the silk slippers going down

3194
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:08,863
You know I thought about that for a minute and contrasted it to this idea that

3195
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:12,703
You know we should be judging Empires on territorial acquisition

3196
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:15,007
If you were living in

3197
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:17,823
Some time. In ancient Persia

3198
02:57:18,335 --> 02:57:21,919
Would you rather live in the wooden shoes era or the silk slippers are

3199
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:27,295
But it seems to me we probably live in the sun version anyway the silk slippers

3200
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:30,879
Era in our own civilization lifecycle I would say

3201
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:38,303
And if I asked you if you wanted to go back to one of the wooden shoes are or where things were more Spartan in the food was more

3202
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:40,095
Simple in the

3203
02:57:40,351 --> 02:57:46,495
In the rules may be more strict I see two ends of the spectrum either like Viking like to be one level of the

3204
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:50,335
Wooden shoes are aware you're so tough that you're just you know it's like a darwinian nightmare

3205
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:51,871
Day-to-day existence

3206
02:57:52,127 --> 02:57:53,407
Or like something like

3207
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:56,991
The Spartans were the Puritans where life is just one long

3208
02:57:57,759 --> 02:58:00,063
You know effort in Spartan denial but it's you know

3209
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:06,463
Create stuff people not so much fun maybe live that life especially if you were born and raised in the slipper are alike

3210
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:07,487
We probably were

3211
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:13,631
The funny part about the Persian Empires history coming up is where we talking about it at 8

3212
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:16,703
An Empire that is traditionally thought to be on the downhill slope

3213
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:22,847
But if you live there other than some inflation some high prices baby might not have been a very bad time in fact

3214
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:29,247
There might have been a decent amount of peace and stability and some of these places which is why some of these Kings were coming up or kind of boring

3215
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:33,087
And you can run through 30 or 40 year

3216
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:34,111
Rain

3217
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:35,647
You're pretty quickly

3218
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:44,095
Ironically the first of these Kings to suffer from sort of the darkness that intrudes on the narrative

3219
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,631
Herodotus is gone

3220
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:52,287
Is the star antagonist of his movie write the Darth Vader characters

3221
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:58,175
Xerxes without leave the end of Herodotus is movie by darn near 15 years

3222
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:05,855
If you believe the ancient Greek sources like the playwright that they often portray him as sort of like the Broken Man broken by the

3223
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:07,647
Grease You're Never quite the same

3224
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:12,767
There's a lot of building project the archaeologists so they weren't sure what you doing want to building after

3225
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:13,535

3226
02:59:14,047 --> 02:59:15,071
You may have conquered

3227
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:19,167
What is general name conquered more territory in the East not really well known

3228
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:27,359
It's pretty certain that the Persians were told a completely different story about the Greek situation than the Greeks would have known

3229
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:28,127
What about

3230
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:31,967
Brianna and Endymion have both quote

3231
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:35,807
A much later account by an ancient historian

3232
02:59:36,319 --> 02:59:38,111
Dio chrysostom

3233
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:39,647
And

3234
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:46,303
Freon says quote the official Persian version of the event is probably close to it.

3235
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:47,839
Social reports much later

3236
02:59:48,095 --> 02:59:50,655
He's talking about how the Persians probably spun

3237
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:53,471
You know the war that just ended in Greece

3238
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:57,567
DuckTales all the way back to the way we began this conversation

3239
02:59:58,335 --> 02:59:59,615
You're much much earlier

3240
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:02,431
We talked about how with the Assyrian to the Babylonians

3241
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:03,711
Everything about

3242
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:06,783
Inable Last Stand of the Spartans at Thermopylae

3243
03:00:07,295 --> 03:00:09,343
Well this is an ancient historian Dio chrysostom

3244
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:10,623
Kind of giving one

3245
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:17,279
The everyone thinks might have been the spin that the Persian people were told and maybe the story that after awhile Xerxes told himself

3246
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:19,583
Tianjin Astorian rights

3247
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:20,351
Quote

3248
03:00:20,863 --> 03:00:22,911
During his expedition in Greece

3249
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:27,007
Xerxes achieved victory over the lack of demonias at Thermopylae

3250
03:00:27,263 --> 03:00:29,311
And killed King Leonidas there

3251
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:31,615
Mini Truckin laid waste to Athens

3252
03:00:31,871 --> 03:00:35,967
I wish you sold into slavery all the inhabitants would not succeeded in escaping

3253
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:40,319
And after these successes he imposed tribute on the Greeks and return to Asia

3254
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:41,599
And quote

3255
03:00:43,135 --> 03:00:44,415
That sounds like a guy

3256
03:00:44,671 --> 03:00:46,719
If that's true that's basically saying

3257
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:48,255
Mission accomplished

3258
03:00:48,511 --> 03:00:49,535
Never mind all that

3259
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:55,167
Revolutionary activity does Athenians and their little Alliance are stirring up on my coastline

3260
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:57,727
Also

3261
03:00:58,239 --> 03:01:04,383
Both of the principal opponents of Xerxes in those Greek battles temistocles or Han Solo character

3262
03:01:04,895 --> 03:01:07,711
Estes Park

3263
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:09,759
Both of them will end up

3264
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:15,903
Either taking Persian gold or in Persian employee or imitating Persians or marrying Persians

3265
03:01:18,463 --> 03:01:21,791
Xerxes probably got to see pause Aeneas go all Persian

3266
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:27,679
Witcher something they did the Persians were great cultural imperialistic to you came from a Backwater of ancient Greece like

3267
03:01:27,935 --> 03:01:30,751
Seniors did 8 that horrible Spartan gruel

3268
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:33,567
And then go over and see how they're dressed fed

3269
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:38,431
Wined and dined in the use sophisticated Persian women at a lot of people went all Persian

3270
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:39,967
Passing is one of them

3271
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:46,623
Themistocles either showed up in the court of Xerxes or

3272
03:01:46,879 --> 03:01:50,207
Kind of a victory for the dad when your Chief opponent shows up there and kind of goes

3273
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:51,999
Can I play on your team now

3274
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:57,631
Open the Persian point of view I mean you might have been able to say what's up

3275
03:01:58,655 --> 03:01:59,423
Look we win

3276
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:02,239
All about how you spin it song

3277
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:05,823
Nonetheless

3278
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:09,407
Xerxes historical reputation has had to live with

3279
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:14,271
By the way he's been portrayed for so long the first of the jerk Kings I think we called him

3280
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:15,807
Someone who is less

3281
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:19,135
Lenient than his forebears what episode of a laid-back pek

3282
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:20,671
Policy of Tolerance and whatnot

3283
03:02:21,695 --> 03:02:23,487
Probably not true historians say but

3284
03:02:23,743 --> 03:02:25,023
Good luck changing that image

3285
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:26,815
Also

3286
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:32,447
Often portrayed as the first of sort of the silver spoon generation of Persian kings the ones

3287
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:34,495
In a raised as rich kids

3288
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:41,919
And not quite of the same metal as their forebears that's kind of what the end of the prodigious movie

3289
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,455
Implies

3290
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:46,527
Here's the way I am a den den

3291
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:47,551
Describes

3292
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:49,343
So the image

3293
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:51,135
It's come down to listen to Xerxes quote

3294
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:57,023
In the works of other Greek authors Xerxes is depicted as being surrounded by stupid eunuchs

3295
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:00,863
Plato wrote that Xerxes was excessively spoiled

3296
03:03:01,119 --> 03:03:02,399
And it's starting with him

3297
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:06,239
The Persian kings were great name only but not in reality

3298
03:03:06,751 --> 03:03:09,311
Contemporary historians often regard Xerxes

3299
03:03:09,567 --> 03:03:11,103
In accordance with Greek writers

3300
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:12,127
As a man of week

3301
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:12,895
Character

3302
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:14,943
And a toy in the hands of his unit

3303
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:21,599
The official Persian sources he writes however the pig Xerxes otherwise statement in a try and Warrior

3304
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,391
And quote

3305
03:03:25,183 --> 03:03:30,047
This idea of Xerxes being the first of the Persian kings to sort of inaugurate

3306
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:34,911
The decadence and decline era in Persian history is long stand

3307
03:03:36,191 --> 03:03:37,983
Common until the 1950s

3308
03:03:38,239 --> 03:03:39,007
Is at least

3309
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:40,543
And a lot of books even

3310
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:42,079
Call me the time after that

3311
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:48,479
Will Durant way of course love but writing in 1935 when there was a different view of these things

3312
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:55,391
You kept the same sort of an idea going in an extremely satisfying from a Storyteller an old-time his

3313
03:03:57,183 --> 03:03:57,951
He writes quote

3314
03:03:58,975 --> 03:04:01,791
The Empire of Darius lasted hardly a century

3315
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:08,447
The moral as well as the physical backbone of Persia was broken by Marathon salamis in platea

3316
03:04:09,215 --> 03:04:12,031
The emperor's exchanged Mars for Venus

3317
03:04:12,287 --> 03:04:15,103
And the nation descended into corruption and apathy

3318
03:04:15,615 --> 03:04:19,967
The decline of Persia anticipated almost in detail the decline of Rome

3319
03:04:20,479 --> 03:04:25,855
Immorality in the generation among the people accompanied violence and negligence on the throne

3320
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:28,671
The Persians like the medes before them

3321
03:04:28,927 --> 03:04:32,511
Pass from stoicism to epicureanism in a few Generations

3322
03:04:32,767 --> 03:04:36,095
Eating became the principal occupation of the aristocracy

3323
03:04:36,607 --> 03:04:40,191
These men who had once made it a rule to eat but once a day

3324
03:04:40,447 --> 03:04:45,055
Now interpreted the rule to allow them one meal prolong from noon tonight

3325
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:48,383
They stock their larders with 1000 Delicacies

3326
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:51,455
And they often served entire animals to their guests

3327
03:04:51,967 --> 03:04:54,271
They stuff themselves with Rich rare meat

3328
03:04:54,783 --> 03:04:57,599
And spent their genius upon new sauces and desserts

3329
03:04:58,367 --> 03:05:02,719
A corrupt and corrupting multitude of menials filled the houses of the wealthy

3330
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:05,791
Well drunkenness became the common Vice of every class

3331
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:08,607
Cyrus and Darius created Persia

3332
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:10,143
Xerxes inherited it

3333
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:11,935
Is successors destroyed

3334
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:13,727
And quote

3335
03:05:15,519 --> 03:05:19,103
Is a history fan that's a wonderfully satisfying piece of Storytelling

3336
03:05:20,383 --> 03:05:26,271
And there are two things that are wonderful about it one it seems to teach you some wonderful Cosmic lesson doesn't it

3337
03:05:27,295 --> 03:05:33,439
About the decay of societies based on civilization

3338
03:05:33,951 --> 03:05:38,815
Lesson in wisdom acquired wisdom from the past the other thing that's wonderful is

3339
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:41,887
The Surety of at the certitude

3340
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:45,727
It's a very satisfying piece of writing

3341
03:05:45,983 --> 03:05:52,127
Compare that to something like Pierre Briand so much of it especially in the. We're coming up to is comparing

3342
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:56,991
This ancient offered at this ancient authoring basically finding problems with both of what they say

3343
03:05:57,759 --> 03:06:03,903
The wonderful irony of this. In history were in now where everything is so much more documented in careful in scientific

3344
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:05,439
We know less than we ever did

3345
03:06:06,463 --> 03:06:08,767
Instead of Illuminating a ton of things that were

3346
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:10,815
Dark although there's been quite a bit of that

3347
03:06:11,327 --> 03:06:13,631
A ton of what modern history is done to debunk

3348
03:06:14,143 --> 03:06:15,935
What we thought we knew in the past

3349
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:20,031
DuckTales right with the way

3350
03:06:20,287 --> 03:06:26,431
We mentioned it earlier Pierre Brown started his whole book which is this we know who you haven't heard a thousand Pages or more

3351
03:06:26,687 --> 03:06:32,319
Stop talking about this is how it was and you start your entire book off with a phrase that says quote

3352
03:06:32,575 --> 03:06:35,903
You Must Believe ancient history even if it's not true

3353
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:37,183
And quote

3354
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:41,791
Because the basic structure is real

3355
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:44,863
The details are completely unknown

3356
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:47,167
Any idea

3357
03:06:47,423 --> 03:06:51,007
Going all the way from ancient Greek times to the 1950s at least

3358
03:06:51,263 --> 03:06:57,151
But you can see in here part of an of a recurring pattern of civilizations declining and falling because they're people start

3359
03:06:57,663 --> 03:07:03,295
Eating Richard food and concentrate their genius on sausage instead of weapons or whatever the implication is there

3360
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:08,159
That's fascinating to because everybody understand how ridiculous it is to blame

3361
03:07:08,415 --> 03:07:14,559
You know something like an entire cultures fall on the fact that their people are getting slovenly that they're slouching towards

3362
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:15,327
Master

3363
03:07:16,095 --> 03:07:17,119
At the same time

3364
03:07:17,375 --> 03:07:23,519
One could perhaps be convinced that something like that has some sort of role in the grand scheme of things but try quantifying

3365
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:25,055
You try

3366
03:07:25,311 --> 03:07:31,455
Diagramming the toxics to the brings down the Roman Empire in deciding exactly what percentage of responsibility

3367
03:07:31,711 --> 03:07:33,247
Do you tribute to the fact that they're women

3368
03:07:33,503 --> 03:07:37,087
Charles Atlas virtuous than they were back when the empire was right and you see what I'm saying

3369
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:43,999
It's possible that that plays a role but when you read these histories and isn't playing a role it is playing V roll

3370
03:07:44,767 --> 03:07:50,911
And you look back on it now and you just say okay something like that is patently ridiculous and even if once or twice in history something like

3371
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:54,495
Like that can be said to be what it was

3372
03:07:54,751 --> 03:07:59,871
Do use it as some sort of general rule that applies to the rise and fall of civilizations throughout history is

3373
03:08:01,151 --> 03:08:02,431
And everybody knows it now

3374
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:05,759
But it's colored the way this story has been told

3375
03:08:06,015 --> 03:08:08,831
And so so much about the way to color now is trying to

3376
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:13,439
Look through the weeds that have grown up over 2500 years

3377
03:08:13,695 --> 03:08:17,791
Including such things as well Xerxes was hanging out in the Harem drinking too much wine and

3378
03:08:18,047 --> 03:08:20,095
You know that's what happened to victim of Harem intrigues

3379
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:28,287
Which brings us to the other problem with all this is going to be great if we could just as I said earlier right all this off

3380
03:08:28,543 --> 03:08:29,055
BS

3381
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:32,895
Harriman trees is a wonderful example

3382
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:34,943
Traditionally Xerxes assassinated

3383
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:38,783
In keeping with the rest of this history of Persia we don't know how

3384
03:08:39,295 --> 03:08:40,831
Can you have multiple different accounts

3385
03:08:42,111 --> 03:08:48,255
The traditional overview they'll say is it's a victim of Harem intrigues of all these women fighting amongst each either on the rivals and and

3386
03:08:48,511 --> 03:08:53,375
Quest for power in the Unix and all this stuff in this we said earlier when you get these sources from people like

3387
03:08:53,631 --> 03:08:55,679
TCS he may be a little gossipy

3388
03:08:57,471 --> 03:09:01,055
Show me the whole history of Persia come down to a princess.

3389
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:02,591
Prince Charles

3390
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:03,871
Love triangle deal

3391
03:09:05,663 --> 03:09:10,527
Historian Lloyd Llewellyn Jones who's the one so I'm putting this TCS translation that I have together

3392
03:09:11,039 --> 03:09:14,623
He writes a very good defense of the idea of Harem intrigues

3393
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:20,767
It sort of gives a pretty darn good historical justification for something that a lot of historians say this is just a motif

3394
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:23,071
There's no such thing as a Greek

3395
03:09:23,327 --> 03:09:28,703
Idea romantic idea of a harem of all the sex in the end the drinking and it's like a Greek fantasy

3396
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:29,983
But here's what

3397
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:34,847
Llewellyn-jones has to say about this and what this does when he defends this idea

3398
03:09:35,103 --> 03:09:41,247
Is once more make us realize that when it comes to the history of the ancient Persian Empire and a lot of this ancient stuff we don't know anything for sure

3399
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:42,015
Practically

3400
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:44,063
You can make a case or an argument

3401
03:09:44,831 --> 03:09:47,135
For multiple interpretations of most things

3402
03:09:47,903 --> 03:09:48,927
Llewellyn-jones rights quote

3403
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:51,487
So what then do we make

3404
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:55,327
Noticias is vignettes of powerful queens and eunuchs

3405
03:09:55,839 --> 03:09:58,655
It is clear that the Royal women of achaemenid Persia

3406
03:09:58,911 --> 03:10:00,191
Did not live in prayer.

3407
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:04,287
Nor did they inhabit an orientalist world of sultry sensuality

3408
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:08,127
But they did form part of a strict hierarchical Court structure

3409
03:10:08,383 --> 03:10:10,687
They moved in close proximity to the king

3410
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:12,479
Is a component of his harem

3411
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:15,551
They followed the peripatetic lifestyle of the great king

3412
03:10:15,807 --> 03:10:20,671
The Royal women's importance and their allegiance to the maintenance of dynastic power

3413
03:10:20,927 --> 03:10:26,559
The achaemenid dynasty was after all essentially essentially run family business

3414
03:10:26,815 --> 03:10:29,119
And at the heart of the operation lay the harem

3415
03:10:29,375 --> 03:10:31,679
The king's domestic Inner Circle of women

3416
03:10:31,935 --> 03:10:33,727
Offspring siblings and slave

3417
03:10:35,007 --> 03:10:38,847
TCS the stories of female power and agency he writes

3418
03:10:39,103 --> 03:10:40,383
Always operate

3419
03:10:40,639 --> 03:10:42,431
Around the safeguarding of the throne

3420
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:44,735
And the preservation of personal power

3421
03:10:44,991 --> 03:10:47,039
Stories of sexual shenanigans

3422
03:10:47,295 --> 03:10:50,367
The stuff of orientalist dreams are kept to a minimum

3423
03:10:50,623 --> 03:10:52,927
And even when they do appear they serve a bigger picture

3424
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:59,583
Royal women fought over rank in position privilege and when Unix over reach there a lot of positions and names

3425
03:10:59,839 --> 03:11:00,351
For the throne

3426
03:11:00,607 --> 03:11:02,911
The Queen's act swiftly and punish them

3427
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:07,007
For the women men and eunuchs slaves of the Royal Family

3428
03:11:07,263 --> 03:11:11,103
Prestige and access to power lay in their proximity to the king

3429
03:11:12,383 --> 03:11:13,407
Kevin says quote

3430
03:11:13,663 --> 03:11:19,807
The squabbles rivalries double dealings murders and executions must be seen in the contest

3431
03:11:20,063 --> 03:11:21,343
Text to buy Natick politics

3432
03:11:21,599 --> 03:11:23,903
Persia was controlled by an absolute ruler

3433
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:25,695
That is not orientalist

3434
03:11:25,951 --> 03:11:26,463
Cliche

3435
03:11:26,719 --> 03:11:27,231
It is a fact

3436
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:33,631
Absolute monarchies are open to a particular form of political tension which usually focuses on the Royal Family

3437
03:11:33,887 --> 03:11:35,935
Turn on the noble families that surround the king

3438
03:11:36,191 --> 03:11:37,727
Within such institutions

3439
03:11:37,983 --> 03:11:42,079
Women of the dynastic family often rise to positions of political agency

3440
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:46,431
Not sure any formal route to power but by other less qualifiable mean

3441
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:51,295
Cross-cultural and cross temporal comparisons with other court societies

3442
03:11:51,551 --> 03:11:52,831
Reveal this to be the truth

3443
03:11:53,343 --> 03:11:53,855
And quote

3444
03:11:55,391 --> 03:11:56,415
In other words

3445
03:11:56,671 --> 03:12:02,303
What llewellyn-jones just did there was take one of the things historians today are most comfortable with blaming on

3446
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:07,167
Greek stereotypes and makes a darn good historical scientific defense of it

3447
03:12:07,935 --> 03:12:11,007
And what does that do just muddies the waters even more

3448
03:12:12,031 --> 03:12:13,567
This is my excuse now

3449
03:12:14,079 --> 03:12:15,615
For moving through

3450
03:12:15,871 --> 03:12:18,687
Several of the succeeding Kings quickly

3451
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:26,367
When I decided to deal with each Persian king in succession is my structural framework for the store

3452
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:31,231
I knew I was going to be front loading events because there's so much known and so much written

3453
03:12:31,487 --> 03:12:33,023
About the first several Kings

3454
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:34,815
And the created the Empire and then

3455
03:12:35,071 --> 03:12:41,215
Do most people tend based on the evidence to scream through the succeeding Kingdom part of the reason why

3456
03:12:41,471 --> 03:12:42,239
Don't have as much

3457
03:12:42,495 --> 03:12:46,079
To do with the Greeks on a regular basis so there's less written about them

3458
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:49,919
But you'll get whole rain like artaxerxes the first

3459
03:12:50,431 --> 03:12:52,735
Screens for like four decades and he's a

3460
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:56,831
Person that normally you see a few events of his life put on a timeline

3461
03:12:57,855 --> 03:12:58,879
Listen to the way

3462
03:12:59,391 --> 03:13:01,951
That same will Durant writing in 1935

3463
03:13:02,207 --> 03:13:08,095
In a paragraph or two sums up the rest of the history of the kings of Persia after Xerxes as time

3464
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:09,375
Quote

3465
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:16,543
Only the records of Rome after Tiberius could rival in bloodiness the Royal annals of Persia

3466
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:22,943
The murder of Xerxes was murdered by artist after a long rain was succeeded

3467
03:13:23,199 --> 03:13:24,479
Goodbye Xerxes II

3468
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:28,575
Who was murdered a few weeks later by his half-brother Saudi on us

3469
03:13:28,831 --> 03:13:32,159
Who was murdered six months later by Darius II

3470
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:35,231
Who suppress the Revolt of terror attack knees

3471
03:13:35,487 --> 03:13:41,631
By having him slain his wife cut into pieces and his mother brothers and sisters buried alive

3472
03:13:42,399 --> 03:13:44,703
Darius II was followed by his son

3473
03:13:44,959 --> 03:13:46,239
Artaxerxes II

3474
03:13:46,751 --> 03:13:48,287
Who won the battle of cunaxa

3475
03:13:48,543 --> 03:13:52,127
Had to fight to the death his own brother the younger Cyrus

3476
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:54,687
When the youth tried to seize the royal power

3477
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:58,271
Artaxerxes II enjoy the long rain

3478
03:13:58,527 --> 03:14:01,087
Killed his son Darius for conspiracy

3479
03:14:01,343 --> 03:14:06,975
And died of a broken heart on finding then another son focus with planning to assassinate him

3480
03:14:07,487 --> 03:14:09,279
Ochus rule for 20 years

3481
03:14:09,535 --> 03:14:12,351
And was poisoned by his General bag of us

3482
03:14:12,607 --> 03:14:14,399
This iron livered Warwick

3483
03:14:14,655 --> 03:14:17,215
Play Star versus son of a focus on the throne

3484
03:14:17,471 --> 03:14:19,519
Assassinated arcis his brothers

3485
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:23,103
To make our secure then assassinated arsis

3486
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:25,919
And his infant children and gave the scepter

3487
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:27,199
Tokoto mantis

3488
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:28,991
I safely effeminate friend

3489
03:14:29,503 --> 03:14:30,015
And quote

3490
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:32,575
In other words

3491
03:14:33,087 --> 03:14:36,927
The highlight of most of the reins of the rest of the kings of Persia

3492
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:38,463
Seem to be

3493
03:14:38,719 --> 03:14:40,511
The remarkable

3494
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:44,095
Bloody purrific incestual

3495
03:14:44,351 --> 03:14:46,911
Assassination leading where they die

3496
03:14:49,727 --> 03:14:50,751
But it's worth pointing out

3497
03:14:51,007 --> 03:14:53,567
That of all those ends that

3498
03:14:54,591 --> 03:14:56,127
Will Durant just gave you

3499
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:58,943
Almost none of them can be confirmed

3500
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:06,367
These are traditions and you have to decide that you're going to buy the sources and sometimes the sources differ for example

3501
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:08,159
Take the death of

3502
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:11,487
The anti-hero in the Herodotus production Xerxes

3503
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:16,351
The sources that are out there have different stories

3504
03:15:17,375 --> 03:15:20,959
TC this is the one that usually cited in the TCS version

3505
03:15:21,215 --> 03:15:24,543
Xerxes is assassinated by his bodyguard

3506
03:15:24,799 --> 03:15:30,431
Which could be a kind of a bodyguard or a general or counselor or busier the position is interesting

3507
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:34,015
This bodyguard person is working with a eunuch

3508
03:15:34,783 --> 03:15:35,807
So what else is new

3509
03:15:36,575 --> 03:15:38,367
And the two of them are supposed to kill Xerxes

3510
03:15:38,879 --> 03:15:39,903
Now later

3511
03:15:40,159 --> 03:15:43,743
A fragment of TCS actually talked about how Xerxes died

3512
03:15:44,255 --> 03:15:47,327
But it says that he died in the most shameful way a man can die

3513
03:15:48,095 --> 03:15:49,375
I having his throat cut

3514
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:51,679
While he sleeps by his son

3515
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:56,287
And then the story gets interesting this is this is when

3516
03:15:56,543 --> 03:15:59,871
TCS has the two conspirators The Bodyguard in the eunuch

3517
03:16:00,383 --> 03:16:03,967
Going to one of the Xerxes Sons going to be the people who inherit

3518
03:16:04,223 --> 03:16:06,015
The throne which may be The Bodyguard wants

3519
03:16:06,271 --> 03:16:07,551
And telling the Sun

3520
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:09,599
It is Brothers the one who killed his father

3521
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:12,415
Yeah your dad dead guess you did at your older brother

3522
03:16:13,439 --> 03:16:18,303
So that kid we're told goes to his brother's house and accuses him of killing their father

3523
03:16:19,071 --> 03:16:20,863
The older brother says I can't kill dad

3524
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:22,911
The younger brother doesn't believe him and killed him

3525
03:16:24,703 --> 03:16:30,335
And then there were wild and they could be true but you don't know

3526
03:16:30,847 --> 03:16:36,223
Then the conspirators try to get rid of this other son so that maybe the throne clear for them who knows

3527
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:38,527
And the sun figures it out it was told

3528
03:16:38,783 --> 03:16:43,135
But he turns the tables and he kills The Bodyguard and the eunuch and the eunuch supposedly by

3529
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:45,951
That wonderful torture method of the boats

3530
03:16:48,255 --> 03:16:49,279
And that King

3531
03:16:50,047 --> 03:16:51,327
Becomes artaxerxes the first

3532
03:16:52,863 --> 03:16:55,167
The artaxerxes the first is a wonderful example

3533
03:16:55,423 --> 03:16:58,239
How the rest of the story going to go until the very last king

3534
03:16:58,495 --> 03:17:01,567
Of the Persian Empire or maybe the second last depending on how you

3535
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:02,847
Chronicle.

3536
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:06,175
But that's the here's a guy who will rule

3537
03:17:06,431 --> 03:17:08,735
From 465 BC

3538
03:17:08,991 --> 03:17:12,319
24204 BC it's an enormous rain

3539
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:14,879
For decades floss right

3540
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:18,207
If you look at artaxerxes the first life

3541
03:17:18,975 --> 03:17:21,023
It's like a few bullet points on a timeline

3542
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:25,631
That's how all the rest of these things are going to be two up until the last one or two

3543
03:17:26,911 --> 03:17:32,287
It's tempting to say maybe that's just because there wasn't a whole lot to record maybe artaxerxes the first is a great

3544
03:17:32,543 --> 03:17:33,823
Manager maybe like

3545
03:17:34,079 --> 03:17:40,223
You know Darius was a great CEO Persia core and he's so great that you know the Steady Hand on the wheel keeps their from

3546
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:44,063
Norma's flare-ups of things that make great historical stories

3547
03:17:45,855 --> 03:17:46,623
I will probably

3548
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:48,415
More connected to the fact that

3549
03:17:48,927 --> 03:17:49,951
Woodworking

3550
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:52,255
Other parts of the Persian Empire remember

3551
03:17:52,511 --> 03:17:58,655
There's an entire Persian Empire on the other side of the Persian Capital that the Greeks know very little about its like

3552
03:17:58,911 --> 03:18:00,191
The Dark Side of the Moon to them

3553
03:18:00,447 --> 03:18:01,983
But there's a lot going on there

3554
03:18:02,239 --> 03:18:08,383
And a lot of the more modern historians point out that that's probably the more important part of the Empire to the Persians themselves

3555
03:18:09,151 --> 03:18:10,687
Who knows what artaxerxes is doing

3556
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:13,247
He's famous though in the Greek story

3557
03:18:13,503 --> 03:18:19,647
For being the guy who caught a fisa practice at the Persians were already doing but sort of makes it the foreign policy

3558
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:20,415
Your Persian

3559
03:18:20,927 --> 03:18:22,207
When dealing with the Greeks

3560
03:18:22,719 --> 03:18:23,999
Artaxerxes is the one

3561
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:28,863
Who decides to make it the policy of Persia to use diplomacy as a weapon

3562
03:18:31,167 --> 03:18:33,727
And this is something I think a lot of modern-day people forget

3563
03:18:33,983 --> 03:18:38,591
The diplomacy is really good at we think of it as wimpy sometimes best defensive

3564
03:18:39,103 --> 03:18:40,127
A lot of the Great

3565
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:41,919
Civilizations in history

3566
03:18:42,175 --> 03:18:44,991
Were fabulous at using diplomacy like a sword

3567
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:47,807
Will you can go in and really deconstruct

3568
03:18:48,063 --> 03:18:49,599
Your adversaries using

3569
03:18:50,367 --> 03:18:54,207
The Persians were so skilled at this that some of the modern historians I was reading

3570
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:58,815
Know that they can't help us a why didn't the Persians do this from the very beginning

3571
03:18:59,071 --> 03:19:04,447
I didn't need to fight any of those battle that we just were counted to you they could have just done this cuz look how effective it was

3572
03:19:05,471 --> 03:19:11,615
The 490 in the 480s Persia is fighting and mostly losing Land and Sea battles

3573
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:12,895
Against these Greek city-states

3574
03:19:14,687 --> 03:19:17,759
100 years later the Persians have essentially emasculated them

3575
03:19:19,039 --> 03:19:21,855
I paying for them to emasculate each other

3576
03:19:23,647 --> 03:19:25,695
And they're so Machiavellian about it

3577
03:19:25,951 --> 03:19:32,095
When one side seems to be doing too well they'll fund the other side and the other side will continually

3578
03:19:32,351 --> 03:19:33,119
Change sometimes

3579
03:19:33,375 --> 03:19:36,703
The Persians are funding the Spartans to bring down Athenian power

3580
03:19:37,471 --> 03:19:43,615
But then for example will be a time where the Spartans will invade modern-day turkey in Asia Minor look like

3581
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:46,431
I'm thinking about marching on Persian cities of the Persians

3582
03:19:46,687 --> 03:19:48,479
Front of a bunch of gold back to Greece

3583
03:19:48,735 --> 03:19:50,271
Spartan enemies attack Dam

3584
03:19:51,807 --> 03:19:54,367
Is there any Chester star said that essentially the

3585
03:19:54,879 --> 03:19:56,671
Persian Empire was like

3586
03:19:56,927 --> 03:20:01,535
The Puppet Masters of Greece by the end of this time and they had managed to do that simply by

3587
03:20:01,791 --> 03:20:02,815
Using money

3588
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:05,631
To prolong and deepen

3589
03:20:05,887 --> 03:20:08,959
The natural disagreements that greeted always had with each other

3590
03:20:10,495 --> 03:20:11,775
And at the same time

3591
03:20:12,031 --> 03:20:18,175
Provide the means to continue fighting until everyone was exhausted at one point in the Peloponnesian War for example one of these

3592
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:19,455
These wars that were spawned

3593
03:20:20,223 --> 03:20:21,247
You indirectly

3594
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:23,295
In part by Persian gold

3595
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:25,599
The Spartans will lose a fleet

3596
03:20:25,855 --> 03:20:27,135
To the Athenians are most of

3597
03:20:27,391 --> 03:20:30,719
Feel like they have to maybe drop out of the washer the Persians are buying another flea

3598
03:20:31,999 --> 03:20:36,351
They don't even have to go to the great king sometimes one of the set traps in the local area will pay for

3599
03:20:36,607 --> 03:20:38,655
Yeah sure no problem I'll just keep fighting

3600
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:42,751
Now artaxerxes is one of these Kings who may have

3601
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:47,103
Brokered the actual official maybe end of the war peace agreement in

3602
03:20:47,871 --> 03:20:54,015
449 but even that is argued about by historians who wonder if there ever was one and if the terms

3603
03:20:54,271 --> 03:20:56,063
Come down to us were real so

3604
03:20:57,087 --> 03:21:03,231
Who knows but artaxerxes is supposed to have died again we don't know how he died either but he supposed to had a good death Justina song

3605
03:21:03,487 --> 03:21:04,511
Breaking Bad or natural or what

3606
03:21:06,303 --> 03:21:08,607
Then he's the one who has three of his sons

3607
03:21:08,863 --> 03:21:11,679
So declare together that they're going to be king in that doesn't turn on

3608
03:21:11,935 --> 03:21:12,447
Atwell

3609
03:21:13,471 --> 03:21:18,847
One of them will be killed supposedly drunkenly after 45 days of being proclaimed King

3610
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:22,687
Another one will manage a little longer until

3611
03:21:22,943 --> 03:21:24,479
Eventually he gets killed

3612
03:21:24,991 --> 03:21:27,551
Bye again close relative these are all Brothers

3613
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:30,623
Black brother will take the name

3614
03:21:31,135 --> 03:21:37,023
Darius or dries the second rule from 4:23 BCE to 404 BCE

3615
03:21:38,047 --> 03:21:41,119
He has one of the coolest wildest wickedest wives in the world

3616
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:42,399
She will be

3617
03:21:42,911 --> 03:21:44,447
Well depends on how you're looking at it

3618
03:21:44,703 --> 03:21:49,567
1 top worst mother-in-law's of all time or bastina from my standpoint

3619
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:53,151
Loving the story she's one of the best she can Alexander the Great

3620
03:21:53,919 --> 03:21:57,759
You wouldn't want to have them as your mother-in-law but I get the story that come out of it or wonderful

3621
03:21:58,783 --> 03:22:02,367
Just so happens of course that just to make matters more Persian and interesting fun

3622
03:22:02,623 --> 03:22:03,135
Ancient

3623
03:22:03,903 --> 03:22:04,927
Thrice the second wife

3624
03:22:05,183 --> 03:22:05,951
What is sister

3625
03:22:08,767 --> 03:22:14,911
Your kid is artaxerxes II who's famous because he has a civil war with his little brother

3626
03:22:15,423 --> 03:22:16,703
Going to Cyrus the younger

3627
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:19,775
Cyrus the younger as the Persians all through this.

3628
03:22:20,031 --> 03:22:25,663
Do hires a ton of Greek mercenaries to fight for him one of them is a guy named xenophon

3629
03:22:25,919 --> 03:22:29,247
Who happens to write in whose work has come down to us so it's famous

3630
03:22:30,527 --> 03:22:33,087
Cyrus the younger led by his Greek Mercenaries

3631
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:35,391
Triumph at the Battle of cunaxa

3632
03:22:35,903 --> 03:22:36,415
Well

3633
03:22:36,671 --> 03:22:40,255
To a certain point is a better fight than a van says that the Persians Runaway

3634
03:22:40,511 --> 03:22:41,023
Before they even

3635
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:45,631
Cross beers with his degree to pursue them a long distance and it was all going to be one except

3636
03:22:46,399 --> 03:22:47,679
Cyrus the younger the

3637
03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:53,823
Rebel King they were fighting for manages to get himself killed in the battle in that pretty much ends that you can't really

3638
03:22:54,335 --> 03:22:54,847
You know

3639
03:22:55,103 --> 03:22:58,431
Fight your brother for the throne if you don't survive the battle so

3640
03:22:58,943 --> 03:22:59,711
Story 2

3641
03:22:59,967 --> 03:23:03,039
Xenophon tells his famous in Western literature

3642
03:23:04,063 --> 03:23:04,575
These

3643
03:23:04,831 --> 03:23:08,415
Greek soldiers between 10 and 13000 of them have to manage

3644
03:23:08,671 --> 03:23:09,951
To get out of

3645
03:23:10,463 --> 03:23:15,327
The Persian Empire all the way back to Greek run territory and do so

3646
03:23:15,839 --> 03:23:21,727
You know where the Persian army essentially chasing them in a ratchet in the hallway the long story short of this whole thing is they management

3647
03:23:22,751 --> 03:23:25,823
And this has all sorts of overtones including this idea

3648
03:23:26,079 --> 03:23:31,199
Vulnerable the Persian Empire must be if they can't wipe out 10 to 13,000 hoplites

3649
03:23:31,711 --> 03:23:33,759
In their own territory unsupported

3650
03:23:36,319 --> 03:23:39,647
Of course my favorite story and xenophon and I would count it all the time

3651
03:23:40,159 --> 03:23:41,951
Is the moment where he and his troops

3652
03:23:42,975 --> 03:23:44,767
Camp out near these giant

3653
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:45,791
Ghost cities

3654
03:23:47,071 --> 03:23:53,215
Built them and they're bigger than anything they don't know they think maybe

3655
03:23:55,007 --> 03:23:57,055
Of course we all know that he's camping out

3656
03:23:57,567 --> 03:24:01,919
Near the ruins of the greatest Syrian City

3657
03:24:02,175 --> 03:24:03,455
Two or three hundred years before

3658
03:24:05,503 --> 03:24:09,855
The Persians are the ones who inherited that old world and they ruled it for a while

3659
03:24:10,623 --> 03:24:16,767
And it made the transition from that black-and-white era to the fully colorized era of xenophon and we know he's in the fully colorized

3660
03:24:17,023 --> 03:24:18,303
We're reading this stuff aren't we

3661
03:24:20,863 --> 03:24:21,631
Versions of the bridge

3662
03:24:22,911 --> 03:24:25,983
They sort of explain how we got from the very very old world

3663
03:24:26,495 --> 03:24:31,615
To merely the very old world with xenophon asks who built these cities that are

3664
03:24:31,871 --> 03:24:33,151
Disintegrating around him

3665
03:24:33,919 --> 03:24:35,455
He's looking back to his ancient

3666
03:24:35,711 --> 03:24:36,479
Pass and ID

3667
03:24:36,991 --> 03:24:37,759
Seems to

3668
03:24:40,575 --> 03:24:42,111
And I said there's got to be a very weird

3669
03:24:42,367 --> 03:24:46,463
Feeling when you look back on something that is clearly from a long time ago

3670
03:24:47,487 --> 03:24:49,791
And some way looks bigger or better

3671
03:24:50,303 --> 03:24:55,167
Then what you currently have we don't have that experience right when we look back at the past looks primitive

3672
03:24:55,423 --> 03:24:57,471
Imagine coming from one of those time.

3673
03:24:57,727 --> 03:24:58,751
Maybe you're living in

3674
03:24:59,007 --> 03:25:04,639
5th Century Europe somewhere and you look at things that were built at the height of the Roman Empire you sit there and go

3675
03:25:05,151 --> 03:25:08,735
How did they build that and how sophisticated might they have been remembered

3676
03:25:08,991 --> 03:25:09,503
Human

3677
03:25:10,015 --> 03:25:11,551
Civilizational progress

3678
03:25:12,063 --> 03:25:13,599
Has only been straight up

3679
03:25:14,111 --> 03:25:19,231
For about the last five hundred or so years since the Renaissance before that time it was more like a stock market

3680
03:25:19,743 --> 03:25:23,327
And sometimes you had your high watermarks and sometimes you went down from your high

3681
03:25:24,607 --> 03:25:25,887
Xenophon Zera

3682
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:29,983
Is coming up to the highs of the very Heights of the previous era

3683
03:25:30,495 --> 03:25:35,359
It won't be long before they are building cities greater and grander than the one disintegrating around xenophon

3684
03:25:36,383 --> 03:25:37,407
But when he looks at it

3685
03:25:38,175 --> 03:25:39,455
He's looking at something that hasn't

3686
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:40,991
Quite been replicated

3687
03:25:41,247 --> 03:25:42,527
In the world he comes from

3688
03:25:44,063 --> 03:25:45,855
Going to be interesting feeling when do you think

3689
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:48,671
Right there will if something that great and Grand

3690
03:25:48,927 --> 03:25:49,439
Fall

3691
03:25:49,951 --> 03:25:50,975
It can happen to any of

3692
03:25:55,327 --> 03:25:56,607
Does NF on people

3693
03:25:57,631 --> 03:25:58,911
Shortly afterwards

3694
03:25:59,935 --> 03:26:01,727
To the kings of Persia 2

3695
03:26:03,519 --> 03:26:09,151
But once again after we lose xenophon in terms of you know his story about his Retreat from Persia ends

3696
03:26:09,919 --> 03:26:12,223
We don't hear a whole lot about artaxerxes II

3697
03:26:12,479 --> 03:26:15,039
But he rules for 46 years

3698
03:26:15,807 --> 03:26:19,391
Does that show you how the sources just kind of completely overshadow

3699
03:26:19,903 --> 03:26:23,487
The Reigns of these later qinghai rule 46 years and there's not much that

3700
03:26:23,743 --> 03:26:29,887
This one incident that happened over one year that one Greek writer wrote about his huge the rest of the guys rain

3701
03:26:30,143 --> 03:26:31,167
Practically unknown

3702
03:26:32,447 --> 03:26:34,495
He's supposed to have hundreds of wives

3703
03:26:36,031 --> 03:26:37,055
Under the kids

3704
03:26:38,335 --> 03:26:40,383
One of them will become the next king

3705
03:26:42,175 --> 03:26:46,527
In the year 425 BCE and this came traditionally is sort of

3706
03:26:46,783 --> 03:26:52,671
The one that takes an already bloody history of the Persian royal family and takes it off into Caligula Ville

3707
03:26:54,207 --> 03:26:56,511
He's known as artaxerxes the third

3708
03:26:58,559 --> 03:27:01,631
There are a lot of people have gotten the job to but one of the brothers have been

3709
03:27:01,887 --> 03:27:03,935
Murdered another one commits suicide another one

3710
03:27:04,191 --> 03:27:10,335
Executed and when artaxerxes the third comes to the throne he's taking no chances he starts killing most of the Royal Family

3711
03:27:12,127 --> 03:27:18,271
Have you say something like well he killed his brother that sounds terrible when you realize artaxerxes the third had more than a hundred and fifty Brothers probably

3712
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:22,111
You start to realize when wiping of the royal family might mean

3713
03:27:22,623 --> 03:27:23,391
When the

3714
03:27:23,647 --> 03:27:26,975
In a guy who sired you had 350 wives

3715
03:27:28,511 --> 03:27:29,023
MLS

3716
03:27:29,791 --> 03:27:31,327
Artaxerxes the Third

3717
03:27:31,583 --> 03:27:34,911
Comes to power at a time where Greek Warfare has changed

3718
03:27:36,703 --> 03:27:42,847
And once again it's very tempting to get down to the Tactical level and say that there are little teeny tweaks on the battlefield

3719
03:27:43,615 --> 03:27:46,431
It will end up involving themselves in contests

3720
03:27:46,687 --> 03:27:49,503
The end result of which will change the course of history

3721
03:27:51,807 --> 03:27:52,575
In this case

3722
03:27:53,343 --> 03:27:55,647
The Persians and the Greeks over the last

3723
03:27:56,415 --> 03:27:57,951
Century or so

3724
03:27:59,231 --> 03:28:01,023
Advantage to weaken each other greatly

3725
03:28:04,095 --> 03:28:09,215
The Persians have funded Athenians fighting Spartans fighting thebans in any strange combination

3726
03:28:10,751 --> 03:28:12,799
The year 371 and 1/2 in

3727
03:28:13,055 --> 03:28:14,079
Famous battle

3728
03:28:14,335 --> 03:28:15,359
Call leuctra

3729
03:28:16,127 --> 03:28:17,151
The thebans

3730
03:28:17,663 --> 03:28:20,223
Begin the process of demolishing

3731
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:21,759
Spartan military power

3732
03:28:22,527 --> 03:28:27,647
And within 10 years I'll have another one of these battles it doesn't and so many Spartans die Spartans never the same

3733
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:30,463
Many different

3734
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:32,255
Innovations in Greek

3735
03:28:32,511 --> 03:28:33,279
Warfare

3736
03:28:33,535 --> 03:28:37,631
Were displayed in these battles and it's often seen as a step towards

3737
03:28:38,143 --> 03:28:43,007
A higher level of military sophistication for the Greek states often tied to

3738
03:28:43,263 --> 03:28:47,871
Prolonged contact with sophisticated military fight the Persians writing rubs off on

3739
03:28:49,663 --> 03:28:52,223
The thebans especially our are different in Greece because

3740
03:28:52,735 --> 03:28:57,343
They are the one major Greek city-state that is always had cavalry

3741
03:28:57,599 --> 03:28:59,903
Good Cavalry tradition they come from Cavalry country

3742
03:29:01,951 --> 03:29:05,279
And they use this Cavalry in these battles against the Spartans in the use it well

3743
03:29:06,047 --> 03:29:08,095
They also incorporate some light troops

3744
03:29:08,351 --> 03:29:10,911
Interesting tactics to end something that's been

3745
03:29:11,167 --> 03:29:11,935
Growing

3746
03:29:12,191 --> 03:29:15,519
An important especially amongst Even Stevens it always kind of

3747
03:29:16,031 --> 03:29:17,823
Like to fight in Greater depth

3748
03:29:18,335 --> 03:29:20,639
Then the hoplites from other Greek city-states but

3749
03:29:20,895 --> 03:29:22,943
They just go to maximizing that

3750
03:29:23,455 --> 03:29:24,991
During the reign of their last couple of

3751
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:26,271
Military leaders

3752
03:29:27,039 --> 03:29:28,575
And at the Battle of leuctra

3753
03:29:29,087 --> 03:29:29,855
The

3754
03:29:30,623 --> 03:29:33,695
Even hoplites are fighting 50 ranks deep

3755
03:29:35,999 --> 03:29:38,815
And they smash into a

3756
03:29:39,583 --> 03:29:42,399
Formation of Spartan hoplites that is lined up

3757
03:29:42,911 --> 03:29:48,287
12-ranked Steve now if they had only recently gone to 12-ranked who used to be less than that

3758
03:29:48,543 --> 03:29:50,079
So you run a

3759
03:29:50,591 --> 03:29:51,871
Formation of

3760
03:29:52,639 --> 03:29:56,991
People a block of men that's 50 ranks deep into one that's 12 ranks deep

3761
03:29:57,759 --> 03:29:58,271
What happened

3762
03:29:59,807 --> 03:30:00,575
Not just that

3763
03:30:01,087 --> 03:30:05,695
But the thebans amongst other Greek city-states have begun to have

3764
03:30:05,951 --> 03:30:07,231
Professional military

3765
03:30:07,487 --> 03:30:12,351
That's Greek Warfare was always such an amateurish Affair and always was taught that way when I was younger

3766
03:30:13,119 --> 03:30:14,399
But it's now understood that

3767
03:30:14,655 --> 03:30:17,727
A lot of these city-states now I totally professional units

3768
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:23,871
That were maybe like the tip of the spear for the rest of their army which was still Farmers & artisans in those kind of people

3769
03:30:24,383 --> 03:30:27,711
In the case of the thebans they had one called The Sacred band

3770
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:29,503
300

3771
03:30:29,759 --> 03:30:31,551
Professional soldiers Maybe

3772
03:30:31,807 --> 03:30:35,135
May be homosexual lovers to that's always been thrown in there is something

3773
03:30:35,647 --> 03:30:36,415
Involved in the

3774
03:30:36,671 --> 03:30:37,439
Interesting

3775
03:30:37,695 --> 03:30:38,719
In a Greek city-state

3776
03:30:39,231 --> 03:30:40,255
Milieu

3777
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:41,791
MLS

3778
03:30:42,303 --> 03:30:48,447
The Spartans great advantage over the other Greeks and the Persians to all the time was that they were the only professional War

3779
03:30:48,703 --> 03:30:49,471
Lawyers in Greece

3780
03:30:49,983 --> 03:30:51,007
But not anymore

3781
03:30:52,543 --> 03:30:55,359
So some of the things that always made Spartans extra-special

3782
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:56,383
AR

3783
03:30:56,639 --> 03:30:58,431
Less unique by this time.

3784
03:30:58,943 --> 03:30:59,967
So you throw

3785
03:31:00,223 --> 03:31:03,295
A force led by 300 professional feed bins

3786
03:31:04,063 --> 03:31:05,599
Backed by a Phalanx that

3787
03:31:05,855 --> 03:31:11,999
50 Shields deep instead of going after the weak part of the Spartan line goes after the best Spartan troops and Crush

3788
03:31:12,255 --> 03:31:12,767
Is as

3789
03:31:13,023 --> 03:31:15,583
The theban general epaminondas says

3790
03:31:15,839 --> 03:31:17,375
Head of the serpent

3791
03:31:18,143 --> 03:31:19,423
And you ruin Sparta

3792
03:31:21,727 --> 03:31:23,007
There is somebody

3793
03:31:23,263 --> 03:31:24,287
Observing

3794
03:31:24,543 --> 03:31:26,847
Is military revolution in Greece

3795
03:31:27,103 --> 03:31:28,127
The hostage

3796
03:31:29,663 --> 03:31:30,687
Hostage from

3797
03:31:31,455 --> 03:31:35,295
Country that for a long time was Holding On by the skin of its teeth

3798
03:31:35,807 --> 03:31:38,623
To survival and sometimes not even that

3799
03:31:40,415 --> 03:31:41,183
His name

3800
03:31:41,951 --> 03:31:42,463
Was Philip

3801
03:31:43,999 --> 03:31:46,047
He will be the greatest military

3802
03:31:46,303 --> 03:31:50,911
Leader in the most dangerous man that your produces up until his life is over

3803
03:31:51,679 --> 03:31:52,703
He's learning

3804
03:31:53,471 --> 03:31:55,263
How to fight in the new style

3805
03:31:56,031 --> 03:31:59,615
By watching the thebans do it while he's a hostage and feed

3806
03:32:00,895 --> 03:32:05,503
Well then go back to his own country and based on a lot of what he learned while observing

3807
03:32:05,759 --> 03:32:07,551
Even military innovations

3808
03:32:08,063 --> 03:32:08,575
Build

3809
03:32:08,831 --> 03:32:09,599
The most

3810
03:32:09,855 --> 03:32:12,159
Military the world has ever seen

3811
03:32:14,975 --> 03:32:16,255
The Army did Philip bill

3812
03:32:18,047 --> 03:32:19,327
Was one that took

3813
03:32:19,583 --> 03:32:21,631
All sorts of influences from

3814
03:32:22,143 --> 03:32:22,655
Athens

3815
03:32:22,911 --> 03:32:23,423
Themes

3816
03:32:24,191 --> 03:32:26,751
And took makedonia is natural strength

3817
03:32:27,007 --> 03:32:27,519
And combined

3818
03:32:29,055 --> 03:32:30,335
Makedonia has great

3819
03:32:30,847 --> 03:32:31,871
Feudal cab

3820
03:32:32,127 --> 03:32:33,151
Aristocratic cow

3821
03:32:34,431 --> 03:32:37,759
Think of them nights and maybe that's not too far wrong

3822
03:32:39,807 --> 03:32:45,695
The Greek sources portray though makedonian infantry is being like a barbarian rabble before Philip

3823
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:49,023
Philip turns them into the kind of soldiery

3824
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:50,303
He would have seen it feed

3825
03:32:50,559 --> 03:32:51,583
People who stood

3826
03:32:52,351 --> 03:32:58,495
Shoulder to shoulder carrying very long Spears and Phillip lengthen them quite a bit since I've had the longest Spears anywhere

3827
03:32:59,519 --> 03:33:01,055
And he made their formation

3828
03:33:01,311 --> 03:33:02,591
16 ranks deep

3829
03:33:04,127 --> 03:33:06,431
Created an entirely new troop type

3830
03:33:06,943 --> 03:33:09,503
Information on the battlefield the phalange

3831
03:33:11,551 --> 03:33:13,343
With this form in his battle line

3832
03:33:13,599 --> 03:33:19,743
Use the Cavalry on the wings of a strike force Incorporated archers and light troops with it to make it flexible

3833
03:33:20,255 --> 03:33:26,143
He drilled them relentlessly and he used them almost every year of his reign

3834
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:27,423
To fight somebody

3835
03:33:29,215 --> 03:33:33,567
It was an amazingly clever treacherous interesting fantastic guy

3836
03:33:33,823 --> 03:33:39,199
Did the old histories always portray as a drunken Barbarian who like boys but like women better

3837
03:33:40,735 --> 03:33:44,575
A kind of greekish biking character if you will

3838
03:33:45,343 --> 03:33:50,463
And by the time he's in his mid-forties the physical effects of his lifestyle

3839
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:52,255
Are apparent

3840
03:33:53,791 --> 03:33:55,071
He lost an eye

3841
03:33:56,095 --> 03:33:57,887
He's broken collarbones

3842
03:33:58,399 --> 03:34:01,727
He may be fractured his hands and they maybe didn't grow back right that's not

3843
03:34:01,983 --> 03:34:02,751
For sure

3844
03:34:03,519 --> 03:34:06,335
And his leg is dragging behind him

3845
03:34:06,847 --> 03:34:08,127
The result to be there being

3846
03:34:08,383 --> 03:34:09,151
Speared

3847
03:34:09,407 --> 03:34:13,503
Behind the knee maybe we're having it crushed by a barbarian Club

3848
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:16,319
But Phillips

3849
03:34:16,831 --> 03:34:19,135
Physicality on the battlefield

3850
03:34:19,903 --> 03:34:24,255
You know which clearly represented in his body the makedonian had a sort of a homeric

3851
03:34:24,511 --> 03:34:25,791
Kind of ethos that

3852
03:34:26,303 --> 03:34:30,911
The southern Greeks and kind of outgrown by this time there are more like Achilles and

3853
03:34:31,167 --> 03:34:33,983
Homer's Heroes ancient Greeks down south of

3854
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:36,031
Become much more cultured

3855
03:34:36,287 --> 03:34:38,079
And philosophical and

3856
03:34:38,847 --> 03:34:40,639
In a sense you know if you want to get back

3857
03:34:40,895 --> 03:34:44,479
That idea of the silk slipper and the wooden shoes life cycle thing

3858
03:34:44,991 --> 03:34:46,015
Now it's the Greek

3859
03:34:47,039 --> 03:34:53,183
Interrupted by softness and luxury in the contact with the Persians all this time didn't help in now

3860
03:34:53,439 --> 03:34:55,487
Now the people with the wooden shoes

3861
03:34:55,743 --> 03:35:00,607
Are the ones who have some of the Barbarian virtues of strength and ruthlessness and

3862
03:35:01,375 --> 03:35:02,143
Well that's

3863
03:35:03,423 --> 03:35:04,959
The makedonian maybe so

3864
03:35:05,471 --> 03:35:10,591
From the old history and silk slipper syndrome approach the makedonian they're just the next in line

3865
03:35:13,407 --> 03:35:16,735
Florida modern history portrayed Philip as a much more culture

3866
03:35:18,015 --> 03:35:20,831
You have often portrayed the Dynamics of the makedonian

3867
03:35:21,087 --> 03:35:24,159
Royal family is a kin to a mafia crime family

3868
03:35:24,415 --> 03:35:26,975
Without a lot of alcohol and some homosexuality

3869
03:35:27,999 --> 03:35:29,279
But you also have to add

3870
03:35:30,047 --> 03:35:30,559
Aristotle

3871
03:35:31,583 --> 03:35:32,351
When people like that

3872
03:35:34,399 --> 03:35:34,911
Philip was

3873
03:35:35,167 --> 03:35:36,191
Absolutely

3874
03:35:36,447 --> 03:35:40,799
Committed it seems to upgrading the culture level of his court and when

3875
03:35:41,055 --> 03:35:45,663
Greek contemporaries met him they talked about a person who was thoroughly Grease

3876
03:35:46,175 --> 03:35:47,455
A great speaker

3877
03:35:47,711 --> 03:35:49,759
And charming and clever and

3878
03:35:50,527 --> 03:35:52,063
Fascinating individual in

3879
03:35:52,575 --> 03:35:54,879
Yeah it would be hard to imagine

3880
03:35:55,135 --> 03:35:57,439
Makedonia going from nothing

3881
03:35:57,695 --> 03:35:58,719
Two great powers

3882
03:35:59,231 --> 03:35:59,743
Without him

3883
03:36:01,791 --> 03:36:03,071
At the Battle of chaeronea

3884
03:36:03,839 --> 03:36:04,607
He will defeat

3885
03:36:04,863 --> 03:36:05,375
Utterly

3886
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:10,751
A an alliance of thebans and Athenians to as the old saying goes

3887
03:36:11,775 --> 03:36:14,335
And the independence of the Greek city-states

3888
03:36:15,615 --> 03:36:17,151
His son Alexander

3889
03:36:17,407 --> 03:36:22,271
Leading the cavalry charge that destroys the theban sacred band to a man

3890
03:36:24,575 --> 03:36:25,855
Anyone famous story

3891
03:36:26,623 --> 03:36:29,183
After one of these battles Philip is portrayed as

3892
03:36:29,951 --> 03:36:34,047
Limping around the battlefield amongst the Goron Corpses

3893
03:36:34,303 --> 03:36:35,327
Drunkenly

3894
03:36:36,607 --> 03:36:42,751
Perhaps making fun of the nickname that they gave him down in the south of cultured so flipper regions of Greece now

3895
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:43,775
Were they called

3896
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:45,311
The Barbarian

3897
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:53,503
You may ask where the Spartans are during this time. Now that Philip has essentially conquered although he put grease into a

3898
03:36:53,759 --> 03:36:55,807
Made it look like we were all here

3899
03:36:56,319 --> 03:36:58,879
Cuz we want to be and I'm going to call it the Warsaw Pact

3900
03:36:59,135 --> 03:37:00,159
To mean something like that

3901
03:37:01,695 --> 03:37:02,463
Sparta was like

3902
03:37:03,743 --> 03:37:06,047
I'm one of the best stories of the Spartans

3903
03:37:06,815 --> 03:37:07,839
I may have mentioned this earlier

3904
03:37:08,863 --> 03:37:09,887
Comes out of the

3905
03:37:10,655 --> 03:37:13,983
Note that supposedly Phillips ends to the smart

3906
03:37:15,263 --> 03:37:17,823
And this by the way has been told multiple ways and translated

3907
03:37:19,103 --> 03:37:20,895
But the general gist of it is quote

3908
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:24,991
You are advised to submit without further delay

3909
03:37:25,503 --> 03:37:31,647
If I bring my Army on your land I will destroy your Farms slay your people and raise your

3910
03:37:35,231 --> 03:37:37,535
Any reply from Sparta

3911
03:37:37,791 --> 03:37:38,559
Just said

3912
03:37:39,327 --> 03:37:39,839
If

3913
03:37:43,167 --> 03:37:43,679
Well

3914
03:37:43,935 --> 03:37:50,079
Most historians I read seem to think it wouldn't even be much of a contest between makedonija this. And Sparta

3915
03:37:50,591 --> 03:37:55,967
Sparta is way past your Prime and makedonia has way more people in that larger

3916
03:37:56,223 --> 03:37:57,759
Economic base in everything

3917
03:37:58,527 --> 03:38:02,111
But the makedonian kept their hands off Smart. For what it's worth

3918
03:38:04,671 --> 03:38:06,463
All this time it seems clear

3919
03:38:07,231 --> 03:38:09,023
As Philip consolidates briefs

3920
03:38:09,535 --> 03:38:11,071
These planning on invading

3921
03:38:11,327 --> 03:38:11,839
Persia

3922
03:38:13,119 --> 03:38:16,959
Philip has a wonderful seeds train he's great at taking cities

3923
03:38:17,215 --> 03:38:19,519
He's got good Logistics he's learned

3924
03:38:19,775 --> 03:38:21,311
Very well how to fight

3925
03:38:23,359 --> 03:38:29,503
And keep armies in the field for long periods of time he doesn't have a bunch of amateur farmers in his army he has a professional military for

3926
03:38:29,759 --> 03:38:31,039
For that he can keep in the field

3927
03:38:31,551 --> 03:38:34,367
He's taking over gold mines he's got tons of money

3928
03:38:36,671 --> 03:38:39,487
If Persia really was that rickety old house that

3929
03:38:40,255 --> 03:38:43,839
Some Greeks at the time and some historians afterwards kind of portrayed as

3930
03:38:44,863 --> 03:38:46,911
All of a sudden something comes along

3931
03:38:48,191 --> 03:38:48,959
They can blow it down

3932
03:38:52,031 --> 03:38:54,335
But a year 336 BCE

3933
03:38:55,359 --> 03:38:57,919
Philip has established a Bridgehead

3934
03:38:58,175 --> 03:38:58,687
On

3935
03:38:58,943 --> 03:39:02,271
Asian soil just over the Bosphorus the hellespont

3936
03:39:02,783 --> 03:39:06,111
Get an army of 10,000 men there on her makedonian General

3937
03:39:06,623 --> 03:39:07,903
The stage is set

3938
03:39:09,439 --> 03:39:13,023
And then while walking into an arena

3939
03:39:14,559 --> 03:39:15,327
Along the

3940
03:39:15,583 --> 03:39:16,607
Column showing

3941
03:39:16,863 --> 03:39:21,727
The Greek gods including a statue of himself amongst them supposedly

3942
03:39:23,007 --> 03:39:25,567
Walking without his normal bodyguard

3943
03:39:26,079 --> 03:39:30,687
To show as a propaganda tool supposedly this is all the tradition

3944
03:39:30,943 --> 03:39:31,967
The other Greeks that

3945
03:39:32,223 --> 03:39:33,247
He is a

3946
03:39:33,503 --> 03:39:34,527
Ruler of Greece

3947
03:39:35,295 --> 03:39:36,063
You know by

3948
03:39:36,319 --> 03:39:39,135
Consensus if he's a benevolent guy he's not some

3949
03:39:39,391 --> 03:39:40,159
Heavy-handed

3950
03:39:40,415 --> 03:39:42,207
Tyrant that maintains his

3951
03:39:42,463 --> 03:39:45,535
Control by military force I don't need bodyguards I'm loved

3952
03:39:46,047 --> 03:39:47,839
And he walks out there alone

3953
03:39:48,351 --> 03:39:50,655
Philip

3954
03:39:51,679 --> 03:39:53,727
With his terrible leg limping

3955
03:39:55,519 --> 03:39:59,359
Garland around his head supposedly a crowd cheering

3956
03:39:59,615 --> 03:40:04,479
Alexander the Great in attendance with his wonderful mother olympius who

3957
03:40:04,735 --> 03:40:06,527
Peter husband supposedly

3958
03:40:08,319 --> 03:40:11,903
And someone from The Bodyguard runs up to the king

3959
03:40:12,415 --> 03:40:13,695
And slammed in my

3960
03:40:14,719 --> 03:40:15,231
Abs

3961
03:40:17,279 --> 03:40:19,327
The assassination is like a

3962
03:40:19,583 --> 03:40:23,423
Kennedy assassination in this time. Who done it and why

3963
03:40:25,215 --> 03:40:28,799
The Assassin runs autism waiting horses but it killed

3964
03:40:29,055 --> 03:40:31,871
By other members of The Bodyguard before you can get there

3965
03:40:33,663 --> 03:40:39,039
Alexander the Great's mother supposedly there's a lot of slander that goes on history so take this with a grain of salt

3966
03:40:39,551 --> 03:40:40,063
Puts

3967
03:40:41,087 --> 03:40:45,951
Emotional remembrances on the Assassins Graves of people have always wondered about Alexander

3968
03:40:46,463 --> 03:40:48,511
Because that's who gets the job next

3969
03:40:49,023 --> 03:40:52,607
So if we go back to our game of Clue from the earlier part of the story

3970
03:40:52,863 --> 03:40:55,935
Alexander's the guy you really benefits from this assassination

3971
03:40:56,447 --> 03:40:57,215
But think about it

3972
03:40:58,495 --> 03:40:59,519
So do the Persian

3973
03:41:00,799 --> 03:41:05,407
A little Persian gold in the right pocket to get rid of an extraordinary man

3974
03:41:06,687 --> 03:41:11,551
Especially after that extraordinary man has just landed 10,000 man on your coastline

3975
03:41:13,087 --> 03:41:15,647
Who knows who killed Philip II but if you're

3976
03:41:16,159 --> 03:41:21,791
One of the higher-ups in Persia you probably have to go give an extra large sacrifice

3977
03:41:22,303 --> 03:41:23,583
At the religious Temple

3978
03:41:24,095 --> 03:41:26,911
Cuz things just seem to have turned out your way

3979
03:41:30,239 --> 03:41:36,127
Alexandra supposed to have fought the Persians behind his father's murder but if it was the case that they were

3980
03:41:36,895 --> 03:41:42,783
Kind of looks like a good move if you're looking at this like you're playing some sort of a strategy game right if you're confronted with

3981
03:41:43,295 --> 03:41:45,343
An extraordinary individual

3982
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:48,671
Enter causing you a ton of problems what's the easiest way to fix that problem

3983
03:41:49,695 --> 03:41:51,999
Maybe just get rid of the extraordinary individual

3984
03:41:53,279 --> 03:41:54,559
How many times in history that have

3985
03:41:55,583 --> 03:42:01,727
And not just amongst these warlord types of made a lot of enemies and you'd expect them to have people willing to stick a knife in their ribs

3986
03:42:02,239 --> 03:42:03,519
But even amongst people

3987
03:42:04,031 --> 03:42:05,823
At the other end of the violence Spectrum

3988
03:42:06,335 --> 03:42:09,407
Look at Martin Luther King or Gandhi both of whom were assassinated

3989
03:42:10,687 --> 03:42:11,711
Both extraordinary

3990
03:42:11,967 --> 03:42:12,479
People

3991
03:42:12,735 --> 03:42:13,503
And both

3992
03:42:14,271 --> 03:42:16,319
Huge D stabilizers

3993
03:42:16,575 --> 03:42:21,695
They caused a lot of people a lot of problems and if you're an ordinary person sometimes dealing with Extraordinary People difficult

3994
03:42:22,463 --> 03:42:23,743
But you can always get rid of them

3995
03:42:26,559 --> 03:42:32,703
Of course you're playing the odds aren't you when you do that the ideas how often do you get extraordinary individuals if I get rid of

3996
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:35,007
Did Philip II is extraordinary European

3997
03:42:35,519 --> 03:42:36,287
Certainly

3998
03:42:36,543 --> 03:42:38,079
I will end up with someone

3999
03:42:38,335 --> 03:42:39,615
Not as good as he is

4000
03:42:42,431 --> 03:42:46,527
I'm at the Persians were behind the assassination it would only mirror

4001
03:42:47,039 --> 03:42:52,415
What Persian saw happening in their own royal family in assassinations

4002
03:42:52,671 --> 03:42:54,207
Always a possibility

4003
03:42:54,463 --> 03:42:55,743
Really took Center Stage

4004
03:42:57,023 --> 03:43:01,887
The famous Harem intrigues is we said I mean artaxerxes the third the Contemporary of Philip

4005
03:43:02,143 --> 03:43:05,983
This guy we mentioned earlier was the one who supposedly took the Royal Family

4006
03:43:06,495 --> 03:43:08,799
Caligula bill is real

4007
03:43:09,311 --> 03:43:10,591
Nasty ruler

4008
03:43:10,847 --> 03:43:14,431
He's going to meet his in the same way Philip. She's got to be stabbed

4009
03:43:14,943 --> 03:43:19,039
He's famously going to be poisoned by one of the great poisoners of the ancient world

4010
03:43:20,319 --> 03:43:21,343
Now there are some

4011
03:43:22,111 --> 03:43:24,927
Cuneiform tablets that seem to suggest that

4012
03:43:25,183 --> 03:43:30,815
Artaxerxes the third may have died a natural death and Lord knows he was supposedly in his mid-eighties so that's not out of

4013
03:43:31,071 --> 03:43:31,583
The question

4014
03:43:32,863 --> 03:43:36,447
But the ancient sources place his death at the hands of his vizier

4015
03:43:36,703 --> 03:43:38,495
Where is counselor may be his General

4016
03:43:38,751 --> 03:43:40,543
The Greeks always call them eunuchs

4017
03:43:41,567 --> 03:43:44,127
Whether they were or not castrated is unknown

4018
03:43:44,895 --> 03:43:46,431
This guy's name is Pago us

4019
03:43:47,199 --> 03:43:47,967
He's famous

4020
03:43:50,015 --> 03:43:55,135
The king that he poisoned supposedly is this one that we were talking about earlier

4021
03:43:55,647 --> 03:44:01,791
That is vicious enough so you think of him almost like an Assyrian King rather than a more tolerant lenient Persian king but

4022
03:44:02,047 --> 03:44:04,095
When you look at his accomplishments he looks like

4023
03:44:04,863 --> 03:44:05,887
The restorer

4024
03:44:06,143 --> 03:44:06,911
Of the Persian Empire

4025
03:44:08,191 --> 03:44:11,519
Long and absolutely are Jewish career

4026
03:44:12,031 --> 03:44:18,175
He is smashing revolts reconquering lost territory and however rickety it may be internally on pay

4027
03:44:18,431 --> 03:44:20,735
By the time this guy dies

4028
03:44:20,991 --> 03:44:22,783
He is restored Persia

4029
03:44:23,295 --> 03:44:27,135
To somewhat of its former luster at least if you look at a map

4030
03:44:29,183 --> 03:44:31,999
It's a remarkable achievement this late in the game

4031
03:44:33,023 --> 03:44:34,815
It's like an athlete decided they're going to

4032
03:44:35,071 --> 03:44:41,215
Compete in the Olympics like they did when they were 20 when they're 50 and they get into great shape and look pretty good they just

4033
03:44:41,471 --> 03:44:42,495
Hopefully it's not too hot

4034
03:44:44,031 --> 03:44:49,151
But the fun for me if you're a fan of Persia's I am is throughout this time. You're setting up an encounter

4035
03:44:49,663 --> 03:44:53,759
Encounter between two extraordinary men Philip II in makedonia

4036
03:44:54,015 --> 03:44:55,039
About to lead

4037
03:44:55,295 --> 03:44:58,111
The Greek invasion of Persia probably

4038
03:44:58,879 --> 03:44:59,647
Certainly after

4039
03:45:00,415 --> 03:45:04,767
Artaxerxes the third die but maybe even before and artaxerxes the third

4040
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:07,583
Obviously competent as hell

4041
03:45:07,839 --> 03:45:08,607
Going to resist him

4042
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:12,191
For the heavyweight championship of the ancient world right

4043
03:45:12,959 --> 03:45:18,847
Who will win the representatives or the representatives of the merely very old world

4044
03:45:19,871 --> 03:45:21,407
And then assassination

4045
03:45:22,687 --> 03:45:26,015
Removed both of these extraordinary men within two years of each other

4046
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:30,879
And the problem if you're looking at this as a giant championship match

4047
03:45:31,391 --> 03:45:31,903
Is it

4048
03:45:32,159 --> 03:45:34,975
We get the standings for both the people we just lost

4049
03:45:36,255 --> 03:45:37,279
In one corner

4050
03:45:37,791 --> 03:45:41,119
We have a guy named Darius the Third

4051
03:45:41,375 --> 03:45:42,911
Person that the poisoner

4052
03:45:43,167 --> 03:45:45,983
Bagelicious after killing a lot of other people and having a little

4053
03:45:46,239 --> 03:45:47,775
Two-year puppet King

4054
03:45:48,031 --> 03:45:50,079
In the interim puts on the throne

4055
03:45:50,591 --> 03:45:54,943
Maybe mediocre maybe worse than mediocre in terms of replacement

4056
03:45:55,199 --> 03:45:57,759
In the other Corner replacing Philip II

4057
03:45:59,295 --> 03:46:00,575
Alexander the Great

4058
03:46:03,135 --> 03:46:07,743
This is a show about the Persian Empire but Alexander the Great as the instrument of its death

4059
03:46:09,279 --> 03:46:13,631
There are some Modern historians would like to think of Alexander is really the last king of Persia

4060
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:17,471
He's the guy who will eventually burn down

4061
03:46:17,727 --> 03:46:19,263
The Royal Palace

4062
03:46:20,031 --> 03:46:20,799
Tumi

4063
03:46:21,311 --> 03:46:22,079
That's where it ends

4064
03:46:22,335 --> 03:46:23,871
It's about Alexander the guy who landed

4065
03:46:25,151 --> 03:46:30,015
He's a historical arsonist in my book and then that's a term I use for these people who come

4066
03:46:30,271 --> 03:46:31,807
In the history periodically

4067
03:46:32,063 --> 03:46:37,951
And soda burn down the Deadwood of an old world so a new one can crop up it's a very simplistic historical approach

4068
03:46:38,207 --> 03:46:39,487
You see these people all through history

4069
03:46:40,767 --> 03:46:42,559
Alexander's the prototypical example

4070
03:46:43,839 --> 03:46:49,983
It's almost like they do what they have to do know they play their role on the on the historical World stage and then they die once they are

4071
03:46:50,239 --> 03:46:51,007
Job is over

4072
03:46:51,775 --> 03:46:56,383
And Alexander falls into one of two categories historical Arsenal seem to fall into

4073
03:46:56,639 --> 03:46:58,431
There's the self-made man

4074
03:46:58,687 --> 03:47:00,223
Guys like djingis Khan

4075
03:47:00,735 --> 03:47:01,247
Cool

4076
03:47:01,503 --> 03:47:04,831
Create the instrument first and then go out and kill people with it

4077
03:47:05,599 --> 03:47:07,391
That's what Alexander the Great's father Philip

4078
03:47:08,159 --> 03:47:13,023
Right he was sort of a historical arsonist in his own way especially if he'd been allowed to continue his career

4079
03:47:13,279 --> 03:47:14,303
A self-made guy

4080
03:47:16,351 --> 03:47:19,423
Alexander the Great Falls into the other category historical arsonist

4081
03:47:19,935 --> 03:47:21,983
Similar to a guy like Frederick the Great

4082
03:47:22,239 --> 03:47:23,519
Where he's born

4083
03:47:23,775 --> 03:47:26,847
And the father has sort of set the historical table for him

4084
03:47:27,615 --> 03:47:28,639
Built the instrument

4085
03:47:29,151 --> 03:47:31,455
To go conquer the world with right

4086
03:47:31,711 --> 03:47:36,319
Created the weapon and then hands it to the son who doesn't have to spend years of his life

4087
03:47:36,575 --> 03:47:37,855
Creating the conditions

4088
03:47:38,111 --> 03:47:40,415
Raise brightness he can just go out and hit the ground running

4089
03:47:42,719 --> 03:47:48,863
It would be tempting to suggest that Alexander had it made in anybody would have been able to do what he did give

4090
03:47:49,119 --> 03:47:50,911
He inherited but here's the thing

4091
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:58,847
Think about the uniqueness to this guy for so understand he probably the most propagandized figure in the ancient world

4092
03:47:59,103 --> 03:48:01,663
Especially if you remove religious figures from the equation

4093
03:48:03,199 --> 03:48:06,527
Is the Elvis Presley of ancient history he's the king

4094
03:48:06,783 --> 03:48:08,063
There is so much

4095
03:48:08,319 --> 03:48:13,695
Stop built around him I mean as one historian says the jungle of Alexander myth out there

4096
03:48:13,951 --> 03:48:14,975
Has been going forever

4097
03:48:17,279 --> 03:48:21,375
We have all the same problems with him that we have with the Persian sources but add to that

4098
03:48:21,631 --> 03:48:23,679
Immense propagandizing

4099
03:48:24,191 --> 03:48:28,287
And cult-like hero-worship there are even historians who suggested Alexander's

4100
03:48:28,799 --> 03:48:33,663
Life story in the sources have been purged and called and clipped over the years

4101
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:35,967
To maintain sort of an image

4102
03:48:37,247 --> 03:48:42,111
For all sorts of domestic purposes of the time in a little stalinist a little North Korea like

4103
03:48:44,415 --> 03:48:47,999
The point is getting to the real guy here is next to Impossible

4104
03:48:50,047 --> 03:48:52,351
There were at least 20

4105
03:48:52,863 --> 03:48:54,399
Contemporary accounts of

4106
03:48:54,655 --> 03:48:56,191
Alexander stuff written

4107
03:48:56,703 --> 03:48:58,495
Including stuff from his generals

4108
03:48:59,007 --> 03:49:00,031
All that stuff is gone

4109
03:49:00,543 --> 03:49:03,359
Warwick Mall in the in absolutely shattering

4110
03:49:03,615 --> 03:49:09,247
Sentence point out that the only actual contemporary thing that exist from Alexander time talking about Alexander

4111
03:49:10,015 --> 03:49:13,087
Is a one-sentence dedication on a temple

4112
03:49:14,111 --> 03:49:15,391
Everything else is derivative

4113
03:49:15,903 --> 03:49:20,511
Which is typical French and history but it does blow your mind when you think of how much stuff there was at one time

4114
03:49:22,303 --> 03:49:28,447
Normal after a few things you can say about this guy their mind blowing right away he's not just the son of the most interesting man in your

4115
03:49:28,703 --> 03:49:32,799
European history probably up until this point certainly the most powerful geopolitical figure

4116
03:49:33,311 --> 03:49:35,615
He's also the son of the most interesting female

4117
03:49:36,895 --> 03:49:42,271
Is Mother's fascinating and once again like all women in ancient history she get the combination of rooked

4118
03:49:43,807 --> 03:49:44,831
Propagandized

4119
03:49:45,343 --> 03:49:48,415
Who knows the truth about this woman the rumors are

4120
03:49:48,927 --> 03:49:55,071
She's a Malaysian which who sleeps with snakes and is an acolyte of Dionysus the god of wine

4121
03:49:56,607 --> 03:49:57,887
She comes from

4122
03:49:58,143 --> 03:50:04,287
A people that the macedonians with the Greeks think are barbarians the makedonian think these people are Barb

4123
03:50:06,591 --> 03:50:12,735
The melodians were a powerful tribe that lived in the Wilds of the ancient Kingdom of the Pirus

4124
03:50:13,247 --> 03:50:14,271
Located south of

4125
03:50:14,527 --> 03:50:15,039
The modern day

4126
03:50:15,295 --> 03:50:16,319
Country of Albania

4127
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:18,111
For what it's worth

4128
03:50:20,159 --> 03:50:21,951
What you can say about her though

4129
03:50:22,463 --> 03:50:25,279
Is this is a woman who is so formidable

4130
03:50:26,047 --> 03:50:31,423
That the greatest figure in European geopolitical history Philip II could not handle her

4131
03:50:32,703 --> 03:50:35,519
Not only that apparently he couldn't just kill her either

4132
03:50:37,311 --> 03:50:40,639
She also proved after Philip was gone

4133
03:50:41,151 --> 03:50:47,295
The Phillips generals and Alexander's generals after Alexander couldn't maneuver

4134
03:50:47,807 --> 03:50:48,831
Murder dumb

4135
03:50:49,087 --> 03:50:53,695
Killed people that got in her way I mean protected the interest of her son she was

4136
03:50:53,951 --> 03:51:00,095
Formidable as hell think of the DNA in the sky Park greatest man in European GOP

4137
03:51:00,351 --> 03:51:01,119
Political history

4138
03:51:01,375 --> 03:51:07,519
With one part most impressive female in European history the malossi in which snake loving follower of Dionysus

4139
03:51:09,311 --> 03:51:09,823
Have that

4140
03:51:10,079 --> 03:51:12,895
DNA Diamond Polished by

4141
03:51:13,151 --> 03:51:16,479
The greatest Shooters of the age including Aristotle

4142
03:51:18,015 --> 03:51:18,783
SEPTA

4143
03:51:19,039 --> 03:51:21,343
Template design for the guy's life

4144
03:51:22,111 --> 03:51:25,183
As one crib from Homer and The Iliad

4145
03:51:25,439 --> 03:51:30,815
Aristotle supposedly annotated copy for Alexander who slept with it under his pillow while on campaign

4146
03:51:32,351 --> 03:51:38,495
Teach him that he is the descendant of legendary gods and heroes on both sides of his family

4147
03:51:38,751 --> 03:51:40,543
Achilles on his mom's side

4148
03:51:41,055 --> 03:51:42,847
Heracles and Zeus on his dad's

4149
03:51:44,127 --> 03:51:45,407
And then hand him

4150
03:51:45,663 --> 03:51:46,431
The keys

4151
03:51:47,199 --> 03:51:51,039
Did the ancient world's equivalent of the 1940s German

4152
03:51:53,599 --> 03:51:55,391
And he's 20 years old

4153
03:51:57,183 --> 03:51:58,207
I keep reminding myself

4154
03:51:58,463 --> 03:52:03,583
Even though the world has changed a lot in 20 years old then might have been the new 30 if you will

4155
03:52:04,351 --> 03:52:09,727
You're still 20 years old I know guys who are afraid of given a 20 year old son's the keys to the sports car

4156
03:52:10,239 --> 03:52:11,519
Because of what they might do

4157
03:52:12,287 --> 03:52:13,311
Alexander has the

4158
03:52:14,079 --> 03:52:17,151
Most dangerous military in the world

4159
03:52:18,431 --> 03:52:19,711
Gassed up and ready to go

4160
03:52:22,271 --> 03:52:25,855
Earlier in the story we said that from the Greek point of view

4161
03:52:26,111 --> 03:52:28,159
Darius the great and Xerxes are

4162
03:52:28,415 --> 03:52:31,743
Invading Greece that they play the role of Darth Vader

4163
03:52:31,999 --> 03:52:32,511
To the Greeks

4164
03:52:34,047 --> 03:52:36,351
Open the Persian point of view this story

4165
03:52:36,863 --> 03:52:39,167
Darth Vader is played by Alexander the Great

4166
03:52:40,447 --> 03:52:42,495
Torries warwick mall suggest

4167
03:52:42,751 --> 03:52:45,311
The Iranian people thought of him

4168
03:52:46,079 --> 03:52:46,591
The demon

4169
03:52:50,175 --> 03:52:51,711
There are a lot of Greeks that would

4170
03:52:52,223 --> 03:52:53,759
Agree with that characterization

4171
03:52:55,295 --> 03:52:59,903
Alexander the Great takes over from his father a bunch of Greek city-states decided to good time to Rebelle

4172
03:53:00,159 --> 03:53:00,671
After all

4173
03:53:00,927 --> 03:53:02,975
What are the odds of this 20 year old kid

4174
03:53:03,487 --> 03:53:06,559
It's going to be able to do to wasps what is extraordinary father did

4175
03:53:07,327 --> 03:53:09,119
The answer turned out to be pretty darn good

4176
03:53:10,399 --> 03:53:12,447
Alexander spends the initial part of his

4177
03:53:13,471 --> 03:53:16,287
Randy first year-and-a-half two years or what have you

4178
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:19,615
Proving the people that he is a chip off the old block

4179
03:53:19,871 --> 03:53:22,431
He can use this Army as well as the old man could

4180
03:53:22,687 --> 03:53:28,575
And in addition to pounding a bunch of Barbarian tribes that decide to get uppity on his border she destroys thieves

4181
03:53:30,111 --> 03:53:31,647
And it is so brutal

4182
03:53:32,159 --> 03:53:38,303
I've read several historian to say what Alexander did the thieves was worse than anything the Persians did the Greek cities when they were occupied

4183
03:53:38,559 --> 03:53:40,607
Pine grease 150 + years before

4184
03:53:42,143 --> 03:53:45,471
But it sends the message in Greece is once again cowed

4185
03:53:45,983 --> 03:53:50,079
And as we said earlier you know they're a little like the Warsaw Pact in this deal

4186
03:53:50,335 --> 03:53:55,711
They get to go fight this war against Persia they get to provide troops whether or not they want to

4187
03:53:56,735 --> 03:53:58,527
There's a lot of Doubt as to how

4188
03:53:58,783 --> 03:54:03,391
Excited these Greek forces that will accompany Alexander on his Crusade r

4189
03:54:04,415 --> 03:54:06,463
Have a couple has the right to think they might have been

4190
03:54:06,975 --> 03:54:10,047
Little more than glorified hostages to keep their people

4191
03:54:10,559 --> 03:54:16,191
Down on the farm while Alexander in the main Army argon adult rebelled against me I have 15000 of your citizens

4192
03:54:17,215 --> 03:54:17,983
Something like that

4193
03:54:20,031 --> 03:54:22,591
In 334 BCE Alexander

4194
03:54:23,359 --> 03:54:24,127
Crosses from

4195
03:54:24,383 --> 03:54:26,687
Europe to Asia it's a big deal at the time

4196
03:54:27,967 --> 03:54:29,247
He brings were told

4197
03:54:30,015 --> 03:54:33,599
Historians and geographers and all kinds of people with him

4198
03:54:35,135 --> 03:54:36,415
People to Chronicle

4199
03:54:36,671 --> 03:54:41,535
Is advanced modern press Corps and propaganda course the way it's often portrayed

4200
03:54:42,047 --> 03:54:44,095
Screwed up the sources ever sent to me

4201
03:54:44,607 --> 03:54:45,631
It's hard enough to Divine

4202
03:54:46,143 --> 03:54:51,007
Fact from fiction in history without having people that are deliberately trying to pull the wool over your eyes for

4203
03:54:52,031 --> 03:54:53,823
No short-term military effect

4204
03:54:55,103 --> 03:54:57,407
Aunt alexandra was fantastic

4205
03:54:59,199 --> 03:55:05,343
Promise you can't tell when you're reading something that's propaganda in something that's true just like all this other source trouble we have Alexander

4206
03:55:05,599 --> 03:55:06,111
Used to have

4207
03:55:07,135 --> 03:55:11,743
From the water as he crossed from Europe to Asia that short little span

4208
03:55:11,999 --> 03:55:13,023
Of liquid

4209
03:55:13,279 --> 03:55:14,303
Throwing a spear

4210
03:55:14,559 --> 03:55:15,583
Off of his boat

4211
03:55:16,095 --> 03:55:17,375
Landing on the beach

4212
03:55:17,631 --> 03:55:19,935
Claiming all of Asia by right of Conquest

4213
03:55:22,751 --> 03:55:24,543
Stream Peter Breon says that

4214
03:55:24,799 --> 03:55:26,335
But this is a novel position

4215
03:55:26,847 --> 03:55:28,895
The Persian leadership to find themselves in

4216
03:55:30,175 --> 03:55:34,271
Because while Persia had had all sorts of revolts over its history

4217
03:55:35,295 --> 03:55:38,879
And certainly tribal Barbarian incursions all over the place

4218
03:55:40,415 --> 03:55:43,487
And trouble along the frontier in military Breakaway situations

4219
03:55:43,743 --> 03:55:45,535
Interference from foreign powers

4220
03:55:46,559 --> 03:55:48,095
They had never had anyone

4221
03:55:48,351 --> 03:55:48,863
That had

4222
03:55:49,887 --> 03:55:51,935
Both the stated intention

4223
03:55:52,703 --> 03:55:56,031
Taking over the whole thing toppling the government in just

4224
03:55:56,543 --> 03:55:57,567
Assuming control

4225
03:55:58,591 --> 03:56:01,151
And also the means to make that a reality

4226
03:56:02,687 --> 03:56:03,455
Kelly Ryan.

4227
03:56:03,711 --> 03:56:04,223
Alexander

4228
03:56:07,295 --> 03:56:13,439
What Alexander's attempting to do here is much more than an ancient battle he's launching a full-scale

4229
03:56:13,695 --> 03:56:14,463
Ancient war

4230
03:56:15,743 --> 03:56:17,791
But ancient Wars involve toothache

4231
03:56:18,815 --> 03:56:19,839
1 years

4232
03:56:20,351 --> 03:56:21,631
Field battles usually

4233
03:56:22,655 --> 03:56:25,727
Those are the big battles where everything can be decided in an afternoon

4234
03:56:28,031 --> 03:56:33,919
It is between the field battles that the dirty grimy dated a horror of

4235
03:56:34,431 --> 03:56:37,503
The ongoing look like slow-moving lava

4236
03:56:38,527 --> 03:56:39,551
Have a campaign goes

4237
03:56:39,807 --> 03:56:44,415
Taking walled cities for example is famously slow and grinding

4238
03:56:46,719 --> 03:56:52,095
So there will be field battles along with a bunch of grinding attritional Siege type

4239
03:56:52,607 --> 03:56:54,399
Horror all in between

4240
03:56:55,935 --> 03:56:58,239
Alexander's first field battle of hapan

4241
03:56:59,007 --> 03:57:00,543
When he is confronted

4242
03:57:01,823 --> 03:57:02,847
Soon after

4243
03:57:03,103 --> 03:57:06,175
Crossing over into Asia by the local Persian forces

4244
03:57:08,991 --> 03:57:11,807
One of our main sources for these events says that

4245
03:57:12,063 --> 03:57:16,415
The King of Persia had been given conflicting advice by different

4246
03:57:16,671 --> 03:57:20,767
Counselors on what to do about this Alexander problem on their Frontier

4247
03:57:22,303 --> 03:57:22,815
There was a

4248
03:57:23,071 --> 03:57:29,215
Famous Greek General working for the king of dining memnon of Rhodes and supposedly memnon

4249
03:57:30,495 --> 03:57:31,775
That this was the ancient world

4250
03:57:32,031 --> 03:57:33,823
What's equivalent to the 1940s German Vermont

4251
03:57:34,335 --> 03:57:36,127
Told the king stay away from that

4252
03:57:37,663 --> 03:57:38,943
Don't engage that

4253
03:57:39,711 --> 03:57:43,807
Burn the crops destroy everything star of that army

4254
03:57:44,319 --> 03:57:47,647
Historians think that Supply problems may have doomed

4255
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:51,999
The Persian invasion of Greece 150 years ago turnabout is fair play

4256
03:57:54,303 --> 03:57:55,583
Cut off that army

4257
03:57:56,095 --> 03:57:56,607
And make it

4258
03:57:57,119 --> 03:57:59,167
Straggle home in defeat

4259
03:57:59,935 --> 03:58:00,959
And this time

4260
03:58:01,471 --> 03:58:05,567
The people from Europe can be like Napoleon soldiers straggly home from Russia

4261
03:58:07,871 --> 03:58:14,015
As you might imagine though the governor's the satraps of those places whose farms and everything would have had to have been burned or no

4262
03:58:14,271 --> 03:58:15,807
Unenthused by that idea

4263
03:58:17,599 --> 03:58:23,743
Cast aspersions on memnon the Greek Heritage may be suggesting that he was working for the other side maybe sympathy wise

4264
03:58:25,279 --> 03:58:28,351
Question his manhood sort of and basically said you know we don't

4265
03:58:28,863 --> 03:58:31,167
Run from people with the Persian Empire

4266
03:58:31,679 --> 03:58:33,471
And so the local forces

4267
03:58:33,727 --> 03:58:34,751
Show up to confront

4268
03:58:35,519 --> 03:58:36,031
This

4269
03:58:36,543 --> 03:58:37,567
Force and here's the thing

4270
03:58:37,823 --> 03:58:43,967
At this point for the for the Persians this is not that unusual been dealing with problems caused by the

4271
03:58:44,223 --> 03:58:45,759
British people from us 200 years

4272
03:58:47,039 --> 03:58:52,927
This is the fringes of their empire even lose battle to these people that happens it's not life or death whatever happens here

4273
03:58:53,951 --> 03:58:55,999
As the sword is continually point out

4274
03:58:56,511 --> 03:58:59,583
Alexander gets no luxuries here he cannot lose one.

4275
03:59:01,375 --> 03:59:04,447
He's in a situation where he if he loses he goes home

4276
03:59:05,215 --> 03:59:09,823
The Persians on the other hand are on their home they can afford to lose some especially

4277
03:59:10,079 --> 03:59:12,383
Dispersed when we just sort of a throwaway battle to them

4278
03:59:12,895 --> 03:59:16,991
They lose no big deal it's just the local forces if they win hahaha

4279
03:59:17,759 --> 03:59:23,903
You know makedonian problem solved that the king even having to show up wonderful right you take that gamble every day of the

4280
03:59:24,159 --> 03:59:24,671
The week I think

4281
03:59:26,975 --> 03:59:30,303
That something happens in the story at this point that is noticeable

4282
03:59:31,583 --> 03:59:37,727
And that is it all of a sudden the color that has been missing since our screenwriter Herodotus left the scene

4283
03:59:38,495 --> 03:59:40,543
Returned in glorious Technicolor

4284
03:59:41,055 --> 03:59:42,079
And it looks like a

4285
03:59:42,335 --> 03:59:45,663
1950s Hollywood sword-and-sandal

4286
03:59:47,455 --> 03:59:50,015
Jam packed with action is wonderful stuff

4287
03:59:53,343 --> 03:59:54,623
2300 years later

4288
03:59:55,903 --> 03:59:59,487
Well were using as a source another one of these ancient Greek writers

4289
04:00:00,255 --> 04:00:03,839
Who is writing in the Roman Empire 400 years later until

4290
04:00:04,095 --> 04:00:07,935
You're tempted to say why pay attention to any of this stuff is just coming out of this guy tomorrow

4291
04:00:10,239 --> 04:00:16,383
Earlier that all the Contemporary accounts are Alexander's time. And because of these were huge event a lot of people wrote

4292
04:00:17,407 --> 04:00:18,175
My time without

4293
04:00:18,431 --> 04:00:20,479
10000 weeks on the bestseller list

4294
04:00:21,247 --> 04:00:24,063
But those things are gone now so we don't have any of those

4295
04:00:24,831 --> 04:00:30,719
But Roman era writers like Aryan the Greek writer whose account has the best account of Alexander's

4296
04:00:30,975 --> 04:00:31,999
Military campaign

4297
04:00:32,511 --> 04:00:34,047
He did have access to that stuff

4298
04:00:35,583 --> 04:00:37,887
He says he wrote from three main sources

4299
04:00:38,399 --> 04:00:39,679
The number one source

4300
04:00:40,191 --> 04:00:46,335
Was one of Alexander's best friends one of his companions what is 7 important bodyguards a guy is so close to him he may have

4301
04:00:46,591 --> 04:00:47,359
I've been a half brother

4302
04:00:47,871 --> 04:00:49,663
And after Alexander's life was over

4303
04:00:49,919 --> 04:00:55,551
This guy tore off a chunk of his Empire and started to Dynasty centered in Egypt that rule for 300 years

4304
04:00:56,831 --> 04:00:57,343
Not too bad

4305
04:00:58,111 --> 04:01:00,415
Primary source right even if your getting a second hand

4306
04:01:01,183 --> 04:01:02,207
Also one of Alexander's

4307
04:01:02,463 --> 04:01:02,975
Admirals

4308
04:01:03,231 --> 04:01:08,863
Combat engineers in the area and basically said she took up with the scientific approach to it and compare the sources to each other

4309
04:01:10,399 --> 04:01:12,191
It's about the best you're going to get right

4310
04:01:13,983 --> 04:01:15,263
The Aryans the main guy

4311
04:01:15,775 --> 04:01:17,311
Arian says

4312
04:01:17,823 --> 04:01:23,967
That at the granicus river Alexander's forces ran into the Persian Defenders and that they numbered about 20

4313
04:01:24,223 --> 04:01:25,759
Cavalry about 20000 in French

4314
04:01:27,551 --> 04:01:29,343
Modern historians think those numbers are high

4315
04:01:31,903 --> 04:01:38,047
But Alexander's numbers are pretty darn well close self for the first time in a long time maybe

4316
04:01:38,303 --> 04:01:44,447
We have reasonable numbers for at least one side Alexander's forces supposed to have had between 30 and 35000

4317
04:01:44,703 --> 04:01:47,519
Instrument and about 5,000 maybe a little more than 5000

4318
04:01:48,799 --> 04:01:53,663
So even having one number to fill in for a letter in the algebraic historical equation

4319
04:01:53,919 --> 04:01:54,431
Alps

4320
04:01:55,711 --> 04:01:58,271
All these battles that are coming up in this

4321
04:01:59,039 --> 04:02:01,343
Campaign are argued about endlessly

4322
04:02:02,879 --> 04:02:04,671
The exact locations are not even known

4323
04:02:05,951 --> 04:02:09,023
So take everything with a grain of salt the one thing you can say though

4324
04:02:09,535 --> 04:02:15,167
Is that what about to happen here it's easy to see how this all contributes to the myth of Alexander

4325
04:02:15,423 --> 04:02:19,519
And one wonders although I haven't heard anybody say this wasn't true if any of this was true

4326
04:02:19,775 --> 04:02:25,663
Theoretically possible that this is all made up about Alexander that he wanted to be portrayed in homeric terms and so

4327
04:02:25,919 --> 04:02:27,967
And he's Superman and all the sources

4328
04:02:28,479 --> 04:02:30,015
Seems very unlikely though

4329
04:02:30,271 --> 04:02:34,367
He seems more on the other end of the Spectrum which is somebody who really enjoyed this

4330
04:02:35,391 --> 04:02:37,695
Somebody who would have considered it

4331
04:02:38,463 --> 04:02:42,559
A bad thing to have for any reason missed out on The Killing

4332
04:02:43,839 --> 04:02:46,143
It wasn't just leading his men cuz it was his duty

4333
04:02:46,911 --> 04:02:49,727
If any of this stuff is true about Alexander he got a kick out of it

4334
04:02:49,983 --> 04:02:51,519
And the stuff he did is

4335
04:02:52,543 --> 04:02:53,055
Frightful

4336
04:02:54,847 --> 04:02:56,127
I don't mean in there

4337
04:02:56,383 --> 04:03:01,247
Sense of giving frightful order like go kill all the civilians from that City we just captured I mean

4338
04:03:02,015 --> 04:03:04,575
On a personal level what he did was frightful

4339
04:03:04,831 --> 04:03:08,159
And you can't judge the people in modern cultural

4340
04:03:08,415 --> 04:03:09,183
Terms because

4341
04:03:09,439 --> 04:03:14,047
Everybody around him was doing similar frightful things that's how you fought right

4342
04:03:14,815 --> 04:03:15,583
What's more

4343
04:03:15,839 --> 04:03:20,191
The society was built on encouraging the carrots and sticks that made such activities

4344
04:03:20,703 --> 04:03:21,727
Cast in the light of

4345
04:03:21,983 --> 04:03:24,031
Heroism or Warrior Hood

4346
04:03:25,055 --> 04:03:27,871
Or Defending Your people or what-have-you another word

4347
04:03:28,383 --> 04:03:31,455
It was completely supported by the culture

4348
04:03:33,759 --> 04:03:35,807
Alexander was increasing his

4349
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:38,623
Glory Fame honor

4350
04:03:39,391 --> 04:03:40,671
And all those other things

4351
04:03:41,183 --> 04:03:42,463
And with all these killing

4352
04:03:43,231 --> 04:03:44,767
And having them recorded in

4353
04:03:45,279 --> 04:03:47,839
Homeric charms was the sort of stuff

4354
04:03:48,095 --> 04:03:51,423
He wanted to read about himself cuz it was the sort of stuff you read about his own hero

4355
04:03:51,935 --> 04:03:52,959
Read The Iliad

4356
04:03:53,215 --> 04:03:53,727
Is frightful

4357
04:03:55,775 --> 04:03:57,055
When you read the accounts

4358
04:03:57,567 --> 04:03:59,871
Aryan provides of Alexander's conduct

4359
04:04:00,895 --> 04:04:01,407
In

4360
04:04:01,663 --> 04:04:05,247
Hand to hand combat at the Battle of the granicus it sounds very similar

4361
04:04:08,319 --> 04:04:11,135
Fascinated and everybody is totally confused about how

4362
04:04:11,391 --> 04:04:12,671
Ancient combat worked

4363
04:04:13,183 --> 04:04:19,327
When you read the sources it's so hard to get Patty to are these literary devices where they have people talking to each other in combat

4364
04:04:19,839 --> 04:04:23,167
Were there ways that could actually happen in the demon battle

4365
04:04:23,935 --> 04:04:26,239
Aaron's account of Alexander fighting at the granicus

4366
04:04:26,495 --> 04:04:28,031
Has that kind of stuff going on

4367
04:04:30,335 --> 04:04:32,639
In addition as we said earlier in Ancient Warfare

4368
04:04:33,151 --> 04:04:38,271
The officers and the commanders are very important and they're right there In Harm's Way

4369
04:04:38,783 --> 04:04:42,879
In the larger battles the commanders might themselves be the head of state

4370
04:04:43,647 --> 04:04:44,671
What happens if you take

4371
04:04:45,183 --> 04:04:45,695
Them out

4372
04:04:46,719 --> 04:04:48,767
Alexander is the head of state

4373
04:04:49,279 --> 04:04:51,839
At this battle and he will be fighting in the front ranks

4374
04:04:52,607 --> 04:04:53,887
According to Arian

4375
04:04:54,399 --> 04:04:56,959
The Persians Mass a bunch of troops together

4376
04:04:57,471 --> 04:05:01,311
And just showed up from their side of the battlefield follow Alexander

4377
04:05:01,567 --> 04:05:04,639
As he moves in his bright magnificent armor

4378
04:05:04,895 --> 04:05:09,247
And with the Trap and you could always tell where these people were because they wanted their own troops to know

4379
04:05:10,527 --> 04:05:16,159
And is essentially a unit of Persian Cavalry following Alexander across the battlefield from the other side

4380
04:05:16,671 --> 04:05:19,487
Waiting for him to make his move and their job is going to be to take him out

4381
04:05:19,999 --> 04:05:23,071
He's the head of the snake as far as they're concerned he's Darth Vader

4382
04:05:24,351 --> 04:05:28,447
Darth Vader and the Death Star and the emperor all rolled into one

4383
04:05:29,727 --> 04:05:31,775
Tell him and maybe everybody goes home

4384
04:05:35,103 --> 04:05:39,967
Alexander's response to that according to Aryan and pretty much everyone else you've ever heard from

4385
04:05:40,479 --> 04:05:42,783
Is the charge into the thick of the mess

4386
04:05:45,599 --> 04:05:51,743
We mentioned earlier we were talking about the Persian army from 150 years ago that we changed over time

4387
04:05:51,999 --> 04:05:53,279
Expect there to be some evolution

4388
04:05:54,047 --> 04:05:55,583
Are the criticisms historians

4389
04:05:56,095 --> 04:05:57,375
A long time ago in in

4390
04:05:57,631 --> 04:06:00,447
All the way up to the time when I was a kid were making about the Persians were

4391
04:06:00,703 --> 04:06:06,847
Do they got beaten all these battles against the Greeks and they didn't really even change it any appreciably positive way but modern historians

4392
04:06:07,103 --> 04:06:08,127
Answered yes they did

4393
04:06:08,639 --> 04:06:14,271
And it was right under your nose is you're always talking about things like Scythe Chariot and all these other things do you think those are

4394
04:06:14,783 --> 04:06:18,623
Their attempt to come to grips with their weakness and a great advantage in this case

4395
04:06:18,879 --> 04:06:25,023
How do you break up those formations of heavy infantry that fight shoulder-to-shoulder with those long Spears they are a pain

4396
04:06:27,071 --> 04:06:31,167
The Persians hired a lot of those Greek mercenary hoplite to fill the gap for them

4397
04:06:31,423 --> 04:06:33,471
There's 10 to 20 thousand of them at this battle

4398
04:06:34,751 --> 04:06:36,031
They also tried to figure out

4399
04:06:36,287 --> 04:06:42,431
Stratagems and ways to break up that Reformation because once those spearmen were no longer huddle shoulder to show

4400
04:06:42,687 --> 04:06:43,967
They were vulnerable as hack

4401
04:06:44,991 --> 04:06:48,063
That's why this is called the battle of the river granite

4402
04:06:48,575 --> 04:06:50,111
Because the Persian forces

4403
04:06:50,623 --> 04:06:52,415
We're on the other side of a river

4404
04:06:54,463 --> 04:06:57,279
And on the far side of the river was a steep Bank

4405
04:06:58,047 --> 04:07:02,399
And on top of that awaited a very long line of Persian cavalry

4406
04:07:05,727 --> 04:07:07,263
The thought process seems to be in

4407
04:07:07,775 --> 04:07:08,799
Seems pretty sound

4408
04:07:09,567 --> 04:07:10,847
We're looking at it

4409
04:07:11,359 --> 04:07:17,503
That you're going to have to cross if you were the makedonian foot soldiers that give the Persians historically such a hard time

4410
04:07:17,759 --> 04:07:19,551
A body of water

4411
04:07:20,063 --> 04:07:21,855
You crossed this body of water

4412
04:07:22,111 --> 04:07:27,487
And you scramble up to the other side there's no way you're still maintaining your

4413
04:07:27,743 --> 04:07:29,791
Shoulder to shoulder cohesion anymore

4414
04:07:30,559 --> 04:07:35,423
And you have Cavalry awaiting you at the top of the rise to charge down on you

4415
04:07:36,447 --> 04:07:40,287
That sounds like a pretty good plan if you're looking at it from the person point of view

4416
04:07:41,823 --> 04:07:47,967
For some reason they seem to a station there infantry too far back to take any part in the battle I read somewhere I think it's like a mile

4417
04:07:48,223 --> 04:07:48,735
Backup meaning

4418
04:07:48,991 --> 04:07:50,271
It's a big distance

4419
04:07:50,783 --> 04:07:53,599
The last looks like a pretty good plan on paper if we're

4420
04:07:53,855 --> 04:07:54,367
Reading Eggs

4421
04:07:57,951 --> 04:08:04,095
The other thing that has changed over a hundred fifty years apparently this is all very debated but but it's it's starting to be

4422
04:08:04,351 --> 04:08:04,863
Become apparent

4423
04:08:05,375 --> 04:08:06,911
The Cavalry has changed

4424
04:08:07,167 --> 04:08:11,007
And 150 years since the earlier Greek war with the Persians

4425
04:08:11,263 --> 04:08:13,311
Back then if you recall the Persians used to attack

4426
04:08:13,823 --> 04:08:19,967
With missile Weapon by Squadron and sort of try to wear you down and they would attack you in hand-to-hand combat if you were like true

4427
04:08:20,223 --> 04:08:22,271
Scattered

4428
04:08:23,039 --> 04:08:25,599
They were going to slam into your formation probably

4429
04:08:26,111 --> 04:08:28,159
150 years later that's exactly what

4430
04:08:28,415 --> 04:08:30,719
Alexander's crack heavy Cavalry does

4431
04:08:31,487 --> 04:08:34,815
And that's what the heavy Cavalry units on the Persian side due to

4432
04:08:35,583 --> 04:08:37,375
Are you study calorie evolution

4433
04:08:37,887 --> 04:08:38,911
Is a long

4434
04:08:39,167 --> 04:08:45,311
Train of thought going back to the idea that this all started in Central Asia with all those horse tribe that were always innovating and spread

4435
04:08:46,335 --> 04:08:52,479
By the time Alexander is attacking the Persian Empire spread indeed and there is melee Cavalry on both sides

4436
04:08:54,015 --> 04:08:59,903
And unlike the Greek Wars of a hundred fifty years ago where the Persian Cavalry really had no counterparts on the other side

4437
04:09:00,159 --> 04:09:06,303
Here Persian and makedonian Cavalry often faced off against each other often these battles are going to involve infantry in

4438
04:09:06,559 --> 04:09:07,071
In the center

4439
04:09:07,583 --> 04:09:10,143
Alexandro replaces Phalanx this giant

4440
04:09:10,399 --> 04:09:13,215
Block of human beings that took up the main battle line

4441
04:09:13,471 --> 04:09:16,031
And then Calvary on the wings where it could do something

4442
04:09:16,287 --> 04:09:19,615
It's often opposed by Persian Cavalry on the other side

4443
04:09:19,871 --> 04:09:21,407
And a lot of these battles

4444
04:09:21,919 --> 04:09:26,783
Involve the Persian and macedonian Cavalry fighting it out in almost nightly fashion

4445
04:09:27,295 --> 04:09:28,831
And that's what happens with Alexander

4446
04:09:29,343 --> 04:09:34,207
The front of this infantry starts to advance toward the Persians Alexander get to sort of a

4447
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:40,863
A faint underway were you able to get the Persians to move in a different direction then he slams into them in a Cavalry battle in shoes

4448
04:09:41,119 --> 04:09:42,655
Games where he almost dies

4449
04:09:43,679 --> 04:09:44,447
Here's the way

4450
04:09:44,703 --> 04:09:49,823
Historian je London I thought he did a wonderful job synthesizing the Aryan

4451
04:09:50,079 --> 04:09:51,103
Here's the way

4452
04:09:51,359 --> 04:09:54,943
From the area and he describes what it's like for Alexander the Great

4453
04:09:55,455 --> 04:09:56,735
Head of state

4454
04:09:57,759 --> 04:10:00,063
And Darth Vader in the Persians eyes

4455
04:10:00,319 --> 04:10:02,367
In this battle he sounds like

4456
04:10:02,879 --> 04:10:06,207
The guy who he thinks his ancestor Achilles doesn't he

4457
04:10:06,719 --> 04:10:07,231
Quote

4458
04:10:07,743 --> 04:10:13,887
Alexander lettuce makedonian Cavalry through the riverbed and directly at the position of the sad tracks in the

4459
04:10:14,143 --> 04:10:15,935
Persian

4460
04:10:16,447 --> 04:10:17,727
When the two lines struck

4461
04:10:17,983 --> 04:10:20,287
Alexander broke his Lance in the fighting

4462
04:10:20,543 --> 04:10:22,591
He cried to a groom for another

4463
04:10:22,847 --> 04:10:27,711
But the Groom Zone Lance was broken and he was defending himself bravely with the broken stump

4464
04:10:28,223 --> 04:10:29,503
Ask somebody else

4465
04:10:29,759 --> 04:10:30,271
He shouted

4466
04:10:30,783 --> 04:10:33,855
When another of his retinue finally surrendered his Lance to the king

4467
04:10:34,111 --> 04:10:36,159
Alexander spy mithridatic

4468
04:10:36,415 --> 04:10:39,487
A son-in-law advancing

4469
04:10:40,255 --> 04:10:45,375
Writing out from his guard the makedonian drove his land straight through the Persians face

4470
04:10:47,423 --> 04:10:48,959
Knauer Osakis

4471
04:10:49,471 --> 04:10:50,239
Another Persian

4472
04:10:50,751 --> 04:10:55,103
Brother of the satrap of Lydia struck Alexander on the head with a sword

4473
04:10:55,615 --> 04:10:57,407
The blow wrecked the Kings helmet

4474
04:10:57,663 --> 04:10:58,943
Get the helmets Save the King

4475
04:10:59,455 --> 04:11:02,015
Clearing Mr Davies asgore off his land

4476
04:11:02,271 --> 04:11:04,831
Alexander took Roche keys in the chest

4477
04:11:05,343 --> 04:11:06,367
Piercing his queerest

4478
04:11:06,623 --> 04:11:08,415
And hurling him to the ground as well

4479
04:11:08,927 --> 04:11:15,071
From the melee behind the king the set traps mithridates Wong back to deliver a great blow to avenge

4480
04:11:15,327 --> 04:11:16,095
Just Fallen brother

4481
04:11:16,351 --> 04:11:20,191
But Alexander's companion Cletus was there first with his own sword

4482
04:11:20,447 --> 04:11:24,031
The clove off at the shoulder the arm upraised to fell the king

4483
04:11:24,543 --> 04:11:26,335
It was from this point in the fighting

4484
04:11:26,591 --> 04:11:31,199
This Cascade of arterial blood that Panic began to spread them on the Persian

4485
04:11:31,455 --> 04:11:33,759
Until it carried them fleeing from the field

4486
04:11:34,271 --> 04:11:35,039
And quote

4487
04:11:37,343 --> 04:11:39,903
That's a famous story in Alexander's life as he's

4488
04:11:40,415 --> 04:11:46,047
In the midst of the fighting a Persian from behind is about to strike him maybe take his head off

4489
04:11:46,303 --> 04:11:50,143
And is his arm is upraised to bring the blow down on Alexander's head

4490
04:11:50,655 --> 04:11:51,679
His friend Cletus

4491
04:11:51,935 --> 04:11:55,263
Sears off the Persians arm in a weapon in hand

4492
04:11:57,823 --> 04:12:03,455
Think about all that's going on in the midst of how much is that is a good story and how much of its really what happened

4493
04:12:03,711 --> 04:12:04,479
It's hard to know

4494
04:12:06,271 --> 04:12:11,903
What's hard to know when it's also hard to know if things really went that way some historians believe that there may have been a

4495
04:12:12,927 --> 04:12:18,303
Reverse initially at this battle but that Alexander's propaganda which could not afford any

4496
04:12:18,559 --> 04:12:19,839
Suggestions of

4497
04:12:20,863 --> 04:12:21,631
Reverses

4498
04:12:22,143 --> 04:12:23,167
You covered up

4499
04:12:23,935 --> 04:12:27,775
But none the less one way or another it seems that at some point Alexander's

4500
04:12:28,543 --> 04:12:30,591
Forces Drive the Persian Cavalry off

4501
04:12:31,615 --> 04:12:36,223
Greek hoplite infantry in the rest of the Infantry was too far away to impact in the battle

4502
04:12:36,479 --> 04:12:40,831
Alexander ends up butchering a bunch of them and then selling the rest of slaves

4503
04:12:41,855 --> 04:12:44,159
And the battle of the granicus is over

4504
04:12:44,671 --> 04:12:46,463
Remember this was something that involved

4505
04:12:46,975 --> 04:12:48,767
Local forces on the scene

4506
04:12:49,279 --> 04:12:55,423
Once the Persian see this now it's time to get serious we're going to call in a Royal Army and that's a pain in the

4507
04:12:55,679 --> 04:12:56,191
The rear

4508
04:12:56,447 --> 04:13:01,055
Remember the Persians treated their empire little like a company with subcontractors and

4509
04:13:01,311 --> 04:13:06,687
Their army had a royal core sort of that they could bring to a mustering spot and then they would call

4510
04:13:06,943 --> 04:13:13,087
Districts they needed forces from in this case most of them to come and bring troops to the same location to bring you

4511
04:13:13,343 --> 04:13:15,647
Your local forces and will pull them all together and then

4512
04:13:15,903 --> 04:13:18,207
We'll have this huge Force to deal with Alexander

4513
04:13:19,231 --> 04:13:20,767
The call comes out in the

4514
04:13:21,023 --> 04:13:22,815
Persian king is going to take the field himself

4515
04:13:23,071 --> 04:13:27,679
And meanwhile Alexander goes and does the stuff that you do in a between field battles

4516
04:13:28,191 --> 04:13:30,239
He takes the submission of local people

4517
04:13:30,495 --> 04:13:36,383
In any area they're saying I was hated the king I'm glad you're here and I'm going to be your friend can I stay in charge of this region I've always run

4518
04:13:36,895 --> 04:13:38,431
I'm really good at it I got it down to a science

4519
04:13:38,687 --> 04:13:41,247
So there's a lot of that there's also the people who resistant

4520
04:13:41,503 --> 04:13:46,111
Hide behind walls and Alexander have to break those places down and he's not nice usually when he does

4521
04:13:48,415 --> 04:13:53,791
Alexander comes up with a novel strategy to sort of eliminate the threat from the Persian Fleet

4522
04:13:54,303 --> 04:13:59,423
He doesn't have a fleet that can fight the Persian Fleet so he just goes around starts taking all the cities along

4523
04:13:59,935 --> 04:14:03,263
The coastline so that there won't be any place for the fleet to

4524
04:14:03,519 --> 04:14:05,823
Sika Port me just takes all the port

4525
04:14:06,847 --> 04:14:08,127
Combat strategy either

4526
04:14:10,175 --> 04:14:13,759
Alexander's consolidating his Conquest

4527
04:14:14,015 --> 04:14:19,903
Running his porch strategy the Persians are funneling money to all the states in Greece that want to break away from makedonija

4528
04:14:20,671 --> 04:14:26,559
Ironically a bunch of them places that hundred and fifty years ago were fighting for their lives and freedom against the Persians

4529
04:14:27,583 --> 04:14:31,167
Hummel all this is going on in the king of kings in Persia

4530
04:14:31,423 --> 04:14:34,751
Is mastering the Royal Army which which must have taken a long time

4531
04:14:35,775 --> 04:14:39,615
Sebastian Pires getting from one place to another with a lot of troops not easy

4532
04:14:40,127 --> 04:14:43,967
So they must have them believe it was in Babylon chords

4533
04:14:44,223 --> 04:14:45,503
Modern-day turkey

4534
04:14:45,759 --> 04:14:47,807
In the fall of 333 BC

4535
04:14:50,111 --> 04:14:53,951
To give you an idea of how rare this is although I think they had fought some major

4536
04:14:54,463 --> 04:14:56,511
Battles in Egypt not that long ago

4537
04:14:56,767 --> 04:14:58,047
Is going to your brain says that

4538
04:14:58,303 --> 04:14:58,815
The

4539
04:14:59,071 --> 04:15:05,215
People in that part of the Persian Empire and turkey had not seen a royal Army in a hundred and fifty years since

4540
04:15:05,471 --> 04:15:05,983
Jesus time

4541
04:15:07,519 --> 04:15:09,823
The Persians don't often have to bring out the big guns

4542
04:15:10,335 --> 04:15:13,151
The fact that the king is there with the Army now

4543
04:15:13,407 --> 04:15:15,967
Is a sign that they're taking Alexander the Great seriously

4544
04:15:17,247 --> 04:15:23,135
Power ancient Greek writer Arian says the Persian king is leading 600,000

4545
04:15:24,159 --> 04:15:28,511
Through Syria and up toward turkey to confront Alexander that's pretty darn serious

4546
04:15:29,791 --> 04:15:31,071
It's also pretty darn

4547
04:15:31,839 --> 04:15:32,351
Incredible

4548
04:15:33,887 --> 04:15:35,679
As always with the Persian numbers historians know that

4549
04:15:35,935 --> 04:15:37,727
Incredible they just can't agree on what is

4550
04:15:40,031 --> 04:15:43,871
Alexander's probably got about 40 thousand guys with him

4551
04:15:44,127 --> 04:15:46,687
The low numbers you here for the Persians are equal

4552
04:15:47,455 --> 04:15:48,479
2 Alexander

4553
04:15:50,015 --> 04:15:52,319
Most often though the numbers you get for the Persians art

4554
04:15:52,575 --> 04:15:56,415
Twice as large or two and a half times as large generally it's thought

4555
04:15:56,671 --> 04:15:58,463
Did Alexandra significantly outnumber

4556
04:15:58,719 --> 04:16:00,255
In this battle and that's not hard to believe

4557
04:16:00,511 --> 04:16:02,303
Are you considering that you are in the Persian heart

4558
04:16:02,559 --> 04:16:03,071
Land

4559
04:16:04,607 --> 04:16:09,727
But I would have to remind myself in again this is the value of a historian from 100 years ago like Hans dalebrook from

4560
04:16:10,239 --> 04:16:10,751
Germany

4561
04:16:11,263 --> 04:16:16,639
But delbrook reminds us and uses historical example to point out that just because you have a lot of people at a place

4562
04:16:16,895 --> 04:16:18,943
Doesn't mean those people are soldiers

4563
04:16:19,711 --> 04:16:25,855
We always had this concept that every human being out there was a potential person you could throw into the ranks in his delbrook points out no

4564
04:16:26,367 --> 04:16:28,927
Any societies you have people who are warriors

4565
04:16:29,183 --> 04:16:30,719
And people who make pottery

4566
04:16:30,975 --> 04:16:32,767
And things like that are Farm

4567
04:16:33,279 --> 04:16:35,583
And sometimes they can be malicious but he points out

4568
04:16:35,839 --> 04:16:38,655
If the Persian army were a lot smaller than you thought it

4569
04:16:38,911 --> 04:16:40,959
An Empire that size your produce

4570
04:16:41,215 --> 04:16:44,031
There are historical analogies all over the place for why that might

4571
04:16:45,567 --> 04:16:50,687
Nonetheless however large this Army is that the Persian king of kings is leading personally

4572
04:16:51,455 --> 04:16:54,015
It somehow manages to get behind Alexander the Great's army

4573
04:16:55,551 --> 04:16:56,575
Cuts off his

4574
04:16:57,087 --> 04:16:58,111
Line of retreat

4575
04:16:58,367 --> 04:16:59,903
Blocks his Supply

4576
04:17:00,671 --> 04:17:01,183
And

4577
04:17:01,439 --> 04:17:05,791
If you believe in stories Arthur Ferrell says Alexander must have been shocked to find this out

4578
04:17:06,303 --> 04:17:07,839
How did that happen and historians

4579
04:17:08,351 --> 04:17:12,703
Argue over whether or not this was deliberate in a masterstroke by the Persian generals

4580
04:17:13,215 --> 04:17:16,031
Or was it sort of an accident and they kind of found themselves

4581
04:17:16,287 --> 04:17:18,335
Guess what I'm on Alexander supply line

4582
04:17:20,639 --> 04:17:24,223
This fact though is why if you look at the Battle that's about to happen

4583
04:17:24,479 --> 04:17:26,527
It looks like the map needs to be turned upside down

4584
04:17:27,039 --> 04:17:30,111
The armies appear to be on the wrong side but that's because

4585
04:17:30,367 --> 04:17:36,511
The positions got reversed and that's why Alexander is coming north and the Persians are going south and they meet in this Coast

4586
04:17:36,767 --> 04:17:40,351
Stop playing so you have the ocean on one side once like is guarded by the sea

4587
04:17:41,119 --> 04:17:42,399
Do you have the mountains

4588
04:17:42,655 --> 04:17:45,215
Maybe two and a half miles

4589
04:17:45,471 --> 04:17:49,055
Any other direction so you got this coastal plain that turns out to be your Battlefield

4590
04:17:50,591 --> 04:17:51,103
There will be

4591
04:17:51,359 --> 04:17:52,639
Critiques from the ancients

4592
04:17:52,895 --> 04:17:56,479
About the Persian decision to fight the spot because they will say that

4593
04:17:56,735 --> 04:18:01,087
2 miles or maybe a little bit longer it's not wide enough playing for the Persians to

4594
04:18:01,599 --> 04:18:04,671
Really take advantage of their Superior numbers are constrained

4595
04:18:04,927 --> 04:18:07,743
Hemmed in by the hills on one side and C on the other

4596
04:18:08,767 --> 04:18:12,351
These are the same people that thought they were 600,000 Persians there maybe so

4597
04:18:13,119 --> 04:18:15,423
Maybe a little distorted you how it really was

4598
04:18:16,959 --> 04:18:17,727
For me though

4599
04:18:17,983 --> 04:18:22,079
When you look at what's about to happen you're seen in my opinion but a lot of people feel this way

4600
04:18:22,591 --> 04:18:23,871
Alexander's real acid

4601
04:18:25,151 --> 04:18:29,503
The first time maybe you could make a good case that he's not living off his dad's funeral

4602
04:18:30,271 --> 04:18:32,319
And that everything he done so far

4603
04:18:32,831 --> 04:18:38,975
What's something that a lot of people probably could have done having been handed with Alexander was handed I mean my goodness you could add a puppy

4604
04:18:39,231 --> 04:18:39,743
Peking

4605
04:18:39,999 --> 04:18:41,279
With those generals of

4606
04:18:41,535 --> 04:18:42,815
Philips Hue his dad

4607
04:18:43,071 --> 04:18:44,607
If they didn't kill you their murderous

4608
04:18:44,863 --> 04:18:48,447
Wild guys I mean you know you wouldn't survive in that setting

4609
04:18:48,959 --> 04:18:51,519
What do we call it a mafia crime family type dynamic

4610
04:18:52,031 --> 04:18:55,615
None the last song in those guys could have run this whole thing probably on autopilot

4611
04:18:55,871 --> 04:18:56,639
This to me

4612
04:18:57,151 --> 04:18:59,967
Is a battle where you see Alexander stand out of something

4613
04:19:00,223 --> 04:19:00,991
Really special

4614
04:19:01,247 --> 04:19:07,391
And there are people who will say that even after this battle it still could have been autopilot that's how good this Army was and that's how good

4615
04:19:07,903 --> 04:19:09,951
The command structure was I mean it's really

4616
04:19:10,207 --> 04:19:11,487
It's really quite a step up

4617
04:19:11,743 --> 04:19:12,511
And yet

4618
04:19:13,023 --> 04:19:14,047
In this battle

4619
04:19:14,559 --> 04:19:15,071
As

4620
04:19:15,327 --> 04:19:18,143
The Duke of Wellington supposedly said

4621
04:19:18,399 --> 04:19:19,679
About Waterloo

4622
04:19:20,191 --> 04:19:26,335
This battles going to be in near run the thing but you don't normally associate with Alexander who got this one of Godlike quality

4623
04:19:26,591 --> 04:19:27,103
Impart

4624
04:19:27,615 --> 04:19:29,919
Something fans Maybe by his own publicist

4625
04:19:30,687 --> 04:19:31,455
And media staff

4626
04:19:32,223 --> 04:19:35,039
Where you don't even think he comes close to losing

4627
04:19:35,551 --> 04:19:36,575
Body mist bottle

4628
04:19:37,343 --> 04:19:38,623
It's a near run thing

4629
04:19:40,671 --> 04:19:41,951
Both sides with lineup

4630
04:19:42,207 --> 04:19:42,719
On

4631
04:19:42,975 --> 04:19:44,255
Opposite sides of a small stream

4632
04:19:44,511 --> 04:19:46,559
Manestream gives you a little cover to deploy

4633
04:19:47,071 --> 04:19:52,447
Because in one of the little known fun parts about Ancient battle really even up to Napoleonic times and later

4634
04:19:52,703 --> 04:19:55,007
If it takes a long time to deploy

4635
04:19:55,519 --> 04:19:56,031
Think about it

4636
04:19:56,287 --> 04:20:01,151
How many people you're talking about they all have to be in specific position so both sides take hours at this

4637
04:20:01,919 --> 04:20:03,455
And in a place like ancient Greece

4638
04:20:03,711 --> 04:20:09,087
In a lot of cultures actually they had all these sort of cultural gentlemen's agreement I guess you could call them where we say things like

4639
04:20:09,343 --> 04:20:13,951
Don't don't let nobody attacks anybody else is on Drew Brees right right and we'll say go when we go out

4640
04:20:14,207 --> 04:20:15,231
Vikings did that

4641
04:20:15,487 --> 04:20:16,511
Ancient Greeks did that

4642
04:20:16,767 --> 04:20:21,119
But when you're fighting cross-culturally all those gentlemen's agreements got the window

4643
04:20:21,631 --> 04:20:27,775
So both sides are on opposite sides of the street and they're all using light infantry and Cavalry to keep the other side from messing with them too much while they get

4644
04:20:28,031 --> 04:20:29,311
They're soldiers in just the right spot

4645
04:20:31,359 --> 04:20:34,175
Last-minute moves from one side to the other

4646
04:20:34,431 --> 04:20:35,967
Countering this encounter in Latin

4647
04:20:36,223 --> 04:20:36,991
Basically

4648
04:20:37,247 --> 04:20:40,575
The Persians line up a whole bunch of Calvary on their right flank

4649
04:20:41,599 --> 04:20:47,743
And they're playing according to you know this is argued about to Bud Arthur Ferrell he's a good military has thrown the following and he goes

4650
04:20:47,999 --> 04:20:52,607
Those with a general agreement that the Persians are trying to do a hammer and Anvil tactic and Alexander

4651
04:20:53,119 --> 04:20:55,423
They're just doing it on opposite sides of the battlefield

4652
04:20:56,959 --> 04:20:58,751
So Alexander going to lead a charge

4653
04:20:59,007 --> 04:21:00,543
On his right flank

4654
04:21:01,311 --> 04:21:07,455
And try to crush the person Left Flank and then sweep around and go attack the Persian middle from behind and the Persians are going to try to do the

4655
04:21:07,711 --> 04:21:11,807
Exact same thing on the opposite side of the battlefield where they've matched almost all their cowboy

4656
04:21:13,087 --> 04:21:14,623
Now I can't help but think

4657
04:21:15,391 --> 04:21:20,511
How much of a morale boost it has to be to your average Persian Soldier there

4658
04:21:21,023 --> 04:21:25,375
You may be facing this demon from guide is Darth Vader character

4659
04:21:25,631 --> 04:21:31,775
But all you have to do is look down your own battle line and 100 200 300 yards down the line you see the

4660
04:21:32,031 --> 04:21:32,799
Sacred

4661
04:21:33,311 --> 04:21:35,103
Chariot of Persia's

4662
04:21:35,615 --> 04:21:38,687
King of Kings drawn by the sacred white horses

4663
04:21:38,943 --> 04:21:40,991
And surrounded by the royal guard

4664
04:21:42,271 --> 04:21:46,111
This guy is not quite a God Like a pharaoh or something

4665
04:21:46,623 --> 04:21:49,695
But he's about one tiny half step below that

4666
04:21:50,463 --> 04:21:52,511
You have to feel pretty confident

4667
04:21:53,023 --> 04:21:56,607
If you're on the Persian side and you look in the King of Kings is right there

4668
04:21:57,631 --> 04:22:00,703
What we said earlier Alexander the greatest makedonija is

4669
04:22:00,959 --> 04:22:04,287
Head of state fighting in hand-to-hand combat in these battles

4670
04:22:04,543 --> 04:22:07,103
This is the first time that the head of state for makedonija

4671
04:22:07,359 --> 04:22:11,967
Face is on the opposite side of the battlefield under 200 yards away at the start

4672
04:22:12,479 --> 04:22:15,039
The head of state of the Empire he trying to take down

4673
04:22:16,319 --> 04:22:17,599
And I love that I mean that

4674
04:22:17,855 --> 04:22:20,415
Reminds me of that video when I was a kid

4675
04:22:20,927 --> 04:22:27,071
Genesis did one with during the Cold War that had Ronald Reagan in the head of the Soviet Union fighting hand-to-hand in it

4676
04:22:27,327 --> 04:22:27,839
Order something

4677
04:22:29,631 --> 04:22:31,935
I tried to come up with like a modern analogy

4678
04:22:32,191 --> 04:22:35,775
And they're all so ridiculous but they're still fun I mean imagine the Second World War

4679
04:22:36,031 --> 04:22:36,543
Where

4680
04:22:36,799 --> 04:22:42,943
You're fighting this way and on one side of the battlefield as Winston Churchill in the British forces and they look across

4681
04:22:43,199 --> 04:22:47,807
No man's land a hundred two hundred yards across the field and they are surrounded by

4682
04:22:48,063 --> 04:22:52,159
You know maybe the mounted SS lifeguard is out of Hitler

4683
04:22:52,671 --> 04:22:54,719
See them on the other side and

4684
04:22:55,487 --> 04:22:56,255
Depending on

4685
04:22:56,511 --> 04:22:59,071
How you conduct yourself if you want to

4686
04:22:59,583 --> 04:23:00,863
You can go get them

4687
04:23:03,423 --> 04:23:07,263
This is once again we're Alexander looks very homeric in the sense that

4688
04:23:07,519 --> 04:23:10,847
She almost comes through on the sources he wants to make this personal

4689
04:23:11,615 --> 04:23:13,919
And I'm not sure the king of Persian does

4690
04:23:16,735 --> 04:23:20,831
Not wanting to weigh in on the controversy of all the arguments over hubby

4691
04:23:22,623 --> 04:23:23,391
Arthur Farrell

4692
04:23:24,415 --> 04:23:25,439
Military historian

4693
04:23:26,463 --> 04:23:27,231
I'll let him do it

4694
04:23:28,255 --> 04:23:29,279
After saying that the

4695
04:23:29,535 --> 04:23:30,815
Persians were using

4696
04:23:31,071 --> 04:23:33,119
A hammer and Anvil strategy

4697
04:23:33,375 --> 04:23:34,399
He goes on to say

4698
04:23:34,655 --> 04:23:35,935
That Alexander is to

4699
04:23:36,191 --> 04:23:36,703
Pieces quote

4700
04:23:37,471 --> 04:23:41,055
Ironically Alexander's plan was essentially the same as his opponents

4701
04:23:41,311 --> 04:23:43,103
And we can see clearly in this battle

4702
04:23:43,359 --> 04:23:48,479
How the traditions of ancient near Eastern and Greco Macedonian Warfare have been fused

4703
04:23:48,735 --> 04:23:53,087
Alexander hope to breakthrough Darius is left Center in a cavalry charge

4704
04:23:53,343 --> 04:23:59,231
Andrew Weil around against the rear of the Persian Center in an identical hammer and Anvil operation

4705
04:23:59,487 --> 04:24:02,047
Is Alexander near the Persian position

4706
04:24:02,303 --> 04:24:04,863
He forced his army to advance of the slow pace

4707
04:24:05,119 --> 04:24:08,447
Just as the Persians had done against Cyrus at chew noxa

4708
04:24:08,703 --> 04:24:14,335
Finally when the macedonians were well within bowshot probably had about a distance of 100 yards

4709
04:24:14,591 --> 04:24:17,151
Alexander ordered an attack on the double

4710
04:24:17,407 --> 04:24:19,455
With contingents of Cavalry on his right

4711
04:24:19,711 --> 04:24:21,759
Supported by infantry close behind

4712
04:24:22,015 --> 04:24:23,807
He charged the river at a gallop

4713
04:24:24,319 --> 04:24:28,159
Persian skirmishers in front of their line probably fell back in panic

4714
04:24:28,415 --> 04:24:32,511
Creating confusion in the main infantry line on the Persian left fender

4715
04:24:32,767 --> 04:24:34,559
And Alexander smash through

4716
04:24:35,327 --> 04:24:35,839
And quote

4717
04:24:37,631 --> 04:24:39,423
This battle is often portrayed

4718
04:24:40,191 --> 04:24:41,471
A Race Against Time

4719
04:24:42,239 --> 04:24:48,383
Because Alexander is blowing away the opponents that he and his Cavalry are facing in front of them the problem is

4720
04:24:48,639 --> 04:24:49,663
He's having problems

4721
04:24:49,919 --> 04:24:51,711
In all the other sectors of the battlefield

4722
04:24:52,223 --> 04:24:56,063
In the sentries having problems against the Greek mercenaries hired by the Persians

4723
04:24:56,319 --> 04:24:59,903
And his left leg is in real trouble cuz that's where the Persian version

4724
04:25:00,159 --> 04:25:02,463
Of the hammer and Anvil tactics are hammering

4725
04:25:02,719 --> 04:25:06,815
They put all their Cavalry on their right flank and now the poor makedonian

4726
04:25:07,071 --> 04:25:09,887
Calvary really Greek at the sailing Cavalry on their left leg

4727
04:25:10,143 --> 04:25:14,751
Is trying to hold their own without collapsing so Alexander has to manage to

4728
04:25:15,007 --> 04:25:16,543
Finish this battle

4729
04:25:17,055 --> 04:25:17,823
From the

4730
04:25:18,335 --> 04:25:22,943
Distant position he has on one flank before his Center in his left leg collapses

4731
04:25:24,223 --> 04:25:27,295
The sources say Alexander in keeping with the original plan

4732
04:25:27,551 --> 04:25:29,599
Swings his Cavalry to his left

4733
04:25:30,111 --> 04:25:32,927
And begins attacking the rear of the Persian line

4734
04:25:33,439 --> 04:25:37,279
But is he going to be able to win the battle there before his own Army collapses

4735
04:25:38,303 --> 04:25:39,583
And then traditionally

4736
04:25:40,095 --> 04:25:41,887
We're told he spots

4737
04:25:42,655 --> 04:25:43,423
The alternative

4738
04:25:45,471 --> 04:25:47,007
One way to destroy

4739
04:25:47,263 --> 04:25:52,895
An ancient army used to destroy the ancient army another way to destroy the ancient army is simply to kill the commander

4740
04:25:54,175 --> 04:25:55,967
Doesn't always work course

4741
04:25:56,479 --> 04:25:59,551
But if the Commander is the head of state and

4742
04:25:59,807 --> 04:26:01,343
A near god-king

4743
04:26:02,111 --> 04:26:03,903
Chances are better than normal

4744
04:26:05,439 --> 04:26:07,743
Traditionally Alexander spies

4745
04:26:08,511 --> 04:26:09,023
Is counter

4746
04:26:10,047 --> 04:26:11,327
Not that far away

4747
04:26:12,863 --> 04:26:15,935
And in true homeric fashion

4748
04:26:16,447 --> 04:26:17,215
Makes right

4749
04:26:17,471 --> 04:26:17,983
For him

4750
04:26:19,263 --> 04:26:21,311
With a few hundred of his clothes as compared

4751
04:26:23,359 --> 04:26:24,895
Historian Peter Green picks up in the

4752
04:26:25,407 --> 04:26:25,919
Quote

4753
04:26:26,687 --> 04:26:28,991
The moment he located the great King's chariot

4754
04:26:29,247 --> 04:26:31,039
Alexander charge straight for it

4755
04:26:31,295 --> 04:26:34,623
And every makedonian Warrior that day shared his ambition

4756
04:26:35,135 --> 04:26:36,671
The defense was equally heroic

4757
04:26:37,183 --> 04:26:39,487
Darius certainly knew how to command loyalty

4758
04:26:39,743 --> 04:26:41,535
Among the Iranian barons

4759
04:26:41,791 --> 04:26:47,167
Those are threes his brother leading the Royal household Cavalry talk desperately to protect him

4760
04:26:47,423 --> 04:26:50,751
Dying men and horses lay piled and wild confusion

4761
04:26:51,007 --> 04:26:53,311
Alexander received a wound in the thigh

4762
04:26:53,567 --> 04:26:59,711
From Darius himself or so it was claimed if this is true it shows how close he came to attending his objective

4763
04:27:00,479 --> 04:27:02,527
The horses of darius's chariot

4764
04:27:02,783 --> 04:27:08,927
Covered with wounds and terrified by the corpses line all about them plunged in reared half berserk

4765
04:27:09,183 --> 04:27:14,815
For a moment there was a real danger that they might carry the great king headlong through Alexander's lines

4766
04:27:15,327 --> 04:27:18,655
Abandoning Royal protocol in this emergency

4767
04:27:18,911 --> 04:27:20,703
Grab the reins with his own hands

4768
04:27:20,959 --> 04:27:24,031
A second later Cherry was somehow found and brought up

4769
04:27:24,287 --> 04:27:27,615
Darius seeing himself in imminent danger of capture

4770
04:27:27,871 --> 04:27:28,895
Scrambled into it

4771
04:27:29,151 --> 04:27:30,175
And fled the field

4772
04:27:31,199 --> 04:27:31,711
And quote

4773
04:27:33,503 --> 04:27:35,039
The king of chains

4774
04:27:35,295 --> 04:27:36,319
A Persia

4775
04:27:37,343 --> 04:27:43,487
Got in his Chariot and in front of all these men whose morale was so heartened by the fact there near god-king was

4776
04:27:43,743 --> 04:27:44,767
Was there with them

4777
04:27:45,023 --> 04:27:49,119
Sharing the risks and not afraid of the Demon King this Darth Vader

4778
04:27:49,631 --> 04:27:50,655
That guy

4779
04:27:51,167 --> 04:27:52,703
Was running away

4780
04:27:53,727 --> 04:27:55,263
As fast as he could go

4781
04:27:57,567 --> 04:28:00,127
Kind of makes you think that all of The Wanderers effect

4782
04:28:00,639 --> 04:28:04,991
The magic power of having the god King near god king there

4783
04:28:05,503 --> 04:28:06,783
Just what a boomerang

4784
04:28:07,039 --> 04:28:13,183
Set a time like this doesn't have been better had the king not even been there at all than to see him turn tail and flee

4785
04:28:16,255 --> 04:28:17,023
Is Army

4786
04:28:17,279 --> 04:28:21,375
Which has been fighting pretty darn well maybe winning the sender certainly winning

4787
04:28:21,631 --> 04:28:24,959
Another Persian right flank against the makedonian other Calvary wing

4788
04:28:25,983 --> 04:28:26,495
It doesn't

4789
04:28:27,519 --> 04:28:30,335
Not an unusual thing in an ancient battle by the way

4790
04:28:31,359 --> 04:28:36,479
Have you told you officers are important generals are really important if you're generally your head of state as well

4791
04:28:37,247 --> 04:28:41,087
Well if they run away or die it's not unusual for the Army to sort of Melt Away

4792
04:28:41,855 --> 04:28:42,623
In this case

4793
04:28:42,879 --> 04:28:46,463
Which hole do you know again if you buy the engine numbers hundreds of thousands of people

4794
04:28:47,231 --> 04:28:49,535
Begin a choking Panic retreat

4795
04:28:50,047 --> 04:28:53,887
Where the bodies become so thick Alexander supposedly in Pursuit

4796
04:28:54,143 --> 04:28:57,727
Of the Persian king of kings can cross rivers on the piles of corpses

4797
04:28:59,519 --> 04:29:01,823
Nonetheless that's one of the key battles in ancient history

4798
04:29:02,079 --> 04:29:04,383
Because no matter what happens next

4799
04:29:04,639 --> 04:29:10,527
This is not a fluke anymore Alexander is in the process of toppling the Persian Empire

4800
04:29:10,783 --> 04:29:13,343
And the mood historically speaking seem to change

4801
04:29:14,367 --> 04:29:15,647
Now we start getting

4802
04:29:16,415 --> 04:29:20,767
Correspondence were toll between the king of kings of Persia

4803
04:29:21,279 --> 04:29:21,791
And this

4804
04:29:22,047 --> 04:29:28,191
Makedonian warlord sudden controls a nice chunk of what was up until a few months ago The Purge

4805
04:29:28,447 --> 04:29:28,959
Empire

4806
04:29:29,727 --> 04:29:31,007
Very different tone

4807
04:29:31,519 --> 04:29:33,055
Between these two men now

4808
04:29:33,823 --> 04:29:34,591
What's more

4809
04:29:34,847 --> 04:29:38,687
Some of Alexander's generals people he inherited from his father was starting to think that

4810
04:29:39,455 --> 04:29:42,271
What they've conquered to this point looks pretty good

4811
04:29:42,783 --> 04:29:48,927
And maybe you might want to walk away from the gambling table at Las Vegas at this point with what you want rather than gamma

4812
04:29:49,183 --> 04:29:49,695
Anymore

4813
04:29:50,207 --> 04:29:51,743
You know an overreach

4814
04:29:52,767 --> 04:29:54,815
But they're not Alexander

4815
04:29:55,327 --> 04:29:56,607
And he is

4816
04:29:56,863 --> 04:29:57,631
A fact

4817
04:29:58,399 --> 04:30:00,703
He continually likes to point out to them

4818
04:30:03,519 --> 04:30:05,567
Traditionally at this point in the story

4819
04:30:06,847 --> 04:30:08,383
Where the Persians begin

4820
04:30:08,639 --> 04:30:09,919
To offer Alexander

4821
04:30:10,175 --> 04:30:10,943
Deals

4822
04:30:12,223 --> 04:30:14,015
He supposed to get letters or

4823
04:30:14,271 --> 04:30:20,415
Envoys the ancient sources say from the Persian king basically offering him territory and other things in exchange for

4824
04:30:20,927 --> 04:30:22,207
Deciding you've had enough

4825
04:30:23,743 --> 04:30:24,255
I think a little

4826
04:30:24,767 --> 04:30:26,303
Peace inside me died

4827
04:30:27,071 --> 04:30:33,215
When I read theory on story modern history and he suggested that all these traditional accounts which all the historians I grew up reading

4828
04:30:33,727 --> 04:30:34,495
As gospel

4829
04:30:35,263 --> 04:30:41,407
Almost certainly nothing but makedonian propaganda from the time. As I said earlier you know it's hard enough to try to figure out what

4830
04:30:41,663 --> 04:30:42,175
What's going on with the

4831
04:30:42,431 --> 04:30:46,527
Normal Source problems you add the makedonian propaganda

4832
04:30:46,783 --> 04:30:49,343
And unfortunately for us some of the best stuff then

4833
04:30:49,855 --> 04:30:52,671
Is stuff that Brianna would have us believe is a direct

4834
04:30:52,927 --> 04:30:54,463
Fabrication for

4835
04:30:55,231 --> 04:30:56,767
More real-world purposes

4836
04:30:57,791 --> 04:31:00,607
None the less you know you can actually tell quite a bit about

4837
04:31:00,863 --> 04:31:02,143
Other things by

4838
04:31:02,399 --> 04:31:03,423
The propaganda

4839
04:31:04,959 --> 04:31:05,727
And in this case

4840
04:31:06,239 --> 04:31:11,615
And what we used to and not still wishes actually like these official you don't from the desk of Alexander the Great

4841
04:31:12,127 --> 04:31:14,175
Type communication between Alexander

4842
04:31:14,431 --> 04:31:17,247
And Darius is instead of piece of propaganda

4843
04:31:17,503 --> 04:31:22,367
Where the makedonian is trying to give you a feel for a certain relationship in a relationship is this new one

4844
04:31:22,623 --> 04:31:27,231
At least in the eyes of King Alexander is he calls himself in this propagandistic note

4845
04:31:27,743 --> 04:31:33,375
And the king of kings of the ancient and Grand Persian Empire he refers to merely as

4846
04:31:33,887 --> 04:31:34,399
Darius

4847
04:31:35,679 --> 04:31:37,471
This is from Arian remember

4848
04:31:37,727 --> 04:31:39,519
Supposedly have a source who was there

4849
04:31:39,775 --> 04:31:40,799
With Alexander

4850
04:31:41,055 --> 04:31:42,591
A describes a response

4851
04:31:43,359 --> 04:31:46,687
Tune official note he's supposed to have gotten remember it again maybe I'll pray

4852
04:31:46,943 --> 04:31:49,503
Propaganda from the king of kings of Persia saying

4853
04:31:49,759 --> 04:31:55,903
And give me back my family which Alexander seized as booty after it says they were there what are you doing bringing your family too

4854
04:31:56,159 --> 04:31:59,231
To the battlefield but the King of Kings did Alexander snatch them up

4855
04:32:00,255 --> 04:32:01,279
Domantas family back

4856
04:32:01,791 --> 04:32:06,143
He's going to make a deal he proposes a deal to Alexander who says you want your family back you want your wife back

4857
04:32:06,399 --> 04:32:06,911
The kids back

4858
04:32:07,935 --> 04:32:09,727
Arian has the rest of the note back

4859
04:32:09,983 --> 04:32:11,007
Sadaria saying quote

4860
04:32:12,287 --> 04:32:16,895
Come to me therefore as you would come to the lord of the continent of Asia

4861
04:32:17,663 --> 04:32:20,735
Should you fear to suffer any indignity at my hands

4862
04:32:20,991 --> 04:32:22,271
And send some of your friends

4863
04:32:22,527 --> 04:32:24,575
And I will give them the proper guarantees

4864
04:32:25,343 --> 04:32:25,855
Come then

4865
04:32:26,111 --> 04:32:27,903
And ask me for your mother

4866
04:32:28,159 --> 04:32:28,671
Your wife

4867
04:32:28,927 --> 04:32:29,951
And your children

4868
04:32:30,207 --> 04:32:31,743
And anything else that you please

4869
04:32:31,999 --> 04:32:33,023
For you shall have them

4870
04:32:33,279 --> 04:32:35,583
And whatever besides you can persuade me to give you

4871
04:32:36,095 --> 04:32:42,239
Any future let any communication you wish to make with me the address to the king of all Asia

4872
04:32:42,495 --> 04:32:44,799
Do not write to me yes to an equal

4873
04:32:45,055 --> 04:32:47,103
Everything you possess is now mine

4874
04:32:47,615 --> 04:32:51,199
So if you should want anything let me know in the proper term

4875
04:32:51,455 --> 04:32:54,271
Her I shall take steps to deal with you as a criminal

4876
04:32:54,783 --> 04:32:56,319
If on the other hand

4877
04:32:56,575 --> 04:32:58,367
You wish to dispute your throne

4878
04:32:58,623 --> 04:32:59,903
Stand and fight for it

4879
04:33:00,159 --> 04:33:01,439
And do not run away

4880
04:33:01,951 --> 04:33:05,791
Wherever you may hide yourself be sure I shall seek you out

4881
04:33:06,815 --> 04:33:07,327
And Co

4882
04:33:09,631 --> 04:33:12,447
Oh how can you not want that to be true

4883
04:33:12,703 --> 04:33:13,215
Right

4884
04:33:14,751 --> 04:33:20,895
There's another correspondence is supposed to have happened right before the big climactic battle were leading up to wear another

4885
04:33:21,151 --> 04:33:24,223
Margiela supposed to be offered Alexander one that basically give them

4886
04:33:24,479 --> 04:33:28,831
Did everything beyond their wildest dreams if they'll just call the war off at that point

4887
04:33:29,343 --> 04:33:34,207
Alexander's General parmenio who's a leftover from is more conservative dad

4888
04:33:34,463 --> 04:33:38,047
It's supposed to have said that's a great deal I'd take that deal if I were Alexander

4889
04:33:38,815 --> 04:33:42,655
And then this great legendary mythical figure Alexander supposed to replied

4890
04:33:42,911 --> 04:33:43,935
I would take it to

4891
04:33:44,191 --> 04:33:45,471
If I were parmenio

4892
04:33:46,239 --> 04:33:47,007
Boom

4893
04:33:47,263 --> 04:33:49,311
Write a drop the mic moment right there

4894
04:33:51,359 --> 04:33:54,175
But the minute you start getting correspondence like this

4895
04:33:54,687 --> 04:33:56,223
Your any king would know

4896
04:33:56,479 --> 04:33:58,015
You got to go get another Army

4897
04:33:58,783 --> 04:34:04,415
That's a while Alexander deals with a bunch of sieges including a terrible one and Phoenician city called Tire

4898
04:34:05,183 --> 04:34:09,023
The King of Persia put together an army mostly based around

4899
04:34:09,279 --> 04:34:15,423
Peoples from his Eastern territories and he's got wild nasty Warrior people most of the mounted most of them Archer

4900
04:34:15,679 --> 04:34:17,983
Many of them armor from the Eastern territories

4901
04:34:18,239 --> 04:34:19,519
Putting all that together

4902
04:34:20,287 --> 04:34:22,335
11331 BCE

4903
04:34:22,847 --> 04:34:25,919
We're told Alexander soda making towards Babylon

4904
04:34:26,431 --> 04:34:28,991
That's something the Persians can't have happened because that's the

4905
04:34:29,247 --> 04:34:32,063
Financial capital of it's got all sorts of importance

4906
04:34:32,575 --> 04:34:37,951
To the Persian king takes this new Army of his which is supposed to be extremely numerous and extremely calorie-heavy

4907
04:34:39,743 --> 04:34:42,815
Finds a spot that Alexander is going to go through although there's some

4908
04:34:43,327 --> 04:34:46,143
Tense moments as to where Alexander's actually going to go

4909
04:34:46,399 --> 04:34:49,215
But eventually defined as Battlefield were told that the king

4910
04:34:49,471 --> 04:34:55,615
Actually levels this battlefield to make sure all the little pieces of brush you're cleared away so it's a nice flat

4911
04:34:55,871 --> 04:34:58,431
Place where all of his troops could really operate well and

4912
04:34:59,199 --> 04:35:01,247
You know when the sort of a wonderfully ironic

4913
04:35:01,759 --> 04:35:04,831
The book ended this whole piece hears this climactic battle

4914
04:35:05,087 --> 04:35:07,903
With a representative of where we sat at the very very old world

4915
04:35:08,671 --> 04:35:13,535
Of ancient Assyria and the glory of ancient Mesopotamia take on the newcomers here

4916
04:35:14,047 --> 04:35:17,375
The guy who's going to murder that old world and where does it happen

4917
04:35:17,887 --> 04:35:19,423
Right near the ruins

4918
04:35:20,191 --> 04:35:23,007
Of the Glorious Assyrian capital of Nineveh

4919
04:35:24,031 --> 04:35:25,311
What is xenophon

4920
04:35:25,823 --> 04:35:28,127
I saw his ghost City that we talked about

4921
04:35:28,383 --> 04:35:29,663
Statue of Liberty

4922
04:35:30,431 --> 04:35:32,479
You have submerged in the surf moment

4923
04:35:33,759 --> 04:35:34,783
The perfect spot

4924
04:35:35,039 --> 04:35:36,063
To decide who's going to

4925
04:35:37,087 --> 04:35:38,623
It take all the marbles here

4926
04:35:40,927 --> 04:35:43,231
We're told that the Persian army and the

4927
04:35:43,743 --> 04:35:45,791
Hellenic League which is Alexander in

4928
04:35:46,047 --> 04:35:47,839
The Greeks the macedonians so they camp

4929
04:35:49,375 --> 04:35:53,215
From each other in the traditional story which is part of the fun is that

4930
04:35:53,727 --> 04:35:54,239
Alexander

4931
04:35:54,495 --> 04:35:55,263
And his troops eaten

4932
04:35:55,775 --> 04:36:00,639
Sleep well in the Persians were so afraid of a night attack that they kept their people at Battle Stations all Knights Inn

4933
04:36:00,895 --> 04:36:02,943
By the time the battle happens they're all tired

4934
04:36:04,735 --> 04:36:09,087
Ancient sources say Alexander intercepts letters from the Persians to his own

4935
04:36:09,343 --> 04:36:09,855
Troops

4936
04:36:10,367 --> 04:36:16,511
Inciting them to try to assassinate Alexander

4937
04:36:16,767 --> 04:36:19,071
And what do you do to level the playing field with maybe you just

4938
04:36:19,583 --> 04:36:20,095
Killam

4939
04:36:20,863 --> 04:36:24,191
So maybe they were out to do that or maybe that's more makedonian propaganda

4940
04:36:27,519 --> 04:36:32,127
It's on the first day of October 331 BCE traditionally that these armies

4941
04:36:33,407 --> 04:36:34,687
Deploy against each other

4942
04:36:36,479 --> 04:36:37,247
Persian

4943
04:36:37,503 --> 04:36:38,527
Army is

4944
04:36:38,783 --> 04:36:39,295
Huge

4945
04:36:40,319 --> 04:36:40,831
Course

4946
04:36:41,599 --> 04:36:44,159
You would expect nothing less from the ancient sources but this time they've

4947
04:36:44,415 --> 04:36:49,279
Knocked on themselves Aryan who remember supposedly has a direct line to a guy who is there

4948
04:36:49,791 --> 04:36:51,071
And would have known

4949
04:36:51,327 --> 04:36:52,863
So the Persians had a million

4950
04:36:53,119 --> 04:36:54,399
Infantry lined up on the

4951
04:36:54,911 --> 04:36:55,423
Amelia

4952
04:36:56,703 --> 04:36:58,239
And 40000 calories

4953
04:37:00,287 --> 04:37:05,407
Hans delbruck hundred years ago road if you had twelve thousand Cavalry there they would be impossible to manage

4954
04:37:07,455 --> 04:37:08,991
Turn the Lights once again

4955
04:37:09,247 --> 04:37:12,063
We have no idea what the real numbers are Alexander

4956
04:37:12,831 --> 04:37:14,879
Supposed to had 47000 men

4957
04:37:15,135 --> 04:37:15,647
Pretty

4958
04:37:16,927 --> 04:37:19,231
Pacific number 7000 those cavalry

4959
04:37:20,511 --> 04:37:23,583
It's probably safe to assume he was out number to 321 Maybe

4960
04:37:25,375 --> 04:37:27,679
The sources say that the Persian army so numerous

4961
04:37:28,191 --> 04:37:30,751
But it's battle line is much much longer than that

4962
04:37:31,007 --> 04:37:32,799
Alexander's and overlaps it by

4963
04:37:33,055 --> 04:37:35,871
Huge amount of stretches off into the distance it may have been

4964
04:37:36,383 --> 04:37:37,663
Almost three miles long

4965
04:37:39,711 --> 04:37:42,015
Alexander to account for this just soda plan

4966
04:37:43,039 --> 04:37:43,551
4

4967
04:37:43,807 --> 04:37:49,439
Having people available to deal with being surrounded if that happens the angles both his flying soda backwards

4968
04:37:49,951 --> 04:37:53,023
So there's somebody does attack from the side directly facing in the right direction

4969
04:37:53,535 --> 04:37:58,143
He stationed some troops behind the main battle line with order to go get anybody to give us

4970
04:37:59,935 --> 04:38:02,495
And then otherwise he sets up in pretty much standard

4971
04:38:02,751 --> 04:38:03,775
Makedonian

4972
04:38:04,543 --> 04:38:06,079
Template style he in the

4973
04:38:06,591 --> 04:38:10,431
Companion Cavalry on the right flank to act as the lightning bolt hammer

4974
04:38:11,455 --> 04:38:14,271
Poor parmenio on the rest of the Cavalry in the Left Flank with

4975
04:38:14,527 --> 04:38:19,903
Orders to hold off the enemy attack until Alexander can win the whole thing and then the Anvil

4976
04:38:20,159 --> 04:38:22,719
This giant mass of human beings in the middle

4977
04:38:23,231 --> 04:38:24,255
16 ranked

4978
04:38:24,511 --> 04:38:26,047
Maybe an 18-foot Pike

4979
04:38:26,303 --> 04:38:27,839
And stretching themselves

4980
04:38:28,095 --> 04:38:31,935
In over a distance of like a half mile or more Miss crazy to think about

4981
04:38:32,191 --> 04:38:35,263
What a wonderful platform of maneuver that is

4982
04:38:36,031 --> 04:38:38,591
How you do that if you're the Persians isn't this the common

4983
04:38:38,847 --> 04:38:41,407
Standard problem they've had all along again

4984
04:38:42,175 --> 04:38:44,223
Heavy Greek makedonian style Infantry

4985
04:38:46,015 --> 04:38:49,599
Remember the battle of the granicus that used terrain features the river in the

4986
04:38:49,855 --> 04:38:52,415
The highbank to break up the cohesion of these troops

4987
04:38:52,671 --> 04:38:56,511
On this flat playing you kind of have to bring your own causes a disorder

4988
04:38:58,559 --> 04:38:59,583
And the Persians

4989
04:38:59,839 --> 04:39:05,471
In contrast to what historians when I was growing up used to say that they didn't learn anything and they could never do any better than

4990
04:39:05,727 --> 04:39:07,519
Hire Greeks to fight Greeks

4991
04:39:07,775 --> 04:39:11,615
They did have things to break up the Greek formations and they brought them to this battle

4992
04:39:12,127 --> 04:39:12,895
Where they were needed

4993
04:39:14,687 --> 04:39:19,295
The first of these things that's fascinating from historical standpoint cuz it's probably the first time

4994
04:39:19,551 --> 04:39:21,599
Greeks ever saw this ever

4995
04:39:22,111 --> 04:39:28,255
And must have been the number one talked about item is these makedonian soldiers looked across the battlefield and saw for the first time

4996
04:39:29,279 --> 04:39:30,047
Elephants

4997
04:39:30,303 --> 04:39:30,815
Indian

4998
04:39:32,351 --> 04:39:33,631
Traditionally about 15 of them

4999
04:39:34,655 --> 04:39:39,263
That must have been something to talk to your neighbor about in the ranks as you waited to come into contact

5000
04:39:40,543 --> 04:39:42,847
And later evidence was show

5001
04:39:43,615 --> 04:39:49,759
Elephants are a wonderful tool against the makedonian Army because they're good against both the hammer and the Anvil Elliman

5002
04:39:50,783 --> 04:39:51,295
Against it

5003
04:39:51,807 --> 04:39:53,599
Charging heavy Cavalry elephant

5004
04:39:54,111 --> 04:39:56,159
Tacticalories usually won't come near them

5005
04:39:57,439 --> 04:39:59,999
If they ever do get caught by the elephant's it's awful for

5006
04:40:00,255 --> 04:40:00,767
The cavalry

5007
04:40:01,791 --> 04:40:03,583
But against the densely packed

5008
04:40:03,839 --> 04:40:04,607
Phalanx

5009
04:40:06,143 --> 04:40:07,423
They could be murderous

5010
04:40:08,447 --> 04:40:12,543
You would think they would be easy to kill but later evidence shows not so easy and you get

5011
04:40:13,311 --> 04:40:15,871
Four or five of those things stomping around

5012
04:40:16,127 --> 04:40:22,015
And intentionally created crowd of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder and it could be very ugly indeed

5013
04:40:23,039 --> 04:40:25,087
If you follow up with form troops

5014
04:40:25,855 --> 04:40:28,671
To take advantage of that Carnage that's not a bad strategy

5015
04:40:30,207 --> 04:40:36,351
But while breaking up these clothes order troops is definitely a part of the Persian strategy doesn't look like the elephants were what they were relying

5016
04:40:37,631 --> 04:40:38,655
Instead they have

5017
04:40:39,679 --> 04:40:45,055
Something right out of like a Mad Max film or one of those 1950s Ben-Hur movies

5018
04:40:45,823 --> 04:40:47,359
They have saved

5019
04:40:47,615 --> 04:40:48,127
Cherry

5020
04:40:48,383 --> 04:40:50,175
They have like 200 of them

5021
04:40:50,943 --> 04:40:52,991
Stationed all along their Frontline

5022
04:40:54,527 --> 04:40:56,831
I've always thought this was an interesting weapon

5023
04:40:57,343 --> 04:40:58,623
But nobody knows what they look

5024
04:40:59,135 --> 04:41:00,415
Everybody tries to recreate

5025
04:41:00,927 --> 04:41:05,279
A visual image of it from the literary sources and everyone's take is a little different

5026
04:41:06,303 --> 04:41:07,839
To imagine some combination

5027
04:41:08,095 --> 04:41:08,863
Heavy chariot

5028
04:41:09,375 --> 04:41:11,935
Cutting blades you're starting to get there though

5029
04:41:13,471 --> 04:41:17,567
I usually run into has the equivalent of about 3 foot long swords

5030
04:41:18,079 --> 04:41:18,847
1 each

5031
04:41:19,103 --> 04:41:19,871
Sticking out

5032
04:41:20,127 --> 04:41:23,455
From the end of the wheels of The Chariot and then either

5033
04:41:23,711 --> 04:41:28,319
Something projecting forward from the cab of The Chariot like a spear or blades

5034
04:41:28,575 --> 04:41:33,695
We're blades facing downward underneath the cab so it's like a giant human lawn mower

5035
04:41:35,487 --> 04:41:36,511
There were stories

5036
04:41:37,535 --> 04:41:38,815
Earlier in history

5037
04:41:39,327 --> 04:41:43,679
Two or three of these things have attacked a Greek Phalanx that was forming up

5038
04:41:44,191 --> 04:41:50,335
And created a ton of Carnage and then Persian Cavalry swooped in to take advantage of the chaos and disorder and destroyed the four

5039
04:41:50,591 --> 04:41:51,103
Formation

5040
04:41:51,615 --> 04:41:52,383
So you can

5041
04:41:53,151 --> 04:41:56,223
See how the Persians were thinking I mean the two or three side chariot

5042
04:41:56,479 --> 04:42:00,319
Were you able to do that you know 10 20 30 40 50 years ago

5043
04:42:00,575 --> 04:42:04,927
What my two hundred of them along our front lines do it's not a bad idea is it

5044
04:42:07,231 --> 04:42:11,839
It certainly shows that they were thinking outside the box a little bit contrary to the historical

5045
04:42:12,607 --> 04:42:14,655
Your take on the subject when I was growing up

5046
04:42:16,959 --> 04:42:17,983
And then they had

5047
04:42:18,495 --> 04:42:21,311
There are me essentially deployed into long line

5048
04:42:22,591 --> 04:42:24,895
Each line composed of several ranks of Truth

5049
04:42:25,151 --> 04:42:25,663
Front

5050
04:42:25,919 --> 04:42:28,223
Line was almost entirely cowboy

5051
04:42:28,991 --> 04:42:32,319
The line behind it mostly infantry and in seemingly

5052
04:42:32,831 --> 04:42:33,855
Slightly useless

5053
04:42:34,623 --> 04:42:35,135
Almost like

5054
04:42:35,391 --> 04:42:35,903
Cannon Falls

5055
04:42:36,415 --> 04:42:37,695
Not the traditional view anyway

5056
04:42:39,999 --> 04:42:42,815
And in the midst of it all in the center of the traditional place

5057
04:42:43,327 --> 04:42:46,911
Any Secretariat again surrounded by his Royal Guard again

5058
04:42:47,423 --> 04:42:49,727
Is the great king of kings of Persia

5059
04:42:50,239 --> 04:42:51,519
Pius the 3rd

5060
04:42:51,775 --> 04:42:54,335
Still able apparently to command

5061
04:42:54,591 --> 04:42:58,431
The Loyalty of enough people to raise an army this big and get it here

5062
04:42:58,687 --> 04:42:59,455
Despite the

5063
04:42:59,967 --> 04:43:01,247
Events of two years ago

5064
04:43:02,527 --> 04:43:05,087
And as I look at this Persian Army on this field

5065
04:43:05,855 --> 04:43:07,135
I think to myself you know

5066
04:43:07,391 --> 04:43:10,207
Not a bad setup I take that Army if you told me

5067
04:43:10,719 --> 04:43:12,255
I had to fight one side of the other

5068
04:43:13,279 --> 04:43:19,167
But you know and I'm absolutely using 20/20 hindsight here although I wonder what Alexander the Great was thinking

5069
04:43:19,423 --> 04:43:20,703
If you're looking at that

5070
04:43:20,959 --> 04:43:21,471
Army

5071
04:43:21,983 --> 04:43:24,287
I'm trying to figure out where its weak point is

5072
04:43:25,311 --> 04:43:27,615
What if you thought that the weak point might be sitting

5073
04:43:28,127 --> 04:43:29,407
In the sacred chariot

5074
04:43:31,711 --> 04:43:33,503
What is that Army's weak point

5075
04:43:34,783 --> 04:43:36,575
Is the psychology of it

5076
04:43:36,831 --> 04:43:38,623
Quasi Divine ruler

5077
04:43:40,671 --> 04:43:46,559
Maybe it's a sign that Alexander thinks that this is a dangerous Army and that it is deployed well

5078
04:43:46,815 --> 04:43:50,911
3 doesn't just charge into some spot he thinks he can break through that would be

5079
04:43:51,679 --> 04:43:53,983
Standard operating procedure if you saw such a spot

5080
04:43:54,751 --> 04:43:56,287
In this case he goes to his typical

5081
04:43:56,543 --> 04:43:57,311
Plan B

5082
04:43:57,823 --> 04:44:02,687
Which is to use tactical maneuvering on the battlefield to see if he can create that spot

5083
04:44:04,479 --> 04:44:07,039
I got a fully armored and protected enemy can you get them

5084
04:44:07,295 --> 04:44:10,879
To raise up their arm and expose the vulnerable underbelly

5085
04:44:12,671 --> 04:44:18,815
As soon as Alexander sees that vulnerable spot he will launch himself like a requiere into the vitals of the

5086
04:44:19,583 --> 04:44:20,607
Enemies

5087
04:44:20,863 --> 04:44:21,887
Vulnerable underbelly

5088
04:44:22,655 --> 04:44:23,423
As he always does

5089
04:44:25,983 --> 04:44:32,127
In this bottle that's what a lot of the early Maneuvers are about Alexander starts moving his army were told kind of forward but to the right

5090
04:44:32,895 --> 04:44:36,223
To the right would take Alexander's Army into rough ground

5091
04:44:36,479 --> 04:44:42,623
Rough ground is where those chariots could not operate them in the king that had that land in front of his chariots levels for real

5092
04:44:42,879 --> 04:44:45,439
He can't let Alexandra move the battlefield

5093
04:44:45,951 --> 04:44:49,791
So he sends out Cavalry that had been in his front rank

5094
04:44:50,047 --> 04:44:51,327
To stop Alexander

5095
04:44:51,583 --> 04:44:53,631
Indigo around his flight can you get this

5096
04:44:53,887 --> 04:44:57,983
Calorie battle on the right plane to develop with both sides feeding more troops into it

5097
04:44:58,239 --> 04:45:00,031
But this is working for Alexander

5098
04:45:00,287 --> 04:45:04,383
Because he's planned to have calorie to feed into that where the Persians are taking their ears

5099
04:45:04,895 --> 04:45:07,711
From their Frontline denuding a part of their Frontline

5100
04:45:08,223 --> 04:45:12,063
And a certain point Alexander with the Exquisite timing that he's known for

5101
04:45:12,319 --> 04:45:15,647
Decides that they've denuded enough so that that's a weak spot

5102
04:45:16,671 --> 04:45:19,487
And once again you know the Imagine Darth Vader

5103
04:45:19,999 --> 04:45:26,143
Or in this case The Demon King at the head of his troops charging an a wedge so it's like that guy

5104
04:45:26,655 --> 04:45:31,775
And then two guys behind them and then for guys behind them I mean he's the tip of the spear literally

5105
04:45:32,287 --> 04:45:33,567
And the head of state

5106
04:45:34,335 --> 04:45:36,127
Charges into the gap

5107
04:45:36,639 --> 04:45:39,199
Which is on the left center of the Persian line

5108
04:45:39,967 --> 04:45:40,991
Which is right near

5109
04:45:41,759 --> 04:45:42,783
The royal guard

5110
04:45:43,039 --> 04:45:44,319
And Darius the Third

5111
04:45:46,367 --> 04:45:47,391
In the last battle

5112
04:45:48,671 --> 04:45:52,511
You sort of had the impression from the sources in The Way It Was Written that maybe

5113
04:45:53,023 --> 04:45:55,071
Alexander had never intended to go out

5114
04:45:55,327 --> 04:45:57,631
The king that got into the back of it

5115
04:45:57,887 --> 04:46:00,191
Ranks it became the quickest way to achieve his goals

5116
04:46:00,959 --> 04:46:04,287
In this bottle you get the impression that that was the goal

5117
04:46:05,311 --> 04:46:06,335
Maybe he decided

5118
04:46:06,591 --> 04:46:07,615
That this guy was

5119
04:46:08,127 --> 04:46:08,895
Skittish

5120
04:46:09,407 --> 04:46:09,919
What did he say

5121
04:46:10,175 --> 04:46:10,943
Benches

5122
04:46:12,735 --> 04:46:16,319
Because Alexander goes at him and homeric fashion again

5123
04:46:17,087 --> 04:46:19,391
This is where you get into the idea

5124
04:46:20,159 --> 04:46:22,975
Of this guy maybe being the weak Link in the armor

5125
04:46:23,231 --> 04:46:23,743
At this point

5126
04:46:25,023 --> 04:46:27,071
What would one of his predecessors

5127
04:46:27,327 --> 04:46:29,887
I've done in a situation that's about to occur

5128
04:46:30,399 --> 04:46:32,703
Is the situation that's about to occur

5129
04:46:33,215 --> 04:46:35,519
Is that this guy is going to relive

5130
04:46:35,775 --> 04:46:37,567
One of the scariest moments

5131
04:46:37,823 --> 04:46:38,847
Of his life right now

5132
04:46:39,103 --> 04:46:43,199
Dries the third has almost certainly when you imagine he's a human being

5133
04:46:43,711 --> 04:46:45,759
Seen this in his dreams before

5134
04:46:46,271 --> 04:46:49,087
Alexander and these murderous makedonian

5135
04:46:49,343 --> 04:46:53,439
Smashing into the guard that's around him which is like a human wall of people

5136
04:46:53,951 --> 04:46:55,231
And beginning to cut

5137
04:46:55,487 --> 04:46:58,047
And hack and stab their way

5138
04:46:58,559 --> 04:47:00,095
Person by person

5139
04:47:00,607 --> 04:47:02,143
Yard by yard

5140
04:47:02,399 --> 04:47:05,471
Towards him as he watches in his chariot

5141
04:47:05,983 --> 04:47:06,751
There is a

5142
04:47:07,519 --> 04:47:13,663
Fragment of a mosaic that they found in Pompeii which is a copy of what was thought to be a near contemporary orig

5143
04:47:14,175 --> 04:47:17,503
What's famous and it probably shows the scene from the Battle of issus

5144
04:47:18,015 --> 04:47:21,087
But it's the same scene we're seeing a replay

5145
04:47:21,599 --> 04:47:24,671
Must have seemed like a reply to the King of Persia 2

5146
04:47:24,927 --> 04:47:27,231
And in that scene you see Alexander

5147
04:47:27,487 --> 04:47:30,047
On his horse stabbing one of the

5148
04:47:30,559 --> 04:47:33,375
Royal Guardsmen in front of the Persian chariot

5149
04:47:33,887 --> 04:47:40,031
And the King of Persia with eyes as big as saucers it's like the moment before he takes off at the Battle of issus

5150
04:47:42,335 --> 04:47:44,127
And I have to say is I've been trying to look

5151
04:47:44,383 --> 04:47:47,711
Pictures from the Persian side the whole way through I have a lot of sympathy

5152
04:47:49,247 --> 04:47:50,015
Where

5153
04:47:50,271 --> 04:47:51,551
Jiraiya 30 is

5154
04:47:52,575 --> 04:47:53,599
This guy wasn't

5155
04:47:53,855 --> 04:47:56,159
Really boring Brenda

5156
04:47:56,671 --> 04:48:02,559
He's obviously Brave remember he's a guy who killed the rebel leader of the Barbarian leader in single combat

5157
04:48:04,095 --> 04:48:06,911
But this is a guy who gets criticized for doing something

5158
04:48:07,679 --> 04:48:11,519
I would think all but the most extraordinary people would do

5159
04:48:13,055 --> 04:48:14,079
Because for the second

5160
04:48:14,335 --> 04:48:15,359
Time in a row

5161
04:48:16,383 --> 04:48:19,967
He's going to look at Alexander and the cutting machine

5162
04:48:20,479 --> 04:48:22,271
Getting nearer to him as he watches his

5163
04:48:22,527 --> 04:48:24,575
Kinsman slaughtered in front of him

5164
04:48:25,599 --> 04:48:27,903
And he's going to turn around and run

5165
04:48:31,487 --> 04:48:32,511
Even a guy

5166
04:48:33,023 --> 04:48:33,535
Who will

5167
04:48:33,791 --> 04:48:37,375
Fight and kill a person with edged weapons mano-a-mano

5168
04:48:38,143 --> 04:48:39,935
Might be forgiven you would think

5169
04:48:40,447 --> 04:48:46,591
When instead of facing a single individual he's facing a crowd of mounted killers were going to roll over him like a

5170
04:48:46,847 --> 04:48:47,359
Wave

5171
04:48:48,383 --> 04:48:50,943
How many people would stand there in the chariot

5172
04:48:51,455 --> 04:48:57,087
And wait patiently as they cut their way towards you especially if you've already been through this once before

5173
04:48:58,623 --> 04:49:01,183
It had to be the biggest nightmare this guy that had

5174
04:49:01,695 --> 04:49:06,047
Last two years and here it is deja vu all over again as Yogi Berra

5175
04:49:06,303 --> 04:49:06,815
I would say

5176
04:49:09,119 --> 04:49:12,959
I got me wondering once again about the ability of a single person to impact history

5177
04:49:13,983 --> 04:49:20,127
As we all know it's it's usually all kinds of things working together and paying off each other and giant Trends and forces and things like that

5178
04:49:20,383 --> 04:49:22,687
What we talked about how extraordinary individuals

5179
04:49:23,199 --> 04:49:24,991
Can soda sometimes push the envelope in

5180
04:49:25,247 --> 04:49:30,879
And make the difference and pain the meteor off in a different direction and change the impetus and all those kind of things

5181
04:49:31,903 --> 04:49:32,927
What's the opposite

5182
04:49:33,695 --> 04:49:34,719
Unextraordinary

5183
04:49:36,511 --> 04:49:38,303
Did you give somebody in a position

5184
04:49:39,583 --> 04:49:43,679
That is less than what you could normally expect to have in Key West

5185
04:49:45,983 --> 04:49:48,799
Counting system is based on clawing your way to the top

5186
04:49:49,055 --> 04:49:52,639
In a theoretical merit-based system you see this less of the time

5187
04:49:53,919 --> 04:49:58,015
But sometimes any inherited systems or systems like this remember this guy got a job for me

5188
04:49:58,271 --> 04:50:00,575
Supposed poisoner who put him into

5189
04:50:01,087 --> 04:50:02,111
The royal

5190
04:50:02,623 --> 04:50:04,671
Position cuz he thought he could control them

5191
04:50:06,207 --> 04:50:11,583
What is that guy's just an ordinary person for the most part who ends up in this extraordinary roll

5192
04:50:13,119 --> 04:50:17,727
Sometimes you can get away with it after almost monarchies have all sorts of safeguards and

5193
04:50:17,983 --> 04:50:19,263
Things in place to keep

5194
04:50:19,775 --> 04:50:25,407
Some less than talented Manar from destroying the whole thing right won't let him make a stupid military decision that's why you

5195
04:50:25,663 --> 04:50:27,199
You have all those generals and advisors

5196
04:50:28,735 --> 04:50:30,527
But in certain keyways

5197
04:50:31,295 --> 04:50:32,575
There are no safeguards

5198
04:50:32,831 --> 04:50:34,367
Lights for what one single

5199
04:50:34,879 --> 04:50:40,255
Below what you could have hoped for individual the opposite of extraordinary what they could do to you

5200
04:50:42,815 --> 04:50:45,887
Sometimes history comes down to trends

5201
04:50:46,143 --> 04:50:47,935
And forces and big stuff like that

5202
04:50:48,703 --> 04:50:50,239
And sometimes it comes down

5203
04:50:51,007 --> 04:50:52,287
21 guy

5204
04:50:52,799 --> 04:50:54,079
Deciding to run away

5205
04:50:56,127 --> 04:50:57,407
For the second straight

5206
04:51:00,735 --> 04:51:01,759
Pointing out that

5207
04:51:03,039 --> 04:51:03,807
At the moment

5208
04:51:04,831 --> 04:51:06,111
The King of Persia

5209
04:51:06,367 --> 04:51:08,415
Does the unforgivable again

5210
04:51:09,183 --> 04:51:13,535
Things are going that badly for the Persians I would say they're losing but they still have a shot

5211
04:51:13,791 --> 04:51:18,143
Just like they still have a shot at the Battle of issus when the king turned tail and ran

5212
04:51:18,399 --> 04:51:19,935
Once you turn tail and run

5213
04:51:20,191 --> 04:51:20,959
The chances of

5214
04:51:21,471 --> 04:51:24,031
You're pulling out that upset go way way down

5215
04:51:26,335 --> 04:51:31,711
And why we hear nothing about the elephants in this bottle from the sources and while the

5216
04:51:32,223 --> 04:51:33,759
Ferocious looking side

5217
04:51:34,015 --> 04:51:37,343
Cherriots turn out to be easily countered by the macedonians

5218
04:51:37,599 --> 04:51:40,159
The Persian Cavalry is living up to the hype

5219
04:51:40,415 --> 04:51:40,927
Foley

5220
04:51:42,207 --> 04:51:43,743
And they have Alexander

5221
04:51:43,999 --> 04:51:45,791
In a good deal of difficulty

5222
04:51:48,863 --> 04:51:53,727
Sources say that even is Alexander is right on the heels of the Persian king pursuing him

5223
04:51:54,239 --> 04:51:55,519
Then he gets a message

5224
04:51:55,775 --> 04:51:59,615
That is left blank report parmenio is as usual fighting off

5225
04:52:00,127 --> 04:52:05,247
Huge numbers of people in holding his own but starting to fall apart Alexander has to stop the pursuit and come and help

5226
04:52:07,295 --> 04:52:09,343
The Persians have also broken through

5227
04:52:09,599 --> 04:52:14,207
The middle of the formation in a couple of places where gaps appeared so it is far from

5228
04:52:14,719 --> 04:52:18,047
A steamroller have to come back and help him

5229
04:52:18,303 --> 04:52:20,095
There's some tough biting in one area and

5230
04:52:20,863 --> 04:52:23,167
The bottom line is that for the moment

5231
04:52:23,935 --> 04:52:27,263
The person who has the crown that Alexander wants

5232
04:52:27,775 --> 04:52:28,799
Has gotten away

5233
04:52:29,823 --> 04:52:31,103
The bottom line is

5234
04:52:31,359 --> 04:52:33,919
You'll never be able to raise another field Army like

5235
04:52:34,175 --> 04:52:34,687
This

5236
04:52:34,943 --> 04:52:36,223
To contest the empire

5237
04:52:36,991 --> 04:52:40,319
Alexander may not have the crown but for all intents and purposes

5238
04:52:41,087 --> 04:52:45,439
Even as the mopping-up of that battle are going on this guy is

5239
04:52:48,255 --> 04:52:48,767
Amidst

5240
04:52:49,535 --> 04:52:50,303
Some under

5241
04:52:50,559 --> 04:52:52,351
Whole numbers of corpses

5242
04:52:52,607 --> 04:52:53,887
They continue to pile up

5243
04:52:54,655 --> 04:52:59,263
As the fugitives from this bottle or continually run down by pursuing cavalry

5244
04:52:59,519 --> 04:53:00,031
Before

5245
04:53:00,287 --> 04:53:01,823
What must have been days

5246
04:53:04,895 --> 04:53:05,663
It's a holocaust

5247
04:53:06,943 --> 04:53:08,223
To the Persian side

5248
04:53:10,527 --> 04:53:12,319
And Alexander will spend

5249
04:53:13,087 --> 04:53:14,623
Literally years

5250
04:53:14,879 --> 04:53:18,463
Quelling all of the hot spots in the Persian Empire

5251
04:53:18,975 --> 04:53:25,119
That rise up against him even with all of the wonderful propaganda that's come down to us about Alexander being well

5252
04:53:25,375 --> 04:53:26,655
Flowers and roses

5253
04:53:26,911 --> 04:53:28,703
Pedals put in front of him and all these kinds of things

5254
04:53:28,959 --> 04:53:34,079
Did you got a murderous European warlord coming to your town you be wise to do that too

5255
04:53:34,335 --> 04:53:35,359
That doesn't mean

5256
04:53:35,871 --> 04:53:40,735
He wasn't better thought of in some cases in the Persians although a lot of the recent history suggests

5257
04:53:41,247 --> 04:53:43,807
The Persian rule was more popular than Alexander's

5258
04:53:44,063 --> 04:53:44,575
Menstrual

5259
04:53:45,855 --> 04:53:47,647
There is a wonderful little

5260
04:53:48,415 --> 04:53:49,695
Sort of karmic

5261
04:53:50,207 --> 04:53:54,047
Justice in this whole thing if you look at it from the Persian point of view

5262
04:53:54,559 --> 04:53:57,887
And the Chinese did this all the time with conquerors

5263
04:53:58,655 --> 04:53:59,935
But when you are

5264
04:54:00,191 --> 04:54:00,703
The Great

5265
04:54:00,959 --> 04:54:02,751
Cultural power of your day

5266
04:54:03,519 --> 04:54:07,103
As the Persians were they were in the inheritors of this culture

5267
04:54:07,615 --> 04:54:09,407
And the Greeks were The Rustic

5268
04:54:09,663 --> 04:54:12,223
Outsiders the makedonian is even more so

5269
04:54:12,991 --> 04:54:15,039
Overtime Alexander would be

5270
04:54:15,295 --> 04:54:16,575
Become more and more

5271
04:54:17,343 --> 04:54:18,111
Persian

5272
04:54:19,391 --> 04:54:20,159
Dressing my

5273
04:54:20,671 --> 04:54:23,487
Requiring his own people to act more like them

5274
04:54:23,743 --> 04:54:28,607
In terms of treating him more like a Persian king there are a lot of historian to consider

5275
04:54:29,119 --> 04:54:29,887
To the last

5276
04:54:30,143 --> 04:54:32,191
King of Kings in Persia

5277
04:54:32,959 --> 04:54:33,727
Is the guy

5278
04:54:34,239 --> 04:54:36,799
Who just destroyed the Persian army

5279
04:54:37,311 --> 04:54:38,591
At the Battle of gaugamela

5280
04:54:40,383 --> 04:54:41,663
I know in my mind

5281
04:54:42,687 --> 04:54:45,759
Put an! On this story where

5282
04:54:47,039 --> 04:54:53,183
Eventually rides all the way to the Eastern parts of the Empire and captures the great city of persepolis and proceed

5283
04:54:53,439 --> 04:54:53,951
2

5284
04:54:54,719 --> 04:54:55,231
Burn

5285
04:54:55,743 --> 04:54:56,767
The Royal Palace.

5286
04:54:59,327 --> 04:55:00,351
Either intentionally

5287
04:55:01,119 --> 04:55:01,887
Symbol

5288
04:55:02,399 --> 04:55:06,751
Payback for all those Wars with Xerxes and dries for more than a century ago

5289
04:55:08,287 --> 04:55:08,799
Or some

5290
04:55:09,311 --> 04:55:12,639
Traditions reported in sort of a drunken mistake

5291
04:55:14,175 --> 04:55:15,455
You famous or suggest

5292
04:55:17,759 --> 04:55:19,807
That he should not burn down his own stuff

5293
04:55:21,855 --> 04:55:22,623
Quite the realization

5294
04:55:25,183 --> 04:55:25,951
Poseidon

5295
04:55:26,719 --> 04:55:27,999
The Demon King

5296
04:55:28,511 --> 04:55:29,535
I've gone native

5297
04:55:32,095 --> 04:55:33,887
Alexander's Conquest

5298
04:55:34,143 --> 04:55:34,655
Put

5299
04:55:35,423 --> 04:55:36,447
European

5300
04:55:36,959 --> 04:55:37,727
Dynasty

5301
04:55:37,983 --> 04:55:43,103
In charge of these ancient civilizations that had never been under the European heal before

5302
04:55:43,871 --> 04:55:45,407
And ruled that in some cases

5303
04:55:45,663 --> 04:55:46,175
Sportscentury

5304
04:55:48,479 --> 04:55:53,343
When the locals and the natives eventually get native dynasties back and get cash

5305
04:55:53,599 --> 04:55:54,879
Control of their own societies

5306
04:55:55,903 --> 04:55:57,183
It will be precious little love

5307
04:55:57,695 --> 04:55:59,231
Pre alexandrian world

5308
04:56:00,255 --> 04:56:01,791
It hadn't been bleached Outlet

5309
04:56:05,375 --> 04:56:11,519
Alexander is always considered to be the end of an era in Western tradition is considered to be a good thing he spread

5310
04:56:11,775 --> 04:56:12,543
Hellenism

5311
04:56:13,055 --> 04:56:16,639
You know to all these parts of the planet that didn't have in creating this wonderful mix

5312
04:56:16,895 --> 04:56:17,663
Exploding.

5313
04:56:17,919 --> 04:56:19,199
Fantastic culture

5314
04:56:20,735 --> 04:56:21,503
But that's the way

5315
04:56:22,527 --> 04:56:23,039
The Conqueror

5316
04:56:23,295 --> 04:56:23,807
Would see it

5317
04:56:24,319 --> 04:56:25,599
Probably not the way

5318
04:56:26,623 --> 04:56:27,391
It would be seen

5319
04:56:28,159 --> 04:56:28,671
Are the Concord

5320
04:56:31,743 --> 04:56:32,767
Geologist Warwick

5321
04:56:33,023 --> 04:56:33,535
Ball

5322
04:56:34,303 --> 04:56:35,583
Is one of a bunch of

5323
04:56:36,351 --> 04:56:40,191
Experts who point out that much of what Alexander gets historical

5324
04:56:40,447 --> 04:56:41,471
Credit for

5325
04:56:42,751 --> 04:56:43,263
Actually

5326
04:56:43,775 --> 04:56:44,287
To be a trip

5327
04:56:44,799 --> 04:56:45,311
To the Empire

5328
04:56:45,823 --> 04:56:46,335
He brought down

5329
04:56:49,407 --> 04:56:50,687
Fall quotes historian

5330
04:56:51,199 --> 04:56:51,967
JM Robert

5331
04:56:52,223 --> 04:56:53,247
Bert's talking about the

5332
04:56:53,503 --> 04:56:56,063
The Persian Empire founded by Cyrus the Great

5333
04:56:57,087 --> 04:56:57,855
Couple hundred years

5334
04:56:58,111 --> 04:56:59,903
Before Alexander the Great and he says about

5335
04:57:00,415 --> 04:57:00,927
Quote

5336
04:57:01,439 --> 04:57:03,487
Right across the old world

5337
04:57:03,743 --> 04:57:07,327
Persia suddenly pulled people's into a common experience

5338
04:57:08,095 --> 04:57:08,607
Indians

5339
04:57:08,863 --> 04:57:09,631
Meads

5340
04:57:09,887 --> 04:57:10,911
Babylonians

5341
04:57:11,167 --> 04:57:11,679
Lydian's

5342
04:57:11,935 --> 04:57:14,495
Greeks Jews Phoenicians Egyptians

5343
04:57:14,751 --> 04:57:17,823
We're for the first time all administered by one Empire

5344
04:57:18,335 --> 04:57:22,687
Who's eclecticism showed how far civilization had already come

5345
04:57:23,199 --> 04:57:27,551
The idea of distinct units of history in the near East was over

5346
04:57:27,807 --> 04:57:30,879
The base of a future world civilization was in the making

5347
04:57:32,159 --> 04:57:32,671
And quote

5348
04:57:35,999 --> 04:57:42,143
It's always so strange about hearing this line that Alexander spread Hellenism is it makes it sound like he's bringing enlighten

5349
04:57:42,399 --> 04:57:42,911
Cement

5350
04:57:43,167 --> 04:57:44,191
To a bunch of

5351
04:57:44,703 --> 04:57:45,471
Primitive natives

5352
04:57:46,495 --> 04:57:48,543
When in fact the better analogy here

5353
04:57:49,055 --> 04:57:50,335
For ancient Persia

5354
04:57:51,359 --> 04:57:51,871
Is

5355
04:57:52,383 --> 04:57:53,407
The Roman Empire

5356
04:57:55,199 --> 04:57:58,271
And the better analogy for Alexander is not the bringer of light

5357
04:57:59,039 --> 04:58:01,599
But something much more akin to a visigoth

5358
04:58:02,879 --> 04:58:04,159
Or Attila the Hun

5359
04:58:06,975 --> 04:58:11,327
The Empire that Alexander is destroying is the greatest the world has ever seen

5360
04:58:11,583 --> 04:58:17,727
And the way it's often portrayed in history in the story the stereotypes in The Motif in the home team cheering for Western Civilization

5361
04:58:17,983 --> 04:58:18,495
Station

5362
04:58:19,007 --> 04:58:20,287
Is it he was somehow

5363
04:58:20,543 --> 04:58:22,079
Enforcing a

5364
04:58:22,591 --> 04:58:27,455
Law of the Jungle that made sense he's the lion taking out the

5365
04:58:27,711 --> 04:58:31,295
In a stick Antelope from the herd it's Nature's Way it strengthens ever

5366
04:58:31,551 --> 04:58:34,367
Everything I mean if you get into the wooden shoes and socks slippers

5367
04:58:35,135 --> 04:58:39,487
The Persian Empire disappointed like the Roman Empire the N2 they have silk slippers

5368
04:58:39,743 --> 04:58:40,767
For their silk slippers

5369
04:58:44,095 --> 04:58:45,375
But let's not forget

5370
04:58:45,887 --> 04:58:47,679
It was wearing the silk slippers

5371
04:58:47,935 --> 04:58:49,727
Last new found out he really like

5372
04:58:51,775 --> 04:58:53,055
As we said Alexander

5373
04:58:53,823 --> 04:58:55,103
Really went all Persian

5374
04:58:55,871 --> 04:58:59,455
Maybe the last Persian king of kings never mind that he may have killed

5375
04:58:59,967 --> 04:59:02,271
Dries the third that never stopped at Persian

5376
04:59:02,527 --> 04:59:03,807
Being King of Kings

5377
04:59:05,343 --> 04:59:09,695
But while he may be a king of kings and while he may actually fit the motif

5378
04:59:09,951 --> 04:59:14,815
Xerxes did supposed to fit absolute power corrupting Alexander

5379
04:59:15,327 --> 04:59:16,351
Absolutely

5380
04:59:17,119 --> 04:59:18,143
Helped Along by

5381
04:59:18,655 --> 04:59:20,703
A terminal case of alcoholism probably

5382
04:59:22,239 --> 04:59:23,775
His successors would see

5383
04:59:24,287 --> 04:59:25,311
No such need

5384
04:59:25,567 --> 04:59:26,591
To put on a Persian

5385
04:59:27,103 --> 04:59:29,407
Poor local facade they will later

5386
04:59:29,663 --> 04:59:30,687
But initially

5387
04:59:31,711 --> 04:59:34,527
This is a bunch of Europeans openly ruling

5388
04:59:34,783 --> 04:59:37,855
These areas that have never been ruled by Europeans before

5389
04:59:38,111 --> 04:59:41,439
And Warwick ball says the next 75 years is going to be one of the

5390
04:59:41,695 --> 04:59:42,207
Darkest

5391
04:59:42,463 --> 04:59:42,975
Eras

5392
04:59:43,743 --> 04:59:46,047
In terms of what life must have been like for the local

5393
04:59:46,815 --> 04:59:50,655
Are the people in West Asia up until the time of the Mongol Khan

5394
04:59:53,983 --> 04:59:56,031
Goodness they at least got a little Helena

5395
04:59:56,543 --> 04:59:57,055
Part of the deal

5396
04:59:59,103 --> 04:59:59,871
It's all about trade

5397
05:00:02,943 --> 05:00:03,455
And don't forget

5398
05:00:04,991 --> 05:00:06,015
Even if it is not true

5399
05:00:06,783 --> 05:00:07,295
You need to be

5400
05:00:08,319 --> 05:00:08,831
History

5401
05:00:15,487 --> 05:00:18,303
I'm on record as saying that I think most of you all to have a website

5402
05:00:19,583 --> 05:00:22,143
And if you look at what's standing in your way

5403
05:00:22,399 --> 05:00:25,983
Let me suggest that Squarespace might be the answer to your

5404
05:00:27,007 --> 05:00:29,823

At those kinds of prices the risk

5413
05:00:54,143 --> 05:00:55,935

05:00:56,191 --> 05:01:02,335
Completely tips in the favor of you should give this a try if you've ever thought about having website I'll tell you what I like about it too and it's

5415
05:01:02,591 --> 05:01:03,103
You think alike

5416
05:01:03,871 --> 05:01:08,991
Perhaps is the number one thing but if you'd had my personal experience but understand then maybe you have

5417
05:01:10,015 --> 05:01:12,575
I spent years going to those websites that are nothing but

5418
05:01:12,831 --> 05:01:13,855
Website template

5419
05:01:14,111 --> 05:01:20,255
Looking for once I light for my website at thousand and this is the amazing thing I go 3000

5420
05:01:20,767 --> 05:01:22,815
And never find one that I really like

5421
05:01:23,583 --> 05:01:26,399
And I see very few that look as professional as the stuff

5422
05:01:26,655 --> 05:01:28,959
I was seeing out there by big companies

5423
05:01:29,215 --> 05:01:29,727
Outlets

5424
05:01:31,007 --> 05:01:33,055
Squarespace has a similar attitude

5425
05:01:33,567 --> 05:01:35,871
Towards their templates that I have toward this show

5426
05:01:36,383 --> 05:01:39,199
Which is quality or quantity they don't have a lot of choices

5427
05:01:39,967 --> 05:01:40,479
For your temp

5428
05:01:40,991 --> 05:01:43,295
Because they spent their time making really good

5429
05:01:44,575 --> 05:01:45,855
Go check them out and see if

5430
05:01:46,367 --> 05:01:52,255
That's not one of the better idea to come around in a long time era of choice

5431
05:01:52,767 --> 05:01:54,303
I found that it works for me

5432
05:01:54,815 --> 05:01:56,607
