0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,792
I need is a fascinating example

1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:05,887
How we human beings can be molded and stretched and

2
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,448
Trimmed and shaped like a bonsai tree

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,263
by the cultural influences into many different

4
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:13,055
Diverse versions of ours

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:13,823
Ourselves

6
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:17,152
Anyone who's a fan of National Geographic for example

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:22,527
Seize the many different colorful cultures and subcultures all over the world write the extreme

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,320
Differences of humankind

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
And how wonderfully pliable we are to the cultural influences

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,207
that, you know, determine

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,816
How we like to dress what we think is attractive little marks of status all kinds of thing

12
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,887
Now magnify that

13
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:44,031
by all the eras humankind's ever been around right so not just a diversity of exotic different places all over the world

14
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:47,103
But all of those places is all throughout history and you can see that we've

15
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:55,039
Well probably tried just about everything is this species wouldn't you thinking and we seen all kinds of different extreme versions of what we can become, I mean, take the physical version

16
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,392
I'm a fan of the people of the Eurasian(欧亚的) steppe(干草原) in those tribes as many of you know

17
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,487
Some of those tribes from time-to-time used to like to practice

18
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:06,048
Something on his head binding

19
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
It's one of the Counterpoint

20
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Foot binding in China

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Which was popular in some circle at sometimes

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,727
To keep the feet small and to have them developed a certain way

23
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,519
Will same thing with head

24
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,152
You see this in other parts of the world to and sometimes cradles for example certain Native American tribes had cradles that we

25
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,000
Shape the head a certain way to.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,319
The point is is that when the skull is pliable when the person is young, you can shape that heads

27
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,623
And so like a bonsai tree if you will

28
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:34,719
And the Romans used to complain that the Huns(匈奴人) look monstrous to them

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,120
I remember growing up thinking while these Romans are really sensitive seeing some people who maybe have slightly Asian features

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
You're thinking about monstrous

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,823
Well now we have skulls that have come out of the ground some of these tombs some of these kurgans were they buried some of these Huns

32
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:52,384
And some of these Huns have skulls

33
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
that look like they are

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
Taken right out of an alien movie

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,391
Big elongated(加长的) skulls that go way far to the back you wonder what they must have look like with hair and skin

36
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:09,024
The point is is if you were a Roman looking at them you might have thought that they look monstrous

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,352
However if you were a young calmly Huntik noblewoman

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:16,704
You might have thought that guy looked hot so it's all a question right of

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,568
Are the cultural carrots Dixon White Sometimes it's not things

40
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
There are so visible on the outside

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,991
we are recognized the vast majority of our makeup in terms of our attitudes

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,367
And the way we think and the way we organize reality is probably going to be culturally

43
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:35,647
Determined

44
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:40,512
Now I am a fan of extreme situations in history

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
In the country

46
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
that produce guys like Hiro Onoda

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Workstream

48
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
And the cultural carrots and sticks were designed

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
To take many

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,872
Of the In a Civic attitudes that most societies considered to be positives

51
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,711
And turn them up to such a high level on the dial of intensity

52
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,807
That they took a bunch of things that might be considered good

53
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,111
And in another context that made them dangerous

54
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,671
How can your culture

55
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:09,951
Impact things

56
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,231
Like

57
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:12,256
Duty

58
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
And honor

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Patriots

60
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
And willingness to sacrificing lay down

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
One's life

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800
For the greater good mean these are all things that most societies

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
You know what figure out

64
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,407
All sorts of cultural ways to encourage

65
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,479
How about just recognize

66
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,575
And take for example

67
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:37,855
A metal

68
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:38,879
Ceremony

69
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:42,719
It might happen in the United States written award citation

70
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:50,144
Somebody was extra Brave or extra heroic or did something out of the ordinary and maybe you get a medal and when you get the metal

71
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
The person giving the award will say something like you know for

72
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:58,592
Heroism or bravery or sacrifice above and beyond the Call of Duty

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,895
Above and beyond the Call of Duty

74
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,991
That right there was a recognition right that there are limits

75
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,623
To what normal people can be asked to do in normal times right

76
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:13,439
And if you exceed those expectations

77
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,487
Go above and beyond the Call of Duty you get a medal

78
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
What is the cultural heritage

79
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,096
Sticks in a given Society

80
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,144
Have evolved in such a way

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,471
So that there's almost nothing

82
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,800
That is above and beyond call of duty

83
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,127
Where the culture expects

84
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,175
Encourages

85
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,480
And only approves

86
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:42,367
A level of sacrifice on the part of every man woman and child in that Society

87
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,184
The most other cultures Reserve

88
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:48,255
For their most elite military unit

89
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:54,911
Welcome to the world that famed Japanese holdout

90
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,216
Hiroo onoda was raised in

91
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,079
When another got back to Japan in 1974

92
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,384
Ghost written book of his

93
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:05,663
Remembrances

94
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Was created

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
It's called No Surrender my thirty-year war and energy describes

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,576
The Japan he was raised in he says quote

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,415
At that time if a soldier who had been taken prisoner

98
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,815
Later managed to return to Japan he was subject to a court-martial in a possible death penalty

99
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Even if a penalty was not carried out

100
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,168
He was so thoroughly ostracized by others

101
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:28,704
Then you might as well have been dead

102
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:32,031
Soldiers were supposed to give their lives for the cause

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Not groveling enemy prison camps

104
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,175
General Hideki tojo's instructions for the military CID explicitly

105
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,968
He's not quoting

106
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
The instructions quote

107
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,112
He who would not disgrace himself must be strong

108
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,696
You must remember always the honor of his family and his community

109
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,512
Animas dry fervently to live up to their trust in him

110
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:55,327
Do not live in shame as a prisoner

111
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,399
Die and leave no ignominious crime behind you

112
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
And quote

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,336
When he leaves to go off to war one of the things he takes with him as a family dagger that his mother says

114
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,639
If your capture use this to kill yourself with

115
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
And I tried to think of any other

116
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Mother

117
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,112
Sending her son off to war in any other major power in the Second World War

118
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,648
With that kind of advice

119
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:21,951
Interesting is a very distinctive different culture

120
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,048
Got some might have a counter on

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,584
I meant to this point

122
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:33,728
That the reason these Japanese holdouts were continuing to hold out was her duty honor country the emperor that sort of thing by pointing out

123
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
A bunch of these people said they didn't know the war was over

124
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,408
So maybe it's more of a sense of being isolated and not getting the news

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,992
But the counter argument to that has to do

126
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:46,271
With the fact that

127
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,136
These people were often told explicitly in many different ways that the war was over

128
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:54,975
And he chose not to believe it and they chose not to believe it because it clot with their

129
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,815
Elemental indoctrination into all this I mean for example

130
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Hiroo onoda

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,216
He had family members flown in at high expense to the Japanese government because

132
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,495
Hiro Nakamura still chilling

133
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,800
In the Philippines

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,432
After the war right he's not just sitting up there in the mountains by himself not bothering anybody killed 20 to 30 Filipinos

135
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,504
So that makes you want to tell this

136
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,576
This person in no uncertain terms and spend a little money to make it happen

137
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,879
Hey you're killing people in the war is over

138
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,208
Believe that they left the newspapers here's how he puts it

139
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,255
In the book written

140
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
With him

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Quote

142
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,144
The search party Left Behind newspapers and magazines

143
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:37,216
Most of them were recent and a lot of them contained articles

144
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:38,752
About the crown Prince's marriage

145
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:42,336
The newspapers which covered a period of about four months

146
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,384
Made a stack nearly 2 feet high

147
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
We we need to two other holdouts with him

148
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:53,088
We thought they were reprints of real Japanese newspapers doctored up by the American Secret Service

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,439
In such a way as to eliminate any news that the Americans did not want us to

150
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,208
Sissy

151
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,767
This was all we could think so long as we believe

152
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
The greater East Asia war was still going on

153
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
And in the way he writes

154
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,704
The newspaper has confirmed that the war was still going on

155
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,519
Because they told a lot about life in Japan

156
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,127
If Japan is really lost the war there should not be any life in Japan

157
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,920
Everybody should be dead

158
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,783
When I arrived in the Philippines in 1944 the war was going badly for Japan he writes

159
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:29,951
And in the Homeland the phrase 100 million Souls dying for Honor was on everybody

160
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
These lips this phrase meant literally

161
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,583
That the population of Japan would die to a man before surrendering

162
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:40,447
I took this at face value and I am sure many other young Japanese men my age did

163
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,847
He says I sincerely believed that Japan would not surrender so long as anyone Japanese remained alive

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,432
Conversely if one Japanese were left alive

165
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:51,967
Japan would not have surrendered

166
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:54,015
He continues

167
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:58,368
After all this is what we Japanese at all vowed to each other

168
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:04,255
We had sworn that we would resist the American and English Devil's until the last single one of us was dead

169
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,840
If necessary the women and children would resist with bamboo sticks

170
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:12,703
Trying to kill as many enemy troops as they could before being killed themselves

171
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:18,080
The wartime newspapers all played this idea up in the strongest possible language

172
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,615
According some of the slogan

173
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,128
One was

174
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,200
Another was

175
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,248
The Empire must be protected at any cost

176
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,344
Another one was 100 million dying for the call

177
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
He says quote

178
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,696
I was virtually brought up on this kind of talk

179
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:34,975
end quote

180
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
When Onoda got back to Japan

181
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,423
Some of the things that I read in some of his later actions indicate

182
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
But he was less than happy

183
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:52,639
With .. what had become of Japan after the war was over in terms of their National values their intensity level in what

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,224
Now I can

185
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:58,272
Speaker experience but in the 1970s

186
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
The rest of the world thought the Japan

187
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,392
Was still a very distinctive culture

188
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,183
And very committed to

189
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,768
Shall we call it the above and beyond the Call of Duty ethics

190
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,072
They seem very intense about that always

191
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,399
Something that they took very seriously they were known for in fact

192
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,168
Other people really

193
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,519
Like things like Japanese products because you knew that they were going to be intense about

194
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:24,639
You're getting it done right but to a guy raised by the standards of all known Azera

195
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:31,807
This was not good at they lost something and let me tell you what they probably lost and the rest of the world would consider this to be a good thing and I think

196
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,368
Modern Japanese wood for the most part 2

197
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,672
They weren't all prepared

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
Every man woman and child

199
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:43,583
To sacrifice themselves anymore to the level of your the world's greatest

200
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,375
Military units right

201
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,264
Act like Spartan hoplite die on command of the emperor like Spartan hoplites these people in the

202
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,823
Modern Japanese war were much more sensible

203
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,128
But in here all notice world

204
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
There's a level of insanity the

205
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,224
It's starting to happen in it

206
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,576
It's really complicated but it kind of explains why

207
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:09,440
The Japanese are this very distinctive different major power in the SEC

208
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,951
The world war

209
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:16,096
And why they're certain unique elements to the Pacific War against Japan that just wasn't present in the other theaters

210
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:17,375
Because I reset the Japanese word

211
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,192
Quick little run-down mighty

212
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,240
Explain some important things and by the way

213
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,264
Japanese cult

214
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:28,128
Culture is much debated as you would expect extremely complicated and definitely a place to be left

215
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,200
But let's just say

216
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,528
It was some pretty obvious things that we should take note of

217
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,087
That might help explain how you get such a

218
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Distinctive

219
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,696
People and let me use the word here that I like I like the wording.

220
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,816
I will point out my stepfather's generation and he fought in the Second World War

221
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,655
He believed that this regime and this

222
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,775
Government in the society that turned out a guy like he wrote on Lota with turning out fanatic

223
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,080
Another word that was much used amongst

224
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,408
They are

225
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Automatize near robot

226
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,480
And I should point out that

227
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,296
Wartime propaganda played into this but

228
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,368
Americans kind of had this image of both the

229
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:14,720
German opponent in the second world war and the Japanese opponent as robot

230
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,511
But different kind of robot

231
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,816
The German robot was like

232
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,864
The vision in The Avengers

233
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,216
Cold robotic mathematical deficient precise and deadly because

234
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,312
There's a coldness in a logical nature there

235
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
The Japanese is the other side of the robot specs

236
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,711
They're like foaming at the mouth crazy robot

237
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
They don't stop you have to

238
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:43,392
Did Littlefinger will come after you if you leave that alone and ready to die for the emperor excited to die for the emperor

239
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:46,464
Dora cartoon character that's extremely dangerous

240
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,024
The word fanatic is a wonderful way

241
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
To avoid having to look beneath the surface at any of the human motivations that might be bald red fanatic is just an A to B

242
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:56,960
Sony jerk

243
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
In terms of

244
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
You know the depth that they need to be examined

245
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,591
Real people

246
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
That might be extremely motivated or

247
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:12,063
Feel extreme pressure in societal and cultural coercion to do something for example fly

248
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:16,672
An aircraft piloted by then suicidally into an enemy ship

249
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
Those people might have

250
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:21,535
Some really interesting motivations to see

251
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,048
Interesting

252
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Points of view

253
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Where they think they're doing

254
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,216
What sort of a range of options and choices do they think they have

255
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,567
This becomes a much more human story when we realize two things one

256
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,871
Any of us could have been born there

257
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,919
Is a certain randomness

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Even if you believe

259
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:44,831
In Uno a DD selecting everything about you they could have selected that you end up in Japan in the 1920s

260
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,392
Go to school with Heroin OD

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,696
Besides that

262
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,768
There's a certain understanding

263
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,816
At what happened in Japan

264
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:58,399
Can happen again it will happen differently it never looks the same

265
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:00,960
But look at the elements involved

266
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,360
And wonder if you can't imagine them being filtered instead of three Japanese cultural filter the cultural filter of

267
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,384
Of your Society

268
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,480
But use the same way and turn to the same kind of uses

269
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,528
And maybe turning out the same kind of

270
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Intensity

271
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,231
Did the Japanese really seem to exude all throughout the story telling me point out there's a wonderful phrase

272
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,303
That was used by a rabbi to describe

273
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
The Jewish people

274
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,864
Once but I love it

275
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:35,264
Because I think it's a wonderful shorthand phrase that applies to a bunch of different very distinctive people on the planet and the shopping

276
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:36,288
These are certainly one of those

277
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,336
Substitute the word

278
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Choose

279
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Would Japanese

280
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,432
The rabbi said

281
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:44,480
The Japanese are like anyone else

282
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,272
Only more so

283
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,879
Don't know if I got the exact wording correct with its but the line is perfect because it did notes

284
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:56,511
A level of intensity right they have all the same human qualities as you do they just have them at a higher intensity

285
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,912
You think you are a good Gardener and your garden looks down when you're done in a raking and taking care of it will go look at a Japanese

286
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,447
He's guarding you feel like you didn't do anything

287
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
Intensity with which state

288
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,567
They pay attention even to the little lines in the dirt I mean

289
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
What happens if you take this in

290
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Density too far

291
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
Dial it up to high

292
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,600
Even if we're talking about being intense about are things that you normally

293
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,392
Considered to be positive today

294
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:29,792
Unless intense level mean your patriotism you got Duty. Love of country sacrifice for the Statham

295
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:32,864
All these things that so many people today we consider positives

296
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,400
How high do you have to

297
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,448
Turn the dial up on the intensity level though

298
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:40,544
I know we already have

299
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,312
I Want superhero run

300
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,897
They should have just happened in it but I got another one only cuz

301
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,712
The Japanese holdouts to me

302
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:52,576
Isn't that sort of like a Japanese version of the Captain America backstory

303
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,721
Right he goes he's a second world war person from the 40s gets put to sleep essentially get awakened

304
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:05,120
In the modern world and is continually contrasting in the last thing he should have remembered what in his mind

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,729
Like last week he was in the forties with the whirly finds now in the values and all these modern different thing

306
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:14,849
All these holdouts were like gone for decades aren't they all like Captain Japan's in that sense

307
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,688
I need the Japan of the 1970s.

308
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:20,225
Despite the rock music

309
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,017
The blue jeans in the longer hair

310
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:23,552
It would have been

311
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:26,113
On display for this Japanese war veteran

312
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:29,184
But the Japanese of the 1970s were still

313
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:32,000
Like everyone else only more so

314
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:36,865
But in the eyes of someone like oh nah that seems his attitude was not more so enough

315
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:43,009
Boston College a few things right away the first thing is it's one of the oldest

316
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:44,801
Tropes

317
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:45,568
In history

318
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,360
The people look back in

319
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,249
And pine away for golden age that they missed the really never existed and old people do this anyway

320
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,041
She probably got some of that go

321
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:55,808
Going on

322
00:16:55,808 --> 00:17:00,160
Let me also say that I know from personal experience cuz it's the era I grew up in

323
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:07,073
But in 1974 there were a lot of World War II veterans from the United States of America that didn't look too fondly of

324
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:08,608
The direction American culture was going

325
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:09,888
Or think

326
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:15,777
The intensity level of Devotion to ideals like Duty and honor and patriotism self-sacrifice

327
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:18,848
Was strong enough in the American culture of those days

328
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:20,384
So in a funny way

329
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:24,480
These bitter opponents in the second world war the Japanese Imperial Army

330
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,249
And the US

331
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,528
In the military

332
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,368
We had something in common if they were reminiscing about the kids today

333
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:31,904
Give me the early

334
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,184
Timmy 1970s

335
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,280
And you're on the surface there does seem to be a little something different

336
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,048
Doesn't there

337
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:44,449
From the Japanese to the Allied perspective if you're pining away for the Golden Age

338
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,472
On the Allied side

339
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,825
You're pining away for the things that brought you victory

340
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:50,848
Right at the kids today

341
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,128
Mi amor

342
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:58,272
Honor patriotism Love & Country let you know what we could do great things remember we did in the war we won the war but the Japanese didn't win the war

343
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,856
The war was a tragedy for them on so many levels

344
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,673
So why would you look back on the values

345
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:09,025
The kind of made you the kind of country you were that you can fight a war like that

346
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:12,865
If that's what it led to

347
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,449
Well perhaps the devil's

348
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:17,729
Counter argument here

349
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:19,520
Is it yes while

350
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:26,432
These specific values and the intensity of the era on a scale of one to ten ten being most intense the

351
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:32,320
I need during the era hero another growing up in our a1011 and yes that got them into trouble eventually and led to

352
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,136
Japan's downfall is a great power

353
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,721
The counter argument that can be made is Japan never would have been a great

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
Had it not been for

355
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,096
The very specific

356
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,913
Active nature of the Japanese and let's understand

357
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,704
This is a people

358
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:53,057
Not quite unique but darn near unique in the.

359
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:57,409
Of colonial Domination by the colonial powers of the western world

360
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:58,944
It managed to avoid that

361
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:05,088
They did not avoid it because anybody was going soft on anyone else or because Japan wasn't day

362
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,368
Tempting targets

363
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:07,393
Snap up

364
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,977
They avoided it because they created the kind of society and Military

365
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,537
It made it impossible for somebody to snap

366
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,840
And they did this

367
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:19,681
Well coming from way behind in the technological race

368
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,288
You know most Miracle like fashion that I think and remember you are getting my little toe

369
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:27,105
For good or ill

370
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:30,176
The intensity of the Japanese character

371
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,480
Is in large part I think

372
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,505
A factor in this

373
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:40,673
You start talking about like National characteristics it gets very easily bleeds are usually in a weird

374
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:42,721
Racism

375
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,000
Stop but it's not

376
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,048
A Japanese

377
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,608
Racial thing that accounts for the way they are to cultural

378
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,192
Carrots and sticks but by the way full disclaimer here

379
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,472
It's going to be a lot of Race 2

380
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:58,336
Not because it matters to me or because I think it's important

381
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:02,432
Because it matters to the people in this story and they think it's important

382
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:06,017
The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries one of the high water

383
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,601
What's College Global racism

384
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,393
And the pseudoscience

385
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:16,769
Stop it and it will impact this story to give you just one example without going to depleted when they will be cases where

386
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:17,792
I will just take

387
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:18,305
White

388
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,401
Western Society don't use the terms that are popular with the time. Because that's going to keep

389
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:24,449
We use the terms of use

390
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,497
Contemporaneously

391
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:27,520
But they will be white

392
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,057
Military powers

393
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:29,825
That will get

394
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,361
Badly hurt

395
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:38,017
From Miss judging the capabilities of a non-white power simply because in racial terms they considered them

396
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,065
Kind of subhuman we don't have to worry about

397
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:40,833
About those people because

398
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,625
I mean listen we're White

399
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,136
In there

400
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:44,416
I think the word that you

401
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,441
Used for monkeys

402
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,769
And the payback for that car make lie

403
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,305
Is to get your rear end

404
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,353
Handed to you by a bunch of people

405
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,169
And we that you underrated because of some weird

406
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:56,704
Construct

407
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,497
A racial superiority

408
00:20:58,497 --> 00:20:59,265
It warm

409
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,057
Your perception of reality

410
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:03,105
Of course you know what perception of real

411
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:03,616
Eventually

412
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,664
Meets the real reality in

413
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,737
There was some payback there more on that in a little bit

414
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:12,833
My point is we'll get to the racism thing and we'll talk about race cuz it matters in the story

415
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:14,368
It's very multi-racial

416
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,416
In an era that's very race

417
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
In this case though

418
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
How do you

419
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,913
Figure out you know who the Japanese are and why they are the way they are well first of all this is a subject for expert job

420
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:29,729
Obviously Japanese culture has been much debated even in the United

421
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:30,240
State

422
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,545
I remember the kid when they started

423
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,336
I'm selling a so much on cars

424
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
A fascination with this Japanese

425
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:39,201
Corporate culture in the way they did things

426
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,249
This is a much-talked-about thing

427
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,576
Per person like yours truly

428
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,441
I can only hit the big boys there are some obvious things that you can look at and go wow that must have effect

429
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:49,952
Did the story

430
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,817
I don't know how I don't know to what degree I don't know what mixes with the other factors but boy you can't ignore

431
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:58,144
Is a couple of those I want to get into

432
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,449
You're going to help explain how we get to where we are

433
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,288
Every society in the world right is a blend

434
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
I'm old and new

435
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
In the case of Japan

436
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,992
The proportion of old to new includes a lot more old than most places

437
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:15,297
This is by Design

438
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,881
And their history kind of consciously shows not just

439
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,393
Ave

440
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,209
Preserve this distinctive way of life

441
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,792
But how trying to preserve their distinctive

442
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,817
Culture

443
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:33,217
Can get them in trouble where they then need those qualities of intensity and everything we were talking about before 2.

444
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:36,800
Dig them out of a hole of their own creation is this interesting dynamic between

445
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,664
Are the Japanese wanted to remain distinctive that that causes problems that then their distinct tivity

446
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,201
Require them to help them get out of

447
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Without going too depleted

448
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Let me explain

449
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:47,553
A little of

450
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:48,065
The background

451
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,345
Big events

452
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,625
Raven

453
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,393
Reading

454
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:52,161
Japan for dummies

455
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,232
Hope you understand first of all we all get the idea

456
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
The geographically speaking

457
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,121
Japan has the opportunity to be different just because

458
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,424
There an island nation or in

459
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Series about

460
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:06,752
Having that

461
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,641
Little bit of water that cuts you off from the mainland allows you at times sometimes depending on the situation

462
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:14,432
In a long time to keep

463
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:21,088
The Ebbs and flows and tides and sometimes the storms raging on the big continent away from your shirt

464
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,929
Now the fact that you are an island does not

465
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:26,464
Determine

466
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,353
In any way shape and form how you develop their lots of different ways you could go for lots of different reason to me take a look at something on a map

467
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,656
Theoretically should be pretty simple

468
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,497
Take a look at Japan on the map of them take a look at the British Isles

469
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,848
Theoretically these places should be somewhat

470
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
Now I guess your name

471
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
And yet

472
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,224
The Japanese will have

473
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:53,856
Periods in their history where they as much as possible try to limit contact with the outside world.

474
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,161
That's just the way they wanted to go for reasons that are

475
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,184
Understandable once we get in

476
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,489
And the

477
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:01,025
English and British

478
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:06,401
In a larger sense or just the opposite I would going country might be a good way to put it so outgoing

479
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,424
Dubai the time

480
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
And we're setting up the story we're getting into now

481
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:14,848
They directly or indirectly control a huge chunk of the globe

482
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
The Japanese culture is a

483
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,457
Of course ancient

484
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:20,992
Dates back to

485
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:22,528
Really early time

486
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,113
And the relationship

487
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,673
That probably has meant the most

488
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:34,048
In Japanese history to the development of that island nation is the one that they've had long-term

489
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
With China

490
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,633
Jupiter

491
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:40,704
Review stage if you ask a Chinese person they might say it's the Sun

492
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:46,080
Not a necessarily impossible to justify point of view either if you think about

493
00:24:46,593 --> 00:24:49,921
In a China basically being the superpower of East Asia

494
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,272
Throughout most of human history except for certain period of time when it

495
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,553
Reaches certain low point

496
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:59,904
Boynton power when does the civilization stock market dips for the Chinese stock

497
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
But most of the time in China

498
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,840
Of the world is at least as powerful as today's modern day China is

499
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,121
Things so stable
