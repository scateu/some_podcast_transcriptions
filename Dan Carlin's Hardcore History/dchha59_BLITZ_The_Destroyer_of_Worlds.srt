1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
Been a long time since we've done a blitz Edition

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
And as a friend pointed out to me when I explain that this latest program of ours is going to be a 6 hour long show

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,056
That we were going to classify as a blitz Edition

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,640
Is it don't take this the wrong way but I'm not sure you know the meaning of the word

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
And I laughed because he's right

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,600
These started off this idea of a blitz show was going to be something to help us get more shows out

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,952
And some nice quick ones right another words in addition to these great epics it took forever and

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
You have killed us and have killed you listen to them

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,096
We have things in between and they grew too cuz I'm obviously

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
I have a problem I'm addicted to contact

11
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Is one of you sad

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,776
A firm believer in the past is prologue

13
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:50,432
And there's no good natural place to start any story right everything's connected it's arbitrary where you decide to begin thing

14
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
That's how I

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,600
And I show I wanted to do about Cleopatra that stretched into a six-part series on Rome

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
Because where do you start the Cleopatra story

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
The reason I chose the topic

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,632
The originally chose for today's program has cuz I thought it artificially constrained me it's 2 weeks long

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Possibly

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
Do a really long show

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
On a two week long event well

22
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
6 hours later here we are

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
And it's also a blitz Edition which now doesn't have anything to do with the length of the show it's turned out through Evolution to be a different kind of show that

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Focuses

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
A different things

26
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Instead of being about

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
People

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
Or events

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
Or error has specifically

30
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,792
Usually they focus on an idea or question

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
And then

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,888
In a weave history around the question somehow

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Usually the recipe

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
As a slightly less drama

35
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,616
Historical epics but slightly more twist does we call those

36
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Musings in

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Weird Twilight Zone things that

38
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
Should have come with the territory with these programs

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
For what it's worth this could have been a two-parter

40
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
But we didn't want to do that to you so you get one long one instead

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
And maybe in an experimental

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
Never here to see what works

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
And in addition to some feedback we got from you folks we tried

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
Arbitrarily after-the-fact mind you it wasn't

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Put together this way

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
The separate

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,592
The show into sections books book 1 book 2

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
In places where maybe there are natural breaks

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Stopping points or what have you

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
We'll see based on your feedback whether you like that approach or not

51
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
Finally this is a very unusual story to tell

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,256
Because unlike most historical Tales which are about things that happened

53
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
It's about something that didn't happen

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Almost happen

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
And still could happen

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
Undertale being told

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
In the middle of the story

58
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
In in

59
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,456
Unfolding series of events that are still ongoing

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,368
So why you can feel like you somehow have a bit of a spoiler knowing how this will turn out

61
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,720
In a specific case we're talking about here in this tale today

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Because it's an ongoing story

63
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,352
There's no guarantee that you actually do know the end

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
In that sense

65
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
This story is not just

66
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,896
Prologue for the event I originally wanted to talk about which was the Cuban Missile Crisis

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
It's prologue

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
For our own future potentially

69
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
Strapping

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Get ready for a

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
6 hour Blitz Edition

72
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
We call it by the Light

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Andheri romantic comedy

74
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Style title

75
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
The destroyer of worlds

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
December 7th 1941

77
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
A date which will live its hardcore history

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
The blitz Edition

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
Anytime you hear and Analysis

80
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Alaris PC

81
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Explaining

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Are strong and are weak points

83
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,007
Why we are where we are today you'll hear someone talk about human adaptability won't you

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
The fact that we can adapt

85
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
This is something that's tied your intelligence obviously for changing circumstances has helped us overcome all sorts of problems

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
Walls that you might have hit along the way for civilizational growth

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
To transcend all those boundaries and here we find ourselves in the 21st century today

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Alive and thriving

89
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,471
But with several major problems in the distance that have the potential to change that fact

90
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Unless we'd

91
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Adapt

92
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Around them

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,479
Now given our past history he would think that we've shown quite the attitude in adopting

94
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
But some of these problems

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,927
May require adaptation Beyond which we are cape

96
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,791
Do you hit an adaptation wall at some point Beyond which you can no longer

97
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
Change as a society as a species as humankind

98
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
There are things that we have done from time immemorial

99
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Fill up your history books from start to finish

100
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
It would be unimaginable if we did them today

101
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
But considering our track record history wise

102
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
What are the odds will never do them again

103
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Case in point

104
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
We currently live in an era of human history that some have referred to as the long peace

105
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
Began in 1945

106
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Obviously

107
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
There hasn't been a whole lot of pee since 1945 there's been lots of conflict people get bombed all the time and mean

108
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,247
Human violence is ongoing and continuous

109
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
What that refers to is

110
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Conflict between the great powers

111
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
The kinds of Wars you've seen

112
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
From Mesopotamia onward

113
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,631
The world for 30 Years War

114
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
The Hundred Years War

115
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
The Punic Wars

116
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Trevor

117
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
One of the constants of human history right

118
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,943
Up until about 70 or so years ago

119
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,343
Of course it was 70 or so years ago 1945

120
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
For humankind

121
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,279
Continuously improving their weapons technology from the Stone Age forward

122
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,935
Finally reached a point where they had created a weapon system that might be too destructive to be used

123
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
And yet if mankind has always used their Innovative technology to create better weapons and always use those better

124
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Weapons

125
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
What did this mean

126
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
The Norms of human behavior

127
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Mankind simply treated

128
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,951
The things that we discovered at the end of the second world war the way we treated every other weapon we've ever created

129
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
What would happen to the world today

130
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
What makes you think though that this is a theoretical question

131
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
There is no guarantee that the long piece

132
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Last forever

133
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
And it's unimaginable to think about what a general War amongst great Powers would even look like with the kind of

134
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Technology we possess today

135
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Humankind is

136
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,279
70 + years into an ongoing and unending experiment

137
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
Can we handle our weapons technology

138
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
The only way this experiment ever concludes

139
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
Is if we find out that we can't

140
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,687
There's a famous quote that may or may not have been said you never know about these things by

141
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
The great physicist Albert Einstein

142
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
You supposed to send something to the effect that he doesn't know

143
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
With what sort of weapons

144
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
The third world war will be fought with

145
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
The one after that will be fought with sticks and stones

146
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
My favorite

147
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Phrases

148
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
Pointed a certain point during the long peace

149
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
Which was attributed to Air Force General Curtis LeMay but he swears he never said it

150
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
When bombing someone back to the Stone Age

151
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
Is something like that even possible

152
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
What are the odds

153
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
That we get to find out

154
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,351
I think what I find so interesting about both those quotes the Einstein one and the Lemay one

155
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Is that they both invoke this idea

156
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,311
Of knocking Humanity back on the civilization scale a few rungs

157
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Below where we are now

158
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
As we all know human history

159
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:30,111
As I described it as kind of like a stock market and you have your UPS when civilization reaches new levels of sophistic

160
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
Location and technological capabilities and all that in

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
And then you have your downs and it's sort of weird for modern people to realize that they were ever people who lived in a Time

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Where their forebears were more technologically sophisticated than they were we've been kind of on a long stock market

163
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
It runs since about the Renaissance tour

164
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Really the Middle Ages

165
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Haven't had any downturns

166
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
You know within

167
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
1000 or more years

168
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,319
Start getting pretty fat and happy and comfortable and you forget that they may be are variables out there

169
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
They could do to us what

170
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Giant plagues that wiped out

171
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
You know what quarter of the population could do back in the old days

172
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Take for example

173
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
With both Einstein and Lemay were referring to

174
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Nuclear war

175
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Between the great powers

176
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
But we used to call World War 3

177
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,615
Once upon a time when I was growing up even

178
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Seem to be like a gun

179
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
Aimed at your head and you walked around with this all the time a Sword of Damocles over your entire Society really

180
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
The entire world

181
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
Cuz it didn't matter if you were a neutral country

182
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
During the Cold War

183
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
All-out nuclear exchange happened between

184
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
The United States and its allies

185
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
And the Soviet Union and its allies

186
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983
Switzerland wasn't escaping unscathed by just cuz they were neutral

187
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Became the first time in human history where you had the potential

188
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
For a single human being we really don't know how these things run

189
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
But the potential for a single human being to have the power

190
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,647
To destroy tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of lives

191
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
With a decision window of minutes

192
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
By the giving of an order

193
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,679
You think of all of the really scary people in human history from a power standpoint Theory

194
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,775
Your djingis Khan Dior Alexander the Great you name it Dior Hitler's it doesn't matter

195
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
None of them had that kind of power

196
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
Genghis Khan decided he was going to destroy your civilization

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
You were in for 10 20 30 years of war maybe especially if you were China

198
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,391
If Richard Nixon in 1969 decide to Nuke China

199
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
You destroy a hundred million people in an afternoon

200
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Nobody's ever had that kind of power before

201
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,631
It's a unique new human experience and you don't get many of those

202
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
Although the people that were there the 400 450

203
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Special

204
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Human beings

205
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,383
Witness the birth of the atomic / nuclear age

206
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
Realise the minute they saw it

207
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Did everything a chain

208
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
The successful testing of an atomic bomb was of course the famous Trinity bomb test from July 16th

209
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
1945

210
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
And Not only was the weapon successful which was not a given

211
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
What was more powerful

212
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Then the physicists unexpected

213
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,031
And many of them is not all of them could look into the future and see

214
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,895
This was a weapon that was only going to grow in power as time went on as

215
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Powerful is the test they had just witnessed was

216
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
This is scratching the surface

217
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Of what this new era

218
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367
Will provide in terms of weaponry

219
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
J Robert Oppenheimer

220
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
Sometimes called the father of the atomic bomb describe the moment

221
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Did the bomb went off

222
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
This way in the 1965 interview on a program called the decision to drop the bomb

223
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Quote

224
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
We knew the world would not be the same

225
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
In the world would not be the same

226
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
True people

227
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
People crying

228
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
People were silent

229
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
I remember that

230
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,399
Line from the Hindu scripture the bhagavad-gita

231
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Trying to persuade

232
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
You should do is Tuesday

233
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Quinn Preston

234
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Multi-armed form

235
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
I am become death

236
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Destroyer of worlds

237
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Now I am become death

238
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
The destroyer of worlds

239
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,919
All the old religious texts always have so much power to the language don't they and in this case

240
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
It matched what

241
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists

242
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
Created and saw on witnessing

243
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,903
That day must have been a whole slew of mixed emotions for those people

244
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
The famous Manhattan Project was a

245
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
Giant Endeavor to build

246
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
A super weapon

247
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
And some of the greatest Minds in

248
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Physics

249
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,311
And science is related to that from all over the world were brought together massive amounts of

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,175
Resources and Manpower and money devoted to the project

251
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,087
And all these people sitting on pins and needles during the test because nobody knew this was going to work or not

252
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
There are a lot of reputations on the line all sorts of

253
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,815
Giant amounts of pressure and tension so when the bomb went off

254
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,447
It was a huge sense of relief and Triumph but mixed emotions among some of the physicist

255
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Not all of them by the way

256
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,383
But people like Oppenheimer for sure and the reason for the Mixed Emotions was

257
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
If you had already seen

258
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,319
How the last year but would become the last year of the second world war 1945 had gone

259
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Who would have thought

260
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Anyone needed to create a superweapon

261
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,327
It was much of an improvement on the technology as it was being Unleashed that year in the war

262
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
1945

263
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,495
Cities were being wiped off the map couple of times a week

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Cities

265
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
If there's one thing the second world war proved yet again

266
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Is it doesn't matter

267
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,551
How many arms limitation ideas you want to float

268
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
You know when you're not in Total War

269
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
How much you have these genteel ideas about how

270
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Weapons will be used and when they will and won't be employed

271
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,911
When you are fighting with everything you have against the other great powers in what's called total war

272
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
There is nothing in the Arsenal

273
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,775
But you are not prepared to use

274
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
People sometimes point out poison gas wasn't used

275
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,479
Any sort of Major Way in the second world war but the reason why is because it wasn't a war winning tool

276
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
If it had been

277
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
Lady used it

278
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,415
Wasn't worth what would happen in return to you

279
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,767
For something that amounted to essentially a minor irritant in terms of the war effort

280
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
Nuclear weapons would have been a different thing

281
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
I mean imagine if Hitler

282
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
And the Nazis have gotten hold of a nuclear bomb first

283
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
That's the thought that motivated

284
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
A number of those physicists involved in the Manhattan

285
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,759
Project deny Germany the chance to get nuclear weapons before the allies

286
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,623
Some of the more less enthused once they realize while there's no way that they're going to beat us in this race

287
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Because then all of a sudden

288
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
You've worked to create a superweapon

289
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
And you put it in the hands

290
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Human being

291
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
Therein lies both the problem and the challenge

292
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,311
And the physicists when they thought to themselves about this

293
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
New it

294
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
When they

295
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Talk about

296
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
How we are all going to survival world

297
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
Where the Weaponry is is powerful

298
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,183
The modern descendants of those weapons that were originally used at the end of the second World War

299
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,559
The physicists talk about us needing to grow as a species

300
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Or else is sort of what's implied

301
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,775
And I would suggest that in most of these quotes you can hear them

302
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:54,431
Looking on the bright side or putting the best face on the idea of now that we have the super weapons what does it mean

303
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
For mankind Oppenheimer himself said quote

304
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
It did not take Atomic weapons to make man want peace but the atomic bomb was the turn of the screw

305
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Screw the atomic bomb made the prospect of future War

306
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Unendurable

307
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,863
You just let us up those last few steps to the mountain pass

308
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
I'm beyond there is a different country

309
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
And quote

310
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
In other words we could never quite

311
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
Get that piece thing right till we had the right incentive the fact that we'll all be blown to Kingdom Come is the right incentive

312
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Hail piece

313
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
That's putting a good face on an Oppenheimer wasn't always so positive

314
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Arthur Holly Compton also physicist

315
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Bro quote

316
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,327
It is hard to think of fissionable materials when fashioned into bombs

317
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
As being a source of happiness

318
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
However this may be

319
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
It was such destructive weapons mentor to survive

320
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
They must grow rapidly in human greatness

321
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
A new level of human understanding is needed

322
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:01,503
The reward for using the Adam's Power toward man's welfare is great and sure

323
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
The punishment for its misuse

324
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Would seem to be deaf

325
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,183
And the destruction of the civilization that has been growing for a thousand years

326
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
These are the Alternatives that Atomic power

327
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
As the steel of Daedalus

328
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Presents to mankind

329
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
We are forced to grow into greater manhood

330
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
And quote

331
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,055
Is that a nice way of saying adapt or die

332
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,407
When it comes to altering modes of human behavior

333
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
That have been a part of the story

334
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
Since there's been a story

335
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,367
Of course not all the physicists always look at the bright side on this question

336
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,023
Is a famous quote by Albert Einstein and makes him sound like he's a bit of a pessimist when it comes to the question of

337
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,375
Society's ability to adapt or die in this question he's supposed to have said quote

338
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,727
The Unleashed power of the atom has changed everything

339
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Save our modes of thinking

340
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,847
And thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe

341
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
A gun aimed at our heads

342
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
Sword of Damocles something we were very aware of

343
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,743
When I was a kid we did Duck and Cover drills for atomic bombs dropping nuclear bombs

344
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
By then

345
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
That kind of still pointed at our heads

346
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,519
We just don't notice it anymore because so many people have grown up in the shadow of that they're used to it

347
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
If somebody is pointing a gun at your head all the time

348
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Eventually do you forget about it

349
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
If you're born with a gun pointed

350
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
Towards your head do you even notice it

351
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
In a way I kind of see the ability of people to forget that that gun is aimed at them as an evolution

352
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Married

353
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Success tool

354
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,887
Why should these people be traumatized because of something that happened 70 or so years ago

355
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
They had the wrong lives our own problems our own world to deal with

356
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
I mean if we all had to

357
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Carry the baggage

358
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Preceding Generations on our backs all the time

359
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
What were we be dealing with

360
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,879
I sent it to Healing mechanism but his healing the same as forgetting it seems to me

361
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,768
One of the main things working against the idea of this long piece continuing indefinitely

362
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
This we don't remember why it was so important

363
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
We never have another great power War to begin with

364
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,080
If the Sword of Damocles has not fallen in a while you forget how sharp it is

365
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Affordable Mexican leave

366
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
British philosopher Bertrand

367
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Russell

368
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Once made it sound like the odds of human beings managing

369
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,392
To avoid

370
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:54,048
Having to be reminded how sharp The Sword of Damocles is going to come to nuclear war seems unlikely he wrote quote

371
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:59,680
You may reasonably expect a man to walk a tightrope safely for ten minutes

372
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,288
It would be unreasonable to do so without accident for two hundred years

373
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
And quote

374
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
If you want to be reminded

375
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,784
Of what that Sword of Damocles can do

376
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,648
There's only two real world examples that you can go study

377
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
That will tell you

378
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
There's a lot of scientists out there and calculations done in testing

379
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
But the only thing that really compares

380
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
If you want to see not a glimpse into the past of a singular Human Experience it only happened twice to a certain group of human

381
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
Individuals in a certain situation

382
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
But instead you want to see

383
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
20 future nuclear attack

384
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,432
Will look like

385
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
You have to look at the only two that there has never been

386
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,136
Atomic bombings of Hiroshima August 6th 1945

387
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
And the one right afterwards

388
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
2 Days Later

389
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Nagasaki

390
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,864
These days when the atomic bombings are discussed it's often

391
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,984
In the context of discussing the morality of dropping them was it right to use them at all

392
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
I find

393
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
The problem with these

394
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Discussions and I talked about it at length

395
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
In other programs

396
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Is this idea

397
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,064
That the people involved at the time the decision-makers had as much

398
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,160
Free range of options of people today assume they have when they didn't

399
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
I mean the idea that President Truman

400
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Could have done something besides drop the bomb

401
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Is a little bit out of Step

402
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,472
With the political realities he was dealing with at the time

403
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
Historian Garry Wills who wrote a whole book on the

404
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,872
Power of the atomic bomb to change everything

405
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,200
Had this to say about what would have happened if Truman had decided

406
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
Not to use the bombs which would use them in another way

407
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,440
The other person by the way mentioned in this protist General Groves General Groves was the military head of the Manhattan

408
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
In his book bomb power is storing Garry Wills rights quote

409
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
If it became known that the United States had a knockout weapon it did not use the families of any Americans killed

410
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
After the development of the bomb would be furious

411
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
The public to press and Congress would turn on the president and his advisers there would have been a cry to impeach president

412
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
Truman and court-martial general Groves the administration would be convicted of spending billions of dollars and Dre

413
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,672
Draining massive amounts of bring power and Manpower from other War projects and all for nothing

414
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
And quote

415
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
In addition to that and this is often overlooked I think by people

416
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
Who talked about the morality of dropping a bomb

417
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,728
Wifey Hiroshima and Nagasaki weapons on civilians

418
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,848
And that's what the Japanese civilians were already putting up with on a daily basis

419
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
What the Germans had started in places like Rotterdam and 1940 and the Japanese have done in China before the second

420
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
World War even officially started

421
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
I've been developed

422
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,208
Into the area weapons we saw from 1943 onward

423
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,072
And they were devastating without the nuclear bombs at all

424
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
In March 1945 months before the atomic bombs were dropped Tokyo was hit with a fire bombing raid to kill the

425
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
100000 people

426
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Vaporized

427
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,968
17 square miles of the capital and by the time the atomic bombs were dropped 50 to 60 square miles of toe

428
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Tokyo gone

429
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
And it has been taken off

430
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
The top priority targeting list

431
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,696
Some 60 plus other Japanese cities

432
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,512
And had the same fate meted out to them

433
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,608
It was a logical extension a natural progression if you will

434
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Total War

435
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
It's a dynamic

436
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,288
That would have been very difficult if not impossible to stop

437
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
It's partly the reason why

438
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
When we discuss another Total War today

439
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
It's so scary

440
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,576
Because the idea that human beings could control what's going on is an illusion

441
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
It has a momentum all its own

442
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Now there are some things

443
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,584
We're different about the atomic bombings and that blow me away to this day

444
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,400
One is the instantaneous nature of

445
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,288
It's hard enough you would think to get your mind around the changes that happened to your city

446
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
During a massive

447
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Late War bombing raid

448
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:31,296
I mean if you have five hundred or a thousand heavy bombers flying over your city practically wingtip to win

449
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,392
Dropping incendiary in high explosive bombs on your town

450
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
How hard is that to get your mind around

451
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
When you crawl out of the bomb shelter

452
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,632
See what used to be your city in Ruins how hard is that to get your mind around

453
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,544
What If instead of happening over 24 to 36 hour time. It happens in the blink of an eye

454
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
Well that's what the atomic bombs did

455
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,968
The best relatively short description I've read

456
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Aldi

457
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Effect of the two bombs

458
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,416
Was Panda by author Susan Southard in her book about Nagasaki

459
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
He says that within a second of the bomb being dropped

460
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,608
The fireball with 750 ft in diameter

461
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
When the temperature

462
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,520
In the fireball was 540000 degrees Fahrenheit

463
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
Higher than at the center of the sun she writes

464
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
She says

465
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Quote

466
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,296
The bombs vertical blast pressure crushed much of the urakami valley

467
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
Horizontal black twins tour through the region a two and a half times the speed of a category 5

468
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Hurricane

469
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
Pulverizing building trees

470
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Plants

471
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
Animals and thousands of men women and children

472
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
In every direction

473
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:56,544
People were blown out of their shelters houses factories schools and hospital beds

474
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,896
Catapulted against walls or flattened beneath collapsed buildings

475
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
Those working in the fields

476
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,784
Riding streetcars and standing in line at City ration stations

477
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
We're blown off their feet

478
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,904
Or hit by plummeting to breathe and press to the scalding Earth

479
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
An Iron Bridge moved 28in Downstream

480
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
Is there buildings began to implode

481
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:24,960
Patients and Hospital staff jumped out of the windows of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital and mobilized

482
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,104
High school girls leaked from a third-story of shiroyama Elementary School 1/2 mile from the blast

483
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
And quote

484
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,480
She then points out that a survivor

485
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
Emphasized

486
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
That all happened

487
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
In an instant

488
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
Think of the shock that this engenders

489
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,768
And it seemed to be your two things in quick succession

490
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Will really three first if you saw it you got the light

491
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
And if you weren't shielded from the light somehow it burns you

492
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
It looked

493
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:01,056
Kind of like it's been described differently but like a flashbulb going off of an old camera

494
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Facts of a bluish white light

495
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
Then it was the blastwave

496
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,272
Which you could level everything depending on how far away from it you were

497
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
And then they were the fires

498
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,672
Which seem to break out several minutes after the actual glasses though

499
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,488
Everything we're sort of heated up and it took a minute for

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
The kindling to

501
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,656
Catch a light but then it did everywhere at once and some of the most heroin stories

502
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Come from family members

503
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Would be trying to get another family member

504
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,896
You know who was stuck in the debris that was all of a sudden everywhere out as the Flames approached and had to leave them

505
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
Essentially saying goodbye as they watch their child

506
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
Stuck in the rubble is the Flames approaches

507
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,600
It's horrifying stuff in the people who were first on the scene

508
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
In both cities

509
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Talk about running into

510
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
Are human zombies if you will

511
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Silent People

512
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Burned almost beyond recognition

513
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
They were like in a trance

514
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
Hiroshima Survivor Hiroshi Shiba Yama

515
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,872
Saw the explosion and ran toward the city center where the bomb and gone off

516
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
I said quote

517
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:16,576
When we are done about one kilometer we were brought to a standstill by a grotesque group of people

518
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,136
The blood pounded in our heads again

519
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
I remember that my eyes were drawn and aux ribly to the scene

520
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
The people were burned so badly

521
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
But it was hard to distinguish feature from feature

522
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
And all were blackened is it covered with soot

523
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Their clothes were in rags many were naked

524
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
Their hands hung limply in front of them

525
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,104
The skin of their hands and arms dangled from their fingertips

526
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
Their faces were not the faces of the living

527
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
And quote

528
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
He then went on to point out

529
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
The heat scene

530
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
Quite a few normal Air Raids up close but this was different

531
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Quote

532
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,464
How can I comprehend what I saw before me now

533
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
It was not just a group of injured people

534
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,608
Nor was it a procession of the dead or a band of ghosts

535
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
No sound came from these figures

536
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
They seem to have given up

537
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,776
The pity that they engendered is beyond expression

538
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,104
I continue to stream past in deathly quiet

539
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
How can anyone describe them

540
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
Their clothes ripped from them by the force of the explosion

541
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,528
Their bodies burned by the intense Heat

542
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Somewhere completely naked

543
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
And others had only two shirts stuck to their bodies

544
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
The injuries to their faces

545
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
We're particularly cruel

546
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
Unscathed then with clothes intact

547
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
I felt like an intruder

548
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
And quote

549
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
The general estimates of the

550
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,824
Casualties from the Hiroshima bomb for example are between 70 and 80000 dead

551
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
From the fire and explosion

552
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
More killed later by radiation

553
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm probably an equal number of people injured

554
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
The Nagasaki bomb numbers

555
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
We're somewhat lower due to all sorts of different reasons

556
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Nonetheless

557
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,352
The tens of thousands of deaths maybe almost a hundred thousand in one city

558
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Cause

559
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Buy a single bomb

560
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
Was an exponential growth in the power of the weaponry

561
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,128
After the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima

562
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:22,016
US President Harry Truman went on television to try to explain to the American people

563
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
The rest of the world

564
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
What does new weapon laws

565
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
Essentially

566
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Officially

567
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Bring the rest of the world up to speed that an entirely New Era

568
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Heptagon

569
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Atomic age

570
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,544
A short time ago an American airplane

571
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,360
Gospel run bomb on Hiroshima

572
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
And destroyed its usefulness to the enemy

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,064
That bomb has more power than 20000 tons of TNT

574
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,416
Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor

575
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,488
They have been repaid manyfold

576
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
And the end is not yet

577
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:11,680
We have now added a new and revolutionary increase

578
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
In destruction

579
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
The supplement The Growing Power of our Armed Forces

Prison farm

581
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
These bombs are now in production

582
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,272
And even more powerful firms are in development

583
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
It is an atomic bomb

584
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,928
It is a Honey Singh of the basic power of the universe

585
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,024
What's the sunrise his power has been loosed

586
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,864
I guess those who bus route to the Far East

Astorian Michael S Sherry

588
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,080
Says that there were overlapping feelings on the part of the American public

589
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,408
To finding out that this new reality existed

590
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Your rights quote

591
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,040
A cacophony of reactions to the bombs Advent

592
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
A rose swiftly among America

593
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,232
Some stressed pride in American achievement and satisfaction in gaining Vengeance against the Japanese

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,632
Truman's announcement that the Japanese quote have been repaid many fold and quote for Pearl Harbor

595
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
A minority of Americans wish the war had gone on longer

596
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,032
Some more atomic bombs could have been used against Japan

597
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Others

598
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:26,432
Especially soldiers who assumed that an invasion of Japan was the only alternative to the bombs use

599
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
Welcome to the peace that the bomb head speed

600
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,576
And the bomb itself as a tool for enforcing continued peace

601
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Overlapping those other reactions was another

602
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
As in responding to the Holocaust

603
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,816
Many Americans saw the bomb as evidence of the scourge of Modern War

604
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:47,168
In the face of which the wisdom of American use seen the minor matter

Ali quotes in New York

606

Herald Tribune article

607
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
From the era

608
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Which said quote

609
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
One forgets the effect on Japan

610
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,968
As one senses the foundation of One's Own Universe trembling

611
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
And cool

612
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
Same CBS News correspondent Edward R Murrow

613
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Put it this way

614
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
At the time

615
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Quote

616
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Seldom if ever has a war ended leaving the victors with such a sense of uncertainty and fear

617
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
With such a realisation that the future is obscure

618
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
And it's survival is not assured

619
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Indica

620
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
So all Americans could be glad that the bomb

621
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Was in their hands

622
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,624
It was a clear sense and understanding that this would probably not always remain the case

623
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,232
Something like that when you were used to having two oceans

624
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
It kept you safe

625
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
From anybody doing any major damage to your country of the sort that other countries were very familiar with during the second World War

626
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,264
Could set the foundations of your Universe trembling

627
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,360
And this is where you begin to get this device

628
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
This idea on the part of some

629
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:08,576
And everything has changed and so the human species is going to have to shed themselves of habits they had forever

630
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,184
When people who view themselves anyway as much more

631
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Firmly attached to reality

632
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,072
I think that what we have here is just a natural extension

633
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Of

634
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Technological change

635
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
Working in the benefit of

636
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,496
Our side the good side

637
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,824
President Harry Truman call the atomic bomb

638
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
The greatest thing in the history of the world

639
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,248
The following year after the bombs were dropped in the war was over

640
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
They would be famous meeting where they

641
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,880
Who headed up the Manhattan Project

642
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,464
Meet face-to-face with the president who dropped

643
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Is creation twice

644
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,632
Oppenheimer is a perfect example of the side that feels

645
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
As though Pandora's Box

646
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Has been opened

647
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,312
He feels increasingly responsible for picking the lock on it

648
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,176
It sounds like President Truman was caught off guard

649
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,968
Oppenheimer's

650
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Gilt

651
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
There are many different

652
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
Quotes of this account and they're all different

653
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
In their book to win a nuclear war Michio Kaku and Daniel Axelrod

654
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
Tell the story

655
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
This way

656
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Oppenheimer in the president

657
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
And the Secretary of State

658
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
Are talking

659
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Quote

660
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
In the course of the conversation

661
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:38,176
Oppenheimer told Truman mr. president I feel I have blood on my hands

662
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,808
Truman then reached into his top pocket removed and neatly folded handkerchief and offered it

663
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Would you like to wipe them

664
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
After Oppenheimer left

665
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
Truman turn to Dean Acheson the under Secretary of State instructed him not to bring Oppenheimer around anymore

666
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Undeclared

667
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:02,240
Blood on his hands damn it he hasn't happened much blood on his hands as I have you just don't go around belly aching

668
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
In about it

669
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
And quote

670
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,896
Amore R-rated version of the story

671
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Is told

672
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,016
In Jean-Jacques Salomon science at politique

673
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Where he said quote

674
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,672
Oppenheimer when he went into Truman's office with Dean Acheson

675
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
Said to the ladder wringing His Hands by a blood on my hands

676
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Truman later said to Atchison

677
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,216
Never bring that f****** Cretin in here again he didn't drop the bomb I did that kind of weeping this make me sick

678
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
And quote

679
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Truman could dismiss

680
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,480
Oppenheimer but he was far from the only Atomic scientist who was Gravely concerned

681
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
Even before the two bombs were used

682
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,440
On Japan in the second world war more than 70 Atomic scientists signed a petition

683
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
With a bunch of different things in it but among

684
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Other concerns

685
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,912
Would that the bombs were going to be used against cities and people and they suggested using them

686
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Offshore

687
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
Uninhabited areas

688
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,944
Truman as we said had a whole bunch of different pressures working on him that the scientist didn't have working on

689
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Damn

690
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
Once the war was over

691
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
All of a sudden the Outlook

692
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,208
Could change cuz he could afford to be change your not in hot blood anymore you're in Cold Blood

693
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
Now you have in your hands

694
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
These new weapons

695
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
What do you do with them

696
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
How do you control them

697
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Who's in charge of them

698
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
And what if either country you get them to

699
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,296
There were in the Years 1945 and 1946 a lot of tug-of-war zand

700
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,136
All sorts of questions being debated I mean the number one

701
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,720
For a while I was who's in charge of atomic weapons

702
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
The military seem like a logical choice

703
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,448
Their argument why is it we're going to have to use them we ought to be in control of him and know what we're doing

704
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
Truman is supposed to have said something to the effect of I'm not going to let some

705
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,128
Dandy lieutenant-colonel decide he wants to start an atomic war

706
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Eventually that power would be

707
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,320
Rested into the hands of the civilian authorities and the president particularly

708
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
He was going to be the one

709
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Who had the power to decide

710
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,280
To push the button as it will be known later

711
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,168
Historian Garry Wills said this is one of the effects the atomic bomb had

712
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,544
It changed the American constitutional system almost quietly

713
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
Due to the technological

714
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Necessities

715
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
That the weapon required hero quote

716
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:59,136
Lodging the fate of the world in one man with no constitutional check on his actions

717
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,464
Cause of violent break in our whole governmental system

718
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,072
General Groves had a mirror simulacrum about Authority

719
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
And only for a single project

720
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,704
Presidents now have it as part of their permanent assignment

721
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
This was in effect

722
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
A quiet Revolution

723
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,896
It was accepted under the impression that technology imposed it has a harsh necessity

724
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,968
In case of nuclear attack on the United States

725
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,064
The president would not have time to consult Congress or instruct the public

726
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
He must respond instantly

727
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,464
Which means that you must have the whole scientific apparatus for response

728
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
On constant alert

729
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
Accountable only to him

730
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:44,192
If on the other hand a danger to our allies or unnecessary assets is posed

731
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,008
Calling for a nuclear initiative on his part

732
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,848
He cannot issue a warning ahead of time without alerting the enemy

733
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:55,199
Like President Truman who was told he could not forewarn Japan

734
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,759
He must act with a loan Authority

735
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,575
The nature of the presidency he writes

736
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Was irrevocably altered

737
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,671
By this grant of a unique power

738
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
And quote

739
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
So already the nature of the weapons

740
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,119
Was changing the way we do things

741
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
On a national level here in the United States but the question of how this might change things on a human wide level

742
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,335
Was being widely debated as well

743
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,199
In the Years 1945 and 1946 there are some very interesting

744
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,015
Relatively unique ideas

745
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Floated in the world

746
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
A public opinion

747
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
And governmental proposals

748
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
There's intent in those years

749
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
An active attempt

750
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,887
To try to put the nuclear Genie back in the bottle

751
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,239
To eliminate Atomic weapons from the face of the Earth

752
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,847
And almost as if to pretend that they had never been discovered at all

753
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,735
There are two things to understand before we get into this the first thing is

754
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,623
All this is occurring when the bodies from the second world war are still warm

755
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
And after these terrible

756
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:16,351
The shattering Wars you often have a hangover. Afterwards were people are understandably

757
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
In one of these moods where they say

758
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,055
Never again this can never be allowed to happen again and at the end of the second world war you throw the

759
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,639
Advent of atomic weapons in at the very end there

760
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,479
That the definitive extra! On that never again

761
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
That's what this seems

762
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:39,647
Like a pie-in-the-sky rainbows and unicorns utopian approach to things realize

763
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
That they're living

764
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
At the last time the Sword of Damocles dropped

765
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
And they have a justifiable fear of it

766
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:53,727
The other thing to take into account and I'm not a historian so you're not going to see me picking the right approach

767
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Is that

768
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
This can be a legitimate

769
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
Proposal that were talking about here

770
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
This could be for public consumption

771
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,015
And behind-the-scenes realpolitik

772
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,647
And geopolitical chess matches and business-as-usual can be going on

773
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,023
In October 1945 which is right after the second world war ends

774
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,351
President Truman gives a speech to Congress

775
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
Which kind of begins to

776
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:28,031
Deal with that question about how are we going to control these nuclear weapons now in this new atomic age

777
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:33,151
Sunday speeches where he says you know the hope of civilization

778
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Rests on International agreements

779
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,551
Where people renunciate the use and development of atomic weapons

780
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
It's pretty big deal and then he

781
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,511
Begins work with the heads of Canada and the United Kingdom a month after that on formulating some sort of

782
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,047
Policy

783
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,375
One of my Nuclear experts I was reading Joseph

784
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,495
To riccione essentially says it's the first nuclear non-proliferation

785
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Agreement ever

786
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
They send their

787
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
Financier representative a guy named Bernard Baroque to the brand new United Nations

788
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,599
On June 14th 1946 he makes this proposal

789
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
He does it with this very dramatic famous language

790
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,255
Noah says we are here to make a choice between the quick

791
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
And the dead

792
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,935
That is our business if we fail then we've dammed every man to be the slave of fear it's a great speech

793
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
That is supposed to set the

794
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,079
Apocalyptic tone though the world were these weapons out there

795
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Conjures up

796
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,455
And the discussion talks about

797
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:45,855
I'm taking all the uranium and plutonium everywhere and everything you would need to build these bombs and putting them in a central location.

798
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
International Silver

799
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,927
Security

800
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,023
Situation where nobody could get their hands on them and you couldn't have these weapons anymore

801
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,655
Now if you are one of these people that thinks in terms

802
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
Maybe that the physicists were using about people growing into greatness maybe you could see this as an example of that

803
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:10,943
These are human beings treating this with the respect and rationality that it deserves

804
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,295
An issuing all of the normal Power politics one would expect

805
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,367
You know five thousand years of human history

806
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
Would lead you to believe

807
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,023
And truthfully from humanitarian Viewpoint the United States offering

808
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:31,167
To essentially give up their Monopoly on Atomic weapons and he went in the history book to somebody do that

809
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Neenah weather

810
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Superweapon

811
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,311
We've got the only one but we'll give it up for this humanitarian cause

812
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
Now here's the

813
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Catch sort of the United States said they would do this as soon as

814
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
Everyone else had renounce them in Aldi

815
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,855
Materials have been put into a central location and all of the

816
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Agreements to make sure no one was cheating and building these weapons on the side were in place and then as soon as that was done the US would give up all their way

817
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Weapons to

818
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
Well there was a little

819
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
Counter proposal made by the people that we're going to begin to be

820
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,775
The other superpower in the world for this next

821
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,127
40 years after this. That we have called in the history books all label

822
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
The Cold War

823
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,807
By the way there's a decent number of historians who believe it's a cold war instead of a hot War

824
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,159
Because of the existence of atomic and later thermonuclear weapons

825
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
Are former wartime allies but we weren't exactly buddy-buddy with them before the war the Soviet Union

826
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,679
The seeds of the suspicions that will explode

827
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
Into

828
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,055
Rabid animosity in just a few years are already apparent

829
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,127
In 1946 in the Soviet counter proposal

830
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:50,527
Did the United States Britain and Canada saying let's all just renounce the use of development of these weapons in as soon as we can

831
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,159
All done that the United States will throw their is away in the Soviet Union now

832
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
Since you're the only one that has any

833
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:04,095
And then we'll figure out how to keep the world from developing anymore after that

834
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
That's exactly the kind of attitude that anybody studying human history forever would expect

835
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Right

836
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,663
Many out there would say that's just rational absolutely don't get Hoodwinked

837
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
There was a belief

838
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:26,367
On the Soviet side that what the United States really wanted to do with this Arms Control agreement if you will is extend the leg

839
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
Length of the Monopoly that they had

840
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:32,255
Atomic weapons list picture no one else can develop any and then

841
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,583
L will have a longer period of time we're the only ones who have them

842
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
But it began to sort of lay the groundwork for

843
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
What we would see in the future

844
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,079
A three dimensional

845
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,151
Geopolitical chess match

846
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
Where the board itself

847
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
Is booby trap with nuclear weapons

848
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231
And no one knows where they are on the board so every time anyone conducts a major move

849
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
Move everyone tenses up

850
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Board itself

851
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,983
Was determined by where the armies were when the second world war ended

852
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,311
And there are some notable trouble spot

853
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,455
The number one geopolitical trouble spot on this chess board

854
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Berlin

855
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
Former German capital

856
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,903
The end of the war Germany is divided the eastern half is

857
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:37,535
Under the control of Soviet forces the Western half under control of the United States France and Great Britain

858
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
All four of those powers

859
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:45,727
Sharing jurisdiction in occupation of the former German capital in Berlin

860
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,543
The problem is is that Berlin

861
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,431
Is geographically speaking well within the Soviet zone of control in Eastern Germany

862
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,527
The Soviets control all access to the city

863
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
A couple of Roads

864
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,183
That the Soviets watch over carefully is where all the supplies coming from the West

865
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
It's an important

866
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,535
Piece on the chessboard

867
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:14,399
But it is a piece that from the beginning of the game is effectively held hostage

868
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:21,311
The most important piece the Soviet Union has on the chessboard is the Red Army

869
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
The Red Army is constructed differently than armies in the west were it's an army that was meant to slug

870
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,599
I'll get out with German forces with tanks with heavy artillery

871
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,671
It is a hammerhead Sledgehammer of an army

872
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,487
It is full of veterans

873
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,071
And their commanders are well-versed in how to use the

874
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,887
Very large horses that they possess

875
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
When the war ends

876
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,263
The other powers like the United States and Great Britain

877
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,079
Quickly start demobilizing their forces

878
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
The Soviet demobilize forces to a degree to but the Red Army stays where it is large powerful

879
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
Threatening

880
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:07,647
And the Allied Forces really have nothing on the ground

881
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
In terms of

882
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
An army

883
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,351
I can stand against it when asked what the Red Army would need to advance into I believe it was Switzerland one

884
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
Us Commander said shoes

885
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,471
I mean the belief that it could just advance

886
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
All the way to the Atlantic

887
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,799
In 1946

888
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
With little to stop it was widespread

889
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
The chess pieces on the Westside though

890
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Wer

891
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Compensatory

892
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
A balanced out the Red Army to some degree

893
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
The West have the grade air forces

894
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
And Naval Supremacy

895
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
And they also had the atomic bomb

896
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,887
The problem that the United States found itself in in terms of a dilemma

897
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
Is the only thing that they had that they knew

898
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
Could blunt the red Army's

899
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,591
The march to the sea if it came to that were Atomic weapons

900
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,407
It may have been early on

901
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,967
Too valuable a piece to give up

902
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:11,647
Of course let's remember the Red Army was not sitting on the edge of Soviet territory

903
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
Defending the motherland

904
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:19,327
They were perched basically along the farthest extent that they had

905
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,375
Taking over in Wartime

906
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
And we're occupying unwilling populations of people who before the war were living in their own countries

907
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
Places like Poland

908
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,479
And Romania and Hungary in the Baltic states and a lot of other places

909
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
We're now occupied

910
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
And we're being Incorporated

911
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,183
Slowly but surely into the Communist Bloc this became a bone of contention

912
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,231
And something that would have kept

913
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,815
Good relations from breaking out probably in any case

914
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,191
The other issue that divided the two sides after the war was ideological

915
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:02,847
And that should come as no surprise I mean the 20th century such an ideological Century anyway

916
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:08,223
In the 1930s who had three giant different ideological block sort of

917
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,295
Competing with each other fascism communism in

918
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
The Democratic

919
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
Free market West

920
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,487
The war essentially eliminated the big fascist powers

921
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,839
Leaving a dynamic that is historian Gwynne Dyer points out

922
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,911
Diplomats from hundreds of years ago would have understood

923
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,215
They would have predicted a war between

924
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
The Soviet Union and the United States

925
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,079
Based on power politics alone

926
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
I have to bear this in mind because

927
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,295
Throwing up when I did the idea of Communism vs. democracy was such a huge part of the equation

928
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
That it's hard to rule that out or minimize that

929
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
What is dire points out

930
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
It's a lot like

931
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,607
The role religion played in the wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth Century it's important and it makes a big difference

932
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,911
But if you took that out of the equation

933
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
You probably would have had the same competition anyway

934
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
The rights quote

935
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
The United States and the Soviet Union have no common border

936
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,919
No claims on each other's territory

937
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
No history of national animosity

938
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
They're not even serious Rivals for trade and resources

939
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:20,927
But their postwar confrontation with perfectly predictable and widely predicted

940
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:26,559
As soon as the probable outcome of World War II became clear around 1943

941
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
He said

942
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Quote

943
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:34,239
Our gravest error in the late 20th century is to overestimate our distance

944
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,031
And are difference from the past

945
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:41,151
We believe that the present round of competition between the great powers

946
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
Is different from all the others in history

947
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,319
But it is invested with special significance because of its ideological dimension

948
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,903
And because of the appalling consequences if it were to lead to war

949
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,975
Has all such other competition to eventually done in the past

950
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
And quote

951
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
Ethan goes on the list

952
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,983
Did both sides can use to point to the other and say We'll look at all these provocative things you've done

953
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
And then he says quote

954
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:14,687
Each side has an ideologically watertight explanation for why the adversary behaves with sucks

955
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
Persistent wickedness and aggression

956
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:23,135
But none of the post-1945 developments would seem surprising to a 17th century Spanish

957
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
Your ottoman diplomat

958
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:31,071
Neither communism he writes nor liberal democracy would mean anything to him other than is it useful

959
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
Label for the players

960
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:37,215
What he would have no trouble understanding why the Victorious Alliance so quickly fell apart

961
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:42,847
They almost always do after Victory because the winners are the biggest players left on the board

962
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,175
Hence they automatically become the greatest potential threats

963
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
To each other's power

964
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
And quote

965
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:55,391
Now who am I to disagree with Gwen Dyer's excellent point about power politics

966
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,743
Yet at the same time as someone who grew up in that are also

967
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
It's hard to discount

968
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
What do you dread

969
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,703
And just staying here in the United States for communism

970
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,775
The impact that had overall

971
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Events

972
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
There's a

973
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:22,015
Foreign Affairs Magazine review of Stephen Whitfield book the culture of the Cold War

974
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:27,391
That I thought was an interesting description that sort of span the width in the breath and then

975
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,511
Of the weirdness as you look back on it now decades later the entire affair

976
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,303
It says about the book quote

977
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,375
A lively and well-documented account

978
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,191
Of how the Cold War both produced

979
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,519
And was sustained by super patriotism

980
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
Intolerance and suspicion

981
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:51,455
And how these pathologies infected all aspects of American life in the 1950s

982
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Entertainment

983
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,527
Churches schools

984
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,855
Older readers will remember and still be amazed

985
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
Younger ones will find this a readable introduction to a bizarre aspect of the American past

986
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
And quote

987
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:11,935
You know looking back on it there was something bizarre about it and I didn't even

988
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,007
Exist in the time when it was at its most bizarre

989
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
The 50s 1950s

990
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
The same time

991
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
And I've said this before

992
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:26,015
I wish that there was this potion or syrup that you can drink

993
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
That would allow you for a moment

994
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,415
To feel what the people living in that era felt

995
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
About this

996
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,631
Ideology that too many of them seemed little better than what Hitler and the Third Reich was awful

997
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
And who's

998
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:51,103
Desire as they saw it to extinguish Freedom all over the world was about the most evil thing

999
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
They could think of

1000
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,503
When you are fighting the most evil thing you can think of

1001
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,319
There's not a whole lot of things

1002
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,135
You're not willing to use to win

1003
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Case in point

1004
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
Atomic weapon

1005
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,703
There's another element that's involved in the story that contributes to how bizarre it looks as we look back on it now

1006
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,335
It's something that for a great many people was an article of faith

1007
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
At the time.

1008
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
Which we know to be false because

1009
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,015
Well what they were worried about happening never happen

1010
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
They don't have that luxury

1011
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
And every era has

1012
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
It's conventional wisdoms

1013
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
That it has to use in factoring out how to make decisions we are as trapped by our own as they were by there

1014
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,495
But a great many people and it's hard to quantify exactly how many

1015
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,871
But it spanned the entire Spectrum from world leaders and decision-makers

1016
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,943
To the intellectuals

1017
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Down to the farmers and the maw and PAW operators of hardware stores in Middle America

1018
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,743
It was this idea that war with the Soviet Union wasn't just a possibility

1019
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,839
But that he wasn't eventual inevitability

1020
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,959
And that colors your thinking and ways

1021
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:27,615
But if you don't believe that or if as we do we know that that wasn't what was going to happen it looks in

1022
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Insane

1023
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
Because you consider things

1024
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,527
That don't make sense outside of that context for example

1025
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,343
If war is going to happen eventually

1026
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,159
More than 5000 years of human

1027
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,999
Political and military history tells you it's better if it happens

1028
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
At a time

1029
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,839
And at a place of your own choosing

1030
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,935
And also when your advantages are maximized

1031
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
And your adversaries are minimized

1032
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:02,175
Since the end of the second world war no greater disparity in weapons technology has ever existed

1033
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,271
The United States had a monopoly on Atomic weapon

1034
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,487
Now it should be pointed out that there were those even at the end of the second world war cotton famously and legendary

1035
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,303
Currently the American General has suggested that since

1036
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,703
You know we already had our stuff all over there everything was mobilize everything was at the height of how we ought to fight that war with the Russians right now

1037
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Now

1038
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,311
But he was a notoriously gung-ho

1039
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
The General

1040
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,223
But even Stone Cold pacifists will be tempted

1041
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,343
By this temporary window of opportunity that exists

1042
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
If the one

1043
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
Atomic power

1044
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
On the planet

1045
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,839
Wanted to know kill the other potential one by strangling it in the Cradle

1046
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:57,215
And no one knew how long the window of opportunity was going a lot of expert opinions different

1047
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
President Truman supposed to vast

1048
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
J Robert Oppenheimer

1049
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,639
How long he thought the Monopoly would like what do you think the Soviets will get the bomb

1050
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,687
He supposed to replied

1051
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,967
I don't know

1052
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:12,831
To which Truman is supposed to responded I know never

1053
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,951
Truman didn't explain his thinking on that whether or not he thought perhaps

1054
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
The D

1055
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,863
In a collective minds of mankind would come to their senses and international agreements wood

1056
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Fix this problem

1057
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,239
Because he believed World War 3 was imminent

1058
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,335
And the Soviet Union would be wiped off the map and your problem would disappear

1059
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,127
In a giant mushroom cloud

1060
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,759
The military head of the Manhattan Project General gross thought it was going to be two decades

1061
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
Before the Soviets got the bomb

1062
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:49,183
But concerned scientists and even pacifists

1063
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,023
We're worried enough to consider the potential value

1064
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,119
Of a preventative nuclear war Bertrand Russell

1065
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,655
Was jailed

1066
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,471
For opposing the first world war as a pacifist

1067
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
Rote

1068
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
In right after the second World War

1069
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Quote

1070
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,175
Russia is sure to learn how to make it

1071
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
The atomic bomb

1072
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,063
I think Stalin has inherited Hitler's ambition for World dictatorship

1073
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,415
One must expect a war between USA and USSR

1074
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,231
Which will begin with the total Destruction of London

1075
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:28,095
I think the war will last 30 years and leave a world without civilized people

1076
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
From which everything will have to be built afresh

1077
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,471
A process taking say 500 years

1078
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,591
There is one thing and one only which could save the world

1079
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,407
And that is a thing which I should not dream of advocating

1080
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:46,015
It is that America should make war on Russia during the next two years

1081
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,111
And establish a world Empire by means of the atomic bomb

1082
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
This will not be done

1083
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
He writes

1084
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,487
Kitten gives a speech

1085
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
Pretty much right after that time

1086
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
To the British House of Lords

1087
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,447
I'm quoting this by the way from prisoner's dilemma by William Poundstone a wonderful book on one of the

1088
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Most famous

1089
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
Scientist associated with

1090
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Atomic power

1091
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
John Von Neumann

1092
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,431
Any quotes Russell is telling the House of Lords

1093
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
Is Nightmare scenario that would turn a pacifist into somebody that wanted a preventative nuclear war

1094
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Ruby started

1095
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
On his advice

1096
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,487
He told the House of Lords quote

1097
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:32,607
As I go about the street and see Saint Paul's the British museum

1098
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,191
The houses of Parliament and the other monuments of our civilization

1099
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,591
In my mind's eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings has heaps of rubble with Corpses

1100
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
Is all around them

1101
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
And quote

1102
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,527
One Russell who's one of the more intelligent people of the century

1103
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,879
Theorizes that the next War which he sees his imminent

1104
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:01,791
Will leave people uncivilized and the civilization will have to be rebuilt

1105
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,607
A new and it will take 500 years

1106
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,655
To get back to where we are now

1107
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,823
Think of how apocalyptic that is not humankind I'll be asleep faces these sorts of threats periodically in fact

1108
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,895
We still face this one now although we don't think about it much

1109
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:24,319
But I mean everything for example from global warming to some meteor hitting your planet or anything like that

1110
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,599
Constitutes

1111
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,999
A grave Potential Threat and end the Dynamics of each one is different so our reaction is different climate change for exam

1112
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:38,399
Sample because it needs to be figured out via mostly things like data and observation and science it becomes a

1113
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,959
And aren't you in ground for people with vested interest

1114
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:47,103
These people had a different situation going on the Dynamics around Atomic weapons I just been proven

1115
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
And scene

1116
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,199
Basically the attitude was

1117
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:57,087
If you don't want to end up looking like Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Hiroshima pictures by the way if you didn't see it

1118
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
We have to do something

1119
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,183
Doing something

1120
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,791
What is a conundrum that these people found themselves a lot more trap to buy

1121
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
And we would find ourselves

1122
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,167
Trapped if we invented Atomic weapons yesterday

1123
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,519
Just one of those little vagaries of history is method

1124
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,919
A lot of these things happen at a time. Where everyone is still all traumatized and stressed

1125
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
Not when you really want to hand

1126
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,039
The new powerful super weapon over to human beings

1127
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,903
Let's let the human beings he a little bit I mean if you discovered atomic

1128
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,999
Bombs yesterday in the laboratory and we were talking about it today

1129
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,815
Different might our approach to them be

1130
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:46,239
These are tear these could really do some damn we better think about this you know nobody's ready to kill each other we're not sitting

1131
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
The knife's edge of tension

1132
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
And Bertrand Russell give that speech

1133
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:58,271
Remember what's going on in this guy's memory banks remember the life experience that he's warming his.

1134
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
Decision making with

1135
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:04,415
Which is the best line I think a history teacher never gave me said remember what these people have seen

1136
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
Their life experiences determine how they formulate

1137
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
You're the best reaction in any given situation or the approach

1138
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,679
Bertrand Russell was born in 1872

1139
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:22,079
Into a completely different world and the reason it wasn't the world he was born into anymore the two worst wars in history

1140
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
Destroyed it twice

1141
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,943
The first one was so bad

1142
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,015
That they had this entire. Afterwards

1143
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,319
Where humankind said never again

1144
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
Not the first time nor the last time

1145
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:41,023
And build a pole structures and treaties and arrangements and Deals and everything the League of Nations of just one example

1146
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
This never happened again

1147
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,911
That is dead within 20 years it did and it was worse than the first one

1148
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,727
But at the end it ended with atomic weaponry

1149
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,847
So you're wrestling 1945 a month or two after the war ended

1150
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:00,479
You are suffering from historical post-traumatic stress disorder and so is everyone around you

1151
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,087
So when you wonder how atomic bombs might be used

1152
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:10,463
You're thinking you're probably going to be used like the last two things I saw happen within living memory

1153
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
It's going to be a lot messier than any of that

1154
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,727
The other thing that these people have going on that I have to continually remind myself up and it would be again so different if we

1155
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,031
Develop these weapons yesterday

1156
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
Is that the two sides that are the

1157
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,479
Can we call them the tip of the spear in the Cold War the USSR the Soviet Union in the United States

1158
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
Both

1159
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Enter the Second World War

1160
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
As the result

1161
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
Devastating surprise attack

1162
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,719
Barbarossa

1163
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,607
The German surprise attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 and then in December 1941 of course Pearl Harbor

1164
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
Imagine

1165
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:55,519
The next devastating surprise attack happening with atomic or nuclear weapons

1166
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:00,895
And then remember that these people had already seen that movie just a few years ago

1167
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,015
The other thing that they were absolutely certain that they had learned

1168
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,367
In the second world war in the time leading up to it had to do with appeasement

1169
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
Tough you had to be on people and

1170
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,463
All of these elements

1171
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,767
Combined create a dynamic

1172
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,327
Where everyone was

1173
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,887
On hair-trigger alert

1174
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:26,495
And now they had these weapons that were so dangerous on one side

1175
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
This was key

1176
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
1946

1177
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:38,271
In Northern Iran when the Soviet Union did not leave as quickly as they were supposed to President Truman is supposed to have threat

1178
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,575
Threatened to use an atomic bomb on them

1179
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,647
And then seem pretty darn happy when they got out

1180
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,183
Real fast in other words

1181
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,327
The idea that when you have the super weapon you can impose your will on other people is really really seductive

1182
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,679
Truman Secretary of War Henry Stimson

1183
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:02,847
Explain the advantage that the atomic bomb gave the president and the United States and the West in poker

1184
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
Opera terms

1185
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
You said that

1186
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,199
When it comes to world power

1187
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:11,295
The atomic bomb was the equivalent of a royal straight flush

1188
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,111
That is a hard

1189
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
Geopolitical hand

1190
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
To avoid playing isn't it

1191
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:25,375
What would people from earlier eras have done if they had nuclear weapons and a monopoly on them

1192
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:30,751
Julius Caesar Alexander the Great a bunch of Chinese Emperors Japanese daimyo Zora

1193
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
Egg

1194
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
Hitler

1195
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,919
Here here's fifty atomic bombs but don't use them

1196
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,319
Is Oppenheimer in those physicists were talking about human beings having to rise to another kind of

1197
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:48,927
Level of evolution in order to avoid destroying themselves you can see why

1198
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:55,327
Because actually imagining them in the hands of most of History's great figures in the past

1199
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,887
What song is the Prelude to a nightmare

1200
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,727
It occurs to me maybe that

1201
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,823
Question could be phrased a little differently and examined also I mean if

1202
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:12,991
The physicists were talking about a new level of human understanding being necessary to live with this sort of

1203
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Analogy

1204
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,063
Maybe it's not fair to imagine

1205
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:21,439
Atomic weapons in the hands of some of the most sociopathic leaders in history

1206
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,511
How humankind in general

1207
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,863
The past dealt with something like this is perhaps a fair comparison

1208
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,983
You could go back in my famous time machine a very large version of it

1209
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,591
And bring back nuclear weapons and some technicians to set them up in

1210
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,895
What button to push in everything

1211
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,735
Do you think of people from the Bronze Age

1212
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,039
Or the Iron Age

1213
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Newk's their adversary

1214
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:57,023
If you give Hannibal nuclear weapons explained what they do set them up for am heading the button and say if you push this wall of Rome will be gone

1215
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,839
A walking zombies with their skin hanging off and

1216
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,423
All that was dead and all that does he push it or does he say maybe I should think about

1217
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
Interesting

1218
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
To wonder

1219
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,615
About the development over time of human ethical systems

1220
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,199
But also something based on

1221
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,039
If you want to suggest the species learning

1222
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,623
How about the idea of imagining Hannibal

1223
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
Would that nuclear weapon

1224
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,583
Haven't gotten the chance to already live through things like the first and second world wars

1225
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,887
To experience Verdun

1226
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,679
And Stalingrad

1227
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:39,007
And gas an atomic bombs used in Warfare

1228
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,823
And then handed the weapon and say

1229
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,711
Maybe now you understand the mess this Sword of Damocles will leave you still want a new Chrome

1230
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:56,159
I'll tell you what's fascinating to me and again is part of the human condition I'm not sure you could get around it

1231
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,511
Is at this moment and maybe this is the kind of stuff the physicists were talking about also

1232
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,303
At this moment when

1233
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,655
It's all on this like Doomsday Clock knife-edge in in 1947

1234
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,727
Scientist will inaugurate the Doomsday Clock because it's

1235
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,823
Show me how close we are to destruction because of atomic weaponry.

1236
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,175
Doesn't matter how close it is Doda striking midnight

1237
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:22,015
We still playing politics in the world's democracies

1238
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,575
Because that's how democracies work

1239
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
To go back and read

1240
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
The political pressure

1241
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,231
On a guy like Truman

1242
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:37,631
That the opposition party uses against him and the typical political Dynamics are trying to

1243
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,983
To peel the rule voters in swing States and it's insane how

1244
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,591
It changes a dynamic that you would really wish him and kind of sit in a room

1245
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:50,943
Coldly and dispassionately without 1 oz of concern about the politics of it

1246
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,343
And think about this issue that bedevils us right and maybe all humankind maybe all succeeding Generations if you want to take

1247
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,415
Take it to the logical nth degree of hyperbole

1248
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
But no

1249
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,607
We're still going to call the president soft on communism because it's going to help us win the congressional election in place like New York and we're darn close

1250
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
So taking the Senate back

1251
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,215
How else can a democracy run

1252
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:21,919
I think and I don't think this is an unusual statement to make it all if you look at us history there are certain

1253
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:25,759
Time. Where the country fundamentally change is theirs

1254
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,415
It's almost like a body part breaks and we replace it with something else that's reasonably similar if you want to fool your

1255
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
Self and dress it up but has been

1256
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Altered

1257
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,047
Irrevocably and is unrecognizable

1258
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,839
To previous generations

1259
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,399
The founding of this country in the change from the

1260
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:45,727
Confederation to the Constitution is one of them in my opinion

1261
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,615
The Civil War and reconstruction to another one in everybody's opinion

1262
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
But

1263
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:59,039
If you look at the. And then people would have different dates on this from about 1946 to about 1952

1264
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,111
You see the United States government transformed

1265
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,439
Historian Garry wills and we described

1266
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:10,559
I'm talking about how the presidency in the power of one person to decide to go to war in MA

1267
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,423
Window of minutes change that aspect of Presidential Power but then he goes on the list

1268
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,031
Things that people who know American history all know anyway all of the famous

1269
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,895
International Security decisions and things like the Marshall Plan in the Truman Doctrine in

1270
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:31,551
All these different things that when taken as a whole and when you look at them on the list it's amazing how many happened in the space of a few years

1271
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,879
Create the National Security State

1272
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:42,303
And you should know my own biases before I go farther because I do have them in this case and it's worth

1273
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,839
Factoring that into

1274
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
You were thinking when you hear me

1275
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,679
But I talked a lot about politics

1276
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,727
And in my opinion the United States

1277
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,591
Made the wrong course change during this time. And became a different country

1278
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,431
Country much less connected to the 1:00 Americans believe that they have

1279
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
When they study what I like to call them it's of America

1280
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,575
And the Constitution as a lay person would understand it

1281
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:12,511
I think September 11th in the 9/11 attacks is another one of these periods in US history and I think you see a similar Dynamic there

1282
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
And as well

1283
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,935
In neither Case by the way do I hold the decision-makers accountable

1284
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
For having made the decisions at the time

1285
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,383
I think it was inevitable for example that any us Administration given what's going on with the freaked out

1286
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
And overreacted after 9/11

1287
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:34,783
I think the same is true in this tree were talking about here between 1946 and 1952

1288
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,599
It is the later

1289
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:42,207
Generations afterwards that I'm upset with for not fixing it

1290
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:47,071
Problem with historical memories a transgo on long enough

1291
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:53,471
Whole Generations are born never knowing what needs to be fixed because they never lived in the time before the chain

1292
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Change occurred

1293
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
If you wanted to say today

1294
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
We need to go back and fix the

1295
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:04,991
Things that we did between 1946 and 1952 The Dan Carlin things were over reactions

1296
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,295
How the heck do you get back that far

1297
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,415
And I'm more critical question for a person like me is what if we like it better this way

1298
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,511
So please note my biases at the outset

1299
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,351
But this new National Security setup

1300
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,399
What developed from about

1301
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:28,543
4690 46 to my 1952 and hit when the CIA was created the NSA

1302
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:32,895
The entire structure of government that we know today that protects secrets

1303
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:36,479
And and spies on the enemy it keeps us safe and yet medium

1304
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,039
It's our world now and this is what happened

1305
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
It seems to run counter

1306
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:48,511
To the very things that some of those scientists were saying you were going to have to do

1307
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
If we were going to avoid World War 3

1308
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:56,191
Were they called for a new level of human understanding

1309
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:01,823
Whatever that is and I don't pretend to understand exactly what these physicists wanted to set things like this

1310
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,407
But you got the opposite with the National Security State

1311
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,015
Whereas some of these famous physicists some of the most famous

1312
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,599
We're saying in 1945 and 1946

1313
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:18,207
That we should tell the Soviets about the bomb right when we started making it

1314
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,047
Or that we should give them the nuclear secrets after the war

1315
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,631
Thinking how crazy that sounds to us today

1316
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,007
And with our modern mentality we should just give the terrorists all the nuclear bomb secrets

1317
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,103
That sounds insane insane do a lot of the military class

1318
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,687
After the second world war we executed people

1319
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
In US history

1320
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,575
For turning over nuclear secrets and some of our physicists were suggesting

1321
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,135
But that's the sort of level of understanding

1322
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:51,743
They will take us to a new world where we can ease tension so we don't have World War 3

1323
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,327
That's a pretty hard evolutionary tool

1324
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,863
To have to fight again

1325
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,703
Because you have to combat your own fear

1326
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
And I think I've said before

1327
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:09,919
Fear is one of those evolutionary developments that is probably save more lives in human history than anything else I can think of

1328
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,343
Normally it's a very good thing to have right saber tooth tiger comes at you back in caveman times run

1329
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:23,743
Or kill it or whatever you have to do then protect yourself cuz you're afraid from saber tooth tiger attacks and put up fences and

1330
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,791
The fear thing is not a bad

1331
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Condition

1332
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,095
It helps with security

1333
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:32,191
But it's a very things that I've always help with security

1334
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,543
Threaten not just your existence but civilization

1335
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,663
Can you turn that evolutionary tool off

1336
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,735
If that's the only way to survive

1337
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:52,159
As I try to play with counterfactuals you know what if scenarios in this.

1338
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:57,023
Imagining it turning out differently than it did I can't think of any that sound like

1339
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,327
They would be rationally imaginable

1340
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,423
Take for example the military in this situation

1341
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,471
What are they supposed to do

1342
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
After the second World War

1343
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,847
Pretend they don't have a bomb if you're the United States

1344
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,407
Or if you're the other side in this

1345
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,943
Growing distrust

1346
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,759
Neither will turn into the Cold War for the Soviet Union

1347
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:22,111
Do you just pretend the United States doesn't have an atomic bomb how does that work

1348
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Like we said

1349
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,255
It's for the president of the United States almost

1350
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,351
Too good of a hand to resist at least threatening to play

1351
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:37,215
I mean that's just politics right that's just foreign policy the way it's always been handled

1352
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,823
And if you look at this from a strictly

1353
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,615
Age-old

1354
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
Power politics Viewpoint historian

1355
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:50,527
Michael Howard does a great job adjust setting up the way the military saw this thing

1356
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,927
To them and we're speaking of them as a whole rather than some of the individuals and even perhaps some of the various Services moron

1357
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
I'm not in a minute

1358
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,279
I saw these things because that's what they're paid to do

1359
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,815
Howard Road quote

1360
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:09,727
When confrontation developed between the Soviet Union and the West shortly after the ending of the second World War

1361
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,775
The military on both sides

1362
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,567
Forshaw business-as-usual

1363
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,640
The Soviet plan to advance their Western glasses

1364
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
To the Atlantic

1365
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,504
Didn't either the Americans the use of air bases in Western Europe

1366
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,296
Volume arrogance hoped at least

1367
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:27,136
To retain bases in the British Isles Spain and the Middle East

1368
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,696
From which to bombard the Soviet Union

1369
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,232
And then in due course

1370
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,536
In quotes here liberate

1371
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,328
You're up for a second time

1372
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
It continues

1373
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,544
The peoples of Europe knew nothing of these plans and would have shown little enthusiasm for them if they had

1374
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,920
Next time remark at French prime minister who did know about them to his American colleague

1375
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,224
You will be liberating a corpse

1376
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,504
And quote

1377
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,648
The problem you faced in 1946 1947

1378
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,768
If you're the United States military or Harry Truman and maybe you've already threatened to

1379
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,608
To play that royal straight flush on the Soviets in Northern Iran once

1380
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
The problem you have

1381
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,728
Is you have very few of these bombs

1382
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
Although no one knows that

1383
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,848
And you have no good way to deliver them

1384
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,408
The next couple of years

1385
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,200
The military and

1386
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:30,112
Harry Truman and the government of the United States will focus on a system to deliver

1387
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,392
Armageddon

1388
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
If that's what's needed

1389
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,792
It's official name with the Strategic Air Command

1390
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:44,192
And was part of this brand new branch of the United States military known as the Air Force which used to be a part of the eye

1391
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,544
Army and it was part of an entire reorganization that was also a part of this post

1392
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,896
Second world war transformative. The change US foreign policy in the hole

1393
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:57,248
Design of government the new Department of Defense the new Pentagon it was all part of this

1394
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,576
Strategic Air Command job

1395
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
If called upon to do it

1396
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,256
What to destroy the Soviet Union's major cities with atomic weapon

1397
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
And in the process

1398
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,376
Kill tens of millions of people

1399
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,008
The Mind sort of real

1400
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,824
When you think of how quickly we went from that

1401
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,688
Well to us today it even looks like a rainbows and unicorns place

1402
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:32,320
Trying to crap legislation to rid the world of the scourge of atomic weaponry

1403
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,392
To a year-and-a-half two years later

1404
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,184
When the president

1405
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,536
Has to deal with the approval of Air Force plans

1406
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,840
For winning World War 3

1407
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:47,424
That involved as the key part of the strategy something

1408
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:51,520
Commonly referred to as the atomic Blitzkrieg or Atomic Blitz

1409
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,592
Trying to explain

1410
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:59,712
All the various things that go into why these decisions were made as complicated

1411
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,064
And one of the main reasons why is her recent all this is as we said before

1412
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,392
Reality is complicated I don't have to tell you that

1413
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,440
Social cultural economic

1414
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,792
Individual forces I mean a thousand things working on it and every direction all the time

1415
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
Well that's pretty much how it's always been

1416
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,168
But you can always see it the source is so

1417
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,520
When you go back to like ancient Egypt and you look at what historians write about that

1418
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,080
They don't have access

1419
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:31,200
To all the information that would flush out the reality of those people the way we feel it now

1420
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:35,296
Consequently history seems much more simple cuz the

1421
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:40,160
Minor strains that are all interwoven around events are not visible back then

1422
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,720
But the closer you get to now

1423
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280
The more visible those minor threads

1424
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:51,168
Become and it's impossible to quantify the importance of this the right over that's right for example as I said earlier

1425
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,448
You would love to think

1426
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,032
In a situation is important potentially is nuclear

1427
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,384
In a global nuclear war that we would have philosopher-king sitting in quiet rooms

1428
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:06,528
Discussion with the most intelligent physicist in an ethical people in the world how we deal with this situation

1429
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
But instead

1430
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:14,720
The normal things that impact human Kinder at work here to despite the stakes we said politics in a day

1431
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Democracy

1432
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
A little while ago

1433
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,072
But it's more than just politics

1434
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
How about

1435
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
Such

1436
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:27,008
Banal concerns as budgetary questions and

1437
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,800
Interservice rivalry

1438
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
Changes to

1439
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,920
For example

1440
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,016
I think you could make a pretty good argument and a lot of people have

1441
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,576
But the number one reason

1442
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,904
That you have an atomic Blitz style strategy

1443
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,256
That's the plan to win World War 3 should it come during this time.

1444
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,864
Has more to do with budgetary restraint than anything else

1445
01:24:54,912 --> 01:25:01,056
And you again wish that you had your philosopher-kings and everything in the back room not worried about anything but know I like politics and budget

1446
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,152
What have you but reality intervened which is why this

1447
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
Whole argument about having to change

1448
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:12,320
Humanity in order to survive in a post Atomic world is so difficult

1449
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:15,648
Einstein said the atom changed everything but our modes of thinking

1450
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,488
But it's hard to change your modes of thinking

1451
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,048
I mean think about Harry Truman after the war

1452
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,864
Harry Truman's got to cut the budget because it's

1453
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,240
Spending a fortune cuz it was just in the biggest war in history and it was doing the Lion's Share funding

1454
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,544
Cathay those levels right

1455
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,848
Can't live at those levels on Harry Truman

1456
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:38,944
How to cut the military by what he think is going to be 70% after the war

1457
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:45,088
While still having to be able to fight World War 3 should it come

1458
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,648
And as we said a lot of people thought it was imminent

1459
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,184
How do you do that

1460
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,536
Remember running business people who you know opened up there

1461
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:59,168
Business books from college that just said listen it's all about prioritization in consolidation

1462
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,008
There's no reason for all this redundancy first of all

1463
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:09,408
You just combine all these services and have no air force and no Navy no Army 101 hold military defense structure

1464
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:15,040
You hear this argument all the time in this country and other countries to the service is hate.

1465
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,648
Because they all have a lot of pride in their own service and sometimes a little bit of antipathy toward the other ones

1466
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
What's more

1467
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,744
You had

1468
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,608
A whole new branch of the service out there the u.s. air force that he just been created

1469
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,912
And all of them competing

1470
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,728
Or an economic pie

1471
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,288
It was going to be cut by 70%

1472
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,128
As you might imagine in any country at any time. Ever

1473
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
Are the knives came out

1474
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:48,320
And the backbiting started in the services had to get up there in a centrally argue for

1475
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,904
Why they were relevant and why they matter them why they should get a larger

1476
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,208
A piece of the economic defense pie

1477
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,792
I was the air force that ended up winning the argument

1478
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:03,168
They went to the president basically said if I can simplify this

1479
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,264
There's only one branch of the service that will win World War 3 for you and it's us

1480
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:13,664
Because we're the ones who will send fleets of bombers over to the Soviet Union and bomb them with atomic bombs

1481
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:22,112
This was a very contentious. Us defense history again it's part of that entire area with a big change occur between

1482
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,392
46 + 52

1483
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,976
But the services in some of these cases were fighting for their very existence

1484
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,816
In the second defense secretary guy named Louis A Johnson

1485
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:35,424
Who is totally on board with this let's get rid of a bunch of branches of the service idea

1486
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,216
It supposed to have said this quote

1487
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,312
There is no reason for having a Navy and Marine Corps

1488
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,360
General Bradley tells me

1489
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
Did amphibious operations are a thing of the past

1490
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,992
Will never have any more amphibious operations

1491
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,784
That does away with the Marine Corps

1492
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,880
And the Air Force can do anything the Navy can do so that does away with the Navy

1493
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
And quote

1494
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:01,792
Then goes on to cancel this giant supercarrier the Navy was building

1495
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,376
And as you might imagine things just go ballistic

1496
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,448
It leads to something

1497
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:13,312
That's considered to be one of the more unusual and serious because there hasn't been a lot of them

1498
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:16,896
Revolts by a branch of the service in American history

1499
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:23,552
It's often referred to as a mutiny in some Spirit high is it would be very strange because usually gets the Mutiny is from the the

1500
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:27,904
The lower levels of the Navy to the higher-level this involve the highest levels

1501
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,440
Of the Navy

1502
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,000
Who came to the defense of the service

1503
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:38,400
By arguing for all sorts of things that you would understand you know they're just trying to make themselves look relevant and of course the Navy can do this in

1504
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
No one else can

1505
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,544
Usual argument that they also brought to the table and they brought it out in Congressional hearings in it

1506
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,848
In a way that when you think about it it's just shocking

1507
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,688
Was they questioned the US strategy of atomic bombs

1508
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,224
On moral grounds

1509
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:58,624
In something known as the Revolt of the Admirals and Congressional testimony

1510
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:03,744
A bunch of war heroes from the second world war in the guys like Chester Nimitz and everything came out

1511
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:07,328
And then arguing essentially that we don't like your plan

1512
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,352
To just go

1513
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:14,752
Drop atomic bombs on cities and that's how you're going to win the third world war but at the same time in a defending their own branch of the service

1514
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,872
Did you cried the entire idea as an American and a moral

1515
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,480
Does Eric Schlosser rights and command-and-control quote

1516
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,832
Congressional hearings in October 1949

1517
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,392
One high-ranking Admiral after another

1518
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
Condemned the atomic Blitz

1519
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,256
Arguing that the bombing of Soviet cities

1520
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
Would be not only futile

1521
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
Money and morals

1522
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:44,192
They advocated Precision tactical bombing of Soviet troops and supply lines

1523
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,264
Using planes from American aircraft carriers

1524
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,056
Admiral William F Halsey

1525
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:55,456
Compare the Air Force's new bomber to The Siege weapons once used to destroy medieval castles and towns

1526
01:29:55,712 --> 01:30:00,064
Quote I don't believe in mass killings of non-combatants and quote

1527
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,392
Admiral Arthur W Radford testified quote

1528
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,976
A war of annihilation might bring a pyrrhic military victory

1529
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,304
But it would be politically and economically senseless and quote

1530
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,608
The harshest criticism of the Air Force

1531
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:18,752
Came from rear Admiral Ralph a Asti who would toward the burned-out cities of Japan after the war

1532
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,080
He described the atomic Blitz as quote

1533
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:26,176
Random Mass Slaughter of men women and children end quote

1534
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:30,016
The whole idea he said was ruthless and barbaric

1535
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,832
And contrary to American values quote

1536
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:37,184
We must ensure that our military techniques do not strip us of self-respect

1537
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
And quote

1538
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,304
Once again hard to quantify

1539
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,840
And really know

1540
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,704
How much is the Navy's opposition to use of atomic bombs of the war winning

1541
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:52,800
Can you base your strategy on would because their service didn't have any

1542
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
And how much of it was based on moral grounds

1543
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
Complaints with P notably muted

1544
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:03,552
When submarines could carry nuclear weapons it should be noted later on

1545
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:11,232
But the Admirals bring up a key moral question that people will wrestle with four decades as a matter fact they still Russell

1546
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,304
Is there an ethical way to fight

1547
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,352
An atomic or nuclear war

1548
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,240
Is there a way to bomb cities and civilians with atomic weapons

1549
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,544
And have it still square with

1550
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,848
American values in the values of the

1551
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,944
Freedom-loving Weston it would have been known back then in general

1552
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:36,576
In there fighting a bad guy is I said that you go read the literature the time it is clear

1553
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
This might as well be

1554
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,696
And the Third Reich again and Joseph Stalin might as well be Hitler

1555
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:49,888
Little known facts here in the United States but the Soviet Union will mellow out a bit after Stalin goes away but this is the

1556
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,424
The hardcore era still

1557
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:58,080
He is considered to be a ruthless guy and communism appears to be on the move

1558
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
But if you kill tens of millions of civilians

1559
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,456
Using atomic bomb

1560
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:08,064
In order to thwart the evils of a totalitarian superpower

1561
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,672
Watch evil do you get splashed on you in the process

1562
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,768
And what if you strike first

1563
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,864
At the second thing that came into play even

1564
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,984
Gossip is Bertrand Russell for a little while I was thinking that the United States should strike first

1565
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,824
To keep the bomb out of the hands of guys like Joseph Stalin

1566
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:38,016
Interesting to think about what our history books would look like today and how it would treat the subject of a preventative nuclear

1567
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
Your War

1568
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:44,416
Had the United States acted on that kind of premise back in the day when Bertrand Russell was making those peaches

1569
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,024
How do I know if he would change his opinion later on this

1570
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,608
Unless I can't imagine the history books

1571
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,656
Treating it all that nicely today

1572
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,704
Try to explain away all those deaths

1573
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,032
To keep the Soviet Union from getting an atomic weapon

1574
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
1 is

1575
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,128
Reminded

1576
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,712
Friedrich Nietzsche's lying about be careful when fighting monsters

1577
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,272
But you yourself do not become a monster

1578
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,576
The tough ethical dilemma isn't it

1579
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,928
Confirm my own stamp when I find this. Fascinating because

1580
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,024
If you think about the ethical dilemma maybe you're putting

1581
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:25,888
A handgun that's loaded into the hands of a five-year-old boy

1582
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,704
That's kind of what I feel like this. Is here

1583
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:34,848
Maybe the most dangerous. In atomic history because it's the one we're still trying to figure out

1584
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,688
Oppenheimer's right and we have to grow into a new hire

1585
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,992
Version of ourselves just survive

1586
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,040
This is the. Of like adolescence

1587
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,088
Can we do it before

1588
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,368
You know we should something

1589
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,000
And it's a. Where the tension is mounting at such a pace

1590
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:59,680
Did Michael Sherry the historian says that the drumbeat of crises and initiatives was relentless during this time.

1591
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,472
You go look at a timeline in it

1592
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,288
One thing after another Bam Bam Bam Bam

1593
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:11,200
And remember those are the things that make it into the history books that totally discounts with the people in that era

1594
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:15,040
Reading their morning newspaper on a day-to-day basis would have had to contend with

1595
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,088
All the rumors and lies and

1596
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:23,488
And threaten and Maneuvers and things that might happen but never turned out to be true they sweat that out on a daily basis

1597
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:31,936
What you're talking about these things that sound horrific to us today that anyone would even consider you don't understand

1598
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,216
People thought they were facing

1599
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:38,592
The fact that we know that their worst nightmares won't come true

1600
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,408
Can't be allowed to Blind us

1601
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:47,040
From the position that they found themselves and remember we have the luxury of knowing how things turn out

1602
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:54,720
It changes everything doesn't at all makes it very difficult to put ourselves back in those shoes and I want that serum

1603
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:59,584
Instantly allows you to go on my God I'm so scared that the Communist are going to take over the world

1604
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,888
You know what I was doing at the 1970s

1605
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,448
There was something known as the Domino Theory

1606
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,728
Communism

1607
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,264
This idea that

1608
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,312
Spreads from one country to another

1609
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,896
And let you know as soon as one Falls it subverts the next one over there

1610
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,712
And was supposed to explain this exponential growth

1611
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:20,832
Of a of Communism in the world and why you needed to be concerned about all these little countries

1612
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:25,184
You would say what cares about this little out-of-the-way place that they go Tommy this is not exactly like they're in the

1613
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,512
Center of the world you know what why do they matter you say you don't understand

1614
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,536
The domino effect

1615
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,864
They will submit the country next door and then you can't let me get a foothold

1616
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:38,752
In the seventies when I was growing up you were beginning to think that that was crazy although there were still a lot of proponents

1617
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,312
But the reason it looks so out of whack

1618
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:44,640
Is because in the 1970s when I was a kid things that stabilized

1619
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:48,736
It was a theory developed by people that were watching reality unfold

1620
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,552
Back in the era we're talking about now

1621
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:55,392
Where did look like dominoes were falling and it looks like they were falling quickly

1622
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,464
Couple of different kind

1623
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,256
Covert and overt

1624
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,072
For example at the beginning of 1948

1625
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
The Czechoslovakian government is

1626
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,960
Overthrown in a coup and they become part of the Communist Bloc one of their

1627
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,496
Famous ministers

1628
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,544
Found at the bottom

1629
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,688
Of a multi-storey apartment dead in an apparent suicide out of his window which many people believe now was

1630
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,760
Nothing but Russian agents tossing them over the side of it

1631
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,576
That began to give everything so the berry

1632
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
Spy underhanded clandestine You Know The Enemy Within soda field and communism was different than fighting

1633
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Nazism

1634
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,376
You didn't have to worry about Nazism is an intellectual contagion very much

1635
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:44,288
Or as communism was something that could appeal to downtrodden peoples everywhere including in your own countries

1636
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:47,360
I want to send you a new enemy to deal with

1637
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,456
Potentially some of your own people to change things to as everyone knows

1638
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,784
Couple of red scares if nothing else

1639
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,624
The McCarthy era and some legitimate problems with

1640
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:03,488
In a people who were spying because they had an intellectual affinity

1641
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,536
For the beliefs of the Soviet Union

1642
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
When I get

1643
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:11,168
What are some communist all the time saying you was between communism and such a terrible light

1644
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,728
All we can go on is the examples we have

1645
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,288
If they don't match the

1646
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,312
Potential

1647
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
Of the classroom theories well

1648
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:23,456
Can't help. I can only tell you what the Joseph Stalin regime was like

1649
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,272
And it wasn't pretty

1650
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,136
And if you want to point out the problems that the West has I'm going to agree with you on all of them

1651
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,184
But there's still no comparison

1652
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,024
In this case the Soviet just were

1653
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:42,144
Ruthless in the United States and others argued that you had to meet that kind of ruthlessness

1654
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,192
With a similar sense of resolve

1655
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,520
And some of this resolved

1656
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:51,104
Required the ability to push back in places

1657
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,920
Couple months into 1948

1658
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
Joseph Stalin does something

1659
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,064
The test the resolve of the West if you will in a way

1660
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:05,184
That is so challenging it's like calling your bluff in that high stakes poker game

1661
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,560
Michio Kaku and Daniel Axelrod and their book

1662
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:17,216
How to win a nuclear war say that by this time. Harry Truman has already threatened the Soviets four times

1663
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,008
With a nuclear bombing

1664
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,568
Maybe blops but

1665
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,872
Never came to a head because

1666
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,408
The Soviets gave in

1667
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,248
On June 24th 1948

1668
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:35,136
A pretty darn good geopolitical chess player himself Joseph Stalin makes a move

1669
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:39,744
The basically calls the entire nuclear block of the West

1670
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
And shuts down

1671
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,840
All the Rail lines

1672
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,400
And the land routes

1673
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,936
That we're supplying

1674
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,472
West Berlin

1675
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
The place occupied

1676
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,336
By the French the British and the Americans

1677
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:57,920
That they shared with the Soviets and it was deeply inside

1678
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,480
The rest of Soviet Eastern Germany at the time

1679
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:06,880
Only allowed to exist because Stalin allowed food and everything to go through

1680
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,208
On June 24th 1948 he stopped allowing that

1681
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:14,048
And then basically looked at the United States in the rest of the world

1682
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:17,120
And in his own geopolitical way

1683
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
Send

1684
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,168
Check

1685
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,288
You may be thinking to yourself that we are over playing

1686
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
The

1687
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,384
Poker and chess analogies a little bit

1688
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,968
Because they are things by the way they can always be applied to

1689
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,784
Diplomacy in foreign affairs

1690
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:40,160
Realpolitik that you can always compare those things to chess matches and whatnot but nothing so fits

1691
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
The model

1692
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,232
As the Cold War

1693
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,536
And in fact

1694
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:48,864
In due time and alternative approach to

1695
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,728
Oppenheimer in the physicist idea that we're going to have to grow as a species or we're going to wipe each other out of

1696
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,336
Will begin to be developed along the lines of things that we call today Game Theory

1697
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:02,944
And we're already under way in the minds of people like John Von Neumann and others

1698
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,992
Developing ways

1699
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,808
To see if we could use our intelligence

1700
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,904
To not drastically lose the game

1701
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:18,048
If humans had to adapt or die to their new weapons technology

1702
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,376
What's the only kind of adaptation that was going to work

1703
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,424
An evolutionary one

1704
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
Where's that was impossible

1705
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,312
Did humankind have a back-up plan

1706
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,104
Living with a sort of Technology

1707
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,712
In this case was Stalin at setting

1708
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
A foreign-policy sort of terms

1709
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
Is are you really

1710
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,624
Going to start World War 3 over this

1711
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,208
All I did was say

1712
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,048
You could no longer have access to a city deeply behind

1713
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:53,376
The Border in our territory with at least we're we're

1714
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
In charge of Defending

1715
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
R zone

1716
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,728
Influence

1717
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:04,896
We haven't attacked anybody you be attacking us first what would World opinions are you going to start World War 3 over this

1718
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,176
And

1719
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,968
If you do

1720
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,248
Not only

1721
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,552
Will the war start but will

1722
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,624
Start with wiping out all of your forces that are in Berlin now

1723
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,720
Appetizer for World War 3 if you will

1724
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:26,144
How do you respond to that and especially in this. Where once again it's hard to get into the minds of these people with everything you read

1725
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,472
He talks about how much both sides in this cold war

1726
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,264
Thought that they learned

1727
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,800
From World War II

1728
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,336
And the lead up to that

1729
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:38,944
The whole idea of appeasement is ever present in the discussions right

1730
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,760
Hitler proves a point for every

1731
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,296
Maniacal

1732
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
Aggressive

1733
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:50,976
Dictator everywhere right they're all like Hitler so you everything that was applied to Hitler applies to everything else and in the symptom of Joseph Stalin

1734
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:55,072
You cannot show weakness so do you start World War 3 over this well

1735
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
The wheels are in motion

1736
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
And

1737
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,192
Very soon

1738
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,288
A solution the ground apparently by a local Commander

1739
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:10,688
Who started to have food flown into Berlin cuz apparently Stalin wasn't going to shoot down airplanes I guess they saw

1740
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
Pretty quickly

1741
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,504
And very quickly

1742
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
Harry Truman saw that as the

1743
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,856
Life preserver thrown to him

1744
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:24,256
Right where your choices start nuclear war or let Stalin get away with it what about we don't start nuclear war either

1745
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:28,608
We just start supplying the city now what are you going to do you remove

1746
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,704
See how this game thing work so well in this situation

1747
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,752
Another start nuclear war first

1748
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
And what will be known as the Berlin Airlift

1749
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,664
By the time it's finished and it'll be

1750
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,968
An ongoing for more than a year

1751
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:47,296
The United States and the other Western allies

1752
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:52,160
Will fly in 1.5 million tons of coal

1753
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,256
Fuel and other necessary products for everyone West Berlin

1754
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,096
With nearly two hundred thousand flights into the city

1755
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
It's an amazing achievement

1756
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
And was an easy out

1757
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,240
Good World War 3

1758
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,544
But worth noting

1759
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:12,128
A during the crisis especially in July 1948

1760
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:17,248
Discussions and real discussions were had amongst the United States the president is advisors

1761
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:22,112
About whether or not you start nuclear war over this and they're fascinating to go back and look at

1762
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,232
Begin to see the big divide between those who think

1763
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:33,632
The nuclear weapons are the special class of weapon that you left treat totally differently than any weapon that's ever been invented ever

1764
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,936
Ever and don't you think it's just a bigger bomb

1765
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,776
The purposes of our story here

1766
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,360
Which is more about Humanity adapting to its

1767
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,664
Weapons capabilities

1768
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,040
The 1948-1949 Berlin airlift crisis is key

1769
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,832
Because it's the first time

1770
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:56,672
But you get the rubber meets the road practical questions

1771
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:03,072
But hadn't really a reason to this point it's almost like you have to have the crisis before people actually sit down in the room together

1772
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
And debate

1773
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:06,912
The question that should have come up a long time ago like

1774
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:11,008
What can we really accomplish with these weapons what can you do with them

1775
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:16,384
Not everyone understood that you can threaten with them because they already done this before

1776
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
By the way it's a

1777
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:25,344
Strategy known as escalation dominance and you don't need a Tomica nuclear weapons for that strategies always been used.

1778
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:30,976
But it's basically the idea that you're willing to take it to the next level

1779
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,280
You really want to fight over this with lucu

1780
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:37,120
And the other side doesn't have nuclear weapons well that's the end of that game right

1781
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,448
The problem is is that that's a bluff game

1782
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,264
And what these people are asking now

1783
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:49,408
Having played the bluff game three or four times already since the second world wars whatever Force to play this hand

1784
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:56,832
Words that mean the really practical realities things like do we have the planes in placed how many bombs do we have

1785
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,856
What are we going to Target

1786
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:01,440
Get those places and Destroy them does that get us what we want

1787
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,768
These are the kind of things that have been sort of

1788
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:11,168
Compartmentalize and talked about in various branches of government the Berlin airlift crisis brings all these people together with the price

1789
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:17,056
President to have really fundamental discussions of the store that hadn't happened before you could see these broad differences of opinion

1790
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:21,152
The military man by and large are under the impression

1791
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:26,016
It when we go to World War 3 we're just going to use the new weapons to the way we use the old one

1792
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,320
And some of the other people for example

1793
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:31,136
Head of the atomic energy commission David lilienthal

1794
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:34,720
He's part of the group of people that are counseling Truman in this

1795
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:39,072
Key moment during the Berlin airlift crisis not to use the nuclear weapons

1796
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:44,192
The July 1948 meeting between Truman

1797
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
And his various advisors is

1798
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,080
Talked about him and she okay KO and that's a rose book and they write quote

1799
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,384
In his journal that day

1800
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,200
Lilienthal atomic energy commission head

1801
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,992
Wrote The Truman quote

1802
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,040
Greeted us rather solemnly

1803
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,832
You look worn and Grimm

1804
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,648
None of the joviality that he sometimes exhibits

1805
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:06,976
I rather think it was one of the most important meetings I've ever attended

1806
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,256
And quote

1807
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,048
The authors continue quote

1808
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:16,448
At the meeting so I'm like lilienthal expressed reservations about using nuclear weapons secretary

1809
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,984
Royal however

1810
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,800
Spoke for the hardliners when he said quote

1811
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:25,920
We've been spending 98% of all the money for atomic energy for weapons

1812
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:29,248
Now if we aren't going to use them that doesn't make any sense

1813
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,528
Ann Coulter

1814
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,856
But even those

1815
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:40,256
Who are trying to figure out maybe that you can just use these weapons as a bluff have a problem themselves

1816
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:44,096
They want to deter with these things in something

1817
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:48,704
Strategy-wise will become known as deterrence their problem is that for that to work

1818
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:55,104
The other side needs to think that you would use the weapons so you can't publicly come out there and say these are the most

1819
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:01,504
Awful things in the world we would never use these weapons because then you can't threaten to use them anymore than they have no utility

1820
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,296
If you're one of these people who believes

1821
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,064
But you won't

1822
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,648
Really use them you won't play the hand but you're threatened with him

1823
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,952
Right to work

1824
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
People have to believe you'll go there

1825
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,352
That's one offer I was reading pointed out

1826
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:21,984
He said that the bombs too terrible to use under any circumstances it has no determined value

1827
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:26,848
So even if you're one of those people that would never foresee the use of atomic weapons

1828
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,384
You can't say that

1829
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,432
Because then they're no good at all

1830
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,248
This becomes the main conundrum

1831
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:36,064
Of using the bomb but during this period

1832
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,160
There's one main part of the conundrum that we understand today that's missing

1833
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:47,328
Because if World War 3 breaks out in response to some event connected to the Berlin airlift in 1948

1834
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:52,192
Only one side is going to have Atomic Weaponry used on them

1835
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:57,568
If you're the American public and you're sweating out these increasing tensions

1836
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:03,456
You can at least Comfort yourself in the idea than the era of atomic war in 1948

1837
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,504
You are still safe for being new

1838
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,576
Because your government is the only one that has the weapons

1839
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,392
1949

1840
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:15,232
That will change and that will change everything

1841
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:19,072
Part 2

1842
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,376
The destroyer of worlds

1843
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,984
1949 is a terrible year

1844
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:32,128
In terms of the Cold War the only thing that keeps it from being say the most terrible year in all world history in terms of danger

1845
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,688
Our technological limitations

1846
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:41,088
You give 1949 the same technology we had in 1969 and I think it is the worst year ever most dangerous

1847
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:45,696
Why things happened in 49 that make people very edgy

1848
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
I mean for example

1849
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:53,888
After a long-running civil war with an intermission during the second world war the Chinese Communist finally

1850
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:58,752
Only gained victory in their Civil War over the Nationalist nationalist go over to Taiwan

1851
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,080
The Communists declare a communist country

1852
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,616
And all of a sudden

1853
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:08,480
Soviet Russia the largest land power in the world in terms of actual Geographic size

1854
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:12,576
Has added to it a country roughly the size of the United States geographically

1855
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,416
And with the largest population in the world communism just took in

1856
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:20,000
25% of the world's population and added it to its ranks

1857
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,024
That's how

1858
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,816
Country like the United States or

1859
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,864
UK would have seen the situation

1860
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:29,472
Does zero sum game and all of a sudden communism just took China and we lost it

1861
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:33,056
Be a big political debate in United States for a long time

1862
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,128
Which party in the White House lost China

1863
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,920
ISO China was ours to lose

1864
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:42,528
1949 is also the year NATO is formed

1865
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:49,440
In attempt to begin to Cobble together a European defense strategy from a whole bunch of country still trying to recover from

1866
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,488
The damage of the second world war remember

1867
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,608
Only one country came out of the second world war major ones anyway any better off than they went into it

1868
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,168
The United States everybody else was recovering

1869
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,520
Certain countries like the Soviet Union from really Grievous wounds

1870
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,360
And that's partly the reason why

1871
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:12,992
The estimates maybe on how long it would take the Soviets to get their own atomic bomb we're so off

1872
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:20,416
Are they do it so quickly the military head of the Manhattan Project General growth didn't think that the Soviets would get it for 20 years

1873
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,440
They got it

1874
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,744
16 years sooner than he thought they'd get it

1875
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,120
There's no doubt that Espionage played a key role in helping

1876
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:35,008
It doesn't change the fact that it took the Soviets about the same amount of time it took the United States

1877
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:39,104
The UK and the Canadians in the Manhattan Project to build their bomb

1878
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:45,248
On August 29th 1949 in the Central Asian deserts

1879
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:48,832
The first Soviet a bomb test goes off

1880
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
The United States finds out

1881
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,464
From a monitoring plane that was just sort of keeping track of radioactivity

1882
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:59,328
Joseph Stalin not the kind of guy to come out and announce anything about anything

1883
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:04,960
The USA though thought he was going to so after debating whether or not they should tell the people of the world

1884
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,520
Did the Soviets were Atomic power now

1885
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:15,712
One of Truman's advisors specifically mentioning the Panic After the War of the Worlds broadcast by Orson Welles

1886
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,016
And saying that the whole thing might cause a panic

1887
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:25,184
But in an attempt to sort of get ahead of the Soviets if they were going to announce it and approached the proper spin on it Truman came

1888
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,720
Vim forward and basically said

1889
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,816
The Soviets have it in this is why it's so important to control these kinds of weapons

1890
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:38,496
The Sands that tiny little. At the beginning of the atomic and nuclear age

1891
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:44,128
Where Atomic power rested in the hands of merely a Singleton

1892
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:50,272
It's somewhat amazing given the state of human affairs

1893
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:56,672
That Williams Monopoly one country didn't use that weapon to dominate the world so maybe one could suggest

1894
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:59,232
But in an ethical sense

1895
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,536
It showed human progress

1896
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,864
Perhaps Bertrand Russell's line about

1897
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:08,960
How long you can expect a man to walk across that tightrope with a hold on

1898
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,264
They haven't had to do this for very long

1899
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:16,128
First round goes to man's ethical and evolutionary growth because we avoided

1900
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:20,736
Bombing the Soviet Union when only one country had the bombs but now two countries have the bomb

1901
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,784
Are they going to change the dynamic

1902
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,880
What takes the fear level

1903
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:32,000
An exponentially can found it because now all of a sudden the United States have to worry

1904
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:37,632
About having the same thing happened with the places like Belgium and Germany have had to worry about forever

1905
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:43,264
But the US isn't going to get invaded in the old-fashioned sense but what's the difference

1906
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,312
Eventually some other power

1907
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:51,456
Can just ignore the fact you have a couple of oceans protecting you and turn your city's into smoking heaps of rubble

1908
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:59,904
The United States hadn't faced anything comparable to this since the British burned the Capitol building in the War of 1812

1909
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:05,536
Psychologically it would affect any power the United States though

1910
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:08,608
With this extra sense of invulnerability it's always had

1911
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,656
Was in a unique place in its history

1912
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,056
Now the other side becoming a nuclear power does a couple of things first of all

1913
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,360
It closes the circle

1914
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
In terms of

1915
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:24,480
Creating the dynamic that we have lived with ever since

1916
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:28,064
This Dynamic of both sides being able

1917
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:32,416
To do incredible amount of damage to each other at least theoretically

1918
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,280
Very different Dynamic than only one side being able to do that

1919
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:40,608
The other thing that happens in a geopolitical sense

1920
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,144
Is the era of

1921
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,472
The United States having that MasterCard

1922
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,776
As the Secretary of Defense and said

1923
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,824
The royal straight flush

1924
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
That's over with

1925
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:54,432
The window of opportunity is another

1926
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:59,552
Advisor had said this. When the US was the only nuclear-powered that's over with two

1927
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,112
And predictably

1928
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
The

1929
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:05,696
Question of how to respond

1930
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,232
Ran the gamut

1931
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,608
With even sober humanitarian type scientists trying to figure out

1932
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,656
If all of a sudden the balance of

1933
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:20,032
Rational thought has swung towards the idea of will now that they are nuclear power

1934
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,080
We should nuke tomorrow we can

1935
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:27,712
In his book prisoner dilemma author William Poundstone quotes

1936
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,016
Harry Truman science advisor

1937
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,552
A guy named William golden

1938
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:35,136
Who penned a letter where he tried to imagine how

1939
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:41,536
A man from Mars Mike view the geopolitical situation in other words somebody didn't have any humans

1940
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,584
In the game just from a purely

1941
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,656
Dispassionate outside observers Viewpoint and he wrote

1942
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:47,680
About the

1943
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:52,288
Soviets having the bomb now in the way that the US and the rest of the West should respond and he said

1944
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
Quote

1945
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:59,200
This brings up the matter of immediate use or threat of use of our weapons

1946
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,248
Let us not delude ourselves

1947
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,856
To bring about a true International control agreement with Russia we would have to use them

1948
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:08,160
The consequences would be Dreadful indeed

1949
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:14,560
Even though I assume that the Russians have so few a bombs now that they could do little or no damage to the USA

1950
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,352
Even if it could put them on target

1951
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:19,168
In theory we should issue an ultimatum

1952
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:22,496
And use the bombs against Russia now

1953
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:25,568
From here on WE inevitably lose ground

1954
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:31,968
And this is true no matter what how much greater rate we produce no matter how much more potent weapons for once

1955
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:38,368
Russia is in a position to put a bombs on our City's no matter how inefficient those bombs maybe and how few in number

1956
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,184
She's in a position to do with unspeakable injury

1957
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:47,072
That we can retaliate a hundredfold or wipe out every Russian will not repair the damage

1958
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,096
So we're good

1959
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:54,240
Low morale case can be made by the disinterested Man From Mars for are shooting at once

1960
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
And quote

1961
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:59,360
Then goes on to say however we won't do it of course

1962
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:03,200
No matter what the alternative because the public would never support it

1963
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:09,856
The last comment is fascinating again cuz your again tempted to see this some sort of an ethical evolutionary

1964
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Change

1965
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:14,976
Mean with the ancient Bronze Age civilizations have hesitated the minute

1966
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,512
Don't know

1967
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:21,632
Of course if one wanted to look at it in a more cynical way

1968
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,680
Maybe you just say

1969
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:30,592
No one wants to be living on what will turn into a nuclear Battlefield if such a war breaks out

1970
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:33,408
Also when your country talks about starting one

1971
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:40,064
Or being the first to introduce such a weapon I think maybe there's just a survival Instinct kicks in and maybe the p

1972
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,624
People from the Bronze Age would have understood that perfectly

1973
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:46,976
But we come to another one of those moments now

1974
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:50,048
A fork in the road a decision

1975
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:56,704
Between maybe what you could call doing things the way we always have for all the right reasons

1976
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,568
And acting in a way that would sort of defy your expectations

1977
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,360
Giving human history

1978
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,664
And it's what are you doing now

1979
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,760
Will you do if your the United States and you just had your

1980
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:12,064
Atomic Monopoly destroyed

1981
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,392
Human Nature

1982
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:18,720
And all of human history would say you try to go get another Monopoly

1983
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:26,400
Continue work right you develop the next system you regain dominance and superiority in

1984
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:32,800
I feel nobody wants to be the one who's the last person to invent a machine gun or something like that you lose a war that way

1985
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,128
The last Nation to get an Air Force right

1986
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:41,760
But if you are already struggling to try to figure out how to handle

1987
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:46,112
You know not having catastrophe strike in the world of atomic weapons

1988
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,720
How sort of against the grain

1989
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:55,840
Hermann Einstein and Oppenheimer viewpoint does it sound to talk about making

1990
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,144
A super super weapon

1991
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:04,032
The super was actually the nickname for the next

1992
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,872
Level in Human Weapon Redevelopment that was already

1993
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,200
Theorize and it working already begun on

1994
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,760
A weapon that would make

1995
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:18,112
The atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki look like

1996
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:18,880
Nothing

1997
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,208
Weapons that require.

1998
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:26,048
A bomb like the bomb used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1999
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,584
As a primer

2000
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:29,888
Moritz main explosion

2001
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:36,288
A guy named Edward Teller is most famous for association with what

2002
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,312
Will be

2003
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:41,152
The weapon that makes atomic bombs obsolete

2004
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:45,248
A guy like J Robert Oppenheimer who

2005
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:48,576
One of Truman's aides said was too much of a poet

2006
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:54,720
And not enough of a hardheaded realist but the kind of bomb that a guy like J Robert Oppenheimer would say

2007
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
Is is

2008
01:58:56,256 --> 01:59:00,864
Farther than we should go we should no longer develop more powerful weapons than the ones we have

2009
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:05,472
Think about how much that runs against the grain of human behavior

2010
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,360
Could we if faced with Extinction decide to cap

2011
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:18,272
Weapons research and development we will never discover anything more powerful or deadly than this

2012
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,832
How do you shut off

2013
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,696
Information like that he keep someone else from developing it

2014
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,048
Is the Angel problems that Humanities always had to deal with

2015
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:34,144
And right after the Soviets demonstrate that they too are now an atomic power

2016
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:40,544
Harry Truman have to Russell once again with all sorts of forces and uncertainties and he's

2017
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,872
He's in a brand new era of human history with no roadmap

2018
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:50,528
This is a guy by the way who had been vice president for like 5 minutes when Franklin Roosevelt died

2019
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:56,928
Edwin cried saying he wasn't up to the job he's dropped two nuclear weapons on Japan ended the

2020
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,464
Second world war in the fact

2021
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,768
And now he's called upon

2022
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,584
Too Faced these kind of pressures it's crazy

2023
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,656
One can only

2024
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:09,984
Whether you think he did a good job or not

2025
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,800
Have some sympathy

2026
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:13,824
For the

2027
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,640
For the haberdasher from Missouri

2028
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:21,248
Which is what this guy was like the artillery captain from the first World War

2029
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:29,184
Truman is not one of the great minds of History one of the Marcus Aurelius type leaders he's just a pretty

2030
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:35,584
Normal human being put in the situation where he literally is making decisions about whether or not we can build stuff to destroy the

2031
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,912
And whether or not that's a good decision

2032
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:42,240
After the Soviets

2033
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:47,360
Blow up their first a bomb Truman asks for some help and some

2034
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:50,688
Advisors and he gets the Wiseman together

2035
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:55,296
It's not exactly philosopher-kings but it is the physicists

2036
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,344
Who invented the first weapon

2037
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,904
Bunch of the mini with led by the guy

2038
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,976
Truman's a that was too much of a poet

2039
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,512
J Robert Oppenheimer

2040
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,304
Obviously folding

2041
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:11,424
Text from the Bhagavad Gita so maybe there's a point there nonetheless put him in a room

2042
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,776
In October 1949 says should we develop the next

2043
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:20,896
Level of Weaponry above Atomic weapons and is it possible and if we did it with his helping

2044
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:24,224
Do we need a Manhattan program for the next super weapon

2045
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,040
The one that makes our current super weapon obsolete

2046
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:30,624
And the physicist winning a room

2047
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,672
Talked about this an issue to report

2048
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:35,744
And the report by the physicist said

2049
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,536
Don't build

2050
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,560
This weapon

2051
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:43,680
Just went by the way or something today we call a thermonuclear bomb

2052
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,240
Or a thermonuclear Warhead

2053
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:47,776
Hydrogen bomb

2054
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:55,200
Thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

2055
02:01:56,224 --> 02:02:00,064
And described by nuclear expert Joseph cirrincione

2056
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:05,952
As the equivalent of bringing a literal piece of the sun down onto Earth

2057
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:10,304
There is no upper limit to their power

2058
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:16,192
In the report Oppenheimer & Friends

2059
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:22,592
Essentially now 5 years after the atomic bomb was dropped have a chance to see how Humanity's dealing with it

2060
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:27,456
And they've decided maybe in Reading between the lines here that we haven't evolved

2061
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,480
Enough yet

2062
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:31,808
Something like the hydrogen bomb the report says quote

2063
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:34,880
We believe the superbomb should never be produced

2064
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,928
Mankind would be far better off

2065
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:40,512
Not to have a demonstration of the feasibility of such a weapon

2066
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,840
Until the present climate of world opinion changes

2067
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,608
And quote

2068
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:48,448
Is that code for until we evolve more

2069
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:52,032
They also seem to be

2070
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:54,592
Suggesting that this is a chance

2071
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,896
To provide an example

2072
02:02:57,408 --> 02:03:01,760
On how we can break the patterns of the past because we have to to survive

2073
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
They write quote

2074
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:09,696
In determining not to proceed to develop the superbomb we see a unique opportunity up

2075
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:14,560
Providing by example some limitations on the totality of War

2076
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:18,912
And that's limiting the fear and arousing the hopes of mankind

2077
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,192
And quote

2078
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,544
There's that poet

2079
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,872
Oppenheimer & is rainbow and unicorns coming out again

2080
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,176
The people around Truman might say

2081
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:35,808
The great Enrico Fermi and another physicist

2082
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,112
Pandan even more

2083
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:44,768
Apocalyptic respond that they didn't think that the one that I just read you goes far enough

2084
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:48,864
They wrote this and I quote it in its entirety cuz it is shocking

2085
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,912
They're basically saying

2086
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:55,264
You are inventing weapons that can now do the equivalent

2087
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:01,664
I'm creating giant natural catastrophes if you could turn on for example the ability to cause

2088
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,968
Cause a massive tsunami or something

2089
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,016
From me and his colleague right quote

2090
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:12,672
A decision on the proposal that an all-out effort be undertaken for the development of the super

2091
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:17,280
Can our opinion be separated from considerations of broad National policy

2092
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:23,936
A weapon like the super is only an advantage when its energy releases from 100 to 1000

2093
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:26,496
Times greater than that of ordinary atomic bombs

2094
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,544
The area of Destruction therefore

2095
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:33,664
Would run from 150 to approximately 1000 square miles or more

2096
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:38,528
Necessarily such a weapon goes far beyond any military objective

2097
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:42,112
And enters the range of very great natural catastrophes

2098
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:45,952
My very nature it cannot be confined to a military objective

2099
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:50,304
Becomes a weapon which impractical effect is almost one of genocide

2100
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:55,424
It is clear that the use of such a weapon cannot be justified on any ethical ground

2101
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:01,824
Which gives a human being a certain individuality and dignity even if he happens to be a resident of an enemy

2102
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:05,920
Country it is evident to us that this would be the view of peoples in other countries

2103
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:11,296
It's used what put the United States in a bad moral position relative to the peoples of the world

2104
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:17,952
Any post-war situation resulting from such a weapon would leave unresolvable and middies for generator

2105
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:22,816
Nations a desirable peace cannot come from such an inhuman application of force

2106
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:26,656
The post-war problems with dwarf the problems which confront us at present

2107
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
And quote

2108
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:35,360
That's pretty harsh and you can say to yourself well you know some of these physicists live in their own unreal world

2109
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:38,944
But David lilienthal from the atomic energy Commission

2110
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:44,576
One of the people who pushed back against the idea of using atomic bombs during the Berlin Airlift

2111
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:46,368
Running his diary

2112
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:52,000
About the way the government was leaning and it was not in the direction the physicist wanted when he said quote

2113
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:57,376
More and better bombs where will this lead

2114
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,912
Is difficult to see

2115
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:05,312
We keep saying we have no other course but we should say is we're not bright enough to see any other car

2116
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,080
Course

2117
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,360
And quote

2118
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:13,760
So you run into the people that give you the old Machiavellian

2119
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:20,416
Reality which is we've got to build these bomb cuz the other side's going to build them to in the last thing you want to do

2120
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:24,256
Is be the last person to own the next level of weaponry

2121
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,560
It makes total sense given our history

2122
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:30,912
What the physicists are telling us is that everything you learned in your history everything's been

2123
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:37,312
Need a paste it onto your DNA from thousands of years of human evolution some cities first cropped up is obsolete

2124
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,384
And you can either change that standard template

2125
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:44,224
No by which you gauge what you should do in any given situation

2126
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,528
Will you can find yourself a victim

2127
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,600
I'm a weapon that makes an atomic bomb

2128
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:51,904
Look like a conventional bomb

2129
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:59,584
Truman as usual had many more pressures Weighing on him

2130
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:07,008
David lilienthal in his diary also record the statement by Senator Brien McMahon

2131
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:11,104
Describe sort of the mood that the American people would have

2132
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:17,248
If they found out that the Russians had an h-bomb but the United States didn't he said quote

2133
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:23,904
Why a president who didn't approve going ahead on the h-bomb all-out would be hanging from a Lamppost if the

2134
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,952
The Russian should get it and we hadn't

2135
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:26,976
And quote

2136
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,584
Kind of hard to argue with that logic isn't it

2137
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,656
Same logic we operate with today

2138
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:38,496
And it's hard not to be struck here

2139
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,520
Isn't it

2140
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,800
When you consider

2141
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:45,920
Estranged divide between the level of the intelligence of the people

2142
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:50,528
That were put together to create the super weapons

2143
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:56,928
Versus the level of intelligence of the people whose decision it will be whether or not to use them

2144
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,256
The political class in these

2145
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:03,328
Democracies and republics for example but let's remember

2146
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:08,448
As that statement by that Senator points out how heavily influenced AR by public opinion

2147
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:13,056
We're living on a knife-edge

2148
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,616
How these weapons are used in

2149
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:22,272
How wise we can be about them do you really want that decision devolving down to the average Joe and Jane level

2150
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:27,648
The counter proposal by the way by physicists like Oppenheimer

2151
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:31,232
Over why you don't need to build the super weapon

2152
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:37,120
Is that you've reached a maximum threshold when it comes to the power of these weapons to do anything

2153
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,936
They offer the idea

2154
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:42,240
That you can just use atomic bomb

2155
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:47,360
To deter anyone who got any weapon greater cuz you don't need anything bigger than that

2156
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:54,784
They may say we'll drop a hydrogen bomb on your city that's a thousand times more powerful than your puny a bomb yes but the

2157
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,088
I'm still basically takes out the city

2158
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:02,464
You trade and cities were cities and what Oppenheimer and those guys were saying is that

2159
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:05,536
Once you lose a city in this deal

2160
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:10,656
What you're trading City for City you have the deterrent value you need to stop somebody else

2161
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,960
I'm attacking you with any kind of weapon

2162
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:15,520
This is

2163
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:19,104
The beginning of the ideas of nuclear deterrence

2164
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,944
You begin to see the introduction into this debate

2165
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:26,272
Of a civilian class of intellectual

2166
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:30,112
Will become sort of the alternative

2167
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:36,768
To the rainbow and unicorn poets like oppenheimer's approach where they wanted to become different people than we've always been

2168
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,328
The other side of that coin these these people

2169
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:45,984
I would say we're not going to change and it's too hard to change you and the system isn't flexible enough even with we wanted to change the

2170
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,288
We're going to have to learn how to live with these weapons

2171
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:50,592
Intelligently as we can

2172
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:58,528
And big civilian thinkers started to meet with each other starting about 1945 right after the first day of autumn

2173
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:00,320
4 dropped at the end of the second World War

2174
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:05,440
And he began to coalesce in groups and meetings at Major University Place like Yale for example

2175
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,512
These experts would come from a wide range of

2176
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:14,400
Discipline social scientist political scientist physicists of course but also people like

2177
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:19,520
The civilian leaders of agencies. David lilienthal from the atomic energy commission was there

2178
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:23,360
And they would debate these fundamental questions

2179
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:27,456
The simply had to be answered in this new era first of all

2180
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,992
Could you use these weapons

2181
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,296
If you use them

2182
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:36,928
Did that make ground war and and tanks and armies obsolete what will World War 3 be like

2183
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,512
All kinds of fundamental questions down the problem

2184
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,792
For these people

2185
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:44,096
Is that all of this stuff

2186
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:47,680
Is part of what you normally considered to be

2187
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:52,288
The responsibility and the prerogative of the military leaders

2188
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:55,616
No tell the general how to use his weapons

2189
02:10:56,128 --> 02:11:00,736
That's not your business you tell me where to go and what to do in terms of winning I'll take care of it

2190
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,576
Now the weapons were so powerful

2191
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:07,136
The meaning of the big thinkers out there argued

2192
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:11,488
It's simply using them had a huge political implications

2193
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,608
Something you could not delegate to a general on the ground who might think he needed Atomic weapons

2194
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:23,264
To blow up the entrenchments on that enemy he'll not realizing that he can lose the entire war of global public

2195
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,616
Look at pinion by doing so I'll write another word to the use of this most powerful weapon

2196
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:31,712
Had to be in the hands of the supreme leader whomever that might be

2197
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:40,672
Well in 1950 that's still Harry Truman by the way in January 1950 after reading the report

2198
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:42,464
Work from Oppenheimer and his fellow

2199
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,768
Scientist saying don't build a super bomb

2200
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:47,072
Truman decide to build the super bomb

2201
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,632
The reasons given

2202
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:54,496
And in the people around him you've given the recent they all revolve around the same thing again

2203
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:57,568
Easily understandable stuff you can't be outdone

2204
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:04,736
Truman even mentioned the psychology of Adam even if you believe the idea that Oppenheimer floated that you can just use a bong

2205
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,016
Against their h-bombs

2206
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:10,112
The psychological effect on the American people was unacceptable

2207
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:13,952
It was a standard understandable response they're going to get it so we have to have it

2208
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:18,304
I do know the way you can kind of reliably

2209
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:25,216
Test to see if this is something that you know there was such a thing as collective human DNA means the species of

2210
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:26,752
Hold it it's in there somewhere

2211
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,824
Can you imagine humankind

2212
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,128
Saying no

2213
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,688
To a more powerful weapon system

2214
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:40,064
I mean I'm sure there's groups on the planet is a very peaceful group of people in that part of the world they would say no

2215
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,392
What is a hole when you think of the powers at the very height of

2216
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:46,464
Important can you imagine them saying you know

2217
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,744
Yes we know that's a much

2218
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,816
Bigger and more powerful weapon than we have but we're okay with what we

2219
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,352
Currently possess we don't need that

2220
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,376
Bigger weapons

2221
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,936
Let me get the aliens landed tomorrow

2222
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,752
And we found out the biggest weapon they had

2223
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,056
Destroy the galaxies in the blink of an eye

2224
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:02,592
What's the x 14

2225
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:07,200
They're going to be people on this planet right away that say we have to have an x 14

2226
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:14,112
The walk all over if we don't have what even if we don't know how to use it even if it might destroy the Galaxy as long as we have one they can't judge

2227
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,904
Israel all I have to take it into account

2228
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:17,696
Wrightwood, player

2229
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,816
We will not be subject to escalation dominance

2230
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:29,472
Psychologically it's important for those aliens to know we have an x 14 2

2231
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,264
Here's the thing though

2232
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:36,896
The Truman administration at the time that he approves going ahead with this hydrogen bomb

2233
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:40,736
Still hasn't figured out how to use the great power of the atomic bomb

2234
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:46,624
You still trying to figure out what you do with that cuz it's so powerful and yet now we're going to move ahead with

2235
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,184
Having a hundred times more powerful than that

2236
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:55,584
Truman has taken the pistol out of the hands of that 5 year old was trying to figure out what you do with that

2237
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,376
And the Machine Gun instead

2238
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:02,752
He still doesn't know what to do with it but at least it's a lot more power

2239
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,360
That's kind of where we are because

2240
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:10,688
In this period between 1945 and 1950

2241
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:16,064
When it's this theoretical. Punctuated by lots of scares and near misses and threatened

2242
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,088
And all that

2243
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:23,488
People are trying to figure out what you can really do with these things in Oppenheimer and his folk it said you don't need anything

2244
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:25,024
Think bigger than an atomic bomb

2245
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:32,448
The problem is a during this time. There is no chance to do what will later be called counterforce really

2246
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,800
Counterforce means using your nuclear weapons against the enemies military targets

2247
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,616
At this stage of development

2248
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:41,920
You are lucky to use them against to anything

2249
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:45,760
Use them against big things cities with people

2250
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:48,064
These are City destroying

2251
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,088
Weapons

2252
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,648
And that's what you use them for in this.

2253
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:58,816
The question of the Moor political minds are asking during the security does that get us what we want

2254
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:04,704
I mean if the thought is that you're going to kill millions and millions of people

2255
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,776
Do you end up with an outcome

2256
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,824
In the end

2257
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:12,128
It was better than what you had before

2258
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,944
Banana courser really important

2259
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,272
Question during the entire period of the cold warning and up to now

2260
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:22,624
Is does the other side really think you do that

2261
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,720
Remember they were really

2262
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:33,120
During this. Two kinds of people when it comes to nuclear weapons to kindly things you can use these things to do plan

2263
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,448
And the kind you thinks you can't use them

2264
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:38,752
But even those people think

2265
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:43,616
Did they still make up a part of what you can use to threaten other people

2266
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:47,968
Being the best use of this tool

2267
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,272
As many theorist during this period

2268
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,320
Thought about it anyway

2269
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
Was it at

2270
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:58,976
Created something where you could tell someone else do that or else or

2271
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:01,792
Don't do that or else you'll get new

2272
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,632
Remember Truman did this several times

2273
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,936
After the second world war in before 1950

2274
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:16,128
But in April 1950 Truman is presented with a document that will become one of the most important and yet

2275
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:20,736
Very little known actually documents in American history is called nsc-68

2276
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:23,040
And it did a lot of things including

2277
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:26,624
Pushed forward some of the hydrogen bomb development stuff

2278
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:29,696
But what nsc-68 did in

2279
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:33,280
In paragraph after paragraphs is spot the hole

2280
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,840
In his entire defense strategy

2281
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:40,704
The fact that you basically were relying on a threat

2282
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:43,264
And if the threat were called

2283
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:48,384
You either had to Nuke the other side and kill millions of people or back down

2284
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:52,480
Other powers could test that

2285
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,832
They could try to find a point

2286
02:16:57,344 --> 02:16:58,624
Underneath the threshold

2287
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,672
Of when you would use these weapons

2288
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:07,072
What if somebody just sort of gobbled up their neighbor a little at a time

2289
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,352
When.do.you Newcomb

2290
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:16,032
Allies were worried about this too because they were starting to think that maybe

2291
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:22,688
The United States would be willing to use nuclear weapons for themselves and their own protection but if it was somebody in Europe that they said they

2292
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:27,040
Check baby they don't nuke anyone for that maybe they don't kill millions and millions and millions of Russians

2293
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:29,344
If the Russians invade West Germany

2294
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:33,952
That kind of thing would make the West Germans nervous for example

2295
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:43,424
One of the things nsc-68 side is that the risk that they were running right now with their strategy of

2296
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,728
Nuke everything or nothing with quote

2297
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,544
The risk was having no better choice

2298
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:54,944
Then to capitulate or precipitate a global war and decoding other words they had no flexibility at all it was new

2299
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:55,712
Nukes or nothing

2300
02:17:56,480 --> 02:18:00,832
Nsc-68 becomes the document that Advocates a huge increase

2301
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:01,856
Back

2302
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:04,160
2 spending on Conventional Weapons tanks

2303
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:06,720
Plane naval ships all the other stuff

2304
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,024
But doesn't back off the nuclear stuff either

2305
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:15,680
In other words whereas before the budgetary choice was between this or that now it's this and that and everything more

2306
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,472
This becomes a document

2307
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:20,544
The Begins the giant military buildup in the US

2308
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:23,872
In the role as sort of the policeman of the Free World

2309
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,664
That we still live with today

2310
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:34,880
Now initially Truman looked at this thing and we are told by the history books. This was going to be horribly expensive and true

2311
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,672
Intended to be fiscally conservative

2312
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:40,256
Any sort of put it on hold and thought about it a little bit and then in June

2313
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:42,816
On the 25th actually 1950

2314
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:45,888
The North Korean Communists invaded South Korea

2315
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,728
And what that man was it all of a sudden

2316
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,776
I'm moving very quickly

2317
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:55,872
And hard to get your mind around and react and debate and deliberate

2318
02:18:57,408 --> 02:19:01,760
What'd initially seemed like it was too much money to spend for Truman

2319
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:04,576
I'm probably Congress and the American people

2320
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,368
I think it was something like a

2321
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,696
In Virtual tripling of us defense expenditures

2322
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:11,744
Seems like a no-brainer

2323
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:14,048
Now that all of a sudden

2324
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:18,144
For all intents and purposes as far as anyone could tell with quickly moving events

2325
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:22,240
The fuse for the third world war seemed to have been lit

2326
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:32,224
Korean War as it's come to be known is so fascinating as so many things involved with it that have nothing to do

2327
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:35,552
Do with the great power that would make a wonderful discussion all by itself

2328
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:38,112
And I really resist

2329
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,672
Going off into too many tangents and try to stay on

2330
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:42,976
On the focus which is

2331
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:46,304
But it's a completely different sort of challenge

2332
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:52,704
Then trying to live with these amazingly powerful weapon in the Temptation in the fear and the uncertainty that they

2333
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,264
Can I bring to the table this new thing

2334
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,568
In peacetime

2335
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,104
Even with all the

2336
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,896
Retsina scares

2337
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:07,808
Entirely different matter to try to deal with the Temptation and fear and uncertainty involving them

2338
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,600
In Wartime

2339
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:13,696
And let's also remember the very

2340
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:18,304
Other human elements involved that are operating sort of underneath the scenes here

2341
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,864
There are a lot of people

2342
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,472
11 vested reputations and viewpoints and all sorts of things into

2343
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:30,080
The efficacy of these weapons and what you can do with them than once of the game changers they are

2344
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:33,408
So now we were going to find out

2345
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,200
You know whether they were right

2346
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:36,992
We're all these

2347
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:43,392
Pronouncements and positions taken in peacetime going to play out the way The Advocates and opponents thought they were going to play out

2348
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:45,184
Now that we have a real

2349
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:47,744
Live fire situation going on

2350
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:53,376
If there was ever a conflict that would tempt

2351
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:55,936
May leader to use Atomic weapons

2352
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:58,752
The Korean War seems tailor-made for

2353
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:05,920
Because eventually it will settle down to an almost first world war Style

2354
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:08,736
Very little movement kind of stalemate

2355
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:14,112
But initially it is an absolute bar brawl

2356
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:20,768
Where the momentum swings wildly from side-to-side and there's crazies after crazies and each side gets in

2357
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:21,792
Ended their own trouble

2358
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:26,144
Initially the North Korean Communist forces

2359
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:32,544
With tanks and people that have fought in the Chinese Civil War just swarm down start smashing the South Korea

2360
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:35,616
Reinforces driving them South towards the water

2361
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:39,968
And this is going to be a Dunkirk with no place to go if you catch my meaning

2362
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:44,832
They outnumber them they have our Mormon is a whole bunch of reasons why it happened

2363
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:47,136
Taqueria

2364
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:49,184
Had been just what I'm getting

2365
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:53,024
The idea of Independence down after being occupied by Japan

2366
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,584
At the end of the second world war the Soviets

2367
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:01,984
It occupied the top half of the country basically the west of the bottom half of the country they put in governments to

2368
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:06,336
But they were in friendly with a communist one in the North in the non-communist one of the South

2369
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:08,384
And then kind of sort of

2370
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:14,784
Look elsewhere while the whole Berlin thing is playing out in a bigger fish to fry as a matter of fact in the Korean War breaks out there's a

2371
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,880
A large contingent of people that thinks that this is just a diversionary faint

2372
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:21,952
Shurhold Joe Stalin

2373
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:28,352
Does a little move in Korea the entire free world in the moves their military forces their we get bogged down and then he

2374
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,376
He invades in Europe

2375
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,960
My people thought.

2376
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:38,080
The historian John Lewis got it makes a very interesting point

2377
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:44,736
Saying that if this hadn't been a World War II style attack with tanks in the whole thing going over the Border

2378
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:48,576
Basically an open auto Andover challenge

2379
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:54,976
To the post-war idea that wouldn't have collected defensive there's never going to be another Hitler in Nebraska Wars never going to win again

2380
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,512
Got it says if this

2381
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,864
Attacking been more like the way the Vietnamese were very good at attacking

2382
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:07,264
15 years after this were they were they would send in gorillas and it would be subversive and slow and infiltration and

2383
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:13,664
Will you never know where the decision points are that the Americans probably wouldn't have gotten involved at all but this was a chair

2384
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,456
Challenge and somebody

2385
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:18,272
Had to stand up to it or at least that's the way

2386
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:20,064
It look to Truman

2387
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,088
Who was just

2388
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:27,488
In the major stages of codifying one of the policy he's most known for instigating something Cost Containment

2389
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,376
There were several different views on how you handle the spread of Communism from the domino effect

2390
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:39,520
The one that was eventually part of nsc-68 was called containment don't let it spread any farther

2391
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:45,920
There were other more aggressive ones like rollback or another one that Liberation was with some of the far-right

2392
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:46,944
Hawks wanted

2393
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:55,648
Containment is what sort of became the policy of the United States and that's going to be your policy even if you thought that just meant you were going

2394
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:58,464
Going to give money and Aid and help certain governments

2395
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:03,072
Now you had a situation on your hands were if you didn't act and you didn't act soon

2396
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:08,192
South Korea was going to disappear it was going to be a fait accompli it wasn't going to matter what you said

2397
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:13,312
It wasn't going to be two koreas anymore you weren't going to be able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again

2398
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:18,176
You know in like 3 days the capital of South Korea Falls what are you going to do

2399
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:23,552
We're so many other things we have to remember we're on going at this time

2400
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:30,208
The importance of which has faded in the 70 years since remember this is 5 years after the second World War

2401
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:32,256
These people had

2402
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:38,912
Began to think that they had made War illegal for lack of a better word they had once again built

2403
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:39,936
Old structures

2404
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:46,336
What they thought were new and improved structures over the last World War structures the League of Nations proved

2405
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:53,504
Toothless tigers and that we had a new and improved version of it called the United Nations and this is a real test for the United

2406
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,808
Truman involved them

2407
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,856
You're basically right away

2408
02:24:58,112 --> 02:25:03,232
They start debating what to do and as fate would have it and it never went this way again

2409
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:09,120
The Soviet Union happened to be boycotting the UN at the time so they were not there

2410
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,936
Now as we all know today

2411
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:15,776
What we would have expected to happen given our understanding of History

2412
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:19,360
What's a twin this question of what should we all do about this Korean War thing

2413
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:22,432
Came to the UN the Soviet Union as

2414
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:28,576
Friends and backers and fellow communist with the North Koreans would have used their veto which several members

2415
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:32,416
Of the UNR on the security Council permanently and wage

2416
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:38,816
And have a veto that they can use and often do the Soviet Union one of each of the whole thing and everything would have been modeled in there would have

2417
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:40,352
Unified effort

2418
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,448
Because they happen to be boycotting at the time they couldn't do that

2419
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,008
And the US with a bunch of other nations

2420
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:51,360
Got an agreement together to go in and save South Korea quickly and the US

2421
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:53,152
And other countries

2422
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:59,552
Became really a United Nations Army at least in terms of the marketing and media

2423
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:02,112
Nations Flag that flew on some of these tanks

2424
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:04,416
Never been quite this way again

2425
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:07,488
The implication was that all the sudden you were going to have any

2426
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,072
Global World Army that could go in and do things like this

2427
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:13,632
In addition

2428
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:17,728
Truman put in charge one of the heroes of the second World War

2429
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:24,128
Douglas MacArthur right the guy who so famously in the Pacific said I shall return and then eventually comes back and goes I have ra

2430
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:24,896
Returned

2431
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:26,432
I'm he's he's

2432
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,760
Eisenhower family studies study Dramatics for years

2433
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:31,296
As a subordinate to

2434
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:32,320
MacArthur

2435
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:37,952
Just put in charge of these forces that rushed over from Japan

2436
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:44,352
These are a bunch of guys have been sitting in Japan enjoying themselves for a few years they're not exactly crack combat troops when they get

2437
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:46,144
Get there and there's not many of them

2438
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:49,984
And the Air Force comes in the Navy gets involved very quickly you find out that that

2439
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:56,128
Defense secretary Louis A Johnson that it will never need another amphibious operation you don't need an AV

2440
02:26:56,384 --> 02:27:02,528
Was about as wrong as you could be because when the Korean war broke out and within five days the United States is trying to

2441
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:04,832
Be there on the ground to save South Korea from falling

2442
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:07,392
And they just don't have what they need straight up

2443
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:14,816
When I get in there and now it looks like they're going to get defeated with the South Koreans it's just a terrible situation

2444
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:16,864
Situation becomes the first moment where

2445
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,656
You think God you know if you had some

2446
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:24,800
Really good tactical nuclear weapons during this. You can see some places where you just love to use them but they don't have that right now

2447
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:29,152
But over and over again situation will change

2448
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,992
Eventually they'll be enough forces build up

2449
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:37,344
The UN forces can start pushing back and creating a larger perimeter and then

2450
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,928
MacArthur and maybe the greatest move of his career

2451
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:45,280
Lands End amphibious operation in your face Louis A Johnson

2452
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:49,632
At Incheon behind the North Korean lines Cuts them off

2453
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:50,912
Begins to

2454
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:57,312
Peter push back up now towards North Korea so we've gone from defending South Korea to now moving in

2455
02:27:57,568 --> 02:28:00,128
North Korea and there are warnings be careful

2456
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,664
You're approaching China

2457
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,200
They might not like that

2458
02:28:03,456 --> 02:28:08,320
Even though MacArthur is supposedly finding Chinese dead people when he goes over and

2459
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:14,720
Looks at what should be North Korea dead people he tells President Truman don't worry Chinese are going to get involved and secretly

2460
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:17,024
Later on you find out he's not scared of him anyway

2461
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:23,424
So they don't have the logistics and what are they going to do nothing going to happen and he continues to move forces closer to

2462
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,520
Airline and then they Whack Him would like 200 300 thousand guys

2463
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:28,800
Boom

2464
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:34,432
The war changes again now the Chinese have entered the conflict

2465
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:38,016
Think of how quickly this escalated

2466
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:39,552
From me

2467
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:42,624
North Korean South Korean affair

2468
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:46,976
2 something where you now have the United States of America and

2469
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:51,840
A multitude of its Western allies the great powers of the West

2470
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:55,680
Facing off against red China on the Asian mainland

2471
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:57,728
Back by the Soviet Union

2472
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:04,896
We started this on June 25th 1950 within a couple of days the u.s. in the western involved

2473
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:07,968
By September you of The inchon Landings in the hole

2474
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:12,320
Complexion of the war changes by late October or early November the Chinese are in it

2475
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,392
But not

2476
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:16,672
Officially

2477
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:23,072
And that becomes part of where you begin to see this evolving

2478
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:26,144
Into a very post

2479
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,448
Second World War forum

2480
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,032
A form that is largely dictated

2481
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,080
Existence

2482
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:36,640
And possible use of nuclear weapon

2483
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:41,248
This is when it becomes a parent

2484
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:45,088
That they keep this from becoming World War 3

2485
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:49,696
All the major powers that would be needed to fight World War 3

2486
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:53,792
Are doing their best to create some plausible deniability

2487
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:56,608
But nobody has to admit this is World War 3

2488
02:29:57,376 --> 02:30:01,472
In one of the interesting theories out there that if you don't have nuclear weapons in the world during this time.

2489
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:04,544
Maybe there's a decent chance this does turn into World War

2490
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,312
Free

2491
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,592
But you can watch

2492
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:09,152
Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union

2493
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:14,784
Maui in red China and Harry Truman all bending over backwards

2494
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:18,112
To be able to tell the world now this is war

2495
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:20,672
Truman's case famously

2496
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:26,560
And when the fighting breaks out and it's the worst since the second world war pretty hard to deny what's going on there

2497
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:32,960
It is war And the reporter says to the president he says President Truman is this war we at War and treatment favor

2498
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:33,984
Usually just right there no

2499
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,264
We are not at War

2500
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,080
And so the reporter counters with something like so

2501
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:44,480
So what is this is just like a police action in Truman famously said something to the effect of about sums it up

2502
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:47,552
And forever after it's been called the police action

2503
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,088
As though

2504
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:51,648
Proper label on this thing

2505
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:53,184
Put a limit on it

2506
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:59,584
It's not just about marketing either

2507
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:04,960
There are real changes I mean the Truman calls this anything besides the war

2508
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:08,544
Does he have to go to Congress and ask them to declare war

2509
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,104
This is another thing that

2510
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,664
The bunch of modern historians are suggesting

2511
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:19,552
Was seen by the people around Truman is kind of a quaint relic of a pre nuclear age

2512
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:24,672
Is Secretary of State and people like that not huge fans of

2513
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:30,816
Even more people being in on the decision making process and Truman was able to put troops In Harm's Way

2514
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:33,888
Without ever having to ask anyone else's permission I mean

2515
02:31:34,912 --> 02:31:37,984
Is there an Gary Wilson the decision to intervene in Korea was made

2516
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,568
Amongst Truman and a tiny group of advisers around himself

2517
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:48,992
The reporter asked that question about are we at War because normally you would know there'd be a big declaration Congress would do it

2518
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:55,392
In the country that use everything in their power they demolish the other side they come home but can you do

2519
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:56,928
Is that a nuclear age

2520
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:02,048
The reason the Korean war is germane to this story

2521
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:06,400
Is because well here's a way historian John Lewis Gaddis explains it quote

2522
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:14,592
The outbreak of fighting in Korea in June 1950 provided the first hard evidence

2523
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:20,992
The Korean War demonstrated how awkward it would be to use atomic bombs even in the most desperate military sir

2524
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:26,624
Circumstances from this perspective they proved to be irrelevant to the outcome of that conflict

2525
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:33,024
From another perspective they were critical importance for Korea determined how hot Wars

2526
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,072
During the Cold War where did he fought

2527
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:41,728
The rule quickly became that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union would confront the other directly

2528
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,288
Or use all available Force

2529
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:48,384
Each would seek instead to confine such confrontation

2530
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,944
Within the theaters in which they had originated

2531
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:57,600
This pattern of tacit cooperation amongst bitter antagonists could hardly have been merged headed not

2532
02:32:57,856 --> 02:33:01,184
I've been for the Existence on both sides of nuclear weapons

2533
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:02,464
And quote

2534
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,144
In order to give them some plausible deniability and basically say we're not at war with United States you don't have a child

2535
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:11,936
Chinese American war going on

2536
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:15,008
Milo and the Chinese labeled

2537
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:19,616
There are hundreds of thousands of Chinese Army troops volunteers

2538
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:26,016
As though you almost don't even know what's happening what did hundreds of thousands of our people in Korea fighting bull who knew

2539
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:29,600
And eventually when the Soviet Union

2540
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:36,000
Who kind of deliberately doesn't get involved I mean I kind of stay away from this instead you got to be careful cuz

2541
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:38,560
The Soviet Union and China have

2542
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:40,864
Signed a pact defense Pact

2543
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:43,680
So if it looks like China is attacked

2544
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:49,568
Automatically the United States at war with the Soviet Union to which the Soviet Union doesn't want

2545
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:50,592
Either

2546
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:56,480
So they're not getting directly involved or staying as far away as they can and will eventually almost cuz they're shamed into it

2547
02:33:56,736 --> 02:33:58,528
They have to send Pilots to help

2548
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,320
They make the pilots

2549
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:03,136
They paint the planes like they're they're Chinese

2550
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:04,416
Volunteer planes

2551
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:10,816
They give him fake names they tell him if they're captured you know you say you were a Russian living in China they don't don't fly over water cuz you

2552
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:13,376
The whole thing as a disguise now

2553
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:16,704
It's not fooling any of the other countries

2554
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:19,520
This is essentially to be able to say

2555
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:21,824
But this is not the kind of War

2556
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:26,176
Where we need to use nuclear weapons although The Temptations keep coming I mean

2557
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:27,968
Tell me a point for example

2558
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,016
Wen 11000

2559
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:34,112
Soldiers most of them American in sub-freezing temperatures are surrounded

2560
02:34:34,368 --> 02:34:35,904
Around the Chosin Reservoir

2561
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:39,232
And there are people that will go to President Truman and say

2562
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:42,816
If mr. president we'd like to use atomic bombs

2563
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:51,264
Keep trying to remind myself that Truman is the first human being to ever have that sort of

2564
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:53,056
Question put to him

2565
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:56,640
To have that kind of responsibility dropped in his lap

2566
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:02,784
You can't fake understanding the ramifications cuz he's already done it twice

2567
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:10,208
What the heck of a thing to put on a human being and Truman as I said didn't just cry when he got the job he basically said

2568
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:15,072
I'm not. I'm not a big enough man for it I'm not a big enough man for it and yet he's the first man in human history

2569
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:17,888
Have this kind of responsibility in his lap

2570
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:26,336
It was a 1952 article in Fortune Magazine where are writer I like name Hadley

2571
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,104
Donovan

2572
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:30,432
Did something which I think is really cool where he

2573
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:33,248
Zoomed out sort of an imagined

2574
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,528
How

2575
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:39,904
Harry Truman power at this stage in world history would have been viewed

2576
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:44,000
And we've been looking at it from 500 years ago or something if we were treating it like

2577
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:50,400
We would treat to the carolingian Empire the Byzantine Empire or something in your history books because we tend to

2578
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,424
Pre-modern history

2579
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:56,032
Totally differently look at through totally different lands in Donovan's article

2580
02:35:57,056 --> 02:36:02,688
Put this in terms that we could recognize a we were talking about events from a thousand years ago when he writes

2581
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,712
Quote

2582
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:11,392
A Californian named Robert Carney Now commands the greatest striking power in the Mediterranean world

2583
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:15,744
The seat of the classic empires of Alexander and Caesar Augustus

2584
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,584
Admiral Carney directs all NATO forces in southern Europe

2585
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,120
And the US sixth Fleet

2586
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:28,288
In northern and western Europe the old Realms of Charlemagne and Napoleon extraordinary military

2587
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:31,360
Korean political influence is held by a Kansas man

2588
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,896
Dwight David Eisenhower

2589
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,432
In Korea

2590
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:40,832
The bridge and Battlefield of half-a-dozen Oriental imperialism's the largest Western army ever lodged

2591
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:44,160
The Asiatic Mainland is led by Matthew Ridgway

2592
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:45,184
From Virginia

2593
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:49,536
All of these officers are answerable of course he writes

2594
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,840
Do Native of Independence Missouri

2595
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:55,168
If the president of the US were ever tempted to think of himself

2596
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:57,216
As Emperor Harry the first

2597
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,520
There is no evidence that he has been

2598
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:03,104
He can look about the world with considerable personal satisfaction

2599
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:04,896
And quote

2600
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:09,248
And yet several times in this war he will be asked

2601
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:14,624
To unleash the sort of hell that none of the people who ran those earlier Empires

2602
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,928
Could ever dream of being able to inflict

2603
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
When it's

2604
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:20,256
Noteworthy

2605
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:24,352
But he turns them down essentially every time

2606
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:32,032
This is kind of a great interesting psychological question to which there is no clear answer but

2607
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:35,104
There a lot of speculations as I said as to why

2608
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:37,408
Truman doesn't drop this bomb

2609
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:42,016
If it's going to help him out of this jam and Jet lot of political pressure tell me why doesn't he do it

2610
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:47,136
Will this becomes another place in history where

2611
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:49,184
It depends on who you believe

2612
02:37:49,952 --> 02:37:56,096
That was a fan of History I simply read all of these different ones and I try to pick the ones in my head which I think are the most

2613
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:59,168
In a logical or make the most sense but often times

2614
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:00,448
Yeah they all kind of

2615
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:01,984
Have a good point I mean

2616
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:07,104
How to win a nuclear war Michio Kaku and Daniel Axelrod amongst other people

2617
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:10,176
Suggest that the reason Truman didn't use

2618
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:14,272
Nuclear weapons in Korea was because he didn't have any extras

2619
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:16,320
2

2620
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:22,720
People who subscribe to that theory the reason isn't moral at all it's simply that the Surplus doesn't exist and if this real

2621
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:29,120
Is a faint in the Soviet Union is just trying to get all our attention over to Asia and then they're going to attack in Europe you're going to want all 300 or

2622
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:33,216
400 atomic bombs in your stockpile so that's one attitude out there

2623
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:40,384
There's another view that they're particularly unsuited to this kind of warfare where you have

2624
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,968
These individual Chinese peasant type infantryman carrying

2625
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:46,272
All they need on their backs over the hills and

2626
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:49,600
Scattered numbers of nuclear weapons not really set up for that

2627
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,160
Is another school of thought that

2628
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:58,560
Are afraid of using them and having them not be as scary as everyone thinks they might be maybe Hiroshima and Nagasaki

2629
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:02,400
Sake where the best place to demonstrate them in terms of scaring people

2630
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:08,032
The most effective conditions you could use them under maybe anything else might be underwhelming so

2631
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:10,848
Are scarier if you don't use and there's all sorts of theories

2632
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:14,176
I can't help but notice a certain pattern

2633
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:20,832
Not that if you look at the first three US presidents have had to Grapple with this amazing amount of power

2634
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:24,160
They have often had to do so

2635
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,440
At

2636
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:29,024
Odds with their military advisors on several occasion

2637
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,888
Truman Eisenhower Kennedy they all will have their advisor saying we think you should use these things

2638
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:36,192
And they will all say no

2639
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,288
It's fascinating to think about that and

2640
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,568
Again one is

2641
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,896
Forced to confront our past and ask if

2642
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:48,736
This is how we would have behaved in earlier Generations

2643
02:39:49,504 --> 02:39:53,856
Or earlier human eras in the same circumstance or whether or not

2644
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:57,952
This is indicative of some sort of evolution or growth

2645
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,280
And if it is growth

2646
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:07,936
Is it ethical growth of these people becoming more ethical than the people of the past or is it intellectual growth

2647
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:09,984
Are we becoming

2648
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:12,544
Intelligent enough to manage these

2649
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:15,616
Unbelievably sophisticated and dangerous weapons

2650
02:40:18,688 --> 02:40:24,576
I can't answer that but I can say one thing for sure it's on a collision course and you don't have to be a genius to see that

2651
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:27,904
With the principal way that the experts

2652
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:30,208
Fight wars during this period remember

2653
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,512
Truman is trying to adapt to this new

2654
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:34,048
Atomic age

2655
02:40:34,304 --> 02:40:40,448
He's got Generals in charge of forces fighting complicated Wars on a nuclear booby-trap geopolitical chessboard

2656
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:42,752
We're born in the 1800s

2657
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,848
MacArthur does not want to worry

2658
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:53,760
About which chess pieces he wants to use on this nuclear booby-trap chessboard or what squares he can and can't move to

2659
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:56,576
He's used to having a free hand

2660
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:59,648
And he and Truman Clash over what he can do

2661
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:07,072
Truman is creating something that will be known as limited War whether he knows it or not during this time

2662
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:07,840
.

2663
02:41:08,864 --> 02:41:15,008
The general that he personally put in charge of all these forces in the not just American forces there's Australians

2664
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:18,080
Brits I mean it is a multinational un Force

2665
02:41:18,336 --> 02:41:24,480
Headed up by this guy Truman put into place and a guy who has famously said and will during this entire crisis anymore

2666
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:26,784
For there is no substitute for victory

2667
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:34,464
When I was a kid it was widely thought that Douglas MacArthur wanted the power to use Atomic weapons himself

2668
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:39,072
Against his adversaries in Korea in the Truman wouldn't let him

2669
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:42,400
But none of the modern history seem to think so

2670
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:47,520
They point out that he didn't want to use nuclear weapons but he did want to be able to fight

2671
02:41:48,032 --> 02:41:53,152
The war in Korea the same way he fought every other conventional war with the standards in the

2672
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:54,944
Attitudes towards victory

2673
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:56,736
But he was accustomed to using

2674
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,576
The problem was as if he did those things

2675
02:42:01,088 --> 02:42:04,672
It would cause the Third World War break out most likely if you're

2676
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:09,536
Truman in your playing this knife-edge dangerous game it's way too much of a Gamble

2677
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:12,864
MacArthur didn't want any rules

2678
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:16,192
Telling him what he couldn't do to fight a war Nguyen

2679
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:23,104
When he said this enough publicly that he disagreed with the president's policy to the media

2680
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:24,896
He had to go

2681
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:31,296
And you know it once again when you think about The Bravery involved here with Truman Truman fan particularly

2682
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:32,576
But

2683
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:36,672
His poll numbers were much lower than Douglas MacArthur

2684
02:42:37,184 --> 02:42:42,304
Douglas MacArthur was a hero to a lot of people in there were a lot of people that just plain didn't like Harry Truman

2685
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:46,144
After he fires MacArthur

2686
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:51,008
MacArthur comes home and a half a million people come out to give him a ticker-tape parade

2687
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:54,848
Most of the newspapers come out from a card I mean

2688
02:42:55,872 --> 02:43:00,224
If your Harry Truman you just made the biggest negative move

2689
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:02,528
Xavier entire presidency

2690
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,880
And it took an amazing amount of God and you paid forever for it

2691
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:08,672
Probably cost you another term

2692
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:11,744
Endure the right decision

2693
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,584
You can say in hindsight because if MacArthur had been allowed to do what he wants

2694
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:18,656
A third world war had broken out

2695
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:22,496
Imagine how different our history is today

2696
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:28,384
Emily have to do is look at what the plans were right

2697
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,456
What do you sumption what the plans were in some cases

2698
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:35,040
Western military leaders assumed

2699
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:38,624
At the Red Army would simply launch attacks across

2700
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:43,488
Premier bases in Eastern Europe into Western Europe and roll all the way to the Atlantic

2701
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:47,584
Think about the destruction that that entails right there

2702
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:55,776
Us plans involve the use of this most dangerous of all human weapons ever invented

2703
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:58,336
No not the nuclear bomb because remember

2704
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:00,896
That's a component in a weapon system

2705
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:07,296
You still had to be able to deliver the bomb this was the problem the Soviets had during the street they may have had like 10 maybe 12

2706
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:08,320
These bombs

2707
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:15,744
They didn't have an adequate delivery system they had no Strategic Air Force didn't have a way to bomb anybody

2708
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,536
Yet they're working on it

2709
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:23,424
It wasn't a real threat the real threat was at the Red Army was just Crush all opposition all the way to the ocean

2710
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:27,264
The US however would unleash Strategic Air Command

2711
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,288
Who had a

2712
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:34,688
Bevy of different plans that they hadn't paper and variance of every plant a plant like Shakedown and off tackle mold

2713
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:36,736
These kinds of things but what these plans have in common

2714
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:39,040
Was a massive Atomic Blitz

2715
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:45,440
Using about two-thirds of the atomic weapons in the stockpile right away the same day actually

2716
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:47,232
In most cases

2717
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,304
And then keeping about a third in reserve

2718
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:53,376
To go RI bomb places that needed re bombing

2719
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:59,008
During the. We're talking about here it's something like 200 bombs

2720
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:00,800
Maybe 300 bombs

2721
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:06,944
Maybe on 20 30 40 Soviet cities a bunch of these cities to be bombed multiple times

2722
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,296
It's millions and millions of people though

2723
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:12,832
Anyway you look at

2724
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:16,928
And you wonder

2725
02:45:18,464 --> 02:45:23,840
What the history books would look like today with the photos and accounts of the survivors

2726
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:27,424
Let's just say 35

2727
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,960
Russian cities

2728
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,776
After they had been bombed

2729
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:33,312
On the same day

2730
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,128
In the world's first atomic war

2731
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:39,200
Like Hiroshima

2732
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:42,016
Or Nagasaki on steroids I guess

2733
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,368
I've often felt that

2734
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:51,488
Especially my own people Americans but but maybe a lot of other people too

2735
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:53,280
Don't look

2736
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:54,560
Carefully enough

2737
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,376
At what these weapons do

2738
02:45:58,656 --> 02:46:00,448
Because there are overtones

2739
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:07,103
That people tend to push away because we're human in the United States when you'll talk to people about the atomic bombings of joy

2740
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:07,871
Japan

2741
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:14,527
There's a defensiveness that often comes up because they assume you're trying to keep some sort of guilt on them and they will get defensive in

2742
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:18,623
Point out the things the Japanese did or or many of the other elements involved

2743
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:23,999
And with a conversation about Atomic and nuclear bomb is usually break down towards and it keeps us

2744
02:46:24,767 --> 02:46:27,327
I'm examining the most important part of the story though

2745
02:46:27,839 --> 02:46:30,143
Last part that can't be changed

2746
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:32,447
But the Future Part

2747
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:35,007
That needs to be understood

2748
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:39,103
When we are talking about doing things that might lead

2749
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:43,455
To the kind of outcomes we've only seen a couple of times before and those outcomes are

2750
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:44,735
So important

2751
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:50,367
I'm struck by the fact that even people who were living through them at the time and trying to survive

2752
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:52,159
Realized

2753
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:55,999
They were essentially guinea pigs up a new age

2754
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:58,815
And tried to write things down

2755
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:05,727
So we could benefit from it today but in order to benefit we have to look at it history makes you look at things

2756
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:12,383
It's a part of me that thinks there be something beneficial to walk in a lot of people around

2757
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,687
The death camps

2758
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:18,015
After the second world war where people were exterminated

2759
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:19,295
Just to remind them

2760
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:28,511
History forces you to look at these things realize that this isn't just some weird occurrence one time this is what happens

2761
02:47:28,767 --> 02:47:29,535
Periodically

2762
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:33,375
These mistakes beware of them and know what can happen

2763
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:38,751
There's a diary kept by an amazing doctor

2764
02:47:39,263 --> 02:47:40,031
Hiroshima

2765
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:42,847
Italian doctor michihiko hachiya

2766
02:47:44,127 --> 02:47:48,479
And in his diary first of all he's a survivor of the Hiroshima bomb

2767
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:55,135
But then he goes on to the nearest hospital to begin treating people one of the things that's so terrible about these weapons is because they

2768
02:47:55,391 --> 02:47:57,183
I created almost natural disaster

2769
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:03,071
The First Responders and the people that have to help all the damaged people are themselves victims

2770
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:05,887
And if facilities are part of what damaged

2771
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,935
So you can pound

2772
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,983
A difficult situation

2773
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:13,567
By killing all the doctors and nurses and destroying the hospitals at the same time

2774
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:19,967
Put in a move that just shows how sometimes like in this case it's scientist but there are other

2775
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:21,759
Peoples are professions also

2776
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:28,671
In this case this Japanese scientist realizes as soon as he's not having people literally dying it is

2777
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:30,975
Beatniks like 4 days later or something

2778
02:48:32,255 --> 02:48:36,607
Tell the other doctors that we have to start writing stuff down

2779
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:41,983
The dad is going to be really important to people in the future because there haven't been many people

2780
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:44,543
To live through this yet another words

2781
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:49,919
This guy was already thinking beyond the war to posterity and knowing that

2782
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:50,943
Actual

2783
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:54,527
Data on live subjects in real-world conditions

2784
02:48:55,039 --> 02:48:57,599
Will be rare and important for the future

2785
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:01,439
He puts that has diarrhea found that amazing

2786
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:03,999
And heartwarming but it doesn't help us

2787
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:05,279
If we don't use it

2788
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:09,375
So you have to look at this stuff straight in the face and then say

2789
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:15,775
When you're talking about nuclear war you're talking about this and you're not talking about it happening to some foreign people you don't know

2790
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:19,871
You simply have to put the phases of your own friends and family

2791
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:22,687
On the victims and imagine that instead

2792
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:28,575
Hiroshima Survivor

2793
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:30,367
Aasimar koshy

2794
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,671
Was in the bathroom

2795
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:38,303
When the Hiroshima bomb went off in the bathroom collapsed around her and she finally got out with the help of someone else

2796
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:41,119
I found her sister dreadfully injured

2797
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:43,167
Mostly from the Heat

2798
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:45,727
Of these bombs that's one thing they had to be

2799
02:49:45,983 --> 02:49:52,127
Regular conventional bombs didn't they were somewhat The Flash some people describe it like a bluish white like a flash bulb Flash and Woodburn

2800
02:49:53,151 --> 02:49:56,223
Like the worst sunburn all the way to the Bone you've ever seen

2801
02:49:56,735 --> 02:49:58,527
But funnily enough it was so quick

2802
02:49:58,783 --> 02:50:03,391
But if you have clothing on especially light clothing you can be perfectly protected under the clothing

2803
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:05,951
And your skin falling off everywhere else

2804
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:12,095
When this woman describes getting out of this bathroom after collapsed around her

2805
02:50:12,863 --> 02:50:17,471
What happened next and remember this could be your wife or your mother or your sister or your daughter

2806
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,239
Quote

2807
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:20,543
Looking around for my sister

2808
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:23,103
I saw her lying sprawled in the corridor

2809
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:26,431
The right side of her body covered with terrible Burns

2810
02:50:26,687 --> 02:50:32,831
She'd probably been washing her hands with her right hand stretched over the washbasin when caught by the Searing Heat

2811
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:34,879
I put my sister on my back

2812
02:50:35,135 --> 02:50:36,415
And fled barefoot

2813
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:41,535
Tajima Park her face was festering from her Burns at her right I was hanging out

2814
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:48,191
I push the eye back into its socket and try to use a gauze mask to hold it into place but her ear

2815
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:51,519
Airhead melted away and there was nothing to attach the Mask 2

2816
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:54,335
Her mouth was twisted to the right

2817
02:50:54,591 --> 02:51:00,223
And she could do no more than whimper for water only the first syllable of the word emerging distinctly

2818
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:06,623
I'm reaching his Gianna Park I laid my sister down on the ground and set off to search for my children

2819
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,927
The fires were still burning fiercely

2820
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:15,327
In A Streetcar that have been burned bright red surrounded by people already killed by the fire I saw a woman

2821
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:18,143
Still holding onto a strap and calling for help

2822
02:51:18,655 --> 02:51:21,471
The intense heat prevented me from approaching her however

2823
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:23,007
It was nothing I could do

2824
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:26,335
To a man sitting on some Stone steps I said

2825
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:28,383
Come on let's get away from here

2826
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:30,175
And pulled him up by the hand

2827
02:51:30,431 --> 02:51:34,783
But as I did so the skin came away from his hand and he fell slowly to the ground

2828
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:39,647
I can see his shadow imprinted clearly on the wall behind him where he had been sitting

2829
02:51:40,671 --> 02:51:43,487
Many people called out to me for help or water

2830
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:46,559
Unburned because of having been in the laboratory

2831
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:52,703
I can only bring my hands together and apologize to the people I passed as I search for some sign if my children

2832
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:53,983
As it turned out

2833
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:56,799
None of those who left that morning never came home again

2834
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:59,615
Not my five children my grandfather

2835
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:02,175
My sister Michiko or my cousin

2836
02:52:02,431 --> 02:52:04,991
Not a bone remain for me to find and treasure

2837
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:09,343
Our house burned down so that I had not even a photograph to remember them by

2838
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:15,743
My sister has Taco Drew her last breath for days later on the evening of August 10th and Agony from her massive in

2839
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:20,863
Injuries I will never forget the expression on her face when I tried to give her a drop of water

2840
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:22,143
I was alone

2841
02:52:23,167 --> 02:52:23,679
And quote

2842
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:27,263
It's not meant to be a tearjerker

2843
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:32,127
It's meant to be an example that you * the number of people

2844
02:52:32,383 --> 02:52:35,711
Who are involved in these catastrophes if they happen

2845
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:41,087
When you think about what people are afraid of

2846
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:47,743
Understand that this is a science fiction dystopian type of nightmare story

2847
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:52,863
Until it comes true and in this error the possibility of it coming true

2848
02:52:53,119 --> 02:52:56,447
A x appears to be about the same chance

2849
02:52:56,703 --> 02:52:57,727
You going to get a

2850
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:00,287
Heads or tails when you flip a coin

2851
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:05,407
And you another

2852
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:11,551
Interesting study into the end of The Human Condition can be made if you asked about the kind of people who advocate

2853
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:15,647
This as a viable and useful strategy

2854
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:20,255
Cuz you might say to yourself we know who would do this who would plan for this

2855
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:26,655
Who could sit down and actually say no this is what we're going to do if the imminent third world war happens and it will so this is what

2856
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,447
Will do who does that

2857
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:32,031
If it was some kind of

2858
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:33,823
Mass murderer right

2859
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:36,639
What's the kill people

2860
02:53:37,919 --> 02:53:40,735
That's not how the people that do these things see it

2861
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:42,783
They have

2862
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:49,439
What two people on the farther side the rainbows and unicorns Oppenheimer poet side thinking is an aura

2863
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:50,975
Current way of viewing things

2864
02:53:51,743 --> 02:53:57,119
But there are a lot of people here that are making calculations about relative disasters

2865
02:53:58,143 --> 02:54:00,959
You'll see this later on to when you'll get these people

2866
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:03,263
At these think tanks that will say

2867
02:54:03,519 --> 02:54:09,663
And if they're trying to reduce the number of dead in a nuclear war from 40 million to 20 million another peep

2868
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:13,247
People think that simply even trying to do that is morally reprehensible

2869
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:16,063
We should be talking about having no Millions died

2870
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:16,831
Right

2871
02:54:18,623 --> 02:54:22,463
But if you read the accounts of people like Curtis LeMay the very very famous

2872
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:25,279
Leader of Strategic Air Command the one who will be

2873
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:31,935
Turned into a stock character in the 1960s movies and whatnot dr. Strangelove Fail-Safe they all have a

2874
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:35,263
Curtis LeMay type the cigar-chomping Air Force guy

2875
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:42,943
Amazed attitude was one that you saw amongst a lot of generals and especially these first and second world war people

2876
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:47,807
Who saw the major nasty part of Modern War

2877
02:54:48,063 --> 02:54:49,087
As being its length

2878
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:56,511
And it because the casualties mounted everyday like a meat grinder or anything you could do to shut that down and

2879
02:54:56,767 --> 02:55:01,119
Limit the length of time the war went on was humanitarian by its very nature

2880
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:03,679
Even if what it took to do that

2881
02:55:04,191 --> 02:55:08,287
Was a shocking amount of violence in a very short time to shock everybody into piece

2882
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:13,407
Lemay did not like what was going on in the Korean War

2883
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:18,271
He wanted to unleash his heavy bombers as he had over Japan in the Second World War

2884
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:20,063
He testified afterwards

2885
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:25,695
But it would have been I'm putting words into his mouth the other more humanitarian approach

2886
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:30,815
This is the philosophy of strategic bombers and believe it or not

2887
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:33,375
It's based on humanitarian

2888
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:35,167
Essex

2889
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:40,799
And just to show you how ingrained it is it is not ironic when they name

2890
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:45,151
Nuclear weapons Delivery Systems as they've done more than once

2891
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:47,199
With names like Peacemaker

2892
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:54,111
And Peacekeeper the the new bomber that will carry out these nuclear destruction places like the stove

2893
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:57,951
Soviet Union happened in 1950 and 1951 is a brand-new B-36

2894
02:55:58,207 --> 02:55:59,999
Which is nicknamed

2895
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:01,279
The Peacemaker

2896
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:03,071
Lemay said about

2897
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:07,679
The all-out bombing campaign that they didn't do at the beginning of the Korean War quote

2898
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:12,799
So we go on and don't do it and let the war go on

2899
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:19,455
Over a. Of three and a half or four years we did burn down every town in North Korea and every town

2900
02:56:19,711 --> 02:56:20,991
South Korea and what

2901
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:24,063
Killed off 20% of the Korean population

2902
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:25,599
What I'm trying to say is

2903
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:29,439
If once you make a decision to use military force to solve your problem

2904
02:56:29,695 --> 02:56:30,719
Then you want to use it

2905
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:33,023
And using overwhelming military force

2906
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:39,423
He was too much and deliberately used too much so that you don't make an error on the other side and not quite have enough

2907
02:56:39,935 --> 02:56:42,239
And you roll over everything to start with

2908
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:44,287
Can you close it down just like that

2909
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:49,151
Can you save resources you save lives not only your own but the enemies to

2910
02:56:49,407 --> 02:56:54,527
End of recovery is quicker and everybody's back to Peaceful existence hopefully in a shorter. Of time

2911
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,319
And quote

2912
02:56:58,111 --> 02:57:01,439
So when you wonder about the kind of people that could carry out these kinds of

2913
02:57:01,695 --> 02:57:05,023
War aims which may sound apocalyptic to you

2914
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:08,351
These are people flying planes called peacemakers

2915
02:57:08,863 --> 02:57:10,143
Who firmly believe

2916
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:11,935
But their way of War

2917
02:57:12,191 --> 02:57:15,263
Will end up being more beneficial to everybody

2918
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:16,287
In the end

2919
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:23,455
It's a similar point of view to Douglas MacArthur it's the traditional

2920
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:27,039
Modern 20th century military point of view

2921
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:29,855
Total War saves lives

2922
02:57:30,111 --> 02:57:32,415
Limited War prolongs the nastiness

2923
02:57:33,695 --> 02:57:35,999
Once again American presidents

2924
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:41,119
Heads of the Soviet Union and China the heads of the western NATO countries

2925
02:57:42,143 --> 02:57:44,447
They have a lot of things to worry about

2926
02:57:45,215 --> 02:57:48,031
Besides this idea of total victory

2927
02:57:49,823 --> 02:57:52,127
Take for example the idea that perhaps

2928
02:57:52,895 --> 02:57:55,967
A total or even partial defeat

2929
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:59,807
In an atomic war might have been something in the back of their heads

2930
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:03,391
None the less the way

2931
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:05,695
The Korean war ends up as something that

2932
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:12,351
Either side of that total war vs limited war debate could probably use at ammunition in their discussion

2933
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:20,287
The friends Harry Truman might say listen by middle of 1951 both sides are at the Armistice table talk

2934
02:58:20,543 --> 02:58:21,823
Walking and working out a deal

2935
02:58:22,847 --> 02:58:28,991
To which the friends of Curtis LeMay and Douglas MacArthur my counter by saying yeah but the talks will go on for two years and so

2936
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:31,551
Soldiers will die on both side the entire time

2937
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:38,975
To which the Harry Truman supporters could then reply yet but we didn't get World War 3

2938
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:39,743
You say that

2939
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:44,351
Yes the situation in Korea was a nightmare

2940
02:58:44,863 --> 02:58:48,191
Lots of casualties lots of dead lots of civilians

2941
02:58:48,447 --> 02:58:51,007
Bad all the way around but it wasn't nuclear war

2942
02:58:53,311 --> 02:58:54,335
Presidents are often

2943
02:58:54,591 --> 02:58:55,615
Fortune do

2944
02:58:55,871 --> 02:58:59,199
Making lesser of two evil choices in this case

2945
02:59:00,223 --> 02:59:05,343
Got to be pretty darn bad of an outcome for nuclear war to not be the greater evil

2946
02:59:07,135 --> 02:59:08,927
The 1952

2947
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:12,255
The greater evil is getting worse

2948
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:16,351
I think you have to say that

2949
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:21,727
Harry Truman deserves a lot of credit for getting us out of his entire

2950
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:23,775
Terms in office without

2951
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:28,895
Ascending up bombing anyone with nuclear weapons after the second world war ended because I think

2952
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:31,455
It was a flip of a coin whether or not we did that

2953
02:59:33,503 --> 02:59:37,599
Remember all he would have had to have done is listened to some of his military advisers and he would have

2954
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,671
As Truman's

2955
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:44,767
Turman office wind down you can see that it's easy to say

2956
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:51,167
And if the world is playing a three-dimensional geopolitical game of nuclear chess

2957
02:59:51,935 --> 02:59:58,079
They're playing by the rules laid down by Truman and let's be honest the people that he was playing

2958
02:59:58,335 --> 03:00:01,151
Will your chest with also Joseph Stalin in the Soviet it was a

2959
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:03,711
Takes two to tango situation

2960
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:06,783
In between the two major sides

2961
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:11,647
Things are hammered out in there. You know him put some Europeans and third world Nations I mean

2962
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:16,511
This is a global effort to Cobble together a way to deal with what is becoming

2963
03:00:16,767 --> 03:00:20,863
An ever-increasing threat and a threat that is moving so quickly

2964
03:00:21,887 --> 03:00:24,703
But the sheer speed of technological change

2965
03:00:25,215 --> 03:00:28,031
Is one of the most destabilizing parts of the entire equation

2966
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:30,591
At what point do you get used to this

2967
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:36,735
I mean we've been pondering the question about whether humans can adapt to their weapons technology

2968
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:41,343
Let's remember that once upon a time people didn't have to adapt this quickly

2969
03:00:42,879 --> 03:00:49,023
Throughout most of human history the pace of change was much less quick than it is today if you could take 1950s Atomic technology

2970
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:53,119
Give it to the ancient Egyptians and say this isn't going to change very much for the neck

2971
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:55,935
15 Generations take some time figure it out

2972
03:00:56,959 --> 03:01:00,031
Does the extra time they get help them do it or I mean it's just

2973
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:01,823
Thinking of ancient Egyptians with

2974
03:01:02,335 --> 03:01:04,895
In a nuclear technology too weird to even contemplate

2975
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:07,455
The point is is that

2976
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:11,807
You know I try to remember who these people are true miniature grandfather

2977
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:14,111
Surrounded by other grandfather

2978
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:17,183
You ever had to help your grandfather with text off

2979
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:20,767
This is a guy

2980
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:27,167
Who is sitting there listening to different nuclear physicist describe the pros and cons of different ideas and pushing different points of view

2981
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:29,215
He has to decide which one he agrees with

2982
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:31,263
Why do I have an image

2983
03:01:32,031 --> 03:01:37,919
I've been having to call is Kayden College to come home and help him figure out where to turn the nuclear bomb off I can't find that button

2984
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:42,783
Truman kind of looks like that weiner president

2985
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:46,879
Non-specialist technical error

2986
03:01:47,647 --> 03:01:50,207
To the one where you have to referee

2987
03:01:50,463 --> 03:01:54,303
Competing arguments between physicists like Oppenheimer & Teller

2988
03:01:57,375 --> 03:02:02,239
Requires a different kind of mind different kind of an approach and maybe a different kind of background

2989
03:02:04,287 --> 03:02:10,431
As I said I feel kind of lucky we got out of that era intact but when you look at the last year of Truman's presidency

2990
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:11,455
1952

2991
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:12,991
You can see

2992
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:18,367
The tsunami of dangers mounting in the distance and you just

2993
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:24,767
It's hard to have confidence that the haberdasher from Independence Missouri who's already exceeded

2994
03:02:25,023 --> 03:02:27,583
Vacations you know his flexibility

2995
03:02:27,839 --> 03:02:29,887
Hard to see him flexible enough to deal

2996
03:02:30,143 --> 03:02:33,215
With some of the things 1952 brings on MP4 example

2997
03:02:33,983 --> 03:02:36,287
Here's a guy who's advisors and administration

2998
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:38,335
Help craft as we said the rules

2999
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:39,615
How you play this

3000
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:41,663
Global chess match

3001
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:44,479
Two-player game

3002
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:49,855
And in October 1952 the United Kingdom explodes their first atomic bomb

3003
03:02:50,623 --> 03:02:52,159
Now they're in the nuclear Club

3004
03:02:52,671 --> 03:02:54,975
Now it's a more than two person games

3005
03:02:55,999 --> 03:02:57,279
Battle changer Dynamics

3006
03:02:58,815 --> 03:03:00,095
Especially when

3007
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:06,751
The part that really bothers everybody about the UK test becomes clear which is that they won't be the last power to join the new

3008
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:07,775
Nuclear Club

3009
03:03:08,287 --> 03:03:12,895
In a few years are you going to have 10 15 20 Powers with atomic bombs

3010
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:20,831
So in order now for humans to adapt to this new weapon they now have to adapt to more people having it so the Dynamics get much more

3011
03:03:21,087 --> 03:03:21,599
Complex

3012
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:24,927
Now you act out the change in the power of the weaponry

3013
03:03:26,975 --> 03:03:27,999
Less than a month after the

3014
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:29,279
United Kingdom

3015
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:31,327
Demonstrates there in atomic power

3016
03:03:31,583 --> 03:03:33,119
United States demonstrates

3017
03:03:33,375 --> 03:03:35,423
They have the technology and it works

3018
03:03:35,935 --> 03:03:36,959
To build a super bomb

3019
03:03:38,751 --> 03:03:40,031
They actually exploded

3020
03:03:40,287 --> 03:03:43,359
Only a couple of days before the US presidential election

3021
03:03:45,151 --> 03:03:46,943
In the power of the bomb

3022
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:48,479
Stunning

3023
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:50,015
Truly

3024
03:03:50,527 --> 03:03:51,295
Paradigm shift

3025
03:03:54,623 --> 03:03:56,415
The test occurs on an island in the Pacific

3026
03:03:58,207 --> 03:03:59,487
When it explodes

3027
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:03,071
There's a fireball more than 3 miles wide

3028
03:04:05,119 --> 03:04:07,423
Lightning crackling inside it

3029
03:04:09,983 --> 03:04:12,031
The craters more than 6000

3030
03:04:12,543 --> 03:04:16,127
Feet in diameter the holes more than 150 ft deep

3031
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:22,527
It's somewhere between 4 and 5

3032
03:04:22,783 --> 03:04:24,575
A hundred times more powerful

3033
03:04:25,855 --> 03:04:30,207
Then either of the bombs that were dropped in the second world war four to five hundred times more power

3034
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:36,607
The most kind of interesting about this. Compared to our own is

3035
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:39,935
How much of this weapons development of psychological

3036
03:04:41,727 --> 03:04:46,335
Again to have a psychological Edge in your opponent's be able to use things like deterrence

3037
03:04:46,591 --> 03:04:47,615
Effectively

3038
03:04:47,871 --> 03:04:50,431
Everyone had to know you had these weapons and so

3039
03:04:50,687 --> 03:04:55,807
Today you would imagine government wouldn't even tell anybody about any of this stuff with the United States announce these things

3040
03:04:56,831 --> 03:04:58,623
We have this weapon now we have that weapon

3041
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:02,207
Because that was important to its ability to be used

3042
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:04,511
The problem with something

3043
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:09,887
Like the thermonuclear weapons the hydrogen bomb is that they're so powerful now

3044
03:05:10,143 --> 03:05:11,935
That they're in effect working

3045
03:05:12,191 --> 03:05:16,031
Against the idea that you can use them for deterrent right the bigger they get

3046
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:17,311
The less willing

3047
03:05:17,567 --> 03:05:20,127
Your enemy your adversary is to think you'll use it

3048
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:22,687
Joseph Stalin is quoted as saying he thinks

3049
03:05:22,943 --> 03:05:24,223
An impromptu he said that the

3050
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:28,831
Public opinion in the peace movement around the world will ring in their government skin

3051
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:32,671
No one's going to use a Megaton

3052
03:05:32,927 --> 03:05:34,719
You know powerful weapon

3053
03:05:34,975 --> 03:05:37,535
I want us because World opinion won't stand for it

3054
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:38,815
And there's some truth to that

3055
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:45,983
But if you're the military and you want to use these weapons or your the intellectuals in the political Associates of the

3056
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:49,055
President can you want your deterrence to stilbite and work

3057
03:05:49,311 --> 03:05:54,687
How do you deal with that Dynamic right that the weapons are so powerful No One Believes you use them

3058
03:05:55,711 --> 03:05:56,991
Make smaller versions of them

3059
03:05:59,295 --> 03:05:59,807
It's

3060
03:06:00,063 --> 03:06:04,159
A decent argument to ask whether the most destabilizing effect

3061
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:06,975
I'm inventions from 1952

3062
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:11,839
You can make an argument for all three is it nuclear proliferation starting

3063
03:06:12,351 --> 03:06:15,167
Is the invention of the super the hydrogen bomb

3064
03:06:15,935 --> 03:06:17,215
Or is it the

3065
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:24,127
Beginning of the Revolution that we call Dad a tactical nuclear weapons are Battlefield nuclear weapon

3066
03:06:26,175 --> 03:06:32,319
And the funny thing about it is it some of the people who worked on limit Oppenheimer got roped into this. He was doing a good thing I'm going

3067
03:06:32,575 --> 03:06:37,951
Create smaller weapons because if I create smaller nuclear weapons the military won't be tempted to use the bigger ones

3068
03:06:38,463 --> 03:06:38,975
Turn down

3069
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:40,767
He was wrong about that

3070
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:42,815
In a famous quote that when he

3071
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:48,703
Years later tried to explain his thinking and he said to understand where I was then you would have had to have seen

3072
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:54,079
The Air Force's War plan for 1951 census was those goddamn just thing I ever saw

3073
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:56,895
It scared him so much 500

3074
03:06:57,151 --> 03:06:59,199
Atomic bombs dropped on Russia

3075
03:06:59,455 --> 03:07:03,551
Eddie thought I'll give them something they can use instead of those it turned out as as most thinkers

3076
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:06,623
Assume today the tactical nuclear weapons

3077
03:07:06,879 --> 03:07:13,023
Open up the door dangerously to an escalation very quickly to the very big bombs that Oppenheimer hope would never be used

3078
03:07:13,279 --> 03:07:14,815
Did you have the smaller bombs instead

3079
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:18,655
Honest mistake though we're in new territory here

3080
03:07:18,911 --> 03:07:23,263
Technologically speaking aren't we another reason maybe you don't want Truman running the show

3081
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:27,103
He's about as well as maybe you could help for

3082
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:33,759
The guy who wins the presidency in 1952 is a very interesting choice for the Sarah and I think more more historians or realize

3083
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:35,295
I think now when I was a kid

3084
03:07:35,551 --> 03:07:36,831
The kind of a different View

3085
03:07:37,343 --> 03:07:38,879
AB General and now

3086
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:42,463
In November 1952 President elect Dwight David Eisenhower

3087
03:07:43,999 --> 03:07:49,887
It's interesting I saw a couple of historians I was reading were speculating it's not far off from them decent speculation Maybe

3088
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:56,287
That partly with the United States was going for here in terms of the electric was they had just had a president and a general sort of

3089
03:07:56,799 --> 03:08:02,943
Disagreeing about how you fight this war in Korea and all these questions about nuclear weapons in this whole new world and everything what if you just

3090
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:09,343
Just got a person with military experience put them in the top job and then when the general is arguing with the president the president

3091
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:13,439
There are some people who speculate that Dwight Eisenhower with kind of

3092
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:15,743
Feeling like he stepped down

3093
03:08:16,255 --> 03:08:22,399
In terms of responsibility when he took the American presidency for a job cuz he was coming down for like commander of

3094
03:08:22,655 --> 03:08:23,167
NATO

3095
03:08:24,447 --> 03:08:26,495
It was the general of the West is one

3096
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:29,567
Writer I was reading called in the general of the West

3097
03:08:29,823 --> 03:08:32,383
Now he's just merely the president of the United States

3098
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:40,831
Eisenhower's an interesting guy his administration by the way will follow a lot of the same Cycles with the Truman one didn't even ask

3099
03:08:41,087 --> 03:08:42,367
Castration after him wheel 2

3100
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:46,207
In part because they'll find that they have a lot of the same pressures

3101
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:51,071
And disincentives and incentives working on them that the previous administration also did

3102
03:08:52,351 --> 03:08:56,703
And you often try to adopt the obvious solution in those cases which

3103
03:08:57,215 --> 03:08:59,263
Each one gets excessively so

3104
03:08:59,775 --> 03:09:01,823
As we said the Trump Administration seems to have

3105
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:05,151
Established a pattern that will be followed by

3106
03:09:05,663 --> 03:09:06,687
Subsequent Administration

3107
03:09:08,735 --> 03:09:10,271
In Eisenhower's case though

3108
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:16,671
A bunch of things happen basically right at the beginning of the Eisenhower Administration that completely upset the geopolitical chessboard

3109
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:18,207
14 ways to give him

3110
03:09:18,719 --> 03:09:22,303
Well both opportunities and dangers The Truman never had to face

3111
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:23,583
Start with the fact

3112
03:09:23,839 --> 03:09:28,703
It pretty much right after Eisenhower actually takes office January 20th 1953

3113
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:31,007
Joseph Stalin dies

3114
03:09:31,775 --> 03:09:32,543
March 5th

3115
03:09:32,799 --> 03:09:35,359
1953 and he doesn't die

3116
03:09:35,871 --> 03:09:42,015
Like a long slow lingering death where Russia has lots of time to prepare the Soviets and lots of time to prepare for

3117
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:43,295
What you going to do afterwards

3118
03:09:43,551 --> 03:09:49,695
He has like a stroke or something so it's it's here today gone tomorrow or here today on my way to going very soon

3119
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:55,327
What the hell happened in the Soviet Union if there's no Joseph Stalin

3120
03:09:56,607 --> 03:10:00,703
This guy's been running the show personally so long in that country

3121
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:02,495
That there's a

3122
03:10:03,007 --> 03:10:06,591
Logical question that happened and it happens right when Stalin

3123
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:12,991
Debilitated in a mobile and paralyzed from the stroke in urine-soaked pajamas lay on his floor unable to

3124
03:10:13,247 --> 03:10:15,807
Communicate his underlings are outside his room

3125
03:10:16,063 --> 03:10:18,111
Outside the door talking on here we do

3126
03:10:20,415 --> 03:10:21,439
There is no

3127
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:25,023
Logical successor to Joseph Stalin there was no

3128
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:30,143
Organized system that dictated well here's your Vice Premier who takes over

3129
03:10:31,423 --> 03:10:34,495
Once Upon a Time all that stuff it been around Stalin

3130
03:10:34,751 --> 03:10:40,895
I'd come up in a system with lots of brilliant intellectuals and people from the original Revolution people like Lenin

3131
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:44,991
Great people Stalin killed a lot of those people on his way to power

3132
03:10:46,527 --> 03:10:48,063
And for more than 20 years

3133
03:10:48,575 --> 03:10:51,391
He can easily say the same thing at Louis XIV

3134
03:10:51,647 --> 03:10:53,439
The French King famously said about

3135
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:57,791
You know his relationship to the country Louis XIV said I am the state

3136
03:10:58,303 --> 03:10:59,071
The state is ME

3137
03:10:59,839 --> 03:11:00,351
End

3138
03:11:00,607 --> 03:11:03,679
Joseph Stalin could have been the poster boy

3139
03:11:03,935 --> 03:11:07,519
It came up when you Google the phrase Cult of Personality

3140
03:11:08,543 --> 03:11:11,359
Merrifield one of his successors will call it just that

3141
03:11:12,127 --> 03:11:13,407
And yet the problem is

3142
03:11:13,663 --> 03:11:19,807
Is that this guy's personality was completely infused on his country a country by the way as we've pointed out before

3143
03:11:20,831 --> 03:11:23,135
Badly traumatized by a surprise attack

3144
03:11:23,903 --> 03:11:25,183
In the Second World War

3145
03:11:26,719 --> 03:11:27,743
You add to that

3146
03:11:28,255 --> 03:11:33,887
The Stalin view of Communism which is also paranoid which again maybe

3147
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:37,471
Just finely-tuned self-defense antenna at work here instead

3148
03:11:37,727 --> 03:11:38,495
But that the

3149
03:11:38,751 --> 03:11:44,895
Non communist Powers were going to try to take you over add to that that you'd already been surprise attack added that that you're paranoid dictator

3150
03:11:45,151 --> 03:11:45,919
Your type anyway

3151
03:11:46,175 --> 03:11:50,271
And isn't it interesting that that is all infused

3152
03:11:51,295 --> 03:11:56,159
On the player that the historical roll of the dice just manages to give

3153
03:11:56,415 --> 03:11:57,439
The Free World

3154
03:11:57,951 --> 03:12:02,047
When you have your first ever nuclear chess match will you play Joseph Stalin

3155
03:12:03,583 --> 03:12:09,215
Going to be a little Machiavellian right you're not going to be all Peace Love poets and Robert Oppenheimer

3156
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:11,519
When you're playing that guy and by the way

3157
03:12:12,031 --> 03:12:18,175
I got quite a few books on the Soviet side of the story and the problem with the Soviet side of the story is he once again it's all

3158
03:12:18,431 --> 03:12:22,783
Call Stalin and you can't figure the guy out so you're taking public statements in this nut

3159
03:12:23,039 --> 03:12:23,551
What the

3160
03:12:23,807 --> 03:12:29,439
Question that was put to several people like Andrei sakharov and others that have been involved in the Soviet nuclear program

3161
03:12:29,951 --> 03:12:31,231
Is what if the US

3162
03:12:31,487 --> 03:12:33,023
Egg on the hole

3163
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:34,047
You know

3164
03:12:34,303 --> 03:12:38,143
Full force Robert Oppenheimer band this stuff route

3165
03:12:38,399 --> 03:12:39,167
What would the

3166
03:12:39,423 --> 03:12:41,471
Soviets and Joseph Stalin done

3167
03:12:41,727 --> 03:12:47,871
And to a man they all say all it would have been seen as weakness installing would have pushed forward with his weapons program

3168
03:12:48,127 --> 03:12:52,735
I mean I believed it behind the scenes at all happening anyway

3169
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:53,759
In other words

3170
03:12:54,271 --> 03:12:55,295
If the US

3171
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:59,647
And Britain and NATO and all of them had gone

3172
03:12:59,903 --> 03:13:03,487
Into a Robert Oppenheimer dream mode

3173
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:08,607
That would not necessarily have had any sort of real reciprocation

3174
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:11,935
From the other side because the other side was Joseph Stalin

3175
03:13:14,495 --> 03:13:15,519
And as of

3176
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:16,287
March

3177
03:13:16,543 --> 03:13:18,591
6th 1953

3178
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:22,175
For the first time in the nuclear age it's not

3179
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:27,039
Truman never had the opportunity to deal with anyone else

3180
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:32,159
When Stalin dies new things happen the world changes a little bit and

3181
03:13:32,415 --> 03:13:34,463
Eisenhower has a chance for example

3182
03:13:34,719 --> 03:13:39,071
To come out with a proposal that's known as the Atoms for Peace proposal

3183
03:13:40,351 --> 03:13:42,655
Now I have to make up a disclaimer here

3184
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:44,959
Nothing can be trusted from this era

3185
03:13:45,215 --> 03:13:45,727
Nothing

3186
03:13:47,519 --> 03:13:48,543
Alluded to this earlier

3187
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:49,567
For example

3188
03:13:50,079 --> 03:13:54,175
These presidents from Truman dies and they will all have two faces to them

3189
03:13:54,943 --> 03:13:56,223
I don't know which one is real

3190
03:13:58,271 --> 03:13:59,807
They will have one face

3191
03:14:00,063 --> 03:14:06,207
Where they will say you can never use these weapons mean Eisenhower famously said you couldn't have a nuclear war the running of the bulls

3192
03:14:06,463 --> 03:14:08,255
Closers to scoop Up the Bodies

3193
03:14:08,767 --> 03:14:09,791
In from the streets

3194
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:16,959
You'll have other statements where they will say they do not ever question or willingness to use these weapons

3195
03:14:18,751 --> 03:14:24,895
So you have to say it for deterrence to work but did they secretly believe that you couldn't use these weapons or is it the Opera

3196
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:32,319
Did you know some of these depends on how cynical you are as a writer but some of these writers and historians will say none of the plan

3197
03:14:32,575 --> 03:14:38,719
Entire time was to Nuke everything but you just can't say that in public so you get up there and have an Atoms for Peace

3198
03:14:38,975 --> 03:14:42,815
This program will you talk about working together to ban these terrible weapons

3199
03:14:43,583 --> 03:14:49,727
I will say that I can't imagine our leaders today having something like Eisenhower speech to the United Nations where he

3200
03:14:50,239 --> 03:14:51,775
In 1953

3201
03:14:52,031 --> 03:14:54,847
Made the whole situation out

3202
03:14:55,615 --> 03:14:58,943
Now whether this is some sort of cynical geopolitical

3203
03:14:59,455 --> 03:15:05,599
You know the public relations toy or whether he's serious and it's hard to know Eisenhower with a deep and interesting and complex character

3204
03:15:07,135 --> 03:15:11,231
But everything that we've been talking about in this program is stuff we know now

3205
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:13,535
The people in the time.

3206
03:15:13,791 --> 03:15:19,935
Are just as Whiplash by technology is Harry Truman was an in 1953 Eisenhower

3207
03:15:20,191 --> 03:15:23,263
But this is right after the hydrogen bomb concept is proven

3208
03:15:23,775 --> 03:15:28,895
Lays out the steaks to a bunch of people who maybe didn't realize exactly how threatened they were

3209
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:34,527
I feel impelled to speak today in a language that

3210
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:36,063
Innocent

3211
03:15:36,319 --> 03:15:37,087
Is new

3212
03:15:38,623 --> 03:15:39,903
One which I

3213
03:15:40,415 --> 03:15:43,487
Let's spend so much of my life in the military profession

3214
03:15:44,255 --> 03:15:45,279
What are preferred

3215
03:15:45,535 --> 03:15:46,047
Never

3216
03:15:46,559 --> 03:15:47,071
To you

3217
03:15:48,607 --> 03:15:49,887
That's new language

3218
03:15:50,655 --> 03:15:51,423
Is the language

3219
03:15:51,679 --> 03:15:52,959
Of Atomic Warfare

3220
03:15:55,263 --> 03:15:58,335
The atomic age has moved forward at such a pace

3221
03:15:59,103 --> 03:16:01,151
That every citizen of the world

3222
03:16:01,919 --> 03:16:03,711
Should have some comprehension

3223
03:16:04,735 --> 03:16:07,039
At least in comparative terms

3224
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:08,831
Of the expense

3225
03:16:09,087 --> 03:16:10,111
Of this development

3226
03:16:11,391 --> 03:16:13,183
Of the utmost significance

3227
03:16:13,951 --> 03:16:14,975
To everyone

3228
03:16:16,511 --> 03:16:17,023
Clearly

3229
03:16:17,791 --> 03:16:22,399
If the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace

3230
03:16:23,423 --> 03:16:24,959
They must be armed

3231
03:16:25,215 --> 03:16:26,751
With a significant facts

3232
03:16:27,519 --> 03:16:28,287
Oxidase

3233
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:29,311
Except

3234
03:16:31,615 --> 03:16:34,687
My recital of atomic danger and Power

3235
03:16:35,199 --> 03:16:36,991
Is necessarily stated

3236
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:38,783
In United States perm

3237
03:16:39,807 --> 03:16:43,135
For these are the only incontrovertible fact

3238
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:44,159
That I know

3239
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:46,975
I need hardly point out

3240
03:16:47,231 --> 03:16:49,023
Do this assembly however

3241
03:16:49,791 --> 03:16:51,327
That's the subject is Google

3242
03:16:52,351 --> 03:16:54,143
Not merely National

3243
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:58,239
On July 16th

3244
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:00,543
1945

3245
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:03,871
United States asset off the world

3246
03:17:04,127 --> 03:17:05,919
First atomic explosion

3247
03:17:07,711 --> 03:17:08,479
Since that day

3248
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:10,271
In 1945

3249
03:17:11,039 --> 03:17:14,623
United States of America has conducted 42

3250
03:17:14,879 --> 03:17:15,647
Test exposure

3251
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:19,231
Atomic bombs today

3252
03:17:20,255 --> 03:17:23,583
Are more than 25 times as power

3253
03:17:24,607 --> 03:17:25,119
How's the weather

3254
03:17:25,375 --> 03:17:28,191
With which the atomic age dawn

3255
03:17:29,215 --> 03:17:30,751
While hydrogen weapons

3256
03:17:31,263 --> 03:17:32,543
Aryan the Rangers

3257
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:34,335
Of millions of tons

3258
03:17:34,847 --> 03:17:36,895
TNT equivalent

3259
03:17:38,687 --> 03:17:39,455
Today

3260
03:17:39,967 --> 03:17:42,783
United States stockpile of atomic weapons

3261
03:17:44,063 --> 03:17:45,855
Which of course increases daily

3262
03:17:47,135 --> 03:17:49,183
Exceeds by many time

3263
03:17:49,695 --> 03:17:50,975
The total equivalent

3264
03:17:51,487 --> 03:17:53,535
Of the total of all bombs

3265
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:55,071
Ammo sales

3266
03:17:55,583 --> 03:17:57,887
That came from every plane

3267
03:17:58,143 --> 03:18:03,519
And every gun in every theater war in all of the years of World War II

3268
03:18:05,311 --> 03:18:06,847
A single Air Group

3269
03:18:07,615 --> 03:18:08,895
Weather afloat

3270
03:18:09,407 --> 03:18:10,175
Orlando Pace

3271
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:13,759
Can now deliver to any reachable Target

3272
03:18:14,527 --> 03:18:16,063
A destructive cargo

3273
03:18:16,831 --> 03:18:18,367
Exceeding in power

3274
03:18:18,623 --> 03:18:19,647
Alabama

3275
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:21,183
That fell on Britain

3276
03:18:21,439 --> 03:18:23,487
In all of World War II

3277
03:18:26,815 --> 03:18:29,887
That's from the famous Atoms for Peace speech

3278
03:18:31,167 --> 03:18:33,727
When Eisenhower like Truman before him

3279
03:18:34,239 --> 03:18:39,871
Will evoke the Specter of the world's great cities lying in Ruins

3280
03:18:40,127 --> 03:18:43,967
The cultural achievements of the past of thousands of years of

3281
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:48,063
I've worked to build up to destroyed mankind having to

3282
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:52,415
Arise From the Ashes of irradiated in destroyed civilization

3283
03:18:52,927 --> 03:18:55,231
Just in case you were unaware of the steaks

3284
03:18:57,535 --> 03:19:00,351
There are so many different ways you can view people

3285
03:19:00,607 --> 03:19:03,423
Right we all understand that in modern history

3286
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:04,703
Postmodern history

3287
03:19:05,215 --> 03:19:06,751
Makes it the most apparent because

3288
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:09,823
You can find statements from all these people

3289
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:12,383
Contradicting themselves

3290
03:19:12,639 --> 03:19:14,943
Private statements versus public statements

3291
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:18,271
Diaries that they write in that they assume will someday be published

3292
03:19:18,527 --> 03:19:21,343
Where's the secret diaries that they never want anyone else to see

3293
03:19:22,111 --> 03:19:25,695
What is PR vs. what is behind the scenes

3294
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:30,815
I mean when Harry Truman talks about the Terrible Things he's nuclear weapons can do

3295
03:19:31,583 --> 03:19:32,607
He's the same guy that

3296
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:34,143
Gave the go-ahead to make them

3297
03:19:34,655 --> 03:19:36,959
When Eisenhower give the speech is about

3298
03:19:37,471 --> 03:19:43,615
These existential dangers mankind faces he is at the same time solving a budgetary

3299
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:44,383
Problem

3300
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:47,711
By deciding to rely on

3301
03:19:48,223 --> 03:19:52,575
A strategy with nuclear weapons that will be known as massive retaliation

3302
03:19:54,879 --> 03:19:59,231
Which Eisenhower do you buy or is it some sort of blend of the two

3303
03:20:02,047 --> 03:20:07,679
And listen as we said good luck getting to the core of any of these public figures they're so multi-layered that

3304
03:20:07,935 --> 03:20:11,775
To know you actually had what they really believed that be tough to do

3305
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:14,079
In anytime.

3306
03:20:15,103 --> 03:20:21,247
Add to that the fact that we all know when history compresses these human beings into one-dimensional figures you lose so much of the new

3307
03:20:21,503 --> 03:20:22,527
You want to meet imagine

3308
03:20:23,039 --> 03:20:25,599
If you made it into the history books 100 years from now

3309
03:20:26,111 --> 03:20:29,183
How much your life would be compressed into a few bullet points

3310
03:20:29,695 --> 03:20:33,023
Did that sort of really give the true picture of you

3311
03:20:34,559 --> 03:20:36,351
Bonita J Robert Oppenheimer

3312
03:20:37,119 --> 03:20:39,167
Dean acheson's too much of a poet

3313
03:20:39,679 --> 03:20:41,727
Wasn't always too much of a poet

3314
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:45,567
He was often opposed to nuclear weapons but not always

3315
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:50,175
Sometimes his opposition was moral but sometimes it was technical

3316
03:20:50,687 --> 03:20:51,711
And sometimes he

3317
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:54,527
So good applications for nuclear power and weapon

3318
03:20:56,063 --> 03:20:56,831
So he's been

3319
03:20:57,343 --> 03:20:58,623
Turned into an archetype

3320
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:00,671
My history as well even buy me

3321
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:02,719
So

3322
03:21:02,975 --> 03:21:06,559
But they're all that in mind and even with all that said

3323
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:11,679
Eisenhower is unusually confusing and misleading

3324
03:21:11,935 --> 03:21:12,703
On purpose

3325
03:21:15,007 --> 03:21:16,543
In his book Ike's Bluff

3326
03:21:17,567 --> 03:21:19,871
Author Evan Thomas weaves in

3327
03:21:20,639 --> 03:21:22,943
Eisenhower's near addiction

3328
03:21:23,711 --> 03:21:25,503
Two strategy card games

3329
03:21:26,271 --> 03:21:27,039
And

3330
03:21:27,295 --> 03:21:33,439
In a drawers that into Eisenhower's conduct of world affairs and how he handled the various car

3331
03:21:33,695 --> 03:21:38,047
Cards in his hand if you will a Dell with the uncertainties involved in other people's hands

3332
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:41,631
He was I guess

3333
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:46,495
A huge poker player but an even bigger bridge player and Bridge I guess it's played by

3334
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:49,055
My all sorts of generals and politicians and strategists

3335
03:21:50,335 --> 03:21:52,383
They feel that it better represents the

3336
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:54,431
Great geopolitical game

3337
03:21:54,943 --> 03:21:58,015
Then Chester because in chess you can see all the pieces openly

3338
03:21:58,271 --> 03:22:01,855
Whereas in a card game your hand is known only to you

3339
03:22:02,111 --> 03:22:07,231
Adversaries have their hands secret you don't know what's in the deck you have to do a lot of bluffing

3340
03:22:07,743 --> 03:22:09,279
And this is where Eisenhower's

3341
03:22:09,791 --> 03:22:10,815
You know deliberate

3342
03:22:11,327 --> 03:22:13,631
Opaqueness and confusion

3343
03:22:13,887 --> 03:22:16,447
And misleading nature and ability to

3344
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:22,335
Bluff his way into various situations seem to correspond to being a master

3345
03:22:22,591 --> 03:22:25,663
Bridge player I mean if you're going to have somebody sit in the chair

3346
03:22:25,919 --> 03:22:29,247
To represent your side in this historical

3347
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:35,391
Psychological game of strategy and uncertainty for the very highest of stakes

3348
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:37,183
Don't you want a gamer

3349
03:22:38,975 --> 03:22:42,559
And it sounds like you're talkin strategy games

3350
03:22:42,815 --> 03:22:44,607
Eisenhower was one

3351
03:22:45,119 --> 03:22:46,143
And he was good

3352
03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:52,543
He's got a new opponent as we said and you got to be breathing a sigh of relief cuz

3353
03:22:52,799 --> 03:22:56,383
Facing Joseph Stalin in the Octagon at that game

3354
03:22:57,151 --> 03:23:03,295
When he really didn't even have nuclear weapons imagine him during the 1950s when he really did get the ability to just start striking to you

3355
03:23:03,551 --> 03:23:04,063
Atwell

3356
03:23:04,575 --> 03:23:06,367
Perish the thought he's gone though

3357
03:23:06,623 --> 03:23:09,183
Replacing him in the chair is one of his subordinates

3358
03:23:10,207 --> 03:23:11,999
And it's a fascinating guy

3359
03:23:12,511 --> 03:23:18,655
To be playing against during this era cuz now you have the general of the West finally the West gets in there with one of these heavy

3360
03:23:18,911 --> 03:23:23,775
Wake candidates okay bring on your best shot and their best shot is a guy named Nikita Khrushchev

3361
03:23:24,799 --> 03:23:25,567
Who I love

3362
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:31,967
Nikita Khrushchev is one of the great success stories you're ever going to find

3363
03:23:33,503 --> 03:23:34,271
It's like a

3364
03:23:34,527 --> 03:23:37,855
Forget the Abe Lincoln Log Cabin Story I mean it's it's

3365
03:23:38,111 --> 03:23:39,903
Nikita Khrushchev was born a peasant

3366
03:23:41,183 --> 03:23:47,327
The only reason that he finally is running one of the two great superpowers in this era

3367
03:23:47,839 --> 03:23:53,727
Is because of the Soviet Communist Revolution the Bolshevik Revolution the top of the czar

3368
03:23:53,983 --> 03:23:59,103
Before the first world war is over and totally up bands that Society

3369
03:24:00,639 --> 03:24:03,711
And puts people in power and authority

3370
03:24:04,479 --> 03:24:05,247
Who were

3371
03:24:05,503 --> 03:24:09,599
You're mocking at the manure out of the barn when they were teenagers

3372
03:24:11,903 --> 03:24:18,047
Nikita Khrushchev is a peasant peasant he uses all the terminology he'll be at the big meetings without he's always use

3373
03:24:18,303 --> 03:24:23,423
Using these peasant sayings that are supposed to be deeply philosophical no one else in the room has any idea what they mean

3374
03:24:24,447 --> 03:24:25,727
To this guy was so

3375
03:24:25,983 --> 03:24:28,799
The United States had the haberdasher from Missouri

3376
03:24:29,055 --> 03:24:31,871
Running the nuclear are still for a while and trying to adjust

3377
03:24:32,127 --> 03:24:38,271
The Soviet Union's about to gain the kind of power where maybe they could begin to actually as opposed to Theory

3378
03:24:38,527 --> 03:24:39,039
Ethically

3379
03:24:39,295 --> 03:24:41,599
Threaten the United States with atomic weaponry

3380
03:24:41,855 --> 03:24:46,463
And that gets given to a guy who was born a peasant and he's just

3381
03:24:47,487 --> 03:24:47,999
Fascinator

3382
03:24:49,023 --> 03:24:55,167
This is a man who got a huge challenge ahead of him and we certainly in the west never understood this was all going

3383
03:24:55,423 --> 03:24:58,495
It's still not well understood including by me

3384
03:24:58,751 --> 03:25:00,031
Maybe least of all by me

3385
03:25:01,055 --> 03:25:02,847
The crew Chef was

3386
03:25:03,103 --> 03:25:07,967
Part of a group that comes to power in the Soviet Union in Canton perhaps you could say

3387
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:09,759
Guiding that state

3388
03:25:10,527 --> 03:25:12,831
To a soft Landing from stalinism

3389
03:25:14,111 --> 03:25:16,159
This was not some consensus though

3390
03:25:16,415 --> 03:25:21,023
And it were powerful entities in that state vying for leadership also

3391
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:24,095
It appeared much more closely to the old Stalin line

3392
03:25:26,143 --> 03:25:28,959
Professor David Holloway in his excellent book Stalin

3393
03:25:29,215 --> 03:25:30,239
And the bomb

3394
03:25:30,751 --> 03:25:32,031
Talks about how

3395
03:25:32,287 --> 03:25:37,151
It was really the pressure is caused by the reality of nuclear war

3396
03:25:37,663 --> 03:25:42,015
That forced some of these leaders to take it at a different look at

3397
03:25:42,271 --> 03:25:47,647
Even their Orthodox Communists in the sense. Bolshevik and very stalinist

3398
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:51,231
View of the entire world reality

3399
03:25:51,999 --> 03:25:53,279
Because Professor Holloway says that

3400
03:25:53,791 --> 03:25:55,327
It was Stalin's conviction

3401
03:25:55,583 --> 03:25:57,375
I was connected to his views on

3402
03:25:57,631 --> 03:26:03,775
Marxism and the inevitability of a war between the imperialist in the Communist States that within 10 to 20 years war

3403
03:26:04,031 --> 03:26:04,799
World War 3 was coming

3404
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:11,455
And of course is everyone was Awakening to World War 3 was going to be nuclear weapons in devastation

3405
03:26:11,711 --> 03:26:15,807
1955 War plan that the USA commission to check out

3406
03:26:16,063 --> 03:26:17,343
How many people died

3407
03:26:17,599 --> 03:26:23,743
If the US carried out their proposed strikes against the Soviet Union when World War 3 broke out in the number came back to be 60

3408
03:26:25,535 --> 03:26:31,679
And a decent number of those people coming from the countries like Poland and Hungary and all those places that were sort of under the thumb of the

3409
03:26:31,935 --> 03:26:35,007
Have the Soviets how do you even justify that right

3410
03:26:35,519 --> 03:26:38,847
Sorry you were captive person right now but we're going to Nuke you in order to

3411
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:42,687
For you up there eventually you burn down your village in order to save it

3412
03:26:45,247 --> 03:26:47,807
But all the way talks about kruschev in his

3413
03:26:48,319 --> 03:26:49,343
Group getting

3414
03:26:49,599 --> 03:26:51,391
Power and beginning to talk about

3415
03:26:51,647 --> 03:26:53,439
Things that are famous in the history books like

3416
03:26:53,695 --> 03:26:55,487
Peaceful coexistence

3417
03:26:57,023 --> 03:27:00,095
This violated Stalin view Holloway says

3418
03:27:00,351 --> 03:27:06,495
The inevitable war that was coming because if the inevitable War this coming is Armageddon will that'll mess up your long-term planning

3419
03:27:06,751 --> 03:27:07,263
I want it

3420
03:27:08,287 --> 03:27:09,567
Holloway writes this

3421
03:27:10,079 --> 03:27:12,895
About true chef and his people trying to

3422
03:27:13,151 --> 03:27:14,431
Walk back

3423
03:27:14,687 --> 03:27:16,223
Communist ideology

3424
03:27:16,735 --> 03:27:21,855
In order to prevent it from inevitably running into global thermonuclear war

3425
03:27:23,391 --> 03:27:24,159
Direct quote

3426
03:27:25,951 --> 03:27:30,559
My asserting the capitalism and socialism can coexist for a long time

3427
03:27:30,815 --> 03:27:33,119
The new leaders of the Soviet Union

3428
03:27:33,375 --> 03:27:39,519
We're rejecting Stalin's vision of Another World War within 15 to 20 years of the end of World War II

3429
03:27:40,287 --> 03:27:43,359
Peaceful coexistence in quotation marks

3430
03:27:44,127 --> 03:27:47,199
What is defined as the alternative to nuclear war

3431
03:27:47,711 --> 03:27:52,063
Has the policy that had to be followed if nuclear war was to be avoided

3432
03:27:52,831 --> 03:27:53,343
And quote

3433
03:27:54,623 --> 03:28:00,511
On the way then tell the story the cruise ship it told about meeting the much more hardliner Mao the leader of China

3434
03:28:00,767 --> 03:28:03,071
And now is still talking in terms of the

3435
03:28:03,327 --> 03:28:06,143
Assumed to come all out war against the capitalists

3436
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:08,959
And cruise ship already seems to be now

3437
03:28:09,983 --> 03:28:13,823
Have moved on from that this is part of what starts to create a schism

3438
03:28:14,079 --> 03:28:15,615
Amongst the Communist States

3439
03:28:16,127 --> 03:28:18,175
Almost the way you would see religious

3440
03:28:18,431 --> 03:28:19,455
Break off's

3441
03:28:19,711 --> 03:28:22,015
Two or three or four hundred years before this era

3442
03:28:22,271 --> 03:28:24,575
And all of a sudden the change in religious Doctrine

3443
03:28:24,831 --> 03:28:25,343
Dogma

3444
03:28:25,599 --> 03:28:29,183
Messed up enough people so that we're going to go this way and you're going to go that way

3445
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:33,791
The United States in the west saw the Communist up to this. Is a monolithic block

3446
03:28:34,303 --> 03:28:37,119
Who took their orders from Moscow and all of a sudden

3447
03:28:37,631 --> 03:28:42,495
Some of these communist countries are beginning to have disagreements with each other some of them are geopolitical

3448
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:44,543
But some of them are ideological

3449
03:28:45,567 --> 03:28:49,151
But according to Professor Holloway people like cruise ships see this is

3450
03:28:49,407 --> 03:28:52,991
Something that is simply bowing to reality in a nuclear world

3451
03:28:53,503 --> 03:28:54,015
He's a quote

3452
03:28:54,783 --> 03:28:59,391
Peaceful coexistence did not mean ideological coexistence however

3453
03:28:59,647 --> 03:29:03,999
Nor did Intel renunciation of the struggle with imperialism

3454
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:08,607
But that struggle had to be conducted in such a way as to avoid nuclear war

3455
03:29:09,375 --> 03:29:09,887
And quote

3456
03:29:11,423 --> 03:29:14,239
In other words the new leaders of the Soviet Union are also

3457
03:29:14,751 --> 03:29:15,775
Trying to figure out

3458
03:29:16,287 --> 03:29:17,823
How you operate

3459
03:29:18,335 --> 03:29:20,639
Under the old rules in the world

3460
03:29:21,151 --> 03:29:26,271
Where you have neuclear weapons and where they are increasingly getting more and more powerful

3461
03:29:28,319 --> 03:29:31,647
The Soviet Union exploded its first Hydrogen weapon

3462
03:29:32,159 --> 03:29:36,511
Why you get a disagreement about this August 12th 1953 is a good date for this

3463
03:29:36,767 --> 03:29:41,887
Some of the real nitpickers will take

3464
03:29:42,655 --> 03:29:45,471
Nonetheless over the next year or two the

3465
03:29:45,727 --> 03:29:51,103
Soviets will refine the weapon to appoint when no one will argue anymore that they too or a thermonuclear power

3466
03:29:52,895 --> 03:29:57,247
The equation in terms of the global Dynamics will be altered though

3467
03:29:58,015 --> 03:30:02,879
Buy the big us test that goes off on March 1st 1954

3468
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:07,231
This is a test by the way that was not supposed to be this large

3469
03:30:08,511 --> 03:30:12,863
Instead turns out to be the largest explosion ever set off by the United States

3470
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:14,143
To this day

3471
03:30:15,423 --> 03:30:17,727
More than 15 megatons

3472
03:30:18,751 --> 03:30:19,519
Aldi

3473
03:30:19,775 --> 03:30:20,799
Bravo test

3474
03:30:23,103 --> 03:30:27,967
Just I'm the Fireball was like 4 miles wide and everything just gets bigger and larger butt

3475
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:29,759
What made Bravo so

3476
03:30:30,271 --> 03:30:33,343
Completely over-the-top in terms of waking up

3477
03:30:33,855 --> 03:30:39,743
The public to a level where the alarm buttons really were raised on a wide range of

3478
03:30:40,255 --> 03:30:42,559
I've demographics you know where I was before

3479
03:30:42,815 --> 03:30:47,679
If you were a European living on a likely nuclear Battlefield you are always aware what might happen to you

3480
03:30:47,935 --> 03:30:49,215
If you were a person

3481
03:30:49,471 --> 03:30:51,007
Living in India

3482
03:30:51,263 --> 03:30:56,127
With not a care in the world of these Cold War events at this particular time.

3483
03:30:56,383 --> 03:31:00,991
You would notice what a lot of the rest of the world noticed about the Castle Bravo test

3484
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:03,807
Was a radiological disaster

3485
03:31:06,111 --> 03:31:08,927
And because it was so much larger than experts

3486
03:31:09,183 --> 03:31:15,327
And I predicted that it's opened up the door to being wrong about some of the stuff there were physicists who had worst case scenario

3487
03:31:15,583 --> 03:31:16,607
Dies in their nightmares

3488
03:31:17,119 --> 03:31:23,007
You from before that. The thought of you did this wrong the whole atmosphere could catch on fire and all these kinds of things that sound crazy but

3489
03:31:23,263 --> 03:31:25,823
I'm not a physicist so I don't even know if that's possible

3490
03:31:27,615 --> 03:31:33,759
But this test showed that just because you cordon off what you think is a safe area and you try to make his own where you can see what these weapons can do

3491
03:31:34,015 --> 03:31:34,783
Who doesn't make them

3492
03:31:35,295 --> 03:31:35,807
Safe

3493
03:31:37,599 --> 03:31:39,903
They cordoned off his own and people outside the zone

3494
03:31:40,159 --> 03:31:43,487
Got radiologically sick more than a hundred miles away famously

3495
03:31:43,743 --> 03:31:49,119
A Japanese fishing boat outside the exclusionary Zone with bombarded with radiation

3496
03:31:50,655 --> 03:31:53,215
Immense amounts of fall out whenever the air you know when these

3497
03:31:53,727 --> 03:31:55,007
Just happen in these Pacific

3498
03:31:56,031 --> 03:31:57,823
Coral reefs and whatnot are

3499
03:31:58,079 --> 03:32:02,431
Atomized for lack of a better word and turned into like micro dust particles

3500
03:32:03,199 --> 03:32:07,551
And blown up into the mushroom cloud up into the atmosphere all of them irradiated

3501
03:32:09,087 --> 03:32:11,135
And when they fall back down to earth

3502
03:32:11,647 --> 03:32:17,023
They can make you quote sick and die soon if you're close by but even if you're far away

3503
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:21,631
Gets into your water gets into your milk gets into your food chain starts affecting people

3504
03:32:22,399 --> 03:32:24,191
And after the Castle Bravo test

3505
03:32:24,447 --> 03:32:26,751
The rest of the world began to watch

3506
03:32:27,263 --> 03:32:32,639
The giant geopolitical card game or three-dimensional chess game between the great powers

3507
03:32:33,151 --> 03:32:35,199
It's sort of a spectator audience and

3508
03:32:35,455 --> 03:32:38,783
In this particular game the audience made a difference

3509
03:32:39,295 --> 03:32:42,111
And both sides tried to appeal to the audience

3510
03:32:43,647 --> 03:32:46,207
The audience in this case metaphorically speaking

3511
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:48,511
Is global public opinion

3512
03:32:49,535 --> 03:32:53,375
Something that really comes of age in this. In part because

3513
03:32:53,887 --> 03:32:58,751
The whole understanding that nuclear weapons use even just testing

3514
03:32:59,263 --> 03:33:01,567
On the part of a single Global power

3515
03:33:02,079 --> 03:33:03,103
Could affect everyone

3516
03:33:03,871 --> 03:33:06,943
All the sudden everyone had skin in the game and by the way

3517
03:33:07,199 --> 03:33:09,247
The era of colonialism

3518
03:33:09,503 --> 03:33:12,063
Was over for the most part and major

3519
03:33:12,319 --> 03:33:17,439
Countries like Britain and France and others were shedding their colonies their former colonies in their former possessions

3520
03:33:18,463 --> 03:33:22,303
And these places were forming their own governments and had sovereignty of Their Own

3521
03:33:22,559 --> 03:33:23,839
Jennifer change in

3522
03:33:24,095 --> 03:33:29,471
They kind of sometimes look at the Cold War the way the man from Mars that we talked about earlier would

3523
03:33:29,983 --> 03:33:36,127
As Outsiders who were only worried about the idea that listen I don't care what your beef is with each other just don't pollute the

3524
03:33:36,383 --> 03:33:37,151
World we all need

3525
03:33:39,199 --> 03:33:41,247
And this new power block

3526
03:33:41,759 --> 03:33:42,271
Matter

3527
03:33:42,783 --> 03:33:43,807
Increasingly so

3528
03:33:44,063 --> 03:33:48,159
As communication and mass media allow people to be involved in the conversation

3529
03:33:49,951 --> 03:33:51,743
And all of a sudden you had

3530
03:33:52,255 --> 03:33:57,375
Groups of people that could be used in this discussion over how we go forward

3531
03:33:57,631 --> 03:34:01,215
In terms of how we learn to cope with our weapons technology

3532
03:34:01,471 --> 03:34:06,079
The group of scientist the Einstein of the Bertrand Russell's in the Oppenheimer types

3533
03:34:07,103 --> 03:34:10,943
Could all of a sudden appeal directly to World opinion and try to harness it

3534
03:34:11,455 --> 03:34:14,015
To push more for their Viewpoint of how you

3535
03:34:14,271 --> 03:34:18,367
Adapt to these Weapons Systems adapt to these Weapons Systems in their opinion

3536
03:34:18,879 --> 03:34:22,975
By getting rid of War not getting rid of the weapons of war cuz it's their opinion

3537
03:34:23,231 --> 03:34:29,119
At the weapons are there and we just pledged not to use eventually someone's going to grab one make one whatever you need to do

3538
03:34:29,375 --> 03:34:31,935
Especially if they're losing the third world war so that they don't

3539
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:34,751
The scientist are saying

3540
03:34:35,007 --> 03:34:36,031
You know it's going to be tough

3541
03:34:36,287 --> 03:34:39,871
Going to have to stop this whole policy of war that you've been using your whole civilized

3542
03:34:40,127 --> 03:34:40,639
History

3543
03:34:42,687 --> 03:34:44,479
The issue something in 1955

3544
03:34:44,735 --> 03:34:48,063
Again and directly at Global public opinion

3545
03:34:48,319 --> 03:34:50,879
They do it in a press conference how modern is that

3546
03:34:51,391 --> 03:34:53,951
Where Bertrand Russell or old friend too

3547
03:34:54,207 --> 03:34:55,743
For the Soviets got the bomb

3548
03:34:55,999 --> 03:35:00,351
I need nightmares of London lying in Ruins and thought maybe we should nuke the Soviets first

3549
03:35:00,607 --> 03:35:03,935
He and Albert Einstein in one of his last gigs

3550
03:35:04,447 --> 03:35:07,007
And others would get out there and push something

3551
03:35:07,519 --> 03:35:08,799
Known to history as the

3552
03:35:09,055 --> 03:35:10,847
Russell Einstein Manifesto

3553
03:35:11,103 --> 03:35:14,687
And it starts off with Bertrand Russell telling the media this line

3554
03:35:14,943 --> 03:35:16,479
Is a good way to start off a piece

3555
03:35:16,991 --> 03:35:23,135
If you want to say basically just so you know we're directing this towards Global public opinion and we're on it

3556
03:35:23,391 --> 03:35:23,903
Side

3557
03:35:24,415 --> 03:35:27,487
The manifesto began with Russell saying quote

3558
03:35:28,255 --> 03:35:30,303
I am bringing the warning pronounced

3559
03:35:30,559 --> 03:35:33,631
By the signatories meaning of their Manifesto

3560
03:35:33,887 --> 03:35:36,959
To the notice of all powerful governments of the world

3561
03:35:37,215 --> 03:35:42,335
Any Earnest hope that they may agree to allow their citizens to survive

3562
03:35:43,359 --> 03:35:43,871
And quote

3563
03:35:45,407 --> 03:35:50,271
The peace then goes on to talk about the power of nuclear weapons it then goes on to talk about how

3564
03:35:51,295 --> 03:35:52,831
They understand that the idea

3565
03:35:53,087 --> 03:35:55,903
Getting rid of War sounds pie-in-the-sky

3566
03:35:56,415 --> 03:36:00,511
But the power of these weapons has changed everything including the power to pollute

3567
03:36:02,559 --> 03:36:08,191
But they've been come on to say as pie-in-the-sky if you will is the abolition of War sounds

3568
03:36:08,959 --> 03:36:10,495
You must keep your eyes

3569
03:36:10,751 --> 03:36:13,311
On what failure in this round with me

3570
03:36:14,335 --> 03:36:15,359
It's very similar

3571
03:36:15,615 --> 03:36:16,639
To this idea

3572
03:36:17,407 --> 03:36:18,175
Sending people

3573
03:36:18,431 --> 03:36:22,271
To go look at the death camps five minutes after The Liberation happen

3574
03:36:23,807 --> 03:36:25,343
Manifestos quote

3575
03:36:26,367 --> 03:36:31,487
The abolition of War will demand distasteful limitations of national sovereignty

3576
03:36:31,999 --> 03:36:36,095
But what perhaps impedes understanding of the situation more than anything else

3577
03:36:36,351 --> 03:36:40,191
Is that the term Mankind in quotes

3578
03:36:40,447 --> 03:36:42,495
Feels vague and abstract

3579
03:36:43,007 --> 03:36:47,359
People scarcely realizing imagination that the dangerous to themselves

3580
03:36:47,615 --> 03:36:49,663
And their children and their grandchildren

3581
03:36:49,919 --> 03:36:52,991
And I don't lie to a dimly apprehended Humanity

3582
03:36:53,503 --> 03:36:57,855
They can scarcely bring themselves to grasp that they individually

3583
03:36:58,111 --> 03:37:02,975
And Those whom they love are in imminent danger of perishing agonisingly

3584
03:37:03,231 --> 03:37:06,559
And so they hope that perhaps War may be allowed to continue

3585
03:37:06,815 --> 03:37:09,119
Provided modern weapons are prohibited

3586
03:37:09,887 --> 03:37:10,399
And quote

3587
03:37:11,679 --> 03:37:12,447
Beijing guoan

3588
03:37:12,703 --> 03:37:14,239
Explain why that's a pipe dream

3589
03:37:16,799 --> 03:37:18,335
The point is it that all of a sudden

3590
03:37:18,591 --> 03:37:24,735
These scientists can appeal directly to the general public out there and they can position them

3591
03:37:24,991 --> 03:37:31,135
I'm as a block of power opposed to the governments of the world are continuing to act the way governments in the world of active

3592
03:37:31,391 --> 03:37:31,903
Trevor

3593
03:37:33,439 --> 03:37:37,023
The Russell Einstein group of scientists has found

3594
03:37:37,535 --> 03:37:38,815
Hrblock of support

3595
03:37:39,327 --> 03:37:41,375
And it's International in nature

3596
03:37:42,399 --> 03:37:45,471
Now there are other great intellectual thinkers out there

3597
03:37:45,727 --> 03:37:50,079
Who will form the Counterpoint to these people would talk about them already people that started

3598
03:37:50,335 --> 03:37:56,479
No getting together at major universities to places like Yale and whatnot these other intellectuals who don't buy this idea that we can change

3599
03:37:56,735 --> 03:37:59,039
So fundamentally that we could Outlaw War

3600
03:37:59,295 --> 03:38:00,063
They begin

3601
03:38:00,319 --> 03:38:01,343
Trying to think of how

3602
03:38:01,599 --> 03:38:07,743
Once again you live with these weapons in a way that more closely corresponds to how history has shown we're likely to

3603
03:38:07,999 --> 03:38:08,511
To behave

3604
03:38:08,767 --> 03:38:10,303
And if the worst happens

3605
03:38:10,815 --> 03:38:13,375
How do you somehow mitigate the

3606
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:14,655
Worst case scenario

3607
03:38:17,727 --> 03:38:23,871
Earlier we had said that Eisenhower was a good strategic card game player if you were going to be involved in this kind of igloo

3608
03:38:24,127 --> 03:38:25,919
Mobile game if you will

3609
03:38:26,175 --> 03:38:28,479
Didn't you want to have a gamer in that position

3610
03:38:29,247 --> 03:38:32,319
But in a country of hundreds of millions of people why would you stop

3611
03:38:32,831 --> 03:38:34,367
At one good gamer

3612
03:38:34,879 --> 03:38:39,999
If you were playing a chess game for the survival of the world and your side wings you want

3613
03:38:40,255 --> 03:38:43,583
All you're intelligent people getting together somewhere and analyzing it

3614
03:38:44,351 --> 03:38:46,399
Studying the game if you will

3615
03:38:47,167 --> 03:38:50,495
Analyzing every move impossible counter move

3616
03:38:51,007 --> 03:38:54,079
Every variable that might crop up I mean if it's a card game him

3617
03:38:54,591 --> 03:38:57,151
We're holding atomic bomb cards in our hand

3618
03:38:57,407 --> 03:39:00,223
And somebody draws an ace of clubs in a minute you know what we do

3619
03:39:02,527 --> 03:39:07,903
Those people began to coalesce after the second world war these amazingly intelligent intellectuals

3620
03:39:08,415 --> 03:39:13,535
And will eventually find themselves working together in places like the famous Rand Corporation

3621
03:39:14,559 --> 03:39:16,095
But I didn't start that way

3622
03:39:16,351 --> 03:39:19,423
They started by essentially asking the kind of questions

3623
03:39:20,447 --> 03:39:22,751
That are a function of the time

3624
03:39:23,519 --> 03:39:28,895
The sort of higher questions of the store that got Truman in trouble with MacArthur over War aims right

3625
03:39:29,407 --> 03:39:30,431
Mean famously

3626
03:39:30,687 --> 03:39:36,063
One of these people who are the founding fathers of what today we would call civilian defense intellectuals

3627
03:39:36,319 --> 03:39:37,855
Was a guy named Bernard Brody

3628
03:39:38,623 --> 03:39:40,927
And Brody will famously get involved

3629
03:39:41,183 --> 03:39:44,255
Initially with all this just because they are forced ask him to look at them

3630
03:39:44,511 --> 03:39:47,327
World War 2 bombing results and to analyze them

3631
03:39:47,583 --> 03:39:51,167
But this eventually led to Brody asking fundamental questions like

3632
03:39:51,423 --> 03:39:52,191
Okay well

3633
03:39:52,447 --> 03:39:58,591
How big are bombs do we need to do what in order to achieve watching all these deep questions that in general

3634
03:39:59,103 --> 03:40:02,431
The military guys weren't thinking about this wasn't part of their gig

3635
03:40:03,967 --> 03:40:09,087
In Korea MacArthur job was to win the war not to figure out the political situation afterwards and all this but

3636
03:40:09,343 --> 03:40:15,487
All these people are rising the nuclear are these intellectual for pointing out that there is no separation between those things anymore how you feel

3637
03:40:15,743 --> 03:40:16,511
Fight the war

3638
03:40:16,767 --> 03:40:18,559
Will determine so many other things

3639
03:40:19,327 --> 03:40:20,095
For example

3640
03:40:20,863 --> 03:40:27,007
One of the big problems that Brody had with the entire War plan that guys like Curtis LeMay had come up with a nuke to Soviet Union

3641
03:40:27,263 --> 03:40:28,287
All at one time

3642
03:40:28,543 --> 03:40:29,823
Quickly as possible get it over with

3643
03:40:30,847 --> 03:40:32,895
What are you lost every bit of Leverage

3644
03:40:33,407 --> 03:40:37,759
But you might have Brody argue that the game goes on even when nuclear weapons start falling

3645
03:40:38,783 --> 03:40:40,831
And that the way things turn out

3646
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:46,975
You know the difference between maybe a hundred million lives could be how you play the game once the bombs start falling

3647
03:40:47,231 --> 03:40:51,839
Here's the thing all these people at the Rand Corporation in these defense intellectuals

3648
03:40:52,095 --> 03:40:52,607
AR

3649
03:40:52,863 --> 03:40:55,935
Often characterized as a combination of like mr. Spock

3650
03:40:56,447 --> 03:40:58,751
And Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory

3651
03:40:59,519 --> 03:41:03,871
People with great mathematics and economics backgrounds were so great at crunching numbers

3652
03:41:04,127 --> 03:41:08,479
But often seemed detached from The Real World blood guts reality

3653
03:41:08,735 --> 03:41:11,551
You know what they're studying at the worst case scenario happens

3654
03:41:13,087 --> 03:41:15,903
Unless it's hard to argue with some of the things they say for example

3655
03:41:16,671 --> 03:41:18,719
Nebrodi is famously said early on

3656
03:41:19,231 --> 03:41:25,375
That the city's as hostages you know your adversaries cities held hostage is a lot more valuable than having a bunch of car

3657
03:41:25,631 --> 03:41:26,143
Corpses made

3658
03:41:26,911 --> 03:41:28,703
Lemay's playing freely Corpses

3659
03:41:28,959 --> 03:41:30,751
Brody wanted to preserve

3660
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:36,895
Flexibility even after the atomic bomb dropped and he pointed it out this way Fred Kaplan in his 1980's classic

3661
03:41:37,151 --> 03:41:38,687
The Wizards of Armageddon

3662
03:41:39,199 --> 03:41:40,479
Disgusted that he said quote

3663
03:41:42,015 --> 03:41:48,159
Brody reasoned that the final surrender of the Japanese in the Pacific War resulted not from the atom bomb

3664
03:41:48,415 --> 03:41:54,559
Just dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but from the implicit threat of more atom bombs on their way if it

3665
03:41:54,815 --> 03:41:56,351
The Japanese did not give up then

3666
03:41:56,863 --> 03:41:58,143
Likewise he writes

3667
03:41:58,399 --> 03:42:03,007
The Soviets would more likely stop fighting after receiving some destructive blows

3668
03:42:03,263 --> 03:42:04,543
Knowing that if they did not stop

3669
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:06,847
Their cities would be the next targets to get hit

3670
03:42:07,359 --> 03:42:13,503
If however we blew up their cities at the very outset of the War II bargaining lever would be blown up along with them

3671
03:42:14,015 --> 03:42:16,575
Hostages have no value once they are killed

3672
03:42:16,831 --> 03:42:21,695
Consequently the Soviets would feel no inhibitions about blowing up American cities in return

3673
03:42:22,207 --> 03:42:25,023
Hardly an outcome that would serve the interests of American Security

3674
03:42:25,535 --> 03:42:26,303
And quote

3675
03:42:28,095 --> 03:42:32,959
It's a combination of coldly dispassionately logical

3676
03:42:33,471 --> 03:42:35,775
And at the same time and its own way

3677
03:42:36,031 --> 03:42:40,895
Especially when compared to the atomic Blitz plan that the Air Force had in place

3678
03:42:41,663 --> 03:42:42,687
Humanitarian

3679
03:42:43,967 --> 03:42:50,111
These are the people that will coalesce and Brody is one of them Herman Kahn is another John Von Neumann will be involved in Venoy minutes

3680
03:42:50,367 --> 03:42:52,927
Call by some people the most intelligent man who ever lived

3681
03:42:53,951 --> 03:42:57,791
I can very debatable but you know if you're anywhere in that conversation

3682
03:42:58,047 --> 03:43:02,655
You have an incredible mind and in the 1920s Von Neumann famously in a poker game

3683
03:43:03,167 --> 03:43:09,311
Devises the modern version of what you could call the mathematical theory of games because that's what they did call it

3684
03:43:09,823 --> 03:43:11,615
Today we just called Game Theory

3685
03:43:12,895 --> 03:43:14,687
The standard definition of Game Theory

3686
03:43:15,199 --> 03:43:17,247
Is a mathematically precise method

3687
03:43:17,503 --> 03:43:21,343
Determining rational strategies in the face of critical uncertain

3688
03:43:23,647 --> 03:43:25,439
Sounds like it might be pretty useful

3689
03:43:25,951 --> 03:43:26,975
Any game doesn't it

3690
03:43:27,999 --> 03:43:30,047
Or a war for that matter

3691
03:43:30,815 --> 03:43:32,351
Or a war game

3692
03:43:33,887 --> 03:43:36,703
There have been antecedents of course before Von Neumann

3693
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:40,287
Others work on it afterwards and including Von Neumann some more

3694
03:43:40,543 --> 03:43:45,663
But by this time these are the kind of people that want to employ those kinds of theories

3695
03:43:45,919 --> 03:43:46,943
To analyze

3696
03:43:47,199 --> 03:43:48,223
This game

3697
03:43:49,503 --> 03:43:51,807
Patagonia running to the same problem

3698
03:43:52,319 --> 03:43:56,671
Mm electrical to want to see mankind evolved away from war running into

3699
03:43:57,951 --> 03:43:59,999
Speed of the pace of change

3700
03:44:01,535 --> 03:44:04,095
Everything keeps evolving so quickly

3701
03:44:04,607 --> 03:44:07,679
The minute you may think you have this Atomic poker game figured out

3702
03:44:08,191 --> 03:44:11,775
With one deck somebody decides looking elegant play with another deck attitude

3703
03:44:12,031 --> 03:44:12,543
Upsets

3704
03:44:12,799 --> 03:44:14,591
Your Paradigm on a regular basis

3705
03:44:16,639 --> 03:44:22,783
It's arguable that perhaps the biggest destabilizer between 1950 and 1960s the growth of missile technology

3706
03:44:24,319 --> 03:44:27,391
Witching at the end of the second world war the Soviets and the West were both

3707
03:44:27,647 --> 03:44:32,511
Scouring Germany as they occupied it to grab as many Nazi scientists so you could because

3708
03:44:33,023 --> 03:44:36,863
A couple of key areas German scientists were head of the West and the Soviets

3709
03:44:37,119 --> 03:44:38,911
Missile technology for example

3710
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:43,775
They've been using at the end of the war missile called the V2

3711
03:44:44,031 --> 03:44:46,079
Against places like London

3712
03:44:46,847 --> 03:44:48,639
And suspiciously

3713
03:44:48,895 --> 03:44:55,039
For about the next 10 years some of these missiles would look like carbon copies of the V2 the United States would grab one of these scientific any burner

3714
03:44:55,295 --> 03:44:58,879
Von Braun who would of course be influential in the US Space Program later

3715
03:45:00,415 --> 03:45:04,255
The space programs themselves of both the Soviet Union and the United States had

3716
03:45:05,023 --> 03:45:08,607
We'll call it Dual Purpose technological applicability

3717
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:13,471
Because when the Soviets launched the first satellite into space Sputnik in 1957

3718
03:45:14,239 --> 03:45:20,127
Some people worry that the Soviets are now ahead in space technology but a lot of people understand that if you can put a satellite in space

3719
03:45:20,383 --> 03:45:21,663
The tip of a rocket

3720
03:45:22,175 --> 03:45:24,991
You can put a bomb on the tip of a rocket and send it to the United States

3721
03:45:26,783 --> 03:45:29,855
The Realty change for me reading all this material

3722
03:45:30,111 --> 03:45:36,255
Was the modern material makes it clear that even though the time the United States was most frightened of nuclear war hitting them

3723
03:45:36,511 --> 03:45:39,327
When they were building bomb shelters in the backyard in Nebraska

3724
03:45:39,839 --> 03:45:42,911
The Soviet Union probably had very little chance

3725
03:45:43,167 --> 03:45:45,471
I'm launching an attack on the us as we said earlier

3726
03:45:46,751 --> 03:45:52,895
First of all any attack during that period would have involved aircraft in the United States had a wonderful defensive Air Force that could have shot down anything

3727
03:45:54,175 --> 03:45:55,455
But it's missiles to change that

3728
03:45:56,735 --> 03:46:00,319
They also start putting them on submarines which changes everything to

3729
03:46:01,855 --> 03:46:03,903
Difference between 1950

3730
03:46:04,159 --> 03:46:07,487
1960 in terms of trying to control

3731
03:46:07,743 --> 03:46:10,047
And Corral the threat in the growing

3732
03:46:10,815 --> 03:46:12,095
Instability

3733
03:46:12,607 --> 03:46:13,631
Is Mike Davis

3734
03:46:14,143 --> 03:46:14,655
Nuclear

3735
03:46:14,911 --> 03:46:17,215
Expert Joseph cirincione points out

3736
03:46:17,727 --> 03:46:23,871
After discussing the Atoms for Peace idea that Eisenhower throughout their they're also be a summit 1955 between Eisenhower and Khrushchev

3737
03:46:24,127 --> 03:46:24,639
I'm trying to

3738
03:46:24,895 --> 03:46:26,175
To break the tension somewhat

3739
03:46:26,687 --> 03:46:30,527
Bikini from Chevys and came to the United States in the late fifties and visited

3740
03:46:31,295 --> 03:46:34,623
LED around by Vice President Nixon and oppression toe

3741
03:46:34,879 --> 03:46:36,927
Swimming to get to know you know size 2

3742
03:46:37,183 --> 03:46:39,231
Humanize each other a little bit

3743
03:46:40,511 --> 03:46:41,535
For every

3744
03:46:41,791 --> 03:46:44,607
Decrease intentions on one hand there was something

3745
03:46:45,119 --> 03:46:46,399
On the other hand

3746
03:46:46,655 --> 03:46:47,423
To make up for it

3747
03:46:49,215 --> 03:46:55,359
And the complexity and increasing power of the weapons just made the job of anyone who wanted to control these things

3748
03:46:56,383 --> 03:47:00,223
Darn near impossible listen to Joseph cirincione Rundown

3749
03:47:00,735 --> 03:47:01,503
The growth

3750
03:47:01,759 --> 03:47:06,623
In weapons technology in the 10 years between 1950 and 1960 hero quote

3751
03:47:07,647 --> 03:47:11,999
While Atoms for Peace was promoting nuclear technology for peaceful purposes

3752
03:47:12,255 --> 03:47:18,399
The US military was equipping their troops with thousands of nuclear weapons adapting them for use in New

3753
03:47:18,655 --> 03:47:24,799
Nuclear depth charges nuclear Torpedoes nuclear mines nuclear artillery and even a nuclear

3754
03:47:25,055 --> 03:47:25,823
Your bazooka

3755
03:47:26,079 --> 03:47:28,639
This infantry weapon called the Davy Crockett

3756
03:47:28,895 --> 03:47:31,199
Would fire a nuclear warhead about half a mile

3757
03:47:31,967 --> 03:47:37,599
The United States and the Soviet Union develop strategies to fight and win a nuclear war

3758
03:47:37,855 --> 03:47:43,999
Created vast nuclear weapon complexes and began deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles and fly

3759
03:47:44,255 --> 03:47:45,791
Lisa ballistic-missile submarines

3760
03:47:46,303 --> 03:47:52,447
The effect of Abandonment of international control efforts and the race to build a numerical and then they qualitate

3761
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:53,727
Nuclear advantage

3762
03:47:53,983 --> 03:48:00,127
Resulted in the American nuclear Arsenal mushrooming from just under 400 weapons in 1952

3763
03:48:00,383 --> 03:48:02,687
/ 20000 by 1960

3764
03:48:03,199 --> 03:48:05,247
The Soviet Arsenal likewise

3765
03:48:05,503 --> 03:48:08,319
Jump from five Warheads in 1950

3766
03:48:08,575 --> 03:48:11,391
2 roughly 1600 in 1960

3767
03:48:11,647 --> 03:48:13,183
The United States was ahead

3768
03:48:13,439 --> 03:48:14,207
But afraid

3769
03:48:15,231 --> 03:48:15,743
And quote

3770
03:48:17,535 --> 03:48:18,559
When you think about

3771
03:48:19,327 --> 03:48:22,911
The situation that Harry Truman was trying to cope with

3772
03:48:23,935 --> 03:48:26,751
From 45 to 52

3773
03:48:27,519 --> 03:48:30,079
And what seemed complex at the time

3774
03:48:30,335 --> 03:48:32,127
Look at how all of this stuff

3775
03:48:33,663 --> 03:48:38,271
Makes that look like a card game with a single deck and by the time Eisenhower leaves office

3776
03:48:38,527 --> 03:48:40,319
He's playing multi-level chess or

3777
03:48:40,831 --> 03:48:44,159
Atomic poker with 9 decks when I go in at the same time

3778
03:48:44,927 --> 03:48:46,463
But he's grown with it

3779
03:48:47,231 --> 03:48:52,351
Please learn how to play this game he started and stepped in at a time when it was much less complicated

3780
03:48:54,143 --> 03:48:59,775
The Truman Show Them his hand says this is what's in my hand this is what we think is in his hand this is my strategy good luck

3781
03:49:00,543 --> 03:49:03,103
And handed his hand of cards over to

3782
03:49:03,615 --> 03:49:09,759
And one of the great Gamers the guy you would say if you had to hand pick them might have been uniquely qualified for this time

3783
03:49:10,015 --> 03:49:11,039
Time in this place

3784
03:49:13,087 --> 03:49:14,879
But he's also the head of a system

3785
03:49:15,647 --> 03:49:21,791
It doesn't pick their People based on qualification the person that gets to sit in the chair and play the other side

3786
03:49:22,303 --> 03:49:25,887
And with the world as your steaks in the card game of the chess match

3787
03:49:26,143 --> 03:49:27,679
Is chosen by the Electoral

3788
03:49:29,215 --> 03:49:30,239
Are they can choose anybody

3789
03:49:34,335 --> 03:49:37,407
1960 will be Dwight Eisenhower's last year in office

3790
03:49:37,663 --> 03:49:41,759
The Constitution mandates that you get no more than two terms his time is up

3791
03:49:42,783 --> 03:49:47,135
He's done anyway the presidency wipes people out anyways and health problems

3792
03:49:47,391 --> 03:49:49,695
It's time for someone new the problem is is

3793
03:49:50,463 --> 03:49:53,535
Who is qualified to take over the game

3794
03:49:53,791 --> 03:49:54,815
Reminds an hour

3795
03:49:57,119 --> 03:49:59,167
And what if you get someone in there

3796
03:49:59,679 --> 03:50:00,703
Who plays

3797
03:50:00,959 --> 03:50:01,727
Corley

3798
03:50:03,263 --> 03:50:06,079
Voters in the United States have always had a lot of responsibility

3799
03:50:07,103 --> 03:50:09,151
But when they were voting se4

3800
03:50:09,407 --> 03:50:15,551
President Roosevelt for reelection in 1940 they weren't voting for the most dangerous human being of all time

3801
03:50:16,319 --> 03:50:20,671
When they go to the polls in 1960 to vote for someone to replace the retiring Dwight Eisenhower

3802
03:50:20,927 --> 03:50:22,719
What exactly what they're voting for

3803
03:50:24,255 --> 03:50:29,887
For all his power and authority in the 1930s and 1940s Franklin Delano Roosevelt

3804
03:50:30,655 --> 03:50:32,191
Didn't have Atomic weapons

3805
03:50:32,959 --> 03:50:37,311
Dequindre taking us to nuclear war like presidents after 1945

3806
03:50:38,335 --> 03:50:41,407
What's more he operated in a constitutional framework

3807
03:50:41,919 --> 03:50:43,967
Especially for the big Wars

3808
03:50:44,223 --> 03:50:46,527
Require the involvement of other people

3809
03:50:47,039 --> 03:50:49,855
The Congress for example he couldn't do this by himself

3810
03:50:51,135 --> 03:50:56,255
1945 the Advent of atomic weapons changed all that the Truman Administration took that power

3811
03:50:56,511 --> 03:51:00,863
To themselves rightly or wrongly they had some good reasons but you can disagree about them

3812
03:51:02,655 --> 03:51:03,679
But it's solidified

3813
03:51:04,191 --> 03:51:08,287
The power to use these extraordinary weapons in the hands of a single human being

3814
03:51:09,567 --> 03:51:11,103
Don't ever had that kind of power

3815
03:51:11,359 --> 03:51:12,639
And US presidents

3816
03:51:13,151 --> 03:51:17,759
The 1945 on are infinitely more dangerous in the worst case scenario

3817
03:51:18,015 --> 03:51:19,295
And they were before then

3818
03:51:20,831 --> 03:51:22,879
And we Americans tend not to think of

3819
03:51:23,135 --> 03:51:24,671
Our own people as

3820
03:51:24,927 --> 03:51:26,719
Scary and dangerous

3821
03:51:27,999 --> 03:51:30,047
But you can bet that in other countries

3822
03:51:30,303 --> 03:51:32,095
1960 places that

3823
03:51:32,607 --> 03:51:35,679
Might be on the receiving end of a worst-case scenario

3824
03:51:36,703 --> 03:51:40,031
People for example living in the old Soviet Union

3825
03:51:40,287 --> 03:51:43,615
Those people certainly would have recognized the potential Danger

3826
03:51:44,127 --> 03:51:46,943
Are the most dangerous figure in world history

3827
03:51:47,455 --> 03:51:49,247
A person that will be determined

3828
03:51:49,759 --> 03:51:50,527
Bye

3829
03:51:51,039 --> 03:51:52,319
The particular Williams

3830
03:51:52,831 --> 03:51:53,855
The US electorate

3831
03:51:55,391 --> 03:51:58,719
Of course the problem one might ask is if you have issues with that

3832
03:51:59,487 --> 03:52:01,535
Who would you rather have pick that person

3833
03:52:02,815 --> 03:52:06,655
And think about it carefully because the power that person is getting

3834
03:52:07,167 --> 03:52:07,935
More

3835
03:52:08,447 --> 03:52:09,471
Scary

3836
03:52:09,727 --> 03:52:10,239
All the time

3837
03:52:13,311 --> 03:52:18,175
President that succeeds Eisenhower will be the first one to control the US nuclear Arsenal

3838
03:52:18,431 --> 03:52:22,015
In an era where a push-button Holocaust

3839
03:52:22,271 --> 03:52:23,551
Becomes possible

3840
03:52:24,831 --> 03:52:26,111
During Eisenhower's time

3841
03:52:26,367 --> 03:52:31,743
A nuclear war broken out the vast majority of it would have been fought with airplanes dropping bombs

3842
03:52:32,767 --> 03:52:37,631
The next president of the United States is going to have enough intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed

3843
03:52:38,143 --> 03:52:42,495
So that you have the metaphorical cuz he really would just give an order in a code and all that

3844
03:52:42,751 --> 03:52:45,055
Are the metaphorical red button is they call it

3845
03:52:45,823 --> 03:52:51,967
It becomes a reality during this era think of how dangerous that human being is he the person is going to have to make a nuclear decision potential

3846
03:52:52,223 --> 03:52:52,735
Chili

3847
03:52:53,247 --> 03:52:54,527
With only minutes

3848
03:52:54,783 --> 03:52:55,551
To debate

3849
03:52:56,319 --> 03:52:57,343
And decided

3850
03:53:00,159 --> 03:53:02,975
Washington being disqualified for that

3851
03:53:04,767 --> 03:53:08,351
How much are the qualifications if you could mold your perfect

3852
03:53:09,375 --> 03:53:15,519
President and Steward of that kind of power and authority what should a professional or education or purse

3853
03:53:15,775 --> 03:53:17,311
Personal background would you want

3854
03:53:18,335 --> 03:53:20,639
Would you want someone who was a politician

3855
03:53:21,151 --> 03:53:23,455
Controlling the nuclear Arsenal

3856
03:53:24,223 --> 03:53:25,759
With your finger on the button or

3857
03:53:26,015 --> 03:53:29,087
Maybe you think that's something that you could trust a

3858
03:53:29,343 --> 03:53:35,487
Businessperson more someone more tune to the question the prophet Lawson and corporate survivability and maybe there's a

3859
03:53:35,743 --> 03:53:37,791
A lot of things you could argue that that would be beneficial

3860
03:53:38,047 --> 03:53:38,815
Or maybe

3861
03:53:39,327 --> 03:53:41,887
Maybe you want someone who thinks about nothing

3862
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:48,287
But this geopolitical Atomic card game all the time and you want one of those mathematical economist

3863
03:53:48,543 --> 03:53:51,103
I'm someplace like the Rand Corporation put them in

3864
03:53:51,359 --> 03:53:52,127
The White House

3865
03:53:53,407 --> 03:53:57,247
Well maybe you want to go a totally different direction you need someone who's got them or

3866
03:53:57,503 --> 03:53:58,271
Big picture

3867
03:53:58,527 --> 03:54:00,319
Humanity side of this like the

3868
03:54:00,831 --> 03:54:02,111
People at the

3869
03:54:02,623 --> 03:54:04,415
Russell Einstein Manifesto set

3870
03:54:04,927 --> 03:54:06,463
Remember your Humanity

3871
03:54:06,719 --> 03:54:09,791
And forget the rest right you want one of those get maybe you want a philosopher

3872
03:54:10,559 --> 03:54:12,095
Or maybe you want someone

3873
03:54:12,351 --> 03:54:18,495
Who's very religious maybe you wanted Gandhi type president through the first Buddhist president I realize it's a long shot but

3874
03:54:20,031 --> 03:54:22,591
Extraordinary times call for Extraordinary Measures

3875
03:54:23,871 --> 03:54:27,967
Or maybe you want to recreate the Eisenhower years and get yourself a general

3876
03:54:28,991 --> 03:54:29,759
Although

3877
03:54:30,271 --> 03:54:36,415
You get charm after term after term in the White House occupied by a military leader starts to look a little Wiggy in it

3878
03:54:36,927 --> 03:54:38,463
Democratic Republic. Net

3879
03:54:39,743 --> 03:54:40,511
What's more

3880
03:54:40,767 --> 03:54:45,375
What made Eisenhower so particularly I thought suited as I sent for the role

3881
03:54:45,631 --> 03:54:47,679
Wasn't that he was a general

3882
03:54:47,935 --> 03:54:50,495
And because of that he was a Super Hawk

3883
03:54:51,007 --> 03:54:53,823
It's because he carried The credibility of being a general

3884
03:54:54,079 --> 03:54:57,407
I was actually less hawkish than his military advisers a lot of the time

3885
03:54:57,919 --> 03:54:59,967
Sometimes they would want to be

3886
03:55:00,223 --> 03:55:04,063
More whiskey and more muscular and it would be eisenhour that would say no

3887
03:55:04,575 --> 03:55:08,159
I had Eisenhower instead been a civilian like Truman maybe these

3888
03:55:08,415 --> 03:55:14,559
Incredible World War Two Guys who made up a lot of the military advisors in this era they were big powerful karizmatik figures themselves

3889
03:55:14,815 --> 03:55:20,959
During this critical. We were trying to get the formula right the guy who's

3890
03:55:21,215 --> 03:55:21,727
Student

3891
03:55:21,983 --> 03:55:28,127
In the civilian role and predicted the civilian rule was himself a military guy and could push back against the general

3892
03:55:29,407 --> 03:55:30,175
You know you can't

3893
03:55:30,431 --> 03:55:33,503
Accuse Eisenhower of not understanding the military situation

3894
03:55:34,783 --> 03:55:36,575
But now Eisenhower was leaving

3895
03:55:36,831 --> 03:55:38,623
Who was going to have the ability

3896
03:55:39,391 --> 03:55:43,743
And the background to stand up if the generals were to push again in a hawkish Direction

3897
03:55:45,279 --> 03:55:48,863
Consequences for voters getting this wrong in 1960

3898
03:55:49,631 --> 03:55:50,655
Enormous

3899
03:55:52,703 --> 03:55:58,847
It's probably at this point if the man from Mars we've been using a part of our discussion here is watching the 19th

3900
03:55:59,103 --> 03:55:59,871
60 election

3901
03:56:00,639 --> 03:56:03,455
He's not going to be able to figure out we human beings at all

3902
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:05,759
Because of the mind of any

3903
03:56:06,015 --> 03:56:11,647
Mr. Spock type character they're going to look at this and logically figure out that the only thing Americans should care about it getting

3904
03:56:11,903 --> 03:56:13,695
The Sword of Damocles question right

3905
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:19,071
But that's not how human being songs you need any system where they're allowed to have an opinion

3906
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:24,959
It will be one of the concerns the factors into their decision over who they vote for 4

3907
03:56:25,215 --> 03:56:27,263
Most dangerous man in all human history

3908
03:56:28,031 --> 03:56:32,895
But it will not be the exclusive thing I mean they're going to care about domestic issues to MIP attacks question

3909
03:56:33,151 --> 03:56:34,687
Determine who they vote for

3910
03:56:35,455 --> 03:56:39,039
It's probably going to be an issue of what party they are

3911
03:56:39,551 --> 03:56:43,647
Where some Americans are going to vote reliably for the Republican candidate together for Democrats

3912
03:56:44,159 --> 03:56:45,951
Even the Sword of Damocles can't prevent

3913
03:56:46,463 --> 03:56:48,511
In a Party Loyalty from coming into play

3914
03:56:49,791 --> 03:56:51,327
Finally and this is the part of the

3915
03:56:51,583 --> 03:56:54,143
I would imagine would really confuse the man from Mars

3916
03:56:54,399 --> 03:56:57,215
The question of personal Charisma and glamour

3917
03:56:57,471 --> 03:57:01,055
And likeability will come into this and you will think to yourself

3918
03:57:01,823 --> 03:57:04,127
Of course that's just how these things function

3919
03:57:04,383 --> 03:57:07,455
But if you back off and look at it from an outsider's view point

3920
03:57:08,223 --> 03:57:09,759
What is that becomes the reason

3921
03:57:10,271 --> 03:57:12,319
You vote for the person who plays

3922
03:57:13,087 --> 03:57:15,647
A really poor game of atomic poker

3923
03:57:17,695 --> 03:57:18,975
Nuclear Bridge

3924
03:57:20,511 --> 03:57:22,815
Three-dimensional geopolitical

3925
03:57:23,327 --> 03:57:25,119
Nuclear booby trap chess

3926
03:57:26,911 --> 03:57:27,679
And of course

3927
03:57:28,447 --> 03:57:32,031
Estes International groups like The Bertrand Russell

3928
03:57:32,287 --> 03:57:34,591
Albert Einstein group might point out

3929
03:57:35,103 --> 03:57:41,247
It's also a heck of a lot of power for American voters to make a decision that impacts the people around the world

3930
03:57:41,503 --> 03:57:43,295
You have no say it all in the decision

3931
03:57:44,063 --> 03:57:48,671
The people that we were talking about in India do not care about the US tax rate at all

3932
03:57:48,927 --> 03:57:51,231
In the 1960 election but they sure as heck hope

3933
03:57:51,487 --> 03:57:51,999
But the

3934
03:57:52,255 --> 03:57:54,815
Proper person is put in charge of the nuclear Arsenal

3935
03:57:56,607 --> 03:57:58,399
Or look at the central Europeans

3936
03:57:58,655 --> 03:58:03,007
For right smack-dab in the center of the crosshairs if nuclear war breaks out in Europe

3937
03:58:04,031 --> 03:58:08,127
What insurances do they have that the American people are going to vote for president based on

3938
03:58:08,639 --> 03:58:09,663
And who's better looking

3939
03:58:12,223 --> 03:58:15,039
1960 the better-looking candidate wins

3940
03:58:15,807 --> 03:58:16,575
He's also by

3941
03:58:16,831 --> 03:58:22,975
Leaps and Bounds the far richer candidate is the less experienced candidate he is the younger cat

3942
03:58:23,231 --> 03:58:23,743
Something

3943
03:58:24,255 --> 03:58:26,047
Cuz Richard Nixon the Republican

3944
03:58:26,303 --> 03:58:30,911
Former vice president under Eisenhower zamir 46 years old which is young but

3945
03:58:31,935 --> 03:58:38,079
His opponent wins at John F Kennedy and he's a mere 43 still the youngest man ever elected to the office he's a kid

3946
03:58:39,103 --> 03:58:45,247
The seven-year-old Eisenhower and his old people in a walk off the stage and turn over the nuclear

3947
03:58:45,503 --> 03:58:47,551
Launch codes

3948
03:58:47,807 --> 03:58:53,951
To a kid a Playboy millionaire Playboy father's money estimated I thought I read in Forbes Magazine

3949
03:58:54,207 --> 03:58:58,815
300 million dollars of its so much it doesn't matter whether it's adjusted for inflation or not

3950
03:58:59,583 --> 03:59:00,863
Dad was an ambassador

3951
03:59:01,887 --> 03:59:05,727
Is earlier history of Highway originally made that money a lot more sordid than being an ambassador

3952
03:59:07,263 --> 03:59:08,031
The Sun

3953
03:59:08,287 --> 03:59:12,383
Was a swinger he played around with guys like Frank Sinatra and those guys

3954
03:59:13,919 --> 03:59:17,759
Dated a lot of girls that weren't his wife done by people knew that in the Preston

3955
03:59:18,015 --> 03:59:21,599
Talk about that much but had one of these families that was so beautiful and photogenic

3956
03:59:22,111 --> 03:59:26,207
Life magazine and Time Magazine and all these things that that gave all

3957
03:59:26,463 --> 03:59:31,071
The public exposure to him free of charge helped him out a time all the

3958
03:59:31,583 --> 03:59:36,959
Photogenic nature of omit all helped a ton of everybody can understand that that's just politics

3959
03:59:37,983 --> 03:59:41,567
But is that something that's outdated by the time we're picking your leaders

3960
03:59:42,591 --> 03:59:48,735
Will give them the sort of power that Richard Nixon don't feel bad he'll get to be president to just not in nineteen

3961
03:59:48,991 --> 03:59:49,503
60

3962
03:59:49,759 --> 03:59:53,087
Will brag about it 1974 when admittedly

3963
03:59:53,855 --> 03:59:58,463
He's got a few more missiles under his belt and Kennedy will have it he'll tell the press in 1974

3964
03:59:58,719 --> 04:00:00,511
And they should wake everyone up to the

3965
04:00:00,767 --> 04:00:03,583
Disaster you would have if you voted for the wrong person

3966
04:00:03,839 --> 04:00:05,631
Cuz they have this power to

3967
04:00:06,911 --> 04:00:08,447
Nixon quick to the press that

3968
04:00:09,215 --> 04:00:12,799
I could go into my office and pick up my telephone and in 25 minutes

3969
04:00:13,055 --> 04:00:14,847
70 million people will be dead

3970
04:00:16,895 --> 04:00:20,479
The real danger in the system created to manage nuclear weapons

3971
04:00:20,735 --> 04:00:25,087
Is it there is no margin for error it is a 1 strike and you're out situation

3972
04:00:27,135 --> 04:00:29,439
How long do you trust the electorate

3973
04:00:30,207 --> 04:00:34,303
And the political system in general because after all the electricity can only choose

3974
04:00:34,559 --> 04:00:37,119
The candidate to do well in the political system

3975
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:39,679
How long do you trust them

3976
04:00:40,191 --> 04:00:41,727
To do this without making

3977
04:00:41,983 --> 04:00:43,263
Some sort of a terrible mistake

3978
04:00:45,311 --> 04:00:47,103
In the 1960 election

3979
04:00:47,359 --> 04:00:51,967
When John F Kennedy becomes the president of the United States there's a significant number of people that think

3980
04:00:52,991 --> 04:00:55,295
The lightweight has just been given control

3981
04:00:56,063 --> 04:00:57,343
Of the nuclear Arsenal

3982
04:00:59,647 --> 04:01:01,695
And unfortunately

3983
04:01:02,207 --> 04:01:03,999
For world events upcoming

3984
04:01:04,767 --> 04:01:07,327
One of those people going to turn out to be Nikita Khrushchev

3985
04:01:09,631 --> 04:01:11,167
It's going to be wrong about that

3986
04:01:12,447 --> 04:01:18,591
But that's what sets the stage for disaster it's those kind of miscalculations that the exact word count

3987
04:01:18,847 --> 04:01:19,359
Used

3988
04:01:20,639 --> 04:01:21,663
The JFK thought

3989
04:01:21,919 --> 04:01:22,687
Might lead

3990
04:01:23,455 --> 04:01:24,479
To war because

3991
04:01:24,735 --> 04:01:27,807
By this. Is becoming apparent that neither side wants that

3992
04:01:29,599 --> 04:01:31,647
How do you have a war if neither side wanted it

3993
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:34,975
A mistake a miscalculation

3994
04:01:36,511 --> 04:01:37,791
Something unforeseen

3995
04:01:40,095 --> 04:01:45,215
In the book inside the kremlin's Cold War by vladislav zubok and Constantine pleshakov

3996
04:01:45,983 --> 04:01:48,799
It's interesting to read exactly how much

3997
04:01:49,567 --> 04:01:50,847
Khrushchev was hoping

3998
04:01:51,615 --> 04:01:54,687
Kennedy would become the president but not because he thought he was weak

3999
04:01:55,199 --> 04:02:01,343
But because he thought he might be another Franklin Roosevelt someone who could reach out and could have another relationship

4000
04:02:01,599 --> 04:02:04,671
The way Stalin and Roosevelt relationship was seen to be

4001
04:02:06,719 --> 04:02:10,303
Cruise ship apparently I didn't know this did everything he could

4002
04:02:10,815 --> 04:02:12,863
To help Kennedy get elected told

4003
04:02:13,119 --> 04:02:18,495
KGB officers in Washington you know analyze the situation of the sending you can do diplomatically

4004
04:02:18,751 --> 04:02:20,543
Forward propaganda to help do it

4005
04:02:22,847 --> 04:02:27,199
Call Kennedy his president after he was elected and told him at the first

4006
04:02:27,455 --> 04:02:29,247
I2i meeting they ever had you know

4007
04:02:30,271 --> 04:02:31,039
I got you elected

4008
04:02:33,343 --> 04:02:39,487
Now trying to figure out the motivations of the Soviet leader in this situation is as difficult as it is for

4009
04:02:39,743 --> 04:02:45,375
Any of these other politicians in people we've been discussing right though the layers to the core of the onion are impossible to discern

4010
04:02:46,655 --> 04:02:51,007
Zubac and pleshakov inside the kremlin's Cold War seemed to indicate

4011
04:02:51,263 --> 04:02:51,775
That

4012
04:02:52,031 --> 04:02:55,103
Khrushchev was excited about Kennedy

4013
04:02:55,359 --> 04:02:57,919
Coming to the presidency not because he was happy to have

4014
04:02:58,175 --> 04:03:01,759
Some sort of weakling or lightweight at least compared to Eisenhower was a

4015
04:03:02,271 --> 04:03:04,063
Heavyweights heavyweight in office

4016
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:06,367
Because he realistically believed

4017
04:03:06,623 --> 04:03:10,975
But his sources told him that Kennedy was a pragmatist but you was not an idea log

4018
04:03:11,231 --> 04:03:13,023
Maybe you could deal with a man like that

4019
04:03:14,815 --> 04:03:16,351
Shubunkin pleshakov right quote

4020
04:03:17,375 --> 04:03:23,519
Cruise ship was prone to optimistic and often wishful thinking and in the early months after Kennedy's election

4021
04:03:23,775 --> 04:03:26,591
He had an irresistible temptation to see his

4022
04:03:26,847 --> 04:03:27,359
Is an

4023
04:03:27,615 --> 04:03:29,919
Quotes new president in the best light

4024
04:03:30,175 --> 04:03:36,319
He tried many channel to convey to Kennedy that his presidency could open up a new era in US Soviet relations

4025
04:03:37,087 --> 04:03:37,599
And quote

4026
04:03:38,623 --> 04:03:44,767
Detractors and hardliners would say it's all part of a plan he's just going to figure out a way to work this kid and that might be true

4027
04:03:45,023 --> 04:03:47,327
Go to recent history you can't always tell

4028
04:03:48,351 --> 04:03:53,215
But it seem like it was his honeymoon. And the honeymoon. Lasted pretty much up until about

4029
04:03:53,471 --> 04:03:56,799
April because in April something happened if cruise ship thought

4030
04:03:57,311 --> 04:04:00,895
He was going to get to turn to an absolute Clean Slate new page

4031
04:04:01,151 --> 04:04:02,943
After the Eisenhower Administration

4032
04:04:03,455 --> 04:04:05,247
Start bleeding really think that because

4033
04:04:05,503 --> 04:04:07,551
It would be not taking into account the fact

4034
04:04:07,807 --> 04:04:13,951
But nobody gets to start off with a clean slate especially not in the US political system words we said this is a tag team

4035
04:04:14,207 --> 04:04:20,351
Game of atomic poker and in the same way Eisenhower had to take over Truman's hand in mid-game

4036
04:04:20,607 --> 04:04:25,215
Kennedy has to take over Eisenhower's handed mid-game and Eisenhower has some crappy cards

4037
04:04:25,727 --> 04:04:27,263
Let's lay that out there right now

4038
04:04:27,775 --> 04:04:30,335
He warns Kennedy about the tooth loss

4039
04:04:30,591 --> 04:04:31,871
Going to be some trouble just warning you

4040
04:04:33,151 --> 04:04:36,479
Kennedy would find that next door neighbor Vietnam ended up

4041
04:04:36,991 --> 04:04:38,783
Taking more of his time and attention

4042
04:04:39,807 --> 04:04:44,671
Eisenhower also handled in the one card everybody knew was danger handed into Berlin card

4043
04:04:45,439 --> 04:04:47,487
Which was once again hot as hell

4044
04:04:49,023 --> 04:04:52,607
Christian would say about Berlin that Berlin was the testicles of the West

4045
04:04:52,863 --> 04:04:56,959
Every time I want to make the West scream I squeeze on Berlin

4046
04:04:58,239 --> 04:05:04,383
I'm squeezing it in the late 1950s and it became one of the two closest time the Eisenhower Administration came to me

4047
04:05:04,639 --> 04:05:06,431
Nuclear war the other was over a couple of

4048
04:05:06,943 --> 04:05:08,479
Islands off the coast of China

4049
04:05:09,247 --> 04:05:11,039
But you have that card over to

4050
04:05:11,551 --> 04:05:12,831
The new Young president

4051
04:05:13,343 --> 04:05:14,111
Annie Hanna

4052
04:05:14,367 --> 04:05:16,927
Kennedy a new card an unexpected card one that

4053
04:05:17,183 --> 04:05:17,951
Has become

4054
04:05:18,719 --> 04:05:21,535
The more more important but it's in a weird place it's Cuba

4055
04:05:22,559 --> 04:05:24,351
90 miles off US Coast

4056
04:05:25,119 --> 04:05:27,935
Normally a place that us would not be looking for trouble

4057
04:05:28,191 --> 04:05:32,543
During this era as we said they see the whole Freedom communism battle is a zero-sum game

4058
04:05:32,799 --> 04:05:36,383
If communism win some country on the edge of the Earth that's a big deal

4059
04:05:36,895 --> 04:05:39,199
So how the heck did ever snuck into Cuba

4060
04:05:39,967 --> 04:05:40,479
Well

4061
04:05:40,991 --> 04:05:45,343
It's a good story little off the beaten path for us except as it relates to this great game

4062
04:05:45,855 --> 04:05:48,415
But in the late 1950s the government

4063
04:05:48,671 --> 04:05:49,695
The autocratic

4064
04:05:50,463 --> 04:05:54,047
Strongman style government of fulgencio Batista estoppel

4065
04:05:54,815 --> 04:05:57,887
Russian revolutionaries led by guy named Fidel Castro and you made

4066
04:05:58,399 --> 04:06:00,447
Recalled his lieutenants name Che Guevara

4067
04:06:01,727 --> 04:06:03,263
Perdue short period of time

4068
04:06:03,519 --> 04:06:09,663
No one knows what these guys are about but then they end up by hooker by crook there's disagreement about this aligning them

4069
04:06:09,919 --> 04:06:11,967
Shelves with the Socialist side of the world

4070
04:06:12,735 --> 04:06:14,271
This is a huge problem

4071
04:06:14,527 --> 04:06:18,367
And as far as the Eisenhower Administration was concerned during their last years in office

4072
04:06:18,623 --> 04:06:20,927
It had to be dealt with they had a plan

4073
04:06:21,951 --> 04:06:22,975
The CIA plan

4074
04:06:23,999 --> 04:06:25,535
Involving Exile from Cuba

4075
04:06:25,791 --> 04:06:26,815
We're going to

4076
04:06:27,071 --> 04:06:30,655
Hit the beaches at a place called the Bay of Pigs and overthrow that Castro government

4077
04:06:31,167 --> 04:06:34,495
Eisenhower was going to leave office before the plan is ready

4078
04:06:34,751 --> 04:06:37,311
Dwight Eisenhower handed that card to John F Kennedy

4079
04:06:37,567 --> 04:06:43,711
And only a couple months after getting into office the new kid during the learning curve decide to go ahead with the Eisenhower plan cousin

4080
04:06:43,967 --> 04:06:44,991
CIA says it's good

4081
04:06:45,247 --> 04:06:49,087
The military wants to do it basically so Kennedy does it and it

4082
04:06:49,343 --> 04:06:50,111
Fails

4083
04:06:52,159 --> 04:06:54,719
Kennedy Took a ton of personal heat for knot

4084
04:06:55,231 --> 04:06:58,303
Stepping in an overly helping more when the

4085
04:06:58,815 --> 04:06:59,839
CIA badge

4086
04:07:00,351 --> 04:07:01,887
Cubans got into trouble

4087
04:07:02,399 --> 04:07:03,935
He was trying to preserve

4088
04:07:04,191 --> 04:07:09,055
The same sort of figli fiction in Cuba that it was a Cuban on Cuban thing

4089
04:07:09,311 --> 04:07:12,383
But the Chinese and Soviets have been trying to reserve in Korea

4090
04:07:13,663 --> 04:07:14,175
That

4091
04:07:14,431 --> 04:07:15,711
New way you fight

4092
04:07:16,479 --> 04:07:18,271
The wars during the Cold War

4093
04:07:19,551 --> 04:07:21,599
Most of his biographers though assert

4094
04:07:22,367 --> 04:07:28,511
The Kennedy learn something from this data changed him he already had leanings in this direction but it changed in CKD

4095
04:07:28,767 --> 04:07:31,583
Was a second world war veteran he was no Eisenhower

4096
04:07:32,351 --> 04:07:33,119
He commanded

4097
04:07:33,375 --> 04:07:35,935
A little PT boat with like 15 people on it but

4098
04:07:36,191 --> 04:07:38,751
While he was commanding a tegar cutting to

4099
04:07:39,263 --> 04:07:43,359
A Japanese Destroyer that rammed into it and he lost two men instantly

4100
04:07:43,615 --> 04:07:44,383
And had

4101
04:07:44,895 --> 04:07:50,015
It was a highly publicized and used for his political gain story but it was essentially true

4102
04:07:50,271 --> 04:07:55,391
He rescued his own crew Towing 1 wounded man by his life vest

4103
04:07:56,159 --> 04:07:56,927
With the Rope

4104
04:07:57,183 --> 04:08:02,047
Attached to the life vest in his teeth as he swam to Islands miles away

4105
04:08:03,071 --> 04:08:04,863
He that Harvard swim team

4106
04:08:05,375 --> 04:08:06,911
Experience comes in handy

4107
04:08:08,447 --> 04:08:12,031
But Kennedy it said that being a lowly lieutenant

4108
04:08:12,287 --> 04:08:16,127
Sort of on the ground on the scene taught him how out of touch

4109
04:08:16,383 --> 04:08:22,527
The people he called The Brass hats the military leaders back in Washington war with the realities of what the true

4110
04:08:22,783 --> 04:08:23,551
Tips for dealing with

4111
04:08:24,319 --> 04:08:25,087
And that

4112
04:08:25,343 --> 04:08:28,671
Attitude of common soldiers attitude On The Ground by the way

4113
04:08:28,927 --> 04:08:32,511
Was reinforced after the Bay of Pigs disaster

4114
04:08:32,767 --> 04:08:34,303
When he got advice

4115
04:08:34,559 --> 04:08:37,375
From the CIA and his military advisers that he thought

4116
04:08:37,631 --> 04:08:38,911
Was expert opinion

4117
04:08:39,935 --> 04:08:40,959
In one sense

4118
04:08:41,471 --> 04:08:42,495
It was

4119
04:08:43,007 --> 04:08:44,287
But that doesn't mean it's right

4120
04:08:46,079 --> 04:08:47,359
Kennedy wood

4121
04:08:47,615 --> 04:08:48,383
Be shattered

4122
04:08:48,895 --> 04:08:49,407
Die

4123
04:08:49,663 --> 04:08:52,991
What happened at the Bay of Pigs he was supposed to be crying afterwards he was out of

4124
04:08:53,247 --> 04:08:58,111
Shorts for longtime advisor during meetings would catch him staring off into space saying

4125
04:08:58,623 --> 04:09:00,159
How could I have been so stupid

4126
04:09:02,463 --> 04:09:04,767
Biographer Robert dallek writes quote

4127
04:09:05,791 --> 04:09:10,399
How could I have been so stupid was his way of asking why he been so gullible

4128
04:09:10,655 --> 04:09:12,191
He puzzled over the fact

4129
04:09:12,447 --> 04:09:14,751
. not asked harder questions

4130
04:09:15,007 --> 04:09:21,151
I had allowed the so-called Collective wisdom of all these experience National Security officials

4131
04:09:21,407 --> 04:09:22,687
Persuade him to go ahead

4132
04:09:23,199 --> 04:09:29,343
He had assumed he later told adviser Arthur Schlesinger that quote the military and intelligence people

4133
04:09:29,599 --> 04:09:33,439
Both have some secret skill not available to ordinary Mortals

4134
04:09:33,695 --> 04:09:34,207
And quote

4135
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:39,327
The Experience taught him quote never to rely on the experts and quote

4136
04:09:39,583 --> 04:09:41,631
He told journalists Ben bradlee quote

4137
04:09:42,399 --> 04:09:44,703
The first advice I'm going to give my successor

4138
04:09:44,959 --> 04:09:51,103
Is the watch the generals and to avoid feeling that just because they were military man their opinions on Military matters

4139
04:09:51,359 --> 04:09:52,127
You're worth a damn

4140
04:09:52,895 --> 04:09:53,407
And quote

4141
04:09:55,711 --> 04:10:01,855
You know it's tempting to say that there was some luck here historically speaking that Kennedy got this lesson reinforce

4142
04:10:02,111 --> 04:10:07,999
Forced at such an early time in his career before things really heated up in the states Really Got High

4143
04:10:09,023 --> 04:10:11,583
Because only a few months into his career

4144
04:10:12,095 --> 04:10:13,631
Kennedy has decided

4145
04:10:14,655 --> 04:10:17,215
But you have to be skeptical of expert advice sometime

4146
04:10:18,751 --> 04:10:20,031
In this case though

4147
04:10:21,055 --> 04:10:23,871
Is acceptance of an Eisenhower type plan

4148
04:10:24,127 --> 04:10:27,199
Made him look a lot more like the previous administration

4149
04:10:27,711 --> 04:10:30,271
And it's happening right before the meeting with Nikita Khrushchev

4150
04:10:30,783 --> 04:10:36,927
Put the whole kibosh on the honeymoon between Kennedy and Khrushchev as though one spouse itchy

4151
04:10:37,183 --> 04:10:41,023
Eat it on the other after only a couple of months of marriage and if anybody was likely to do that

4152
04:10:42,047 --> 04:10:43,327
Well John F Kennedy

4153
04:10:44,095 --> 04:10:46,655
Nonetheless he went into this Summit

4154
04:10:46,911 --> 04:10:49,215
Right after the Bay of Pigs Fiasco

4155
04:10:49,471 --> 04:10:49,983
To meet

4156
04:10:50,239 --> 04:10:51,775
Khrushchev I die

4157
04:10:52,799 --> 04:10:55,871
And every book you will ever read on the subject no one can resist

4158
04:10:56,383 --> 04:10:57,919
And we won't either obviously

4159
04:10:58,175 --> 04:11:03,807
The visual and background comparison of the two guys when they get together could you find two

4160
04:11:04,063 --> 04:11:05,855
More unlike people

4161
04:11:06,367 --> 04:11:08,927
From their physical differences I mean John F Kennedy's

4162
04:11:09,183 --> 04:11:12,255
Could have been he's the glamour president in terms of

4163
04:11:12,511 --> 04:11:14,303
Looks and charm and all that kind of thinking

4164
04:11:14,559 --> 04:11:17,631
And and he's like the money man he's a propaganda

4165
04:11:17,887 --> 04:11:20,703
Stock character if you're doing this for the Soviet

4166
04:11:20,959 --> 04:11:24,287
Newsreels me he's the money man from the Monopoly game

4167
04:11:25,055 --> 04:11:28,127
And Khrushchev is a peasant but he's one of these peasants who's

4168
04:11:28,383 --> 04:11:34,527
Nicki and he's a Survivor he takes great pride in being able to outwit people who should know better than he

4169
04:11:34,783 --> 04:11:36,575
He knows he has no real formal education

4170
04:11:38,111 --> 04:11:39,135
He has however

4171
04:11:39,903 --> 04:11:41,439
A background in life

4172
04:11:42,207 --> 04:11:43,231
What is formidable

4173
04:11:45,023 --> 04:11:48,863
Zubok and pleshakov describe the two men's first face-to-face meeting

4174
04:11:50,143 --> 04:11:51,423
At the Vienna Summit

4175
04:11:51,935 --> 04:11:56,287
Starting on June 3rd and ending on June 4th 1961 this way quote

4176
04:11:57,567 --> 04:12:02,687
Khrushchev met with Kennedy and Vienna as a prima donna meeting with a first-time Starlet

4177
04:12:03,455 --> 04:12:06,015
I heard you were a young and promising man

4178
04:12:06,271 --> 04:12:08,831
Kruschev greeted the 43 year old president

4179
04:12:09,087 --> 04:12:11,647
The difference in age was almost a quarter of a century

4180
04:12:12,159 --> 04:12:14,975
This generation gap grows into an abyss

4181
04:12:15,231 --> 04:12:21,375
If one thinks of all the Milestones of Russian history as well as the personal experience that it's shaped Khrushchev

4182
04:12:21,631 --> 04:12:24,191
Head of which Kennedy had only a limited understanding

4183
04:12:24,447 --> 04:12:30,335
The only two links between the leaders were World War II and the nuclear polarization of the Cold War

4184
04:12:30,847 --> 04:12:31,359
And quote

4185
04:12:32,639 --> 04:12:34,687
Prussia had already decided after

4186
04:12:34,943 --> 04:12:36,479
The Bay of Pigs Fiasco

4187
04:12:36,991 --> 04:12:39,039
The Kennedy was weaker than Eisenhower

4188
04:12:39,295 --> 04:12:40,831
Something he could have probably assumed

4189
04:12:41,343 --> 04:12:43,391
But now he thought he detected something

4190
04:12:44,415 --> 04:12:45,695
At the Vienna Summit

4191
04:12:46,463 --> 04:12:48,767
He put his theory to the test

4192
04:12:50,303 --> 04:12:53,887
At the summit for two days he put the hard press on John Kennedy

4193
04:12:54,911 --> 04:12:55,935
And Kennedy stumbled

4194
04:12:57,727 --> 04:13:01,311
He came in with a lot of proposals that sounded just like the kind of guy

4195
04:13:01,823 --> 04:13:03,103
Cruise ship was looking for

4196
04:13:03,615 --> 04:13:07,455
I typically first-year president with all the idealism that comes with it in the

4197
04:13:07,711 --> 04:13:13,343
Set of understated implied idea that surely reasonable people can sit down and settle our differences

4198
04:13:13,599 --> 04:13:15,135
And ran into a buzzsaw

4199
04:13:17,695 --> 04:13:22,303
Kennedy described the experience to James Reston of the New York Times

4200
04:13:23,071 --> 04:13:25,375
You said that the summit meeting a quote bin

4201
04:13:25,631 --> 04:13:27,167
The roughest thing in my life

4202
04:13:27,679 --> 04:13:29,215
He just beat the hell out of me

4203
04:13:29,471 --> 04:13:33,055
I've got a terrible problem if you thinks I'm inexperienced and have no guts

4204
04:13:33,311 --> 04:13:36,127
Until we remove those ideas we won't get anywhere with him

4205
04:13:36,895 --> 04:13:37,407
And quote

4206
04:13:39,199 --> 04:13:39,967
Khrushchev said

4207
04:13:40,223 --> 04:13:41,759
Kennedy was too intelligent

4208
04:13:42,271 --> 04:13:43,295
+ 2 week

4209
04:13:44,831 --> 04:13:49,439
Once again when you read the history books on this it's amazing how many of them

4210
04:13:49,695 --> 04:13:50,463
Use

4211
04:13:51,231 --> 04:13:57,375
Poker or some sort of strategic game to describe the situation because there's so much brinkmanship going on

4212
04:13:57,631 --> 04:13:58,911
So much bluffing

4213
04:13:59,167 --> 04:13:59,935
And so much

4214
04:14:00,191 --> 04:14:02,239
Testing out of your opponent in this case

4215
04:14:03,007 --> 04:14:03,775
Khrushchev

4216
04:14:04,031 --> 04:14:07,103
Between the Bay of Pigs in the summit has determined now

4217
04:14:07,359 --> 04:14:10,943
But he's dealing with a much more immature as one of his aides said

4218
04:14:11,199 --> 04:14:14,015
American leader far more immature than Eisenhower

4219
04:14:15,295 --> 04:14:17,343
Inside the kremlin's Cold War

4220
04:14:17,855 --> 04:14:18,879
They Ride quote

4221
04:14:19,391 --> 04:14:22,207
After the first day of talks at the Vienna Summit

4222
04:14:22,463 --> 04:14:28,351
Khrushchev's advisers who waited for his return in front of the Soviet Embassy asked him about his impressions of Kennedy

4223
04:14:28,863 --> 04:14:31,167
Khrushchev waved his hand dismissively

4224
04:14:31,423 --> 04:14:33,727
Kennedy he said was no match for Eisenhower

4225
04:14:33,983 --> 04:14:38,079
He lacked the broad Horizon and the statesmanship of the earlier president

4226
04:14:39,103 --> 04:14:39,615
And quote

4227
04:14:41,663 --> 04:14:42,943
But this changed

4228
04:14:43,199 --> 04:14:48,319
Khrushchev's view of the man and what he could get away with and what he might decide to try

4229
04:14:48,831 --> 04:14:51,391
Which is exactly what you broken Tasha Cobbs say

4230
04:14:51,647 --> 04:14:54,463
Cruise ship told his advisers when some of them said

4231
04:14:54,719 --> 04:14:58,047
Maybe we should kind of listen to this and maybe that will

4232
04:14:58,303 --> 04:15:01,375
Better relations in cruise ship told them

4233
04:15:01,887 --> 04:15:04,959
At the favorable situation must be exploited

4234
04:15:06,495 --> 04:15:11,615
Another words crew Chef originally went into this whole thing may be trying to defuse tensions

4235
04:15:11,871 --> 04:15:18,015
Saw that he was faced with what he thought was a weak president a weak player on the other side of the table couldn't turn

4236
04:15:18,271 --> 04:15:23,135
Down the fabulous opportunity that the role of the historical died seem to have delivered to his side

4237
04:15:23,391 --> 04:15:27,487
And so began to play the game the way you would have played it in a pre nuclear era

4238
04:15:27,743 --> 04:15:30,047
The way Machiavelli would have told you to play it

4239
04:15:32,095 --> 04:15:32,863
But as

4240
04:15:33,119 --> 04:15:36,191
Kennedy theorize when neither side wants War

4241
04:15:36,703 --> 04:15:40,543
You're likely to have one breakout over some miscalculation

4242
04:15:41,311 --> 04:15:43,871
Khrushchev was making a dangerous one

4243
04:15:44,127 --> 04:15:45,919
I thinking that Kennedy was weak

4244
04:15:46,687 --> 04:15:48,735
Even now going to play his hand

4245
04:15:48,991 --> 04:15:53,087
Based on the assumption that that's the kind of man he was competing against

4246
04:15:54,623 --> 04:15:55,647
What happens when

4247
04:15:56,159 --> 04:15:57,695
That gaming strategy

4248
04:15:58,463 --> 04:16:00,255
Run smack-dab into the fact

4249
04:16:01,023 --> 04:16:02,559
If you have misjudged your opponent

4250
04:16:04,095 --> 04:16:04,863
Perhaps

4251
04:16:05,375 --> 04:16:06,655
Apocalyptically saw

4252
04:16:09,983 --> 04:16:10,751
Part 3

4253
04:16:11,519 --> 04:16:13,055
The destroyer of worlds

4254
04:16:16,127 --> 04:16:19,455
The people from the Bertrand Russell side of the evolved

4255
04:16:19,711 --> 04:16:22,783
To deal with our weapons technology debate with saying

4256
04:16:23,551 --> 04:16:29,695
The problem here is the game itself is too dangerous because it involves brinkmanship that's how it's played that's why I ever

4257
04:16:29,951 --> 04:16:30,719
Everyone including me

4258
04:16:30,975 --> 04:16:32,511
Compared to a game

4259
04:16:33,791 --> 04:16:39,679
The rules were laid out very openly by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in the middle 1950s when he said quote

4260
04:16:40,447 --> 04:16:45,567
The ability to get to The Verge without getting into the war is the necessary art

4261
04:16:45,823 --> 04:16:47,103
If you cannot Master it

4262
04:16:47,359 --> 04:16:49,151
You inevitably get into a war

4263
04:16:49,407 --> 04:16:50,943
If you try to run away from it

4264
04:16:51,199 --> 04:16:53,759
If you are scared to go to the brink you are lost

4265
04:16:54,783 --> 04:16:55,295
And quote

4266
04:16:57,087 --> 04:16:59,135
The wind the brink is Armageddon

4267
04:16:59,647 --> 04:17:01,439
How often can you go to the brink

4268
04:17:02,207 --> 04:17:04,767
And no you're not going to Tumble over the edge

4269
04:17:06,815 --> 04:17:08,863
Kennedy will come into office

4270
04:17:09,631 --> 04:17:11,935
As like the dream candidate for the

4271
04:17:12,191 --> 04:17:15,519
Defense intellectuals in places like the Rand Corporation because

4272
04:17:15,775 --> 04:17:19,359
He will bring in people that think that the Rand people have it right

4273
04:17:20,895 --> 04:17:24,735
Kennedy will bring in people from outside the government structure his defense secretary will

4274
04:17:24,991 --> 04:17:27,551
The guy who headed up Ford Motor Company

4275
04:17:27,807 --> 04:17:33,951
Are you bringing in some of the business people to take a new look at all this and say we've been doing it this way for a long time is this the way we should do it

4276
04:17:34,463 --> 04:17:35,487
And a lot of those people like

4277
04:17:35,743 --> 04:17:38,559
Robert McNamara the defense secretary thought those ideas

4278
04:17:38,815 --> 04:17:44,959
Did the Rand people were pushing about you know it's like a bunch of different cards and you have to play them strategically sounded logical

4279
04:17:45,983 --> 04:17:48,031
Demonstration is famous

4280
04:17:48,287 --> 04:17:54,431
For one of the biggest changes in all of nuclear history of something called flexible response traditionally you go for my eyes

4281
04:17:54,687 --> 04:17:55,967
And how was massive retaliation

4282
04:17:56,223 --> 04:17:58,015
Did Kennedy's flexible response

4283
04:17:58,783 --> 04:18:01,087
I used to be a little bit better talking about this

4284
04:18:01,343 --> 04:18:06,207
Before I read some of the newer books by people like Francis J Gavin the basically say

4285
04:18:06,463 --> 04:18:10,303
Something like flexible response was much more for PR

4286
04:18:10,559 --> 04:18:12,351
Then what really was on the ground

4287
04:18:13,631 --> 04:18:17,471
The idea that you could tell the people on the nuclear Battlefield in Europe

4288
04:18:17,727 --> 04:18:21,311
Hey don't worry we won't go to nuclear weapons at the very first option

4289
04:18:21,567 --> 04:18:23,615
At all sorts of benefits whereas

4290
04:18:23,871 --> 04:18:30,015
Kennedy and Eisenhower and Truman all kind of thought that if nuclear war breaks out everybody going to use everything they have anyway

4291
04:18:31,039 --> 04:18:32,575
This game of being able to

4292
04:18:32,831 --> 04:18:38,719
Throw a few bombs out there stop and see what happens sounds good in the classroom but in reality that's probably not what's going to happen

4293
04:18:39,487 --> 04:18:42,303
Unless that's what they're known for a new look at the

4294
04:18:42,559 --> 04:18:46,655
At the security strategy when it came to using nuclear weapons right at a time

4295
04:18:46,911 --> 04:18:53,055
When Kennedy's up against the guy who is every bit as good of a bluffer as Eisenhower was Khrushchev to Fantastic

4296
04:18:53,311 --> 04:18:54,335
Card game player 2

4297
04:18:55,359 --> 04:18:57,663
History John Lewis Gaddis points out

4298
04:18:57,919 --> 04:19:03,551
He uses rhetoric and Bluster and Bluff to cover up for his own side weakness

4299
04:19:03,807 --> 04:19:06,879
Because what the United States doesn't know when Kennedy gets into

4300
04:19:07,135 --> 04:19:07,647
Office

4301
04:19:07,903 --> 04:19:14,047
Talking about a missile Gap with the Soviet Union has more missiles in the United States is that the Soviet Union is woefully unprepared if nuke

4302
04:19:14,303 --> 04:19:15,327
Nuclear war came tomorrow

4303
04:19:16,863 --> 04:19:21,215
Showing proof chef says they're turning out missiles like sausages in Russia

4304
04:19:21,983 --> 04:19:23,519
No choice but to believe him

4305
04:19:25,055 --> 04:19:31,199
The way that us has been finding out what little they could about what was going on is with these over flights of Rush

4306
04:19:31,455 --> 04:19:36,831
Russian territory with these amazing high-level reconnaissance planes called U-2 planes

4307
04:19:38,111 --> 04:19:44,255
But you have to sort of guardian and dart out real quickly the radar shows that you're there but they're flying too high

4308
04:19:44,511 --> 04:19:45,791
Pie for the Russians to intercept

4309
04:19:46,303 --> 04:19:48,351
But they cause International incidents

4310
04:19:48,863 --> 04:19:51,679
And eventually they start getting shot down by missiles

4311
04:19:52,959 --> 04:19:58,847
And when those Pilots fall into Russian hands you have real international incident that was happening during the Eisenhower Administration

4312
04:20:01,151 --> 04:20:03,199
But a 1961 Kennedy orders

4313
04:20:03,455 --> 04:20:04,735
The satellites

4314
04:20:04,991 --> 04:20:06,783
Which are relatively new

4315
04:20:07,039 --> 04:20:13,183
To take a look at the Soviet Union and tell him what they see in over a. Of several months they look down

4316
04:20:13,695 --> 04:20:17,023
And they come back and the experts briefed the president say

4317
04:20:17,535 --> 04:20:20,095
They got my for intercontinental ballistic missiles

4318
04:20:20,351 --> 04:20:21,631
And they're not even ready to go

4319
04:20:23,423 --> 04:20:25,983
They got these nuclear submarines but they're all import

4320
04:20:27,519 --> 04:20:29,567
I'm basically they come to the conclusion

4321
04:20:30,079 --> 04:20:35,455
But if you wanted to all these nuclear problems with the Soviet Union could go away cuz we could Newcomb now

4322
04:20:35,967 --> 04:20:40,319
And stop them dead in their tracks it would be over a preemptive War would solve this

4323
04:20:40,831 --> 04:20:46,719
Catastrophe we all have looming were mankind to be bombed back to the Stone Age what a tempting idea

4324
04:20:47,231 --> 04:20:47,999
That would be

4325
04:20:50,303 --> 04:20:51,839
And the really attractive part

4326
04:20:52,607 --> 04:20:54,655
With the potential to

4327
04:20:54,911 --> 04:20:59,263
Knock out the other side's weapons before they could use them

4328
04:21:00,287 --> 04:21:02,335
Rather than Uber cities another word

4329
04:21:02,591 --> 04:21:05,919
You know like this arm in your opponent by shooting the gun out of his hand

4330
04:21:07,199 --> 04:21:11,039
That sounds a whole lot better than watching a holocaust to keep yourself safe doesn't it

4331
04:21:12,831 --> 04:21:16,671
Daddy also work well with some of the policies that the new Administration

4332
04:21:17,183 --> 04:21:19,487
Add about using nuclear weapons

4333
04:21:20,255 --> 04:21:24,607
Something that would be known as the counter Force strategy in the no cities policy

4334
04:21:25,631 --> 04:21:31,775
And not for the last time something that was intended to make people feel more safe about nuclear

4335
04:21:32,031 --> 04:21:34,079
Your weapon use have the opposite effect

4336
04:21:36,383 --> 04:21:39,455
Kennedy defense secretary explain the counterforce idea

4337
04:21:39,711 --> 04:21:44,319
But now the weapons technology we had would allow the United States

4338
04:21:44,575 --> 04:21:47,647
To Target the weapons of the Soviet Union

4339
04:21:47,903 --> 04:21:49,183
Instead of their cities

4340
04:21:49,951 --> 04:21:53,279
The truth is we would still Target their cities they just wouldn't be the first option

4341
04:21:54,303 --> 04:21:57,375
This was supposed to make people in cities think okay with the United States

4342
04:21:57,631 --> 04:21:58,143
Is it

4343
04:21:58,655 --> 04:22:03,775
Humane country which it is and it would never Target cities if it didn't have to end after all this will return

4344
04:22:04,287 --> 04:22:09,663
You know the battle to the battlefield where it belongs and they'll only be using them against the military forces of the other side

4345
04:22:10,431 --> 04:22:12,223
There were two problems with this one

4346
04:22:12,479 --> 04:22:15,807
People quickly realized that makes them much more usable

4347
04:22:16,319 --> 04:22:17,855
As horrible as it sounds

4348
04:22:18,111 --> 04:22:22,463
The idea that you would kill millions of innocent men women and children in these cities

4349
04:22:22,975 --> 04:22:23,999
Is a deterrent

4350
04:22:24,767 --> 04:22:27,327
If you think what we'll just use nuclear weapons against soldiers

4351
04:22:27,583 --> 04:22:29,887
What weapons are supposed to be used against

4352
04:22:30,399 --> 04:22:36,543
So does that make it a lot easier to start using them and then have a grow out of control will you do use the big weapons on cities

4353
04:22:37,055 --> 04:22:41,151
Does it even matter in a bad enough if you just use them in the military capacity

4354
04:22:42,687 --> 04:22:46,527
The other problem is Savvy people realize something really quickly

4355
04:22:47,039 --> 04:22:48,063
If the point

4356
04:22:48,319 --> 04:22:52,159
Of using these weapons and targeting them at the enemies missiles

4357
04:22:52,415 --> 04:22:55,743
Is to hit the missile so that those missiles don't hit the United States

4358
04:22:56,255 --> 04:22:57,535
You have to shoot them

4359
04:22:58,047 --> 04:23:00,095
Before the other side shoots there's

4360
04:23:00,607 --> 04:23:01,375
You don't want to hit

4361
04:23:01,631 --> 04:23:06,239
A bunch of empty missile locations in launchers and silos after the missiles are gone

4362
04:23:06,751 --> 04:23:08,543
But that means you strike first

4363
04:23:11,615 --> 04:23:14,687
The dynamic was turning into one like a

4364
04:23:14,943 --> 04:23:18,015
Old west gunfight where to gunfighters

4365
04:23:18,527 --> 04:23:20,575
Are going to draw on three

4366
04:23:20,831 --> 04:23:22,111
And everybody's worried

4367
04:23:22,623 --> 04:23:28,511
You're going to get into a situation where what prevents the other side from drawing onto as long as it disables the other person

4368
04:23:28,767 --> 04:23:33,375
Or kill them before they kill you or you going to really question the moral issues

4369
04:23:34,143 --> 04:23:36,447
Which led to a whole need to develop was called

4370
04:23:36,703 --> 04:23:38,751
A second strike capability

4371
04:23:39,519 --> 04:23:41,055
Another word something that said

4372
04:23:41,567 --> 04:23:45,151
We can kill you even if you kill us after you kill us

4373
04:23:45,663 --> 04:23:50,271
Or we can damage you enough so that this whole thing isn't worth another word for deterrence to work

4374
04:23:50,527 --> 04:23:56,671
You would eventually have to have something that Robert McNamara Kennedy's in a former head of Ford Motor Corporation

4375
04:23:57,183 --> 04:23:58,463
Would develop he called it

4376
04:23:58,975 --> 04:24:03,327
Assured destruction today we often call it Mutual assured destruction or mad

4377
04:24:03,583 --> 04:24:04,095
For sure

4378
04:24:06,143 --> 04:24:08,959
But this was a concept that was fully understood in the 1950s

4379
04:24:09,215 --> 04:24:12,543
It was the missiles that turned it into the kind of reality where

4380
04:24:13,823 --> 04:24:19,199
People would start talking about the potential advantages of both sides how to doomsday device

4381
04:24:19,455 --> 04:24:22,527
And eventually the Soviets would have something called the Dead Hand

4382
04:24:23,807 --> 04:24:27,135
With the exact same rationale powering it which is

4383
04:24:27,391 --> 04:24:33,535
We really don't want to have to kill you after you killed us but it might prevent you from killing us in the first place if we do have

4384
04:24:33,791 --> 04:24:34,559
Something like that

4385
04:24:36,863 --> 04:24:42,239
This whole question how you deter the other side of the weirdness of the entire mental construct

4386
04:24:42,751 --> 04:24:44,543
Nuclear deterrence

4387
04:24:45,055 --> 04:24:49,663
I was going to enter the doctor Strangelove phase of weirdness during this era

4388
04:24:50,175 --> 04:24:52,991
Where they will have debates over whether or not

4389
04:24:53,503 --> 04:24:58,623
You should ever respond with a nuclear response if deterrence fails

4390
04:24:59,903 --> 04:25:01,183
Herman Kahn

4391
04:25:01,439 --> 04:25:07,583
It was also associated with the Rand Corporation who will be one of the main Inspirations often cited for the Doctor Strange

4392
04:25:07,839 --> 04:25:08,607
Character

4393
04:25:09,119 --> 04:25:10,399
And we'll talk about it

4394
04:25:10,655 --> 04:25:12,191
The red button

4395
04:25:12,703 --> 04:25:15,263
Nuclear launch button the metaphorical one

4396
04:25:15,519 --> 04:25:21,663
And he will say that people have real discussions about whether or not that button should actually be connected to anything

4397
04:25:23,455 --> 04:25:27,039
Now he says it's important that the other side thinks it's connected to something

4398
04:25:28,063 --> 04:25:29,599
But the idea was

4399
04:25:29,855 --> 04:25:31,135
The if somehow

4400
04:25:31,903 --> 04:25:37,791
Nuclear deterrence fails on the other side launch their nuclear missiles at you the Humane thing to do

4401
04:25:38,559 --> 04:25:39,839
We did not respond

4402
04:25:40,095 --> 04:25:42,143
Right you've lost the war already

4403
04:25:42,911 --> 04:25:44,959
There's no reason to kill them too

4404
04:25:48,543 --> 04:25:53,919
Tasha point out Herman Kahn did not feel that way he definitely thought about you should be connected to something

4405
04:25:54,431 --> 04:25:56,223
Nonetheless he was sort of showing us

4406
04:25:56,735 --> 04:26:00,319
The kinds of conversations that these theorists are having with the sort of

4407
04:26:00,575 --> 04:26:01,599
Questions that will come up

4408
04:26:02,367 --> 04:26:03,903
Their academic in nature

4409
04:26:05,439 --> 04:26:05,951
Theoretical

4410
04:26:07,231 --> 04:26:08,255
Until they're not

4411
04:26:10,303 --> 04:26:12,095
Attentions begin to spike

4412
04:26:12,607 --> 04:26:13,887
After the Vienna Summit

4413
04:26:14,143 --> 04:26:17,471
The last line Kennedy will ever say face to face

4414
04:26:17,727 --> 04:26:19,007
Did Nikita Khrushchev

4415
04:26:19,519 --> 04:26:20,799
Is in response to

4416
04:26:21,311 --> 04:26:24,639
Some of the things that were said at that meeting when he walks out and says

4417
04:26:25,151 --> 04:26:26,431
It's going to be a cold winter

4418
04:26:27,711 --> 04:26:28,479
He's right

4419
04:26:30,015 --> 04:26:34,111
The situation in Berlin will get extremely serious at one point there will be

4420
04:26:34,623 --> 04:26:38,719
American and NATO tanks facing off against Soviet tanks

4421
04:26:38,975 --> 04:26:44,607
Hanover the dividing line between East Berlin and West Berlin and then the Soviets will put up a wall

4422
04:26:44,863 --> 04:26:45,887
Destapa flyme it

4423
04:26:46,143 --> 04:26:48,703
The whole thing becomes a nightmarish disaster

4424
04:26:48,959 --> 04:26:49,471
And

4425
04:26:49,983 --> 04:26:51,775
Problems are narrowly averted

4426
04:26:53,055 --> 04:26:58,175
The tensions will also increase the point where both sides do away with the

4427
04:26:58,687 --> 04:27:03,295
Unofficial moratorium they had on nuclear weapons when everybody started getting worried about Fallout

4428
04:27:03,807 --> 04:27:04,575
No they put a little

4429
04:27:04,831 --> 04:27:08,927
Temporary damper on testing these things and then boom everybody starts up again

4430
04:27:09,695 --> 04:27:13,023
Because if you're going to have tension Skyrocket while you got to make sure

4431
04:27:13,279 --> 04:27:16,095
That your nuclear deterrent remains credible in that means testing

4432
04:27:16,863 --> 04:27:23,007
At the same time it was a great way to send a message to United States will test 98 nuclear weapons

4433
04:27:24,287 --> 04:27:25,823
According to Donovan Webster in a month

4434
04:27:26,335 --> 04:27:27,871
In 1962 in a month

4435
04:27:29,151 --> 04:27:35,295
About sending a message because if you haven't figured out whether it works or not after the 91st St in the you just playing around

4436
04:27:37,855 --> 04:27:38,623
The Soviets

4437
04:27:38,879 --> 04:27:43,743
Have their own way of rattling Sabers they like really really big Savers and Khrushchev Chels

4438
04:27:44,255 --> 04:27:48,607
Is physicist including Andre soccer off that he wants a hundred Megaton bomb

4439
04:27:49,887 --> 04:27:51,423
Remember the United States is

4440
04:27:51,679 --> 04:27:55,519
Test it was the radiological that was 15 megatons

4441
04:27:56,031 --> 04:27:56,799
Castle Bravo

4442
04:27:57,823 --> 04:27:58,335
And

4443
04:27:58,591 --> 04:27:59,103
When you

4444
04:27:59,359 --> 04:28:02,431
Try to figure out megatons I'm no mathematician but but the

4445
04:28:02,687 --> 04:28:05,503
But the power grows exponentially

4446
04:28:05,759 --> 04:28:11,903
You can't just say it's 3 megatons instead of 15 so it's twice as powerful it doesn't work like that especially with things like the thermal radio

4447
04:28:12,159 --> 04:28:12,671
Ocean Park

4448
04:28:13,695 --> 04:28:16,511
Which is highly underrated I just read a whole book on that

4449
04:28:16,767 --> 04:28:19,327
It says for the entire time nuclear weapons been around

4450
04:28:19,583 --> 04:28:23,679
Everyone is underestimated the most dangerous part of them which is the fires that they start

4451
04:28:24,191 --> 04:28:25,471
Because they're hard to measure

4452
04:28:25,727 --> 04:28:31,103
You don't study those just starting to blast so as scary as they are that's all based on blast evidence

4453
04:28:31,615 --> 04:28:37,503
According to Lynn Eden there probably many times more deadly than that once fires taken into account

4454
04:28:39,295 --> 04:28:44,159
Andrei sakharov is supposed to have had with cruise ship and Oppenheimer Truman moment

4455
04:28:44,671 --> 04:28:46,207
A moment with a physicist

4456
04:28:46,463 --> 04:28:50,303
The real deep thinker who's thinking about the ramifications of his

4457
04:28:50,559 --> 04:28:52,863
Creation goes to cruise ship to try to

4458
04:28:53,119 --> 04:28:53,887
Tell him

4459
04:28:54,143 --> 04:29:00,287
Maybe we shouldn't make a 100 Megaton bomb remember it might take a lot more guts for someone to do it in that system

4460
04:29:00,799 --> 04:29:06,943
Didn't say the United States contact because before cruise ship was Stalin and telling Stalin something like this

4461
04:29:07,199 --> 04:29:12,831
Could be bad for your health so already you see that it's a much more open situation but soccer off goes to cruise ship and says

4462
04:29:13,599 --> 04:29:15,647
Maybe we should explode this bomb

4463
04:29:15,903 --> 04:29:20,767
It'll jeopardize future relations in The Test Ban Treaty is that we were unofficially

4464
04:29:21,023 --> 04:29:24,095
I'm having work for us and gets told this by

4465
04:29:24,863 --> 04:29:25,375
Khrushchev

4466
04:29:25,887 --> 04:29:26,399
Quote

4467
04:29:27,423 --> 04:29:30,239
Leave politics to wash where the specialist

4468
04:29:30,751 --> 04:29:33,567
We have to conduct our policies from a position of strength

4469
04:29:34,079 --> 04:29:36,639
Our opponents don't understand any other language

4470
04:29:37,407 --> 04:29:42,527
I did jellyfish and not chairman of the Council of ministers if I listen to people like soccer off

4471
04:29:43,807 --> 04:29:44,319
And quote

4472
04:29:47,135 --> 04:29:48,415
Of course anyone

4473
04:29:48,671 --> 04:29:49,951
The grew up in that era

4474
04:29:51,231 --> 04:29:51,999
Will note

4475
04:29:52,255 --> 04:29:55,071
Automatically. That's exactly the sort of thing

4476
04:29:55,583 --> 04:29:58,143
We here in the US would have said about the Soviets

4477
04:29:58,911 --> 04:30:00,703
Tempe jellyfish in front of them

4478
04:30:01,471 --> 04:30:02,239
In other words

4479
04:30:02,495 --> 04:30:04,799
Khrushchev understands the way it's all played

4480
04:30:05,055 --> 04:30:06,591
Just as Eisenhower did

4481
04:30:06,847 --> 04:30:07,871
Chinese people

4482
04:30:08,639 --> 04:30:10,431
Would make Machiavelli's

4483
04:30:10,687 --> 04:30:11,455
Honor list

4484
04:30:11,967 --> 04:30:16,831
They're good at the game they play but the game is different and soccer off

4485
04:30:17,087 --> 04:30:19,903
At least manages to talk kruschev down

4486
04:30:20,415 --> 04:30:26,559
From a 100 Megaton bomb to a 50 Megaton one because if all you really are trying to do here is rattle a big say

4487
04:30:26,815 --> 04:30:32,447
Sabor 50 megatons is as big as anybody would want even for intimidation purposes

4488
04:30:34,495 --> 04:30:37,311
A slightly over 50 megatons might have been

4489
04:30:38,079 --> 04:30:40,127
Just about half of Khrushchev wanted

4490
04:30:40,639 --> 04:30:42,431
What is John Lewis Gaddis rights quote

4491
04:30:43,455 --> 04:30:45,247
Even so it was big enough

4492
04:30:45,503 --> 04:30:50,879
The single largest blast human beings had ever detonated or have since on the planet

4493
04:30:51,391 --> 04:30:54,463
The Flash was visible 600 miles away

4494
04:30:54,719 --> 04:30:57,791
The fireball now quoting somebody who saw it quote

4495
04:30:58,047 --> 04:31:00,607
Was powerful and arrogant like Jupiter

4496
04:31:00,863 --> 04:31:03,167
It seemed to suck the whole earth into it

4497
04:31:03,423 --> 04:31:09,567
And quote and goddess continues the mushroom cloud Rose 40 miles into the stratosphere

4498
04:31:09,823 --> 04:31:13,663
The island over which the explosion took place was literally level

4499
04:31:13,919 --> 04:31:15,199
Not only of snow

4500
04:31:15,455 --> 04:31:16,479
But also of rocks

4501
04:31:16,735 --> 04:31:20,063
So that it looked to one Observer like an immense skating rink

4502
04:31:20,575 --> 04:31:22,623
The entire spectacle was quote

4503
04:31:23,647 --> 04:31:24,415
Fantastic

4504
04:31:24,671 --> 04:31:25,439
Unreal

4505
04:31:25,695 --> 04:31:27,487
Supernatural end quote

4506
04:31:27,999 --> 04:31:31,839
One estimate calculated got his rights on the basis of this test

4507
04:31:32,095 --> 04:31:38,239
Date of khrushchev's full 100 Megaton bomb have been used instead the resulting firestorm

4508
04:31:38,495 --> 04:31:41,055
Would have been golfing area the size of the state of Maryland

4509
04:31:42,079 --> 04:31:42,591
And quote

4510
04:31:45,407 --> 04:31:47,711
Surely nobody would ever use a weapon like that

4511
04:31:49,247 --> 04:31:51,039
Calculations can go awry

4512
04:31:53,087 --> 04:31:57,951
What do you ramping up at attention during the 1961-62.

4513
04:31:59,487 --> 04:32:01,535
Khrushchev attempted to do something

4514
04:32:02,303 --> 04:32:04,607
If this were really a board game

4515
04:32:04,863 --> 04:32:08,447
The kind I always enjoy playing when I was younger a board war game

4516
04:32:09,215 --> 04:32:13,567
More complicated version of something like Risk an awesome move

4517
04:32:14,847 --> 04:32:20,991
But with the stakes of something like Tsar Bomba and Castle Bravo and all these multi Megaton bombs involve

4518
04:32:22,783 --> 04:32:26,367
It's hard to see how people could justify the worst case scenario

4519
04:32:26,879 --> 04:32:29,183
But under the pre nuclear rules

4520
04:32:29,951 --> 04:32:36,095
Cruise ship makes a move that is so bold that there are quite a few people that think this is the kind of thing that gave him a reputation as a

4521
04:32:36,351 --> 04:32:39,167
Gambler that got him in trouble after this.

4522
04:32:39,423 --> 04:32:42,495
With the other people in Russian leadership who had some say in the matter

4523
04:32:43,007 --> 04:32:44,543
Because it was a recklessness to it

4524
04:32:45,567 --> 04:32:49,663
But my goodness if we were really watching the game instead of life you have to admire

4525
04:32:49,919 --> 04:32:50,687
The hotspot

4526
04:32:51,455 --> 04:32:52,735
When nobody's looking

4527
04:32:52,991 --> 04:32:55,807
Khrushchev solves a bunch of problems he's got

4528
04:32:56,063 --> 04:32:57,343
In one Fell Swoop

4529
04:32:59,135 --> 04:33:00,927
I secretly beginning to put

4530
04:33:01,695 --> 04:33:03,231
Nuclear weapons

4531
04:33:03,743 --> 04:33:05,535
Onto the island of Cuba

4532
04:33:07,583 --> 04:33:09,375
In many ways it's a brilliant idea

4533
04:33:10,399 --> 04:33:16,543
But it all hinges on a single very slender Reed you can see why maybe his cohorts thought him again

4534
04:33:16,799 --> 04:33:19,103
Reckless because that read was

4535
04:33:19,359 --> 04:33:24,223
You got to be able to get the missiles into Cuba and activated ready to go

4536
04:33:24,735 --> 04:33:26,783
Before the US knows they're there

4537
04:33:28,063 --> 04:33:29,599
Because if the US finds out

4538
04:33:30,111 --> 04:33:31,903
The entire plan falls apart

4539
04:33:32,159 --> 04:33:34,463
And when the stakes are global thermonuclear war

4540
04:33:35,487 --> 04:33:36,767
How are you comfortable

4541
04:33:37,279 --> 04:33:39,583
Changing a plan on such a narrow

4542
04:33:40,095 --> 04:33:41,119
Slender Reed

4543
04:33:43,423 --> 04:33:49,567
And not just that it's not like the US isn't paying attention there's been a conventional arms build-up going on in Cuba now

4544
04:33:49,823 --> 04:33:53,407
Now four months so the US is watching it become a political issue

4545
04:33:53,663 --> 04:33:54,943
There are midterm elections

4546
04:33:55,199 --> 04:33:56,223
In November

4547
04:33:56,735 --> 04:33:59,039
Back in September only about a month-and-a-half ago

4548
04:33:59,295 --> 04:34:05,439
The Rumblings were so loud about possible nuclear weapons that Kennedy issued a public statement showing strength and resolve

4549
04:34:05,695 --> 04:34:06,975
You know typical Cold War

4550
04:34:07,231 --> 04:34:07,743
Rhetoric

4551
04:34:07,999 --> 04:34:14,143
I drew a line in the sand and told the Soviet they would be the most Ray ramifications if anyone did anything like that and then Kennedy

4552
04:34:14,655 --> 04:34:20,799
Publicly and privately to the Soviet Diplomat since you're not putting

4553
04:34:22,335 --> 04:34:23,615
Imagine how he felt

4554
04:34:24,639 --> 04:34:29,247
You can also imagine how much gasoline has now recruit around this situation

4555
04:34:29,759 --> 04:34:31,295
When Kennedy finds out

4556
04:34:32,063 --> 04:34:33,087
But he's been lied to

4557
04:34:35,391 --> 04:34:36,671
And if his opponent to

4558
04:34:37,439 --> 04:34:43,583
Charged him with being naive and saying you're putting a country security risk in the Soviets going to put nuclear weapons on that island

4559
04:34:43,839 --> 04:34:44,607
When he finds out

4560
04:34:45,375 --> 04:34:46,911
That's exactly what they've done

4561
04:34:48,959 --> 04:34:50,239
The reason that this

4562
04:34:51,007 --> 04:34:56,895
Crisis begins at such an intense level from the very first minute of that because the stage is set for it

4563
04:34:58,431 --> 04:35:00,479
October 16th in the morning

4564
04:35:00,991 --> 04:35:02,271
1962

4565
04:35:02,527 --> 04:35:03,807
Kennedy's advisors

4566
04:35:04,319 --> 04:35:05,343
Brain photographs

4567
04:35:06,367 --> 04:35:09,439
The photographs show the construction of missile sites underway in Cuba

4568
04:35:10,975 --> 04:35:12,255
The US have been watching

4569
04:35:12,511 --> 04:35:14,047
Weird activity involving

4570
04:35:14,559 --> 04:35:19,935
The Russian handlers offloading shipping if there was suspicion but these U2 photos

4571
04:35:20,447 --> 04:35:22,495
Confirmed everyone's worst fears and that's that

4572
04:35:23,519 --> 04:35:28,383
Within a very short period of time Kennedy CIA advisor thought maybe within a week

4573
04:35:28,639 --> 04:35:31,199
You were going to have operational missiles

4574
04:35:31,967 --> 04:35:34,783
90 miles or so off the US Coast

4575
04:35:36,831 --> 04:35:40,415
Diminutive Kennedy realizes the reality of what he's looking at

4576
04:35:40,927 --> 04:35:42,207
Dynamic starts

4577
04:35:43,231 --> 04:35:44,511
In the back of your head

4578
04:35:45,535 --> 04:35:47,071
A mental stopwatch

4579
04:35:47,327 --> 04:35:48,095
Should begin ticking

4580
04:35:48,863 --> 04:35:51,679
Because the pressures will start to mount instantaneously

4581
04:35:53,471 --> 04:35:59,359
Many historians point out that Kennedy was handing out a best-selling book to his subordinates during this. And you probably read it

4582
04:35:59,615 --> 04:36:02,175
Barbara tuchman's The Guns of August

4583
04:36:02,943 --> 04:36:05,759
The book of course that deals with the run up to the first World War

4584
04:36:06,015 --> 04:36:07,551
And it's really about a dynamic

4585
04:36:08,575 --> 04:36:11,647
The dynamic of decision-makers were in charge

4586
04:36:11,903 --> 04:36:15,743
I'm making moves on the great chessboard and they have some control and they can do things

4587
04:36:15,999 --> 04:36:18,303
But that somewhere along the way

4588
04:36:18,815 --> 04:36:23,167
All of the forces and elements involved begin to turn

4589
04:36:23,679 --> 04:36:26,751
The decision-makers into historical passengers as well

4590
04:36:27,519 --> 04:36:29,823
Or just along for the ride and find

4591
04:36:30,079 --> 04:36:30,591
The

4592
04:36:30,847 --> 04:36:33,663
Range of their possible decisions and moves

4593
04:36:34,431 --> 04:36:38,271
So curtailed that a times they appear to have no good options

4594
04:36:39,039 --> 04:36:42,111
Kennedy was fascinated by this Dynamic apparently

4595
04:36:42,367 --> 04:36:45,951
And thought he saw elements of it coming to play over Berlin already

4596
04:36:47,231 --> 04:36:48,767
Now he was about to take part

4597
04:36:49,279 --> 04:36:51,071
Something very similar although

4598
04:36:51,327 --> 04:36:52,863
From a time constraint

4599
04:36:53,119 --> 04:36:57,215
That run up to the first world war to come month and everybody thought they had no time to react

4600
04:36:57,471 --> 04:37:02,591
Kennedy was going to have nowhere near a month because the move by Khrushchev to put missiles in Cuba

4601
04:37:03,103 --> 04:37:06,431
Makes the next move the United States as if they don't do anything

4602
04:37:06,687 --> 04:37:08,479
Whatever Khrushchev is up to

4603
04:37:08,735 --> 04:37:09,759
Progresses farther

4604
04:37:10,271 --> 04:37:13,087
Do you have to do something and they don't know how long they have to do it

4605
04:37:13,343 --> 04:37:16,671
The fog of War will drive this crisis dynamic

4606
04:37:17,183 --> 04:37:21,023
Because right away the first thing everyone wants to know

4607
04:37:21,279 --> 04:37:24,351
Is are any of these missiles anywhere ready to be fired

4608
04:37:25,887 --> 04:37:28,447
And we found those missile sites

4609
04:37:28,703 --> 04:37:30,239
But what missile sites haven't we found

4610
04:37:30,751 --> 04:37:35,103
Are there Warheads on the island how many is there more stuff on the way

4611
04:37:37,407 --> 04:37:40,735
But your company these critical uncertainties is one thing

4612
04:37:40,991 --> 04:37:43,039
That US policy makers know for sure

4613
04:37:43,807 --> 04:37:44,575
Daddy is

4614
04:37:44,831 --> 04:37:50,975
Every moment you wait the situation is getting worse regardless of what it might be now on the ground a Cubix we don't know that

4615
04:37:51,231 --> 04:37:52,767
But we know it'll be worse for us tomorrow

4616
04:37:53,791 --> 04:37:54,815
That puts

4617
04:37:55,071 --> 04:37:56,351
An incredible

4618
04:37:56,863 --> 04:37:59,423
Time pressure on all these events

4619
04:37:59,679 --> 04:38:02,239
The attitude is the even if you sleep

4620
04:38:02,495 --> 04:38:03,519
Things are getting worse

4621
04:38:04,031 --> 04:38:06,335
I need to move and do something

4622
04:38:06,591 --> 04:38:10,943
Is exerting a huge force on the people who have to make these decisions in a way

4623
04:38:11,199 --> 04:38:13,247
Let's solve the problem

4624
04:38:13,759 --> 04:38:18,879
Without creating a bigger problem in this case the bigger problem would be World War 3

4625
04:38:19,647 --> 04:38:22,207
And if the president will have to remind his advisors

4626
04:38:22,719 --> 04:38:25,023
The other side has a hostage

4627
04:38:26,303 --> 04:38:30,911
What if they decide to kill their hostage if we do something

4628
04:38:31,167 --> 04:38:34,495
To solve our problem in Cuba remember the hostages West Berlin

4629
04:38:35,263 --> 04:38:37,823
Annies Kennedy will also point out to his advisors

4630
04:38:38,079 --> 04:38:42,943
Training Cuba for West Berlin is not a good trade in the Europeans definitely wouldn't think it was a good trade

4631
04:38:45,759 --> 04:38:49,599
Within hours of seeing the photos of the construction sites in Cuba

4632
04:38:50,111 --> 04:38:54,207
President Kennedy calls a meeting of what will be known as the x-com

4633
04:38:55,487 --> 04:38:59,839
It's really just a group of hand-picked National Security advisers along with some other

4634
04:39:00,095 --> 04:39:01,375
Influential voices

4635
04:39:01,631 --> 04:39:07,775
The Kennedy wanted to hear from including the attorney-general's who happens to be his younger brother Robert that's his favorite in

4636
04:39:08,031 --> 04:39:09,567
I think it was about 13 of them

4637
04:39:10,847 --> 04:39:12,383
And it can be in the first meeting

4638
04:39:12,639 --> 04:39:13,407
4

4639
04:39:13,919 --> 04:39:17,759
Noon October 16th and they will begin to discuss

4640
04:39:18,271 --> 04:39:19,551
How you react

4641
04:39:20,319 --> 04:39:24,159
The couch as move right the balls in the US is Court hear what are you do

4642
04:39:24,671 --> 04:39:27,231
At one point Kennedy were reminded participants

4643
04:39:27,999 --> 04:39:29,279
They were talking about

4644
04:39:29,791 --> 04:39:35,935
Potential for strikes on American Urban centers that could create 80 to a hundred million cash

4645
04:39:36,191 --> 04:39:38,495
Talking about the destruction of a country

4646
04:39:39,519 --> 04:39:42,591
Not to mention any casualties elsewhere in the world

4647
04:39:43,615 --> 04:39:46,687
Has there ever been a more important series of conversations

4648
04:39:46,943 --> 04:39:47,455
Ever

4649
04:39:49,759 --> 04:39:51,295
And if you're in a position

4650
04:39:51,807 --> 04:39:54,111
Play John F Kennedy is in the situation

4651
04:39:55,391 --> 04:39:59,999
With that kind of responsibility hanging over your head and the Judgment of History

4652
04:40:01,279 --> 04:40:04,095
How to deal with wouldn't you want to cover your ass

4653
04:40:05,887 --> 04:40:06,655
Somehow

4654
04:40:08,959 --> 04:40:09,471
Kennedy

4655
04:40:09,727 --> 04:40:11,775
Without telling any of the participants

4656
04:40:12,031 --> 04:40:13,311
In the excomm meetings

4657
04:40:14,591 --> 04:40:15,103
Tape them

4658
04:40:16,383 --> 04:40:22,527
Is brother may have known but no one else did a 10 years later when this all came out and we found out that several presidents found tape

4659
04:40:22,783 --> 04:40:24,063
Systems useful

4660
04:40:24,831 --> 04:40:25,855
You can see why

4661
04:40:27,391 --> 04:40:30,975
It upset some of the participants in the XCOM meeting who felt a little betrayed

4662
04:40:33,535 --> 04:40:34,815
At the same time

4663
04:40:35,071 --> 04:40:37,631
It's like a gift from the gods for his story

4664
04:40:38,911 --> 04:40:42,495
Because you can be a fly on the wall I can literally hearing the

4665
04:40:42,751 --> 04:40:46,847
The secondary conversations in the coughing and the people coming and going through the door

4666
04:40:47,103 --> 04:40:48,383
As though you're there

4667
04:40:48,639 --> 04:40:53,503
When at least one side in this crisis. That will last Almost 2 weeks

4668
04:40:53,759 --> 04:40:56,831
Is making the most important decisions in world history

4669
04:40:59,135 --> 04:41:05,023
And what's crazy when you listen to it is it the combination of boring monotony that could put you to sleep

4670
04:41:06,047 --> 04:41:10,143
And subject matter that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up

4671
04:41:10,911 --> 04:41:17,055
Because it sounds like an office meeting even during the most stressful. Nobody's screaming and yelling it sounds like a

4672
04:41:17,311 --> 04:41:19,103
National business meeting in a board of directors

4673
04:41:19,871 --> 04:41:21,919
But when you listen to what they're saying

4674
04:41:22,431 --> 04:41:24,991
At one point of me talking about

4675
04:41:26,271 --> 04:41:29,855
Casualties that are at second world war levels

4676
04:41:30,111 --> 04:41:31,135
In afternoon

4677
04:41:34,463 --> 04:41:35,999
With Stakes that high

4678
04:41:37,023 --> 04:41:39,327
You would love to wish in a perfect world

4679
04:41:39,583 --> 04:41:43,423
But that was the only thing decision-makers took into account how do we avoid

4680
04:41:43,935 --> 04:41:46,495
The casualties on that scale and destruction

4681
04:41:47,007 --> 04:41:51,103
Not apocalyptic but it wasn't the only thing on their minds on either side

4682
04:41:52,127 --> 04:41:52,895
It's funny because

4683
04:41:53,407 --> 04:41:56,223
And more than 50 years and now looking back on this

4684
04:41:56,479 --> 04:41:59,295
We kind of have that man from Mars perspective

4685
04:41:59,807 --> 04:42:02,367
Because all of the individual concerns of the era

4686
04:42:02,879 --> 04:42:04,415
A faded in importance

4687
04:42:04,671 --> 04:42:07,231
Right it's not our day-to-day existence we have our own concern

4688
04:42:07,743 --> 04:42:11,071
The only concern from that. That matters to us now

4689
04:42:11,583 --> 04:42:12,607
Is that they avoid

4690
04:42:13,375 --> 04:42:16,959
World War 3 because imagine how different our time today would be

4691
04:42:17,471 --> 04:42:18,495
Are they failed in that

4692
04:42:19,519 --> 04:42:20,287
But for them

4693
04:42:20,799 --> 04:42:24,383
There's a slew of things acting upon their choices

4694
04:42:25,151 --> 04:42:26,431
Very big things

4695
04:42:27,455 --> 04:42:33,343
And very small things at least from The Man From Mars perspective I mean some of this is driven by John F Kennedy's

4696
04:42:33,599 --> 04:42:37,695
Political reality in the November midterm elections that seems nuts today

4697
04:42:38,975 --> 04:42:41,023
If something like that it influenced

4698
04:42:41,279 --> 04:42:45,375
Global thermonuclear war history turned out can you imagine

4699
04:42:45,631 --> 04:42:47,423
What the verdict of History would be

4700
04:42:49,983 --> 04:42:51,775
Nonetheless this is why those people

4701
04:42:52,031 --> 04:42:58,175
Like the Albert Einstein's questioned our ability to live with these weapons while still playing the game

4702
04:42:58,431 --> 04:42:59,199
Under the old rules

4703
04:42:59,455 --> 04:43:01,759
Because you get into situations like this

4704
04:43:03,807 --> 04:43:05,087
I want you to do

4705
04:43:05,855 --> 04:43:06,879
You can always get out

4706
04:43:08,927 --> 04:43:15,071
After a day or two Kennedy's considering for options to deal with the construction sites in Cuba option number one is an airstrike

4707
04:43:15,327 --> 04:43:16,095
Strike against them

4708
04:43:16,863 --> 04:43:21,727
Option number two is a general series of airstrikes across the island much bigger affair

4709
04:43:21,983 --> 04:43:24,287
But it would help you deal with all the unknowns

4710
04:43:24,543 --> 04:43:27,359
I would help get rid of the defenses so that when you had to fly over

4711
04:43:27,615 --> 04:43:29,407
More times it would be easier

4712
04:43:30,943 --> 04:43:35,295
Number three is a blockade of the US Navy's around the island and say

4713
04:43:35,551 --> 04:43:39,391
We don't know how many nuclear weapons and missiles are on the island but we're not letting anything more Ian

4714
04:43:40,415 --> 04:43:41,695
Phone number for

4715
04:43:42,207 --> 04:43:44,767
Is a general invasion of Cuba by the US Military

4716
04:43:47,839 --> 04:43:50,143
Now while he's considering these options

4717
04:43:50,399 --> 04:43:51,423
Things get worse

4718
04:43:52,447 --> 04:43:55,007
This is also part of the crisis Dynamic but

4719
04:43:55,263 --> 04:44:00,127
You think you're on top of the current situation where you have these medium-range nuclear weapons

4720
04:44:00,383 --> 04:44:02,943
Into because they measure the size of the

4721
04:44:03,455 --> 04:44:06,783
Launching pad areas they figured out these are for medium range weapons

4722
04:44:07,039 --> 04:44:08,319
And all the sudden they find more

4723
04:44:08,831 --> 04:44:10,367
Missile construction sites

4724
04:44:10,623 --> 04:44:13,695
As they fly over with more U-2 reconnaissance planes

4725
04:44:14,207 --> 04:44:18,559
And these are built for bigger muscles are going to be winter called intermediate-range

4726
04:44:19,071 --> 04:44:21,631
Ballistic missiles now on the island to which will reach

4727
04:44:22,143 --> 04:44:24,191
Almost all of the United States

4728
04:44:27,519 --> 04:44:33,151
The Soviets don't have a ton of the missiles that can go from Russian territory to American territory

4729
04:44:33,407 --> 04:44:38,271
But they have a ton of the medium-range. That's been threatening Europe for a decade now

4730
04:44:38,527 --> 04:44:44,671
That's what they're moving into Cuba as one military advisor will say giving them a Quantum Leap in terms

4731
04:44:44,927 --> 04:44:46,719
Is their ability to Nuke the United States

4732
04:44:47,487 --> 04:44:51,327
Kennedy will point out that this is a temporary thing they're building these missiles

4733
04:44:51,583 --> 04:44:55,423
You know every day that can reach from Russia to the United States owe in the matter of time

4734
04:44:55,679 --> 04:45:01,055
Does it really matter if the missile destroys Washington DC started in Moscow or Habana

4735
04:45:04,127 --> 04:45:05,919
Play Ratchet up the pressure even more

4736
04:45:06,943 --> 04:45:08,479
Eventually Kennedy decides

4737
04:45:09,247 --> 04:45:10,271
American dolls

4738
04:45:11,551 --> 04:45:14,367
A limited action for a limited purpose

4739
04:45:14,879 --> 04:45:18,463
He's going to put a blockade around Cuba so that it doesn't get any worse

4740
04:45:20,511 --> 04:45:22,559
He's essentially going to

4741
04:45:23,583 --> 04:45:26,655
Throw the car down and tell Cruise Ship it's his plane

4742
04:45:29,983 --> 04:45:31,263
The problem is such a move

4743
04:45:32,031 --> 04:45:33,311
Is that it does nothing

4744
04:45:33,567 --> 04:45:36,383
To deal with the missiles that are already on the island in the

4745
04:45:37,151 --> 04:45:39,967
Everyone's faking this crushing time problem

4746
04:45:40,223 --> 04:45:43,039
And pressure with because no one knows when they're going to be operational

4747
04:45:43,295 --> 04:45:44,575
We do about those

4748
04:45:46,879 --> 04:45:49,183
Kennedy wanted to take them out we can't figure out how to do it

4749
04:45:49,695 --> 04:45:50,207
Without

4750
04:45:50,463 --> 04:45:56,607
Potentially prompting World War 3 I mean there's Russian working on those weapons would he kill them to how many Russians can you kill him

4751
04:45:56,863 --> 04:45:57,375
Airstrike

4752
04:45:57,631 --> 04:45:58,399
And not prompt

4753
04:45:58,655 --> 04:45:59,423
World War 3

4754
04:45:59,679 --> 04:46:00,191
4

4755
04:46:00,447 --> 04:46:03,007
Just the taking of Berlin which would do the same thing

4756
04:46:05,055 --> 04:46:11,199
October 19th Kennedy goes into a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff is Big military advisors the heads of the

4757
04:46:11,455 --> 04:46:14,527
Army in the Air Force in the Marines and the Navy

4758
04:46:15,039 --> 04:46:16,575
And tell them his plan

4759
04:46:17,343 --> 04:46:19,647
To do a blockade with no air strikes

4760
04:46:22,207 --> 04:46:23,487
And all of a sudden

4761
04:46:23,999 --> 04:46:24,767
It's apparent

4762
04:46:25,279 --> 04:46:28,607
But you have a huge problem on your hand because the military disagree

4763
04:46:29,631 --> 04:46:30,655
And I don't think

4764
04:46:31,423 --> 04:46:35,519
You know we're going too far out on a limb to say that it looks a little like

4765
04:46:35,775 --> 04:46:41,919
What you were seeing at the end of the Truman Administration with the strains they had with the military over who controls this stuff

4766
04:46:42,175 --> 04:46:46,015
Where the lines of demarcation between civilian and Military control our

4767
04:46:46,527 --> 04:46:48,319
Seems like things took a hiatus

4768
04:46:48,831 --> 04:46:51,391
But two terms of Eisenhower the general president

4769
04:46:51,647 --> 04:46:57,791
And now with the kid who screwed up the Bay of Pigs and screwed up the Vienna Summit I mean the weakling this is how the

4770
04:46:58,047 --> 04:46:59,327
Military looked at this guy this

4771
04:46:59,839 --> 04:47:04,191
One Admiral on The Joint Chiefs of Staff I think said he was a skipper for a small Patrol boat I mean

4772
04:47:04,447 --> 04:47:10,591
They didn't respect him and he was starting to not respect them very much and when they heard his plan was a blockade with

4773
04:47:10,847 --> 04:47:14,431
No strikes against the missile bases that were already under construction

4774
04:47:15,967 --> 04:47:17,503
They push back hard

4775
04:47:20,319 --> 04:47:23,135
The pushback was led by Air Force General Curtis LeMay

4776
04:47:24,415 --> 04:47:26,719
And as many of Kennedy's biographers indicate

4777
04:47:26,975 --> 04:47:30,559
Kennedy seemed to be intimidated by Lemay but who wouldn't be

4778
04:47:32,351 --> 04:47:34,911
Author Michael Dobbs write Salome quote

4779
04:47:35,679 --> 04:47:39,007
Anecdotes about Lemay became the stuff of Airforce Legend

4780
04:47:39,263 --> 04:47:40,543
Crude and petulant

4781
04:47:40,799 --> 04:47:44,383
He used to show his contempt for his colleagues on The Joint Chiefs of Staff

4782
04:47:44,639 --> 04:47:49,247
I belching loudly and leaving the door open when he visited their private toilet

4783
04:47:49,759 --> 04:47:55,903
When a crew chief asked him to extinguish his ever-present cigar to avoid igniting an explosion on board a

4784
04:47:56,159 --> 04:47:59,743
Fully fueled bomber Lemay growled it wouldn't dare

4785
04:48:00,255 --> 04:48:04,351
Ask for a policy recommendation on Cuba he replied simply

4786
04:48:04,607 --> 04:48:05,375
Try it

4787
04:48:06,143 --> 04:48:06,911
And quote

4788
04:48:09,215 --> 04:48:09,983
This is what it's like

4789
04:48:10,495 --> 04:48:12,031
To be a fly on the wall

4790
04:48:12,543 --> 04:48:13,823
Curtis LeMay

4791
04:48:14,335 --> 04:48:18,943
Tells President Kennedy that he needs to be invading Cuba right now

4792
04:49:21,663 --> 04:49:27,807
That's a shot right there by the man everyone in the room would have known it was President Kennedy's dad was often tarred

4793
04:49:28,063 --> 04:49:30,367
Feathered associated with the British

4794
04:49:30,623 --> 04:49:34,719
Even policy of Hitler and dappled Lemmings accusing Kennedy of right there

4795
04:49:58,783 --> 04:50:01,855
Contentious 45-minute meeting the president leaves the room

4796
04:50:02,111 --> 04:50:05,695
And the military advisors begin talking about him bad-mouthing him

4797
04:50:06,463 --> 04:50:07,487
Not knowing

4798
04:50:07,743 --> 04:50:10,559
The Kennedys been taping the meeting and the tape hasn't stopped

4799
04:50:11,327 --> 04:50:12,607
And that's all on Tape 2

4800
04:50:15,167 --> 04:50:17,983
This is the way strange Sheldon and Stern put a talking about

4801
04:50:18,239 --> 04:50:19,519
Defense secretary

4802
04:50:19,775 --> 04:50:22,335
Add another person leaving leaving the military heads quote

4803
04:50:22,847 --> 04:50:24,639
McNamara and Taylor Departed

4804
04:50:24,895 --> 04:50:28,735
Leaving Lama schupan wheeler behind to talk if the door closed

4805
04:50:29,247 --> 04:50:35,391
A way they believe from prying ears the remaining Chiefs voiced their disdain for civilian control of

4806
04:50:35,647 --> 04:50:36,159
The military

4807
04:50:36,415 --> 04:50:40,767
And left little doubt who they thought should be in charge of military decision-making

4808
04:50:41,023 --> 04:50:42,815
The hidden tape recorder of course

4809
04:50:43,071 --> 04:50:44,095
Continue to turn

4810
04:50:44,863 --> 04:50:45,375
And quote

4811
04:50:47,679 --> 04:50:48,959
In their defense

4812
04:50:49,471 --> 04:50:53,823
These people have two things to worry about one is keeping the United States safe

4813
04:50:54,079 --> 04:51:00,223
The other is making sure that if the worst case scenario happens when President Kennedy calls the final failure nuclear war

4814
04:51:00,991 --> 04:51:05,343
The job of these generals and military leaders is just beginning they have to win the nuclear war

4815
04:51:07,391 --> 04:51:09,183
So everybody's trying to do the same thing

4816
04:51:10,207 --> 04:51:13,791
The president is pretty sure that if he follows the advice of his military leaders

4817
04:51:14,047 --> 04:51:18,655
He's going to get you in World War 3 the military leaders are pretty convinced that if President Kennedy

4818
04:51:18,911 --> 04:51:20,703
Continue on the course he's on

4819
04:51:20,959 --> 04:51:25,311
You going to have World War 3 anyway and the u.s. is going to be at a disadvantage when fighting it

4820
04:51:27,359 --> 04:51:29,151
Storing Sheldon Dempster and said quote

4821
04:51:29,407 --> 04:51:35,039
After the meeting the president told his a Dave powers that he was stunned by lemay's Kaki certainty

4822
04:51:35,295 --> 04:51:39,903
The cruise ship would do nothing if the US bombed the missile sites and killed a lot of Russians

4823
04:51:40,159 --> 04:51:45,023
Quote these brass hats have one great advantage in their favor JFK fumed

4824
04:51:45,279 --> 04:51:47,583
If we listen to them and do what they want us to do

4825
04:51:47,839 --> 04:51:50,655
None of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong

4826
04:51:51,423 --> 04:51:51,935
And quote

4827
04:51:54,751 --> 04:52:00,383
All the modern historians will say that the XCOM tapes have changed the way this crisis have been viewed

4828
04:52:01,663 --> 04:52:03,455
It's amazingly clear though

4829
04:52:03,711 --> 04:52:09,855
The John F Kennedy like Eisenhower and Truman beforehand but from a much more difficult position Maybe

4830
04:52:10,879 --> 04:52:12,159
Push back against

4831
04:52:12,415 --> 04:52:14,463
In this case unanimous

4832
04:52:14,719 --> 04:52:16,255
Military opposition

4833
04:52:16,511 --> 04:52:21,887
The Joint Chiefs of Staff were unanimous that Kennedy's idea of a blockade with no air strikes was bad

4834
04:52:23,423 --> 04:52:28,287
Is XCOM advisors his civilian advisor to fluctuated in their views and changed

4835
04:52:28,543 --> 04:52:29,567
We're mostly

4836
04:52:29,823 --> 04:52:32,127
Sure then Kennedy was being far too weak

4837
04:52:32,639 --> 04:52:38,783
And when he finally informed a few members of Congress to the biggest bigwigs in his own Democratic party essentially said are you crazy

4838
04:52:39,295 --> 04:52:41,343
Can't just do that and wanted to do

4839
04:52:41,855 --> 04:52:46,207
Nothing's more along the lines of what the military want to do this 45 year old guy

4840
04:52:47,231 --> 04:52:47,999
Define Olive

4841
04:52:51,071 --> 04:52:52,863
Every time I start thinking

4842
04:52:53,119 --> 04:52:58,239
Individual don't matter in history I remind myself that there are examples like this where

4843
04:52:59,007 --> 04:53:04,895
The odds-on favorite thing to do would be to have a president follow the advice of his military advisers

4844
04:53:05,919 --> 04:53:10,015
All it might have taken for things to go sideways is for somebody to have merely done that

4845
04:53:13,087 --> 04:53:14,879
It's a little hard to believe isn't it

4846
04:53:16,671 --> 04:53:21,791
Now at this point in the story when things are getting very scary the world is unaware of this

4847
04:53:22,303 --> 04:53:25,631
The Russians themselves are not completely sure what's going on in the United States

4848
04:53:25,887 --> 04:53:26,655
Kennedy

4849
04:53:26,911 --> 04:53:28,703
Has one of his people handed note

4850
04:53:28,959 --> 04:53:30,239
To the Russian ambassador

4851
04:53:30,495 --> 04:53:35,103
Explaining what's about to happen and then goes on National Television to tell the world

4852
04:53:35,871 --> 04:53:38,687
The United States has found nuclear missiles in Cuba

4853
04:53:38,943 --> 04:53:39,967
And this is a big problem

4854
04:53:42,783 --> 04:53:45,599
The Soviets have gotten word a couple of hours before

4855
04:53:45,855 --> 04:53:46,879
Kennedy speech

4856
04:53:47,647 --> 04:53:49,951
David major that I was going to have to do with Cuba

4857
04:53:50,207 --> 04:53:51,231
And at that point

4858
04:53:51,999 --> 04:53:54,047
The Soviet leadership got together

4859
04:53:54,303 --> 04:53:55,839
Andaz diplomat bacilli

4860
04:53:56,095 --> 04:53:57,119
Kuznetsov

4861
04:53:57,375 --> 04:53:58,399
Pointed out quote

4862
04:53:58,911 --> 04:54:00,703
Khrushchev should his pants

4863
04:54:03,007 --> 04:54:09,151
Because all of a sudden it was clear that that slender little read upon which he had built this audacious Reckless gambler

4864
04:54:09,407 --> 04:54:09,919
What is

4865
04:54:10,175 --> 04:54:14,015
The part about the United States not finding out about the missile till they were operational

4866
04:54:14,271 --> 04:54:15,551
Get it slender Reed broke

4867
04:54:17,855 --> 04:54:21,695
And as Alexander fursenko and Timothy naftali right

4868
04:54:22,207 --> 04:54:22,719
Quote

4869
04:54:23,743 --> 04:54:29,887
Khrushchev let the frustration of the moment show to the men in front of him most of whom have experienced the Russian Civil War

4870
04:54:30,143 --> 04:54:36,287
War and all of whom headed toward the second world war an survive Stalin Khrushchev bared his soul

4871
04:54:36,543 --> 04:54:38,335
It is tragic he said

4872
04:54:38,591 --> 04:54:44,735
Did come so close to having a deterrent force in Cuba so close to making this kind of a nightmare unimaginable

4873
04:54:44,991 --> 04:54:47,807
Now Not only was a US invasion of Cuba possible

4874
04:54:48,063 --> 04:54:51,135
What's up with the new clearxchange involving the Soviet Union

4875
04:54:51,391 --> 04:54:54,719
Nevertheless Khrushchev was determined to show resolve quote

4876
04:54:54,975 --> 04:54:58,047
They can attack us he said and we shall respond

4877
04:54:58,559 --> 04:55:03,423
Articulating what was on everyone's mind in the hall he added this man ended a big war

4878
04:55:04,447 --> 04:55:05,215
And quote

4879
04:55:06,239 --> 04:55:09,055
Kennedy told the world in his speech about the weapons in Cuba

4880
04:55:09,311 --> 04:55:15,455
Said he was going to launch a blockade which they called a quarantine cuz the blockade is an act of War

4881
04:55:15,711 --> 04:55:17,759
A quarantine a Future Weapons

4882
04:55:19,295 --> 04:55:22,111
And then ask Khrushchev in a global forum

4883
04:55:22,367 --> 04:55:27,231
As the world was now Awakening to the fact they were in the middle of a potential thermonuclear crisis

4884
04:55:27,999 --> 04:55:30,047
To step back from the brink

4885
04:55:30,559 --> 04:55:31,839
And try to work

4886
04:55:32,351 --> 04:55:33,375
For the future

4887
04:55:33,887 --> 04:55:35,167
To avoid Armageddon

4888
04:55:37,215 --> 04:55:38,751
I call upon chairman Khrushchev

4889
04:55:39,519 --> 04:55:41,055
The hall and eliminate

4890
04:55:41,567 --> 04:55:45,407
This clandestine Reckless and provocative threat to World Peace

4891
04:55:46,175 --> 04:55:48,223
And to stable relations between our two Nations

4892
04:55:49,247 --> 04:55:52,575
I call upon Him further to abandon this course of world domination

4893
04:55:53,343 --> 04:55:55,391
Energon and his Star Cafe

4894
04:55:55,903 --> 04:55:57,951
When the perilous arms race

4895
04:55:58,463 --> 04:56:00,255
Edit transform the history of man

4896
04:56:01,279 --> 04:56:03,071
He has an opportunity now

4897
04:56:03,327 --> 04:56:04,863
The move the world back

4898
04:56:05,119 --> 04:56:06,399
Show me a picture of Destruction

4899
04:56:07,423 --> 04:56:09,727
By returning to his government own words

4900
04:56:10,751 --> 04:56:14,079
But it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory

4901
04:56:14,591 --> 04:56:16,383
And withdrawing these weapons from Cuba

4902
04:56:17,151 --> 04:56:18,687
Refraining from any action

4903
04:56:19,199 --> 04:56:21,247
Which will widen or deepen the present crisis

4904
04:56:22,015 --> 04:56:24,319
And then by participating in a search

4905
04:56:24,575 --> 04:56:26,623
Peaceful and primitive Solutions

4906
04:56:26,879 --> 04:56:29,183
Before Kennedy is even done speaking

4907
04:56:29,951 --> 04:56:32,255
Strategic Air Command will have moved up hits

4908
04:56:32,511 --> 04:56:34,559
Alert status to Defcon 3

4909
04:56:35,071 --> 04:56:35,839
Animals have

4910
04:56:36,351 --> 04:56:40,191
Bombers in the air which they kind of do all the time anyway to a degree but

4911
04:56:40,703 --> 04:56:43,775
Everything begins to go on heightened alert ships begin moving

4912
04:56:44,031 --> 04:56:49,663
Into the Caribbean there's already Maneuvers underway with the very suspicious code name of

4913
04:56:50,175 --> 04:56:54,271
Well it's Castro spelled backwards I wonder how many people got fooled

4914
04:56:56,319 --> 04:57:00,927
And the mechanisms of war that Barbara tuchman would have recognized

4915
04:57:01,183 --> 04:57:06,815
As beginning to shift into gear in 1914 as the wheels begin to ground toward that

4916
04:57:07,071 --> 04:57:09,119
Particular blueprint for Armageddon

4917
04:57:09,887 --> 04:57:12,191
Things began to follow a parallel path

4918
04:57:13,983 --> 04:57:17,311
On October 22nd 1962

4919
04:57:19,103 --> 04:57:20,639
Kennedy speech to the world

4920
04:57:21,407 --> 04:57:22,431
Did two things

4921
04:57:22,687 --> 04:57:24,223
Pretty much instantaneously

4922
04:57:25,503 --> 04:57:29,343
The first thing it did was confirm with the Soviets were already suspecting

4923
04:57:29,855 --> 04:57:32,159
And that's at the US and found their missiles

4924
04:57:32,927 --> 04:57:34,463
The second thing to speech dude

4925
04:57:35,231 --> 04:57:36,767
Was in one Fell Swoop

4926
04:57:37,791 --> 04:57:42,655
Inform the world that there might be a nuclear war in the very near future

4927
04:57:44,959 --> 04:57:46,495
I'm fascinated by this

4928
04:57:47,263 --> 04:57:49,823
I tried to figure out some sort of analogy for

4929
04:57:50,079 --> 04:57:55,199
Something that might be as disruptive you know every single day if you pile on the pressure to our

4930
04:57:55,967 --> 04:57:57,503
Civilization of framework

4931
04:57:57,759 --> 04:57:59,039
Keep Society

4932
04:57:59,295 --> 04:58:00,063
Together

4933
04:58:00,319 --> 04:58:01,087
As a

4934
04:58:01,343 --> 04:58:03,647
Nuclear war during the Kennedy administration

4935
04:58:05,183 --> 04:58:06,719
I thought what would you the same thing

4936
04:58:07,231 --> 04:58:09,535
Will the same thing we do the same thing

4937
04:58:10,047 --> 04:58:13,375
You found out this week there might be a nuclear war be very similar

4938
04:58:13,631 --> 04:58:15,167
Test case scenario I would think

4939
04:58:16,447 --> 04:58:19,519
The only other thing I could think of maybe that would compare in terms of

4940
04:58:20,031 --> 04:58:22,847
Potentially shaking the foundations upon which we

4941
04:58:23,871 --> 04:58:26,943
Don't run out in the street and smash each other in the head with a bottle

4942
04:58:27,455 --> 04:58:31,551
If the aliens showed up right at the like in all those movies the Giant

4943
04:58:32,063 --> 04:58:34,623
Multi football field size

4944
04:58:35,135 --> 04:58:39,231
Spacecraft Park themselves over our city I think the same sort of shaking

4945
04:58:39,487 --> 04:58:39,999
Us

4946
04:58:40,255 --> 04:58:43,071
To our civilizational foundational Roots would happen

4947
04:58:43,839 --> 04:58:46,911
Nonetheless if you thought you might not wake up tomorrow

4948
04:58:48,191 --> 04:58:51,775
And most other people around you were having the same sort of thought

4949
04:58:53,055 --> 04:58:55,871
Does that change things on the ground in you are

4950
04:58:56,639 --> 04:58:57,407
Little world

4951
04:58:59,199 --> 04:59:02,527
Does that impact the water cooler discussions at work the next day

4952
04:59:03,295 --> 04:59:03,807
How does that

4953
04:59:04,063 --> 04:59:05,087
Change your

4954
04:59:05,343 --> 04:59:07,647
Travel plans for the near future I mean

4955
04:59:07,903 --> 04:59:13,279
There are plans for example even for the most important in the society take the president

4956
04:59:13,791 --> 04:59:19,935
Or his family to get out of Dodge in case nuclear war happened and Jackie Kennedy was famously she didn't want to be

4957
04:59:20,959 --> 04:59:25,311
And if it was going to happen she wanted to die with the children in Washington with the president

4958
04:59:26,591 --> 04:59:30,431
Now there were even plans and once again this shows you how real this is

4959
04:59:30,943 --> 04:59:35,807
What to do to get the president out of the White House if he's in the white house when the White House is new

4960
04:59:38,367 --> 04:59:39,647
I'm going there apparently would like

4961
04:59:40,159 --> 04:59:45,791
You know a saline torches and get him out then bundled him into a radiation suit real quick Michael Dobbs says and then

4962
04:59:46,047 --> 04:59:48,351
Hoffman meindl helicopter for evacuation

4963
04:59:50,911 --> 04:59:52,959
But it gives you an idea of the steaks here

4964
04:59:53,471 --> 04:59:59,103
And what people are forced to contemplate like Bertrand Russell and those other scientist it said imagine your family

4965
04:59:59,359 --> 05:00:04,479
Dying in front of you agonizingly while you yourself do it everyone you know in your community

4966
05:00:05,247 --> 05:00:07,295
These are thought the people almost never have

4967
05:00:11,135 --> 05:00:13,695
I would also suggest that there's a huge difference between

4968
05:00:14,207 --> 05:00:20,351
When people worry about a a true nuclear war versus our main worry today in the 24

4969
05:00:20,607 --> 05:00:21,119
First century

4970
05:00:21,631 --> 05:00:23,167
When it comes to nuclear war

4971
05:00:23,423 --> 05:00:24,191
A loan

4972
05:00:24,703 --> 05:00:30,847
Attack by a terrorist groups of a single bomb goes off in a single City and that would be a nightmarish disaster don't get me wrong

4973
05:00:32,383 --> 05:00:37,247
Shake the foundations of the society because the entire Society will then turn

4974
05:00:37,503 --> 05:00:39,039
And help that place deal

4975
05:00:40,063 --> 05:00:40,831
But what if it's

4976
05:00:41,087 --> 05:00:42,111
12 cities

4977
05:00:42,367 --> 05:00:43,135
At once

4978
05:00:43,647 --> 05:00:44,415
They get nuked

4979
05:00:45,951 --> 05:00:52,095
In the case of the nuclear war plan right now we 1962 Moscow is slated

4980
05:00:52,351 --> 05:00:55,423
For like a hundred nuclear weapons on that city alone

4981
05:00:58,239 --> 05:01:02,335
Do you wonder how long it is before Society turns into one of those

4982
05:01:02,591 --> 05:01:08,735
In a set of a dog-eat-dog everybody starts being pulling out their stored ammunition in their canned goods and and people

4983
05:01:08,991 --> 05:01:14,623
Start thinking there's no you know nothing to live for so I'm not going into work tomorrow then when does it start to break down under the pressure

4984
05:01:18,463 --> 05:01:22,303
In the u.s. lots of army unit I think I read it with the biggest

4985
05:01:22,815 --> 05:01:23,839
In the country

4986
05:01:24,095 --> 05:01:29,727
Amassing of troupe since the second world war begins to move down to Florida in case they're needed for a Cuban invasion

4987
05:01:29,983 --> 05:01:33,567
All the food and all the canned goods start sweeping off the shelves I mean

4988
05:01:33,823 --> 05:01:35,103
In a lot of people quoted

4989
05:01:35,359 --> 05:01:37,407
Remember this time. As

4990
05:01:37,663 --> 05:01:40,223
The will we be alive next week time.

4991
05:01:41,759 --> 05:01:43,551
Bob Dylan famously said he was going to

4992
05:01:44,063 --> 05:01:50,207
Work quickly on the song he was riding at the time cuz he was worried you wouldn't be able to finish it or they get as much down on paper before tomorrow

4993
05:01:52,767 --> 05:01:54,047
Maybe the most poignant

4994
05:01:54,303 --> 05:01:55,839
Line I've ever heard in the

4995
05:01:56,095 --> 05:01:57,631
Missile Crisis as it's called

4996
05:01:58,143 --> 05:02:00,959
What Secretary of State dean rusk when his aide dropped him off

4997
05:02:01,471 --> 05:02:03,007
And said see you in the morning

4998
05:02:03,263 --> 05:02:05,311
This according to Sheldon M Stern by the way

4999
05:02:06,591 --> 05:02:09,151
And then Roscoe's this really you know unflappable sort of

5000
05:02:09,663 --> 05:02:12,223
Emotionally stable guy said I hope so

5001
05:02:12,735 --> 05:02:14,271
See you in the morning I hope so

5002
05:02:14,527 --> 05:02:17,855
Nehi didn't think about it at the time but he's just contemplating it later

5003
05:02:18,111 --> 05:02:22,719
For that guy he said and I'm quoting here that was the emotional equivalent of screaming

5004
05:02:26,815 --> 05:02:28,863
First major crisis moment appears

5005
05:02:29,887 --> 05:02:35,519
Right after the u.s. establishes this quarantine with their ships and the first of the Soviet ships approach it

5006
05:02:36,287 --> 05:02:37,823
It's like two dozen of them

5007
05:02:38,335 --> 05:02:41,663
And the world is now glued to this in real time

5008
05:02:42,943 --> 05:02:46,271
Not sure there's ever been anything like this in the coverage of news

5009
05:02:46,783 --> 05:02:47,295
Where

5010
05:02:47,551 --> 05:02:53,695
Be there waiting on street corners for the next edition of newspaper to be delivered back in the day there be several daily editions of nightly Edition

5011
05:02:54,463 --> 05:02:58,047
They're waiting outside places like Times Square and reading the electronic

5012
05:02:58,303 --> 05:03:00,863
Lit up crawl on the side of the building

5013
05:03:01,119 --> 05:03:07,263
And they're watching all three us broadcast networks give this the 1962 equivalent to wall-to-wall coverage

5014
05:03:08,543 --> 05:03:10,847
Coquille Maps behind Walter Cronkite

5015
05:03:11,103 --> 05:03:14,943
A little paper ship Carter's occasionally being moved closer and closer

5016
05:03:15,455 --> 05:03:16,223
Outline of

5017
05:03:16,735 --> 05:03:17,759
Quarantine

5018
05:03:18,271 --> 05:03:22,367
Even the president and his people were watching this coverage to everybody sort of holding their breath

5019
05:03:24,671 --> 05:03:30,815
It seems to me this is quite a bit different than something like Edward armor has famous live radio broadcast

5020
05:03:31,071 --> 05:03:36,959
From London is the bombs are dropping on the city during the blitz Because unless you lived in London

5021
05:03:37,471 --> 05:03:40,543
This didn't have a direct impact on your life

5022
05:03:41,567 --> 05:03:42,079
Whereas

5023
05:03:42,335 --> 05:03:48,479
You could be in the heartland of the United States or for that matter the heartland of the Soviet Union over that matter Central Europe just about anywhere

5024
05:03:49,247 --> 05:03:53,855
And what you're watching here in real-time May determine whether or not

5025
05:03:54,111 --> 05:03:55,135
You wake up

5026
05:03:55,391 --> 05:03:58,463
Some morning this week what are your children grow up and have a future

5027
05:03:58,719 --> 05:03:59,231
I mean

5028
05:03:59,487 --> 05:04:02,559
This is the stakes are hard to imagine aminos

5029
05:04:02,815 --> 05:04:07,167
HW Brands points out of he's writing a book about soda political Theory

5030
05:04:07,423 --> 05:04:13,055
Point out how this changes the entire equation from anything we ever had in previous history right quote

5031
05:04:14,079 --> 05:04:18,431
When people had labored toward distant goals in the Premier nuclear era

5032
05:04:18,687 --> 05:04:24,063
They could console themselves with the knowledge that though they might not live to see their objectives realized

5033
05:04:24,319 --> 05:04:26,111
Their children or grandchildren might

5034
05:04:26,623 --> 05:04:28,671
If the goals were Beyond human grasp

5035
05:04:28,927 --> 05:04:33,535
Each succeeding generation could at least approach a bit closer than the one before

5036
05:04:33,791 --> 05:04:37,119
The invention of nuclear weapons change the situation entirely

5037
05:04:38,143 --> 05:04:40,959
Now he writes there existed a real possibility

5038
05:04:41,215 --> 05:04:44,287
But the whole human experiment would be cancelled Midway

5039
05:04:44,543 --> 05:04:50,431
In that event not even future Generations because there wouldn't be any would know how things turned out

5040
05:04:50,943 --> 05:04:55,295
Under the nuclear Cloud the meaning of human existence through murkier than ever

5041
05:04:56,319 --> 05:04:56,831
Quote

5042
05:04:59,647 --> 05:05:02,207
If we were still trying to today

5043
05:05:02,719 --> 05:05:08,863
Reach the standards of living that they had back then because we were still working our way back up

5044
05:05:09,119 --> 05:05:10,911
From the rubble of World War 3

5045
05:05:11,679 --> 05:05:13,727
Would any of the concerns

5046
05:05:13,983 --> 05:05:15,519
But these people had

5047
05:05:15,775 --> 05:05:17,311
It's more important

5048
05:05:18,335 --> 05:05:19,615
Seem worth it

5049
05:05:21,151 --> 05:05:27,295
This is something that exposes a bunch of things where you could if you were grading humankind on how

5050
05:05:27,551 --> 05:05:31,135
How well they were doing adapting to their weapons technology you can give him an ass

5051
05:05:31,391 --> 05:05:37,535
Because they've overlooked basic fundamentals for example as this crisis unfolding you just want to scream to the participants.

5052
05:05:37,791 --> 05:05:38,303
Something

5053
05:05:38,815 --> 05:05:40,351
They can't even communicate

5054
05:05:40,863 --> 05:05:41,887
In real time

5055
05:05:42,399 --> 05:05:43,167
One on one

5056
05:05:43,423 --> 05:05:45,215
John Kennedy can't talk to krisha

5057
05:05:46,239 --> 05:05:47,519
When you think about

5058
05:05:48,031 --> 05:05:52,639
All the time they had in the 1950s in the stairs and the threat level rising

5059
05:05:52,895 --> 05:05:57,503
Don't you think one of these people theorizing about nuclear war be like them or whatever you move be like

5060
05:05:57,759 --> 05:06:00,319
Don't you think somebody would have said we have to have a hotline

5061
05:06:01,087 --> 05:06:04,671
We're going to want to talk to the opposite number if a crisis Dynamic starts

5062
05:06:04,927 --> 05:06:05,439
Didn't

5063
05:06:07,999 --> 05:06:11,327
Averanow we could expect world leaders who were

5064
05:06:11,839 --> 05:06:16,703
Ratcheting up the tension to a nuclear war to be able to text each other

5065
05:06:17,471 --> 05:06:20,031
Khrushchev and Kennedy are communicating

5066
05:06:20,287 --> 05:06:21,567
Via letters

5067
05:06:22,591 --> 05:06:25,151
Diplomatic equivalent to snail mail

5068
05:06:26,431 --> 05:06:28,479
Take half a day from the time

5069
05:06:28,991 --> 05:06:30,783
One side writes the letter

5070
05:06:31,039 --> 05:06:37,183
Gets it hand-delivered to the other side after cabling it has to be translated in Than Ready is half a day

5071
05:06:38,719 --> 05:06:40,255
A lot can happen in a

5072
05:06:40,511 --> 05:06:42,559
Real-time prices in half a day

5073
05:06:44,863 --> 05:06:51,007
As the Soviet ships approach the quarantine line for this big face off the US Strategic Air Command

5074
05:06:51,263 --> 05:06:52,543
Alert level is raised

5075
05:06:52,799 --> 05:06:54,079
To Defcon 2

5076
05:06:54,591 --> 05:06:57,919
The first time ever and it public assurances are to be believed

5077
05:06:58,431 --> 05:06:59,711
The only time since

5078
05:07:00,479 --> 05:07:03,295
Defcon 1 is all-out nuclear war by the way

5079
05:07:05,087 --> 05:07:05,855
Soviet

5080
05:07:06,367 --> 05:07:09,439
Strategic arms expert Steven zaloga says that

5081
05:07:10,207 --> 05:07:13,023
At the same time Soviet forces strategic forces were

5082
05:07:13,279 --> 05:07:16,351
Dialogue for the first time ever as well so now you have

5083
05:07:16,607 --> 05:07:18,911
In many theaters around the globe

5084
05:07:19,167 --> 05:07:24,287
These two militaries the two most powerful militaries in all world history and their allies

5085
05:07:24,543 --> 05:07:26,847
Rubbing up against each other militarily

5086
05:07:27,615 --> 05:07:32,991
Bring in the Arctic in Europe in its is everywhere Asia over Japan

5087
05:07:33,759 --> 05:07:38,879
The potential for something bad to happen unintentionally skyrockets

5088
05:07:40,159 --> 05:07:45,023
So do all the variables by the way as well I mean think about how much easier this whole thing must have been

5089
05:07:45,279 --> 05:07:47,583
Forgot like Kennedy before the world knew about it

5090
05:07:48,351 --> 05:07:53,983
Now every press outlet and every big city and small town in America not to mention the rest of the world

5091
05:07:54,495 --> 05:07:58,079
Has a headline related to the decisions you're currently considering right now

5092
05:07:59,103 --> 05:08:01,151
You weren't feeling the pressure before

5093
05:08:01,407 --> 05:08:04,223
The media combined with public opinion combined with

5094
05:08:04,479 --> 05:08:08,831
The political realities in democracies all over the Western world

5095
05:08:09,343 --> 05:08:12,671
Can criticize you an offer Alternatives and cause all kinds of problems

5096
05:08:12,927 --> 05:08:17,535
The stress level becomes so acute it would be hard I think to find a moment

5097
05:08:17,791 --> 05:08:19,583
In human history were human beings

5098
05:08:21,119 --> 05:08:22,655
On such a wide

5099
05:08:22,911 --> 05:08:27,775
Platform it mean not one place at one time but everywhere have been under this kind of pressure

5100
05:08:28,287 --> 05:08:29,055
Just my opinion but

5101
05:08:29,567 --> 05:08:35,711
We normally localized it if you're about to be taken over by the Mongols in your city you feel every bit as worried but it's

5102
05:08:35,967 --> 05:08:36,735
Just in your city

5103
05:08:37,247 --> 05:08:39,295
This is everybody holding their Collective breath

5104
05:08:41,343 --> 05:08:46,719
I mean you want a variable that would have been hard to model at the Rand Corporation 10 years before this time how do you

5105
05:08:46,975 --> 05:08:51,071
Represent with a letter like X somebody like Fidel Castro

5106
05:08:52,095 --> 05:08:56,959
A fervent revolutionary who fully seems ready to die for the cause here if necessary

5107
05:08:57,215 --> 05:09:02,335
He's pretty gung-ho when he puts pressure on cruise ship like the Allies on the west of putting pressure on Kennedy

5108
05:09:03,615 --> 05:09:07,967
He's a hard guy to account for seeing if this was really a show about the Cuban Missile Crisis we be talkin

5109
05:09:08,223 --> 05:09:09,759
A lot more about the Cubans

5110
05:09:10,527 --> 05:09:13,599
But it's more about controlling your weapons technology and

5111
05:09:13,855 --> 05:09:19,999
Khrushchev apparently have to tell Castro something very similar to what he told Mal years before which is we don't we didn't get into

5112
05:09:20,255 --> 05:09:23,071
Did the struggle against imperialism just to die

5113
05:09:25,887 --> 05:09:30,239
As the line of Soviet ships apparently keeps moving toward the quarantine

5114
05:09:30,751 --> 05:09:32,031
The media has

5115
05:09:32,287 --> 05:09:35,359
The countdown going I mean that's how tense this is everybody's

5116
05:09:35,615 --> 05:09:39,967
And biting your nails including Kennedy and his advisors in the White House is being shipped approach to Line2

5117
05:09:40,223 --> 05:09:44,831
What's going to happen confrontation see how quickly could get out of control everybody really worried

5118
05:09:46,367 --> 05:09:48,159
In his book An Unfinished Life

5119
05:09:48,415 --> 05:09:49,439
About John F Kennedy

5120
05:09:49,951 --> 05:09:51,743
Presidential biographer Robert dallek

5121
05:09:52,511 --> 05:09:53,279
Quotes

5122
05:09:53,535 --> 05:09:58,143
Robert Kennedy the president brother who was in the room with them and they're all sitting there waiting for this

5123
05:09:58,655 --> 05:10:00,703
In a crisis moment to occur

5124
05:10:01,727 --> 05:10:03,519
As the countdown continues

5125
05:10:04,799 --> 05:10:07,103
And Alec quoting Robert Kennedy

5126
05:10:07,359 --> 05:10:07,871
Rights

5127
05:10:08,127 --> 05:10:08,639
Quote

5128
05:10:09,919 --> 05:10:13,759
The president's tension was reflected in his appearance and physical movements

5129
05:10:14,271 --> 05:10:14,783
Quote

5130
05:10:15,039 --> 05:10:18,111
This was the moment which we hope would never come

5131
05:10:18,367 --> 05:10:19,391
Bobby wrote later

5132
05:10:19,647 --> 05:10:22,207
Quote the danger in concern that we all felt

5133
05:10:22,463 --> 05:10:24,255
Hung like a cloud over us all

5134
05:10:24,767 --> 05:10:27,583
These few minutes with the time of Greatest Warrior by the president

5135
05:10:28,095 --> 05:10:30,655
His hand went up to his face and covered his mouth

5136
05:10:30,911 --> 05:10:32,191
Any clothes just Fists

5137
05:10:32,959 --> 05:10:35,263
His eyes were tents almost Gray

5138
05:10:35,519 --> 05:10:38,335
And we just stared at each other across the table

5139
05:10:38,591 --> 05:10:42,687
Was the world on the brink of a holocaust and we done something wrong

5140
05:10:42,943 --> 05:10:44,991
I felt we were on the edge of a precipice

5141
05:10:45,247 --> 05:10:46,783
And it was as if there was no way off

5142
05:10:47,551 --> 05:10:48,063
+ 4

5143
05:10:51,135 --> 05:10:51,903
And then

5144
05:10:52,159 --> 05:10:56,767
Kennedy gets a couple of messages and relatively quick succession that appear something's happening on

5145
05:10:57,023 --> 05:10:57,791
The season

5146
05:10:58,303 --> 05:11:01,631
Maybe these ships are slowing down there not sure but maybe and then maybe they're stopping

5147
05:11:02,143 --> 05:11:03,935
And maybe some of them are even turning around

5148
05:11:07,263 --> 05:11:08,543
This is the moment where

5149
05:11:09,055 --> 05:11:15,199
The air goes out of the room like a balloon and then Secretary of State Dean Rusk is supposed to have said you know we had a gay

5150
05:11:15,455 --> 05:11:19,039
Game when I was growing up in Georgia where two people have a staring contest in

5151
05:11:19,807 --> 05:11:23,391
Eventually you lose when somebody have to Blink and goes well the other guy just blinked

5152
05:11:24,415 --> 05:11:27,487
This moment will go down in history of the time the other guy just blinked

5153
05:11:28,255 --> 05:11:30,047
Kennedy faced down Khrushchev in this

5154
05:11:30,303 --> 05:11:32,863
In a contest of Wills in at the last second

5155
05:11:33,375 --> 05:11:34,655
Cruise ship turn this ship around

5156
05:11:36,191 --> 05:11:38,751
That we now know that that's not what happened

5157
05:11:39,263 --> 05:11:41,055
But the people at the time didn't know that

5158
05:11:42,079 --> 05:11:48,223
Has Michael Dobbs Punch-Out in a great line he said kruschev did indeed blank but he blinked 30 hours before

5159
05:11:48,735 --> 05:11:51,039
And it took that long for Washington to see it

5160
05:11:53,599 --> 05:11:58,975
Khrushchev it actually made the decision not to challenge the quarantine with any ships carrying

5161
05:11:59,231 --> 05:12:04,351
Nuclear missiles or weapons pretty darn soon after Kennedy announced the quarantine

5162
05:12:05,119 --> 05:12:06,655
But he didn't make that public knowledge

5163
05:12:08,959 --> 05:12:09,471
Egypt

5164
05:12:09,727 --> 05:12:13,055
Rattling Sabers and threatening to run the blockade in

5165
05:12:14,335 --> 05:12:16,127
Push the envelope the entire time

5166
05:12:19,199 --> 05:12:22,015
All the while knowing he had no intention of running that particular

5167
05:12:22,271 --> 05:12:22,783
Risk

5168
05:12:25,087 --> 05:12:28,671
Historians have long differed on how you should see

5169
05:12:29,183 --> 05:12:32,511
This move by crucial not to openly challenge The Blockheads

5170
05:12:33,535 --> 05:12:37,631
You'll still go through with ships that don't carry band material in the US in

5171
05:12:37,887 --> 05:12:39,423
And his ships will play us one of us

5172
05:12:40,191 --> 05:12:41,727
Consensual dance of

5173
05:12:42,239 --> 05:12:43,519
Convenience to avoid

5174
05:12:43,775 --> 05:12:48,127
Now that they've gotten off the crisis hook temporarily having things get out of control again

5175
05:12:49,407 --> 05:12:52,479
But a lot of historians will say that this is a crushing humiliation

5176
05:12:52,991 --> 05:12:58,623
The cruise ship that have to back down like this especially after he said publicly and the Kennedy and letters I'm not backing down

5177
05:13:00,927 --> 05:13:01,695
And apparently

5178
05:13:01,951 --> 05:13:08,095
Khrushchev's military advisers are coming to see him similarly to how JFK's military advisors he Kennedy

5179
05:13:08,607 --> 05:13:10,399
Not a lot of respect on all sides

5180
05:13:10,911 --> 05:13:15,519
That's playing into this but there are other historians that will portray this more like a

5181
05:13:16,287 --> 05:13:22,431
Counter-move very similar to the ones Kennedy has been making the ones that say I'm not going to be the one to start a nuclear war

5182
05:13:22,943 --> 05:13:27,295
But so many of my active choices would do so I'm going to do more of a passive choice

5183
05:13:28,063 --> 05:13:34,207
Right I'm not going to invade Cuba I'm not going to launch attacks against the Cuban Missile sites I'm just going to throw the quarantine

5184
05:13:34,719 --> 05:13:36,255
Your move mr. Khrushchev

5185
05:13:36,767 --> 05:13:39,583
Khrushchev says I'm not going to challenge the blockade I'm going to pull those shipped back

5186
05:13:39,839 --> 05:13:43,679
But I'm going to continue to work on actually redouble my efforts

5187
05:13:43,935 --> 05:13:45,215
To speed up the work

5188
05:13:45,727 --> 05:13:48,799
All the nuclear weapons and missiles that are already in Cuba

5189
05:13:49,567 --> 05:13:50,847
Your turn mr. Kennedy

5190
05:13:53,407 --> 05:13:59,551
Now we get to this point in the story where I can't help but think about the unquantifiable variable that is the human element

5191
05:13:59,807 --> 05:14:03,135
Again little things that would be so hard to model

5192
05:14:03,391 --> 05:14:05,951
You know when the old game theories

5193
05:14:07,487 --> 05:14:08,511
Things like sleep

5194
05:14:09,535 --> 05:14:11,071
How do you quantify

5195
05:14:11,327 --> 05:14:14,655
Lack of sleep these people are putting in 20-hour days now

5196
05:14:15,423 --> 05:14:15,935
Everyday

5197
05:14:17,471 --> 05:14:23,615
You're not eating well and John F Kennedy's bad back is supposed to problem so much at the Vienna Summit that it may have info

5198
05:14:23,871 --> 05:14:24,895
Things went

5199
05:14:25,151 --> 05:14:27,711
Okay we're not talking about one person now

5200
05:14:28,223 --> 05:14:31,039
In this situation we're talkin about the collective

5201
05:14:31,807 --> 05:14:34,111
Frazzled this of everyone

5202
05:14:34,879 --> 05:14:36,159
On all sides

5203
05:14:36,927 --> 05:14:41,279
Khrushchev isn't leaving his office he's sleeping on his couch and is closed day after day after day

5204
05:14:43,327 --> 05:14:45,887
Think about the little things to the you wouldn't even consider

5205
05:14:46,399 --> 05:14:51,519
Unless you were in that situation all these people that have not a single spare men in their day

5206
05:14:52,031 --> 05:14:58,175
Still have to wonder about how am I getting my family out of this area if nuclear war happens if my wife has 10,000 problem she's calling me back at you

5207
05:14:58,431 --> 05:15:04,575
I can't figure out how to get evacuated I mean these people have all these worries that if it was just a single individual even if it was

5208
05:15:04,831 --> 05:15:06,367
The leader of a country you would think well

5209
05:15:06,623 --> 05:15:08,671
That's a variable the system can work around

5210
05:15:09,183 --> 05:15:12,255
But it's happening to everyone all at once all at the same time

5211
05:15:12,511 --> 05:15:18,143
And you can't quantify you can't say the factory things 20% more towards bad decisions because how would you know

5212
05:15:18,655 --> 05:15:24,287
But you can reliably say that if you compare the performance of the system all the individual together working

5213
05:15:24,543 --> 05:15:25,823
You don't want a One

5214
05:15:26,079 --> 05:15:30,175
To how their operating collectively by day 10 that we're going to see a diminishment

5215
05:15:30,431 --> 05:15:34,527
How long can people in this situation go before you're starting to make really poor decisions

5216
05:15:34,783 --> 05:15:38,879
More for fatigue and stress overload reasons and anything else again

5217
05:15:39,135 --> 05:15:43,231
If you're the Rand Corporation trying to model how things are going to go in a real-world situation

5218
05:15:43,487 --> 05:15:47,071
You know what's the value you plug in Forex for that

5219
05:15:49,631 --> 05:15:51,423
And then there's the ultimate variable

5220
05:15:51,935 --> 05:15:55,519
In this equation the one everyone recognizes cuz it's so obvious

5221
05:15:56,287 --> 05:15:57,823
The two human beings

5222
05:15:58,079 --> 05:16:01,919
Who have the power and authority to unleash nuclear war in fact

5223
05:16:02,687 --> 05:16:06,015
Things go wrong in the near future have the responsibility to unleash it

5224
05:16:07,295 --> 05:16:08,319
Kennedy and Khrushchev

5225
05:16:08,831 --> 05:16:10,111
I'd like to be in their shoes

5226
05:16:11,135 --> 05:16:14,463
I mean a sociopath might like the idea of having nuclear weapons and

5227
05:16:14,719 --> 05:16:15,999
All that that entails

5228
05:16:16,767 --> 05:16:19,839
But that's not the kind of thing most people look forward to having to use

5229
05:16:20,607 --> 05:16:23,423
It creates a huge amount of stress as you might imagine

5230
05:16:23,935 --> 05:16:27,263
Anyone running for high office especially the place like the United States

5231
05:16:28,543 --> 05:16:34,687
As a sort of implied promise that they can get the job done and understanding that the job of being the president is going

5232
05:16:34,943 --> 05:16:38,015
Going to require decisions on your part that will get people killed

5233
05:16:38,783 --> 05:16:39,551
It's unavoidable

5234
05:16:40,575 --> 05:16:45,951
I'm killing bad guys for example of terrorists and those sorts of things there's a lot of people that could sleep very well at night

5235
05:16:46,207 --> 05:16:52,095
It without and their resume so no problem there becomes a different situation when you're thinking that maybe in the next week you're going to have to

5236
05:16:52,863 --> 05:16:58,495
Issue orders that would fry millions and millions of non-combatants and women and children and old people

5237
05:16:58,751 --> 05:17:02,591
And even animals and poison the earth I mean there's a lot into these decisions

5238
05:17:04,383 --> 05:17:07,967
A lot for one human being to have for the society to handle

5239
05:17:08,223 --> 05:17:10,015
Because we discussed earlier

5240
05:17:10,783 --> 05:17:13,855
This is not a power that was seen to be something

5241
05:17:14,111 --> 05:17:17,695
The because of the way that technology worked could be in groupthink decision

5242
05:17:18,207 --> 05:17:20,767
Was something that had to be made by a single individual

5243
05:17:21,023 --> 05:17:22,559
Who can handle that power

5244
05:17:23,839 --> 05:17:27,935
And I don't even mean in a non trustworthy since we're going to Nuke people like some

5245
05:17:28,191 --> 05:17:29,983
Terrible tyrant devold

5246
05:17:30,239 --> 05:17:31,775
The more the stress level

5247
05:17:33,567 --> 05:17:35,359
And if you get lucky

5248
05:17:35,871 --> 05:17:38,943
With the people that you have there at any particular time

5249
05:17:39,455 --> 05:17:43,807
What makes you think that over the Long Haul you're going to continue to be lucky

5250
05:17:44,831 --> 05:17:50,207
This is Bertrand Russell's comment about Walking the Tightrope for a couple hundred years

5251
05:17:50,975 --> 05:17:55,583
Truman did Eisenhower did it for two terms and now in 1962 at the end of the year

5252
05:17:55,839 --> 05:17:57,375
It is starting to look like

5253
05:17:57,887 --> 05:18:00,447
The person walking across that tightrope

5254
05:18:00,703 --> 05:18:01,727
Is going to fall

5255
05:18:03,007 --> 05:18:05,311
How do you like to be the person that had to push the button

5256
05:18:06,079 --> 05:18:06,591
Is that happen

5257
05:18:08,895 --> 05:18:14,271
And there's a part of me that likes to imagine that this is like the ultimate Fail-Safe mechanism in the system

5258
05:18:15,295 --> 05:18:18,879
Those last human beings who actually have to do the equivalent of pushing the button

5259
05:18:19,647 --> 05:18:21,695
Maybe the last minute thing rebell

5260
05:18:22,207 --> 05:18:27,327
And they say I won't do it I won't destroy humankind and it becomes the wonderful end of the movie where everyone go see

5261
05:18:27,583 --> 05:18:30,655
She'd probably couldn't handle that but the humanity one out

5262
05:18:33,471 --> 05:18:34,751
A human version of that

5263
05:18:35,007 --> 05:18:37,055
Red button not connected to anything

5264
05:18:37,567 --> 05:18:38,847
Herman Kahn mentioned

5265
05:18:40,639 --> 05:18:41,919
Problem is

5266
05:18:42,175 --> 05:18:45,503
Most of these situations by the time they get as far as

5267
05:18:46,015 --> 05:18:49,087
You would have to get before people were thinking about pushing the button

5268
05:18:49,599 --> 05:18:54,207
Are out of people's controls by that time that's what the Barbara tuchman World War 1 book is about

5269
05:18:55,487 --> 05:18:57,023
And that's what begins to happen

5270
05:18:57,535 --> 05:18:58,815
In The Story 2

5271
05:19:00,095 --> 05:19:01,375
Because after cruise ship pulls the

5272
05:19:02,143 --> 05:19:06,239
Chips back in the quarantine continues work on those mistletoe that are already on the island

5273
05:19:07,263 --> 05:19:13,407
They start writing letters to each other Khrushchev and Kennedy it actually starts on the 23rd but they continue on and they're fascinating

5274
05:19:13,919 --> 05:19:17,759
We can watch the tone change with the ebb and flow of the crisis

5275
05:19:20,063 --> 05:19:21,599
And at the stress level

5276
05:19:22,367 --> 05:19:23,903
An alert statuses

5277
05:19:24,671 --> 05:19:27,743
And progress toward an invasion of Cuba Maybe

5278
05:19:28,255 --> 05:19:29,023
Ratchets up

5279
05:19:29,279 --> 05:19:31,327
You begin to see both these politicians

5280
05:19:31,839 --> 05:19:34,143
Trying to find a way out

5281
05:19:36,959 --> 05:19:38,239
Both of them are seen

5282
05:19:38,495 --> 05:19:43,103
Their option constrained now the door to getting out of this mess is closing

5283
05:19:44,895 --> 05:19:47,455
And their ability to control the situation

5284
05:19:47,967 --> 05:19:49,247
Slipping out of their hands

5285
05:19:53,087 --> 05:19:54,367
By October 25th

5286
05:19:54,879 --> 05:19:55,647
The day after the

5287
05:19:55,903 --> 05:19:58,463
Non face off at the quarantine line

5288
05:19:58,719 --> 05:20:03,327
Cruise ship is getting all sorts of information that makes him think an invasion of Cuba is imminent

5289
05:20:04,863 --> 05:20:09,983
The president of the United States have this clock going off cuz the missiles are continually being worked on in the pressure caused by that

5290
05:20:10,751 --> 05:20:14,847
Khrushchev got his own clock and invasion of Cuba is imminent what you going to do about that

5291
05:20:16,127 --> 05:20:17,151
He know something

5292
05:20:17,407 --> 05:20:22,271
But not only does Kennedy not know but no one in the west knew until the Soviet Union fell

5293
05:20:22,783 --> 05:20:26,367
And it's record could be made available to historians in the early 1990s

5294
05:20:26,623 --> 05:20:30,463
Khrushchev knew that they were Battlefield nuclear weapons operational

5295
05:20:30,975 --> 05:20:31,743
On Cuba

5296
05:20:32,767 --> 05:20:35,071
Put in place to destroy any Landing

5297
05:20:35,327 --> 05:20:39,679
Imagine like the D-Day Landings of the second world war if the Defenders had nukes

5298
05:20:40,447 --> 05:20:46,079
That are small each one about the size I read 60% of the power of the Hiroshima bomb or something like that

5299
05:20:46,335 --> 05:20:47,615
But they have several of them

5300
05:20:48,639 --> 05:20:49,919
Imagine the Carnage

5301
05:20:50,431 --> 05:20:51,967
Something like that would have created

5302
05:20:52,223 --> 05:20:56,831
And how do you back out of that problem and avoid World War 3 if it goes that route

5303
05:20:58,111 --> 05:20:59,647
The Persian Kennedy begin

5304
05:20:59,903 --> 05:21:02,463
The. In the Cuban Missile Crisis I like to call

5305
05:21:02,719 --> 05:21:04,767
The haggling holding a hand grenade.

5306
05:21:05,791 --> 05:21:09,375
Cuz both of these guys have to get a deal together

5307
05:21:09,631 --> 05:21:12,959
Before the forces driving them toward nuclear war

5308
05:21:13,471 --> 05:21:14,495
Become Unstoppable

5309
05:21:16,287 --> 05:21:17,567
On October 26th

5310
05:21:18,079 --> 05:21:19,871
Kennedy receives a note from cruise ship

5311
05:21:21,151 --> 05:21:22,431
The Sims 2 propose

5312
05:21:23,199 --> 05:21:24,991
A way out of this crisis

5313
05:21:25,247 --> 05:21:28,063
Some historians have suggested this was a desperate note

5314
05:21:28,319 --> 05:21:29,599
RIT nervously

5315
05:21:30,111 --> 05:21:31,135
But not everyone agrees with

5316
05:21:31,647 --> 05:21:32,927
It's clear though

5317
05:21:33,183 --> 05:21:36,511
The true Chef thinks today Invasion cube is coming

5318
05:21:36,767 --> 05:21:39,327
He worries that the military has taken over

5319
05:21:39,583 --> 05:21:40,863
From JFK

5320
05:21:42,143 --> 05:21:44,191
And so he offers a compromise on Cuba

5321
05:21:45,215 --> 05:21:48,799
It makes the case that the only reason the weapons were put in Cuba in the first place

5322
05:21:49,055 --> 05:21:51,103
Used to deter us invasion

5323
05:21:51,359 --> 05:21:52,895
Is it you've already invaded once

5324
05:21:53,151 --> 05:21:54,175
That was the Bay of Pigs

5325
05:21:54,431 --> 05:21:56,991
He says your CIA is constantly harassing

5326
05:21:57,247 --> 05:22:01,087
And causing problems over there that's called operation Mongoose and he's right about that

5327
05:22:01,855 --> 05:22:07,231
He says if you would publicly Proclaim that you won't support any more of that you won't invade the item will take the missiles out

5328
05:22:10,303 --> 05:22:13,119
Then you write about the blockade in the ongoing crisis

5329
05:22:13,375 --> 05:22:16,959
He says to Kennedy in famous language quote

5330
05:22:17,215 --> 05:22:23,359
If you have done this is the first step toward unleashing War well then evidently nothing remains for us to Dubai

5331
05:22:23,615 --> 05:22:25,151
But you accept this challenge of yours

5332
05:22:25,407 --> 05:22:27,455
What if you've not lost command of yourself

5333
05:22:27,711 --> 05:22:31,551
I realize clearly what this could lead to then mr. president

5334
05:22:31,807 --> 05:22:34,367
You and I should not now pull on the ends of the Rope

5335
05:22:34,623 --> 05:22:36,415
And what you have tied the knot of War

5336
05:22:36,927 --> 05:22:40,255
Because the harder you when I pull the tighter than that will become

5337
05:22:40,767 --> 05:22:43,327
And a time may come when it's not as tied so tight

5338
05:22:43,583 --> 05:22:46,655
That the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying

5339
05:22:47,423 --> 05:22:48,959
And then the knot will have to be cut

5340
05:22:49,727 --> 05:22:52,287
What that would mean I need not explain to you

5341
05:22:52,543 --> 05:22:56,639
Because you yourself understand perfectly what dread forces are two countries possess

5342
05:22:57,919 --> 05:22:58,687
Therefore

5343
05:22:58,943 --> 05:22:59,455
He writes

5344
05:22:59,711 --> 05:23:02,015
If there is no intention of tightening this not

5345
05:23:02,271 --> 05:23:06,367
Thereby dooming the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war

5346
05:23:06,623 --> 05:23:09,951
Let us not only relax the forces straining on the ends of the Rope

5347
05:23:10,207 --> 05:23:12,255
Let us take measures for untying the knot

5348
05:23:12,767 --> 05:23:13,535
We are agreeable

5349
05:23:14,047 --> 05:23:14,559
This

5350
05:23:15,327 --> 05:23:15,839
And quote

5351
05:23:20,703 --> 05:23:24,543
So in the early evening of October 26th 1960

5352
05:23:24,799 --> 05:23:25,311
C2

5353
05:23:26,591 --> 05:23:27,359
The first

5354
05:23:27,615 --> 05:23:29,407
Ray of Hope appears

5355
05:23:30,687 --> 05:23:32,479
Right before time Runs Out

5356
05:23:36,063 --> 05:23:37,599
Chinese military advisors

5357
05:23:37,855 --> 05:23:42,719
Do not trust kruschev they think this is a ploy to gain more time to get his missiles operational

5358
05:23:43,999 --> 05:23:46,047
I must remember the Kennedy has misjudged

5359
05:23:46,815 --> 05:23:50,655
The Soviets in the past and these other people have been right so if you're Kennedy

5360
05:23:51,167 --> 05:23:53,471
You must think to yourself maybe I'm wrong again

5361
05:23:54,751 --> 05:23:56,031
At the same time

5362
05:23:56,543 --> 05:23:59,871
If we look at it in a certain way Kennedy had just received

5363
05:24:00,383 --> 05:24:01,663
A personal letter

5364
05:24:02,943 --> 05:24:05,247
An emotional letter some people describe it

5365
05:24:06,015 --> 05:24:09,599
I'm the only other person who is actually in the same position he's in

5366
05:24:11,647 --> 05:24:13,439
You can be the closest advisor

5367
05:24:13,695 --> 05:24:14,463
To the person

5368
05:24:14,719 --> 05:24:17,535
Who actually has to push the button and it's not the same thing

5369
05:24:18,303 --> 05:24:21,119
Cruise ship understand through Kennedy's dealing with and vice versa

5370
05:24:21,887 --> 05:24:24,959
Neither man it looks like wanted to have to do this

5371
05:24:25,727 --> 05:24:30,847
The only way to stop this is by going to the other person who also doesn't want to do this and say

5372
05:24:31,615 --> 05:24:34,431
And what if I do this can we can we call this off

5373
05:24:37,247 --> 05:24:43,391
It must have been a certain mental sense of relief where Kennedy saw this is heaven. Maybe not time that's the problem and you seen the X

5374
05:24:43,647 --> 05:24:46,463
Come take the Kennedys trying to get this done with move it along with

5375
05:24:46,975 --> 05:24:52,351
On the morning of October 27th 1962 Saturday October 27 1962

5376
05:24:54,143 --> 05:24:56,447
Kennedy and his advisers will get together to discuss

5377
05:24:57,215 --> 05:24:57,727
That

5378
05:24:57,983 --> 05:25:04,127
Letter in the ramifications it can we get this deal done where we say we want to talk to you by and they get the missiles out these missiles that they haven't

5379
05:25:04,383 --> 05:25:05,919
But even publicly acknowledge your there

5380
05:25:07,711 --> 05:25:09,503
And then everything begins to go wrong

5381
05:25:10,783 --> 05:25:12,575
Which is why they call this day

5382
05:25:13,087 --> 05:25:13,855
Black Saturday

5383
05:25:16,415 --> 05:25:17,951
Black Saturday starts

5384
05:25:18,464 --> 05:25:21,792
With a press report that added to Kennedy in the morning as he

5385
05:25:22,048 --> 05:25:24,352
Discussing last night's letter from Khrushchev

5386
05:25:24,864 --> 05:25:28,192
This is a public statement by cruise ship like on the radio kind of thing

5387
05:25:28,960 --> 05:25:30,496
Renounces to the world

5388
05:25:30,752 --> 05:25:36,384
The way out of the Cuban Missile Crisis and instead of acts like The olive-branch Peacemaker type

5389
05:25:37,920 --> 05:25:42,016
But the way out is not the same deal he offered Kennedy the night before

5390
05:25:43,296 --> 05:25:47,136
Is way out is a much more difficult deal for Kennedy to do

5391
05:25:47,392 --> 05:25:48,672
Cruise ship tell the world

5392
05:25:49,184 --> 05:25:50,208
It will take those

5393
05:25:50,464 --> 05:25:56,608
I don't think you said missiles cuz they still haven't publicly knowledge but he basically says problem with will be removed from

5394
05:25:56,864 --> 05:26:03,008
Cuba if they pledged not to invade Cuba and if they get their own missiles out of turkey with your as close to us as Cuba

5395
05:26:03,264 --> 05:26:04,288
What is the United States

5396
05:26:04,544 --> 05:26:05,056
Boom

5397
05:26:06,848 --> 05:26:08,384
There's no better example of that old

5398
05:26:08,640 --> 05:26:09,664
Add eggs at the light

5399
05:26:09,920 --> 05:26:12,480
At the end of the tunnel was instead an oncoming train

5400
05:26:13,504 --> 05:26:17,856
Get the bottom drops out of everything here is Kennedy can't do that he certainly can't do that

5401
05:26:18,112 --> 05:26:21,184
Before the timeline for airstrikes or Invasion Runs Out

5402
05:26:23,744 --> 05:26:26,304
The reasons why he can't do it though

5403
05:26:27,072 --> 05:26:29,376
Are the sorts of things that those people

5404
05:26:29,888 --> 05:26:36,032
Like those scientist we talk about now that we have nuclear weapons we have to have a one world government so you don't have multiple

5405
05:26:36,288 --> 05:26:36,800
Governments

5406
05:26:37,056 --> 05:26:39,616
Interacting with each other in these Dynamics

5407
05:26:39,872 --> 05:26:41,664
This is what they're talking about because

5408
05:26:41,920 --> 05:26:42,688
Cannabis

5409
05:26:42,944 --> 05:26:43,456
Fine

5410
05:26:43,712 --> 05:26:45,504
With Cruces public proposal

5411
05:26:45,760 --> 05:26:51,904
He wanted to get these missiles that Khrushchev says You must remove these missiles from Turkey he wanted them out before this crisis even app

5412
05:26:52,160 --> 05:26:52,928
Obsolete

5413
05:26:53,696 --> 05:26:55,744
They just cause trouble to get he wanted them out

5414
05:26:56,768 --> 05:26:58,816
But now that Russia has made it part of the deal

5415
05:26:59,328 --> 05:27:01,120
Kennedy can't accept it

5416
05:27:01,376 --> 05:27:02,656
Without looking weak

5417
05:27:03,680 --> 05:27:08,288
Without looking like he's kind of willing to sell out the security of his European allies

5418
05:27:08,544 --> 05:27:10,592
To buy him some security in the Americas

5419
05:27:11,360 --> 05:27:13,664
Looking like he is rewarding

5420
05:27:13,920 --> 05:27:20,064
This move by Khrushchev to place missiles 90 miles off the US Coast and movies been vilified

5421
05:27:20,320 --> 05:27:22,368
Find the United Nations for more than a week

5422
05:27:23,392 --> 05:27:25,696
He's trapped by geopolitical Dynamics

5423
05:27:25,952 --> 05:27:28,512
Pharaohs of Egypt would have understood

5424
05:27:30,048 --> 05:27:33,120
The game is the same game it's always been

5425
05:27:34,400 --> 05:27:35,936
But the consequences

5426
05:27:36,192 --> 05:27:38,496
I'm making a wrong move in the game now

5427
05:27:38,752 --> 05:27:41,568
Are exponentially greater than anyone's ever dealt with before

5428
05:27:42,080 --> 05:27:43,360
And that's what's changed everything

5429
05:27:43,872 --> 05:27:44,640
Kennedy's Trapt

5430
05:27:44,896 --> 05:27:46,176
Because he's playing a new game

5431
05:27:46,432 --> 05:27:47,456
By the old rules

5432
05:27:49,248 --> 05:27:53,600
But what is that keeps you from being able to stop thermonuclear war from breaking out

5433
05:27:56,928 --> 05:28:03,072
And once again every time you think you can't get any more pressure right how much can the people at the center the story handle

5434
05:28:03,840 --> 05:28:05,376
All day long you going to get more

5435
05:28:06,144 --> 05:28:11,520
On the first three things in the morning at the CIA telling the president we think those are medium-range Ali some of the missile

5436
05:28:12,032 --> 05:28:14,592
Sites are now operational on Cuba boom

5437
05:28:14,848 --> 05:28:16,128
Have you waited too long

5438
05:28:16,896 --> 05:28:20,736
There's another piece of ammunition for the military Hawks to use against you in arguments

5439
05:28:21,248 --> 05:28:22,016
And then

5440
05:28:22,784 --> 05:28:28,672
The military's and both sides having rubbed up against each other all over the world on high alert for days now

5441
05:28:28,928 --> 05:28:30,208
Spark start flying

5442
05:28:32,000 --> 05:28:37,120
A situation as combustible and explosive is the one you're already dealing with

5443
05:28:37,632 --> 05:28:38,912
It would appear to be fatal

5444
05:28:41,472 --> 05:28:47,616
There are naval incident involving Soviet submarines at the US Navy's chasing around Cuba they don't know that those submarines

5445
05:28:47,872 --> 05:28:49,408
Have nuclear Torpedoes by the way

5446
05:28:51,968 --> 05:28:57,856
There's a U-2 reconnaissance plane up in the North Pole in the Arctic that gets off course and Strays over Soviet airspace

5447
05:28:58,368 --> 05:29:00,160
Soviet send fighters to deal with it

5448
05:29:00,416 --> 05:29:01,440
United States up in

5449
05:29:01,696 --> 05:29:04,256
That territory up there since fighter to deal with them with

5450
05:29:04,512 --> 05:29:05,536
Missiles armed

5451
05:29:05,792 --> 05:29:07,072
With nuclear weapons

5452
05:29:09,376 --> 05:29:15,008
Over to buy there will be a low-level reconnaissance flight of planes that is hit with anti-aircraft gun fire

5453
05:29:15,264 --> 05:29:21,408
More ominously a U2 flying over Cuba to keep tabs on those missiles that the US absolutely has to do

5454
05:29:21,664 --> 05:29:22,176
Do

5455
05:29:22,432 --> 05:29:24,736
Is shot down by a surface-to-air missile us and bat

5456
05:29:25,504 --> 05:29:26,272
And the pylons kill

5457
05:29:28,064 --> 05:29:30,112
Now you have blood in the situation

5458
05:29:30,880 --> 05:29:31,648
Not just that

5459
05:29:32,416 --> 05:29:33,696
In order to sort of

5460
05:29:33,952 --> 05:29:40,096
Keep the military Hawks at Bay several days ago Kennedy

5461
05:29:40,352 --> 05:29:41,376
We will act don't worry

5462
05:29:41,632 --> 05:29:47,776
And one of the lines in the sand why did they shoot down a U-2 plane with a surface-to-air missile we will go take out those

5463
05:29:48,032 --> 05:29:48,800
Surface-to-air missiles

5464
05:29:49,056 --> 05:29:51,872
Now the military said guess what just happened what are you going to do about it

5465
05:29:54,432 --> 05:30:00,576
The president's brother Robert was at these meetings and with him in private talks all during this time with right that at this moment

5466
05:30:01,856 --> 05:30:03,904
Crisis was at this stage he felt

5467
05:30:04,160 --> 05:30:04,928
That quote

5468
05:30:05,696 --> 05:30:06,976
The Noose was tightening

5469
05:30:07,232 --> 05:30:08,000
On all of us

5470
05:30:08,256 --> 05:30:10,560
Non-americans on mankind

5471
05:30:10,816 --> 05:30:12,864
And at the bridges to escape were crumbling

5472
05:30:14,144 --> 05:30:14,656
And quote

5473
05:30:16,704 --> 05:30:18,240
The bridges to escape

5474
05:30:18,496 --> 05:30:19,008
Crumbling

5475
05:30:20,800 --> 05:30:21,824
Kennedy would say

5476
05:30:23,104 --> 05:30:24,128
A couple of days

5477
05:30:24,896 --> 05:30:25,920
But at this point

5478
05:30:26,688 --> 05:30:27,456
There was a

5479
05:30:28,480 --> 05:30:30,272
Schedule for Cuba

5480
05:30:31,808 --> 05:30:34,624
To start with bombing raids hundreds of them

5481
05:30:35,136 --> 05:30:36,672
Set for Monday or Tuesday

5482
05:30:36,928 --> 05:30:38,208
Remember it's Saturday

5483
05:30:41,280 --> 05:30:45,632
His own advisers can't make up their mind what to do in the current situation

5484
05:30:46,656 --> 05:30:49,216
Joe Kennedy will famously send his brother Robert

5485
05:30:49,728 --> 05:30:52,032
As a back-channel negotiator

5486
05:30:53,568 --> 05:30:54,848
Without telling anyone

5487
05:30:55,104 --> 05:30:56,128
Robert will go

5488
05:30:56,640 --> 05:30:59,456
In Washington DC to the Soviet ambassador

5489
05:30:59,968 --> 05:31:06,112
You gone to the Soviet Ambassador few days before during this crisis but was his normal combative feisty self

5490
05:31:07,136 --> 05:31:07,904
This time

5491
05:31:08,160 --> 05:31:10,464
The Soviet Ambassador says an entirely different man

5492
05:31:10,976 --> 05:31:11,744
What's in front of him

5493
05:31:13,792 --> 05:31:16,864
Basically trying to explain the plight his brother was in

5494
05:31:17,632 --> 05:31:18,144
And

5495
05:31:18,656 --> 05:31:21,216
I'm not sure plea it's fair to say pleading

5496
05:31:21,472 --> 05:31:23,776
But there was a desperation in all this

5497
05:31:24,544 --> 05:31:27,872
There are many descriptions from different people and Views none of them

5498
05:31:28,896 --> 05:31:30,432
Quite exactly the same

5499
05:31:30,688 --> 05:31:36,576
I like the one you should take with the most salt cuz it's from khrushchev's own Memoirs quoting his ambassador to Brennan

5500
05:31:37,088 --> 05:31:39,136
Who's having this conversation with Kennedy

5501
05:31:40,416 --> 05:31:41,696
Intrusive rights quote

5502
05:31:43,232 --> 05:31:45,024
Robert Kennedy looked exhausted

5503
05:31:45,280 --> 05:31:48,096
One could see from his eyes that he had not slept for days

5504
05:31:48,352 --> 05:31:51,680
DM self said that he had not been home for 6 days and nights

5505
05:31:52,192 --> 05:31:56,800
The president is in the grave situation Robert Kennedy said they say he said

5506
05:31:57,056 --> 05:31:58,848
He does not know how to get out of it

5507
05:31:59,104 --> 05:32:00,896
We are under very severe stress

5508
05:32:01,152 --> 05:32:04,992
Impact under pressure from our military to use Force against Cuba

5509
05:32:05,248 --> 05:32:09,856
Probably at this very moment the president just sitting down to write a message to Chairman Khrushchev

5510
05:32:10,368 --> 05:32:11,392
We want to ask you

5511
05:32:11,648 --> 05:32:12,416
Mr. Brennan

5512
05:32:12,672 --> 05:32:17,024
The past President Kennedy's message to Chairman Khrushchev through unofficial channels

5513
05:32:17,792 --> 05:32:21,120
President Kennedy implores chairman Khrushchev to accept his offer

5514
05:32:21,376 --> 05:32:22,912
Had to take into consideration

5515
05:32:23,168 --> 05:32:25,472
The peculiarities of the American system

5516
05:32:25,728 --> 05:32:31,872
Even though the president himself is very much against starting a war over Cuba and irreversible chain of events could occur again

5517
05:32:32,128 --> 05:32:32,640
His will

5518
05:32:32,896 --> 05:32:37,248
That is why the president is appealing directly to Chairman Khrushchev for his help

5519
05:32:37,504 --> 05:32:38,784
A liquidating this conflict

5520
05:32:39,296 --> 05:32:45,440
If the situation continues much longer the president is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and see

5521
05:32:45,696 --> 05:32:46,208
Seize power

5522
05:32:46,464 --> 05:32:48,512
The American Army could get out of control

5523
05:32:52,096 --> 05:32:55,680
The publisher of my 1970 copy printed in Boston

5524
05:32:56,448 --> 05:33:02,592
Add a footnote inserted right there to point out that this was obviously a misunderstanding that the Soviet leader had about the American system without

5525
05:33:04,128 --> 05:33:09,248
But truthfully you wouldn't have had to have like a military takeover of the government to achieve

5526
05:33:09,504 --> 05:33:12,832
Basically with the Joint Chiefs wanted which they were unanimously opposed

5527
05:33:13,088 --> 05:33:16,672
To the president's approach on this in order to get their way if they had gone

5528
05:33:16,928 --> 05:33:21,536
To the president's opposition in Congress are example and told them that they were unanimous that he was

5529
05:33:21,792 --> 05:33:27,936
Absolutely taking into the country to existential danger in Daily debt to the US media it would be like a giant veto over

5530
05:33:28,192 --> 05:33:29,984
The president's policy public opinion would have

5531
05:33:30,240 --> 05:33:31,008
Fortune

5532
05:33:31,264 --> 05:33:32,288
Into a different route

5533
05:33:33,568 --> 05:33:34,848
And if they had gone that route

5534
05:33:35,104 --> 05:33:36,640
It would have been simply because

5535
05:33:36,896 --> 05:33:41,248
They the experts unanimously talking amongst themselves who decided that the president

5536
05:33:41,504 --> 05:33:43,296
I'd literally put the country in terrible Danger

5537
05:33:46,368 --> 05:33:50,208
And by the way while most histories portray Kennedy is this wise

5538
05:33:50,464 --> 05:33:56,608
Sage guy that save the world in the situation by pushing back against at times unanimous counter opinion

5539
05:33:57,376 --> 05:34:00,448
There are other views I mean historian Garry Wills

5540
05:34:00,704 --> 05:34:03,520
Savages him essentially accusing him

5541
05:34:03,776 --> 05:34:08,896
Of being the one who was responsible for this Timebomb situation to begin with

5542
05:34:09,152 --> 05:34:13,504
The fact that he got you out of it means little since he's the one who set the bomb and

5543
05:34:13,760 --> 05:34:17,344
Wills Point South if you want to give anybody credit for this give it to crucia

5544
05:34:18,112 --> 05:34:20,928
Is the guy willing to suck up the humiliation here

5545
05:34:21,184 --> 05:34:27,328
So that we don't have nuclear war and go home with his tail between his legs and not tell anybody that he actually got the missiles out of church

5546
05:34:27,584 --> 05:34:30,144
Turkey that were threatening my citizens he can't even claim

5547
05:34:30,400 --> 05:34:31,168
Credit for that

5548
05:34:32,448 --> 05:34:33,472
More hard-headed

5549
05:34:34,496 --> 05:34:40,640
Other historians will use that same right now by saying what you really mean to say is Khrushchev was completely outgunned in

5550
05:34:41,152 --> 05:34:46,016
By this time the US military would have crushed him especially in that part of the world choice but to back down

5551
05:34:48,320 --> 05:34:51,904
Regardless it's hard not to look at the two individuals in this crisis

5552
05:34:52,416 --> 05:34:57,024
Khrushchev and Kennedy and think regardless of the role they may have played in getting us to here

5553
05:34:57,536 --> 05:34:58,560
Once they did

5554
05:34:59,072 --> 05:35:01,376
They took the most cautious route

5555
05:35:01,632 --> 05:35:02,144
Out

5556
05:35:04,192 --> 05:35:06,240
One of the historians I was reading a great way

5557
05:35:06,496 --> 05:35:08,288
A framing ahead said

5558
05:35:08,544 --> 05:35:12,128
If this was a gaming scenario and you could run it a hundred times

5559
05:35:12,384 --> 05:35:18,528
How many times would it turn out that you would have nuclear war how many times would it turn out that maybe we forget about

5560
05:35:18,784 --> 05:35:21,600
This is Kennedy and listen to his military advisers

5561
05:35:21,856 --> 05:35:25,440
Cruise ship with a back down and invasion of Cuba somehow would have happened

5562
05:35:25,696 --> 05:35:29,536
And the Cubans been freed and Castro

5563
05:35:29,792 --> 05:35:31,840
A bunch of scenarios where it can go

5564
05:35:33,120 --> 05:35:36,704
But if you are going to the casino to put your bets on something

5565
05:35:36,960 --> 05:35:43,104
And the best case scenario is you could win a fortune the worst case scenario is if that little ball on the roulette wheel and

5566
05:35:43,360 --> 05:35:47,968
The wrong spot my goons take you out the back and shoot you in the head do you even play that game

5567
05:35:48,736 --> 05:35:54,880
Or do you just play as cautiously as you can so I can listen I know this is not a strategy that's going to get me win per se but the worst case scenario

5568
05:35:55,136 --> 05:35:56,928
So bad I'll be happy if I can just avoid

5569
05:35:57,184 --> 05:35:57,696
That

5570
05:36:00,768 --> 05:36:02,816
Increase Shakira's from his ambassador

5571
05:36:03,328 --> 05:36:08,960
Basically that the u.s. government will get those missiles out of turkey but they'll do it quietly but that you can have a deal he's all over

5572
05:36:09,216 --> 05:36:12,288
Because he was thinking he wasn't going to get a deal that good anyway

5573
05:36:12,544 --> 05:36:18,688
He's a little bit worried about letting Kennedy know he accept the deal before this Cuban Invasion happens that's how close we are

5574
05:36:18,944 --> 05:36:21,760
So instead of spending a half day getting letter to him

5575
05:36:22,016 --> 05:36:26,624
Eagles right on Radio Moscow on four planes were in accepting the deal and

5576
05:36:27,136 --> 05:36:27,904
He keeps quiet

5577
05:36:28,160 --> 05:36:28,672
Part 2

5578
05:36:28,928 --> 05:36:35,072
You needed to be kept quiet right through the system that we have here of interaction between nation-states work

5579
05:36:35,328 --> 05:36:36,608
Choirs that certain things

5580
05:36:37,120 --> 05:36:39,680
Be done in ways that help people save face

5581
05:36:39,936 --> 05:36:41,728
And preserve their political

5582
05:36:41,984 --> 05:36:43,776
Opportunities and whatnot

5583
05:36:44,544 --> 05:36:46,080
Khrushchev understands this

5584
05:36:47,872 --> 05:36:48,896
Accept the terms

5585
05:36:49,152 --> 05:36:51,200
And from this moment on

5586
05:36:51,456 --> 05:36:52,992
The tension begins to draw

5587
05:36:55,040 --> 05:37:01,184
And Kennedy said just a couple of days later he feels like a new man I mean I had a airstrikes ready to begin Tuesday mean

5588
05:37:01,440 --> 05:37:02,720
They know how narrowly

5589
05:37:03,232 --> 05:37:04,512
They dodged a bullet here

5590
05:37:05,280 --> 05:37:05,792
And

5591
05:37:06,304 --> 05:37:07,328
Worth noting

5592
05:37:07,584 --> 05:37:11,168
And when he went a few days later that's according to a biographer Robert dallek

5593
05:37:11,680 --> 05:37:13,728
To congratulate and thank

5594
05:37:13,984 --> 05:37:16,544
The Joint Chiefs of Staff the heads of all the military

5595
05:37:16,800 --> 05:37:20,128
Entities in the country on on their help during the crisis

5596
05:37:20,384 --> 05:37:21,408
They were mad

5597
05:37:22,432 --> 05:37:24,992
Admiral Anderson said to him that we've been had

5598
05:37:26,016 --> 05:37:32,160
The essential point was that this too is a stalling thing who who the heck thinks the Soviets were going to get the missiles out of there even

5599
05:37:32,416 --> 05:37:32,928
Now

5600
05:37:33,184 --> 05:37:37,536
General Lemay for the Air Force called at the worst defeat in the country's history

5601
05:37:37,792 --> 05:37:39,584
And said we should still invade Cuba

5602
05:37:41,888 --> 05:37:44,448
Defense secretary Robert McNamara says

5603
05:37:44,704 --> 05:37:48,800
This reaction on the part of the Joint Chiefs of Staff left Kennedy quote

5604
05:37:49,056 --> 05:37:50,336
Absolutely shocked

5605
05:37:50,592 --> 05:37:52,128
And quote and quote

5606
05:37:52,384 --> 05:37:54,176
Stuttering in reply

5607
05:37:54,432 --> 05:37:54,944
And quote

5608
05:37:58,528 --> 05:37:59,552
In 13 months

5609
05:38:00,320 --> 05:38:01,344
Kennedy will be dad

5610
05:38:03,392 --> 05:38:03,904
And

5611
05:38:04,160 --> 05:38:06,976
The vast majority of theories

5612
05:38:07,744 --> 05:38:09,792
Concerning his death including the

5613
05:38:10,560 --> 05:38:12,608
Traditional dongzhimen Theory

5614
05:38:13,120 --> 05:38:16,704
All have very close connections to the island of Cuba

5615
05:38:19,008 --> 05:38:21,312
Khrushchev's loss of power that will be coming

5616
05:38:22,080 --> 05:38:24,896
Will also be connected to Cuba in this whole affair

5617
05:38:26,176 --> 05:38:27,712
Traditionally the idea

5618
05:38:28,224 --> 05:38:28,992
Was it his

5619
05:38:29,504 --> 05:38:35,392
Counterpart in the Soviet leadership considered him to be a reckless gambler but it's more complicated than that

5620
05:38:36,416 --> 05:38:37,952
Unless the only person

5621
05:38:38,976 --> 05:38:43,840
I would stick around despite hundreds of assassination attempts for decades

5622
05:38:44,608 --> 05:38:46,144
He just died recently

5623
05:38:47,168 --> 05:38:47,936
Fidel Castro

5624
05:38:49,984 --> 05:38:51,520
The histories are to be believed

5625
05:38:52,288 --> 05:38:53,056
Out of the

5626
05:38:53,824 --> 05:38:57,408
National leaders making decisions during the Cuban Missile Crisis

5627
05:38:58,688 --> 05:38:59,968
He was the most in favor

5628
05:39:00,480 --> 05:39:01,504
Of using nuclear weapon

5629
05:39:04,832 --> 05:39:06,880
Castro's views with mellow

5630
05:39:07,648 --> 05:39:08,672
With time

5631
05:39:09,184 --> 05:39:13,536
With the acquisition more Insider information about what was going on behind the scenes

5632
05:39:15,584 --> 05:39:16,096
But this

5633
05:39:17,120 --> 05:39:18,912
Cuban Missile Crisis

5634
05:39:19,680 --> 05:39:21,216
Is the best case study

5635
05:39:21,472 --> 05:39:22,752
That we've ever had

5636
05:39:23,264 --> 05:39:25,312
But what it's like when the Sword of Damocles

5637
05:39:25,824 --> 05:39:26,592
Begins to drop

5638
05:39:27,616 --> 05:39:30,432
17 years after the debut of nuclear weapons

5639
05:39:30,944 --> 05:39:32,480
It was a nuclear near Miss

5640
05:39:33,504 --> 05:39:35,040
There's a lot you can learn from that

5641
05:39:37,344 --> 05:39:39,904
American story Martin J Sherwin calls it

5642
05:39:40,416 --> 05:39:41,440
The biggest

5643
05:39:41,696 --> 05:39:42,976
Non-event

5644
05:39:43,232 --> 05:39:44,512
Of the 20th century

5645
05:39:45,280 --> 05:39:49,120
Which is interesting that we normally think of history in positive terms this was done

5646
05:39:49,376 --> 05:39:50,144
Happened

5647
05:39:50,656 --> 05:39:52,704
Sometimes the most important things

5648
05:39:52,960 --> 05:39:54,496
Are the things you avoid he right

5649
05:39:54,752 --> 05:39:55,264
Quote

5650
05:39:55,776 --> 05:39:58,848
In a century replete with unspeakable disasters

5651
05:39:59,104 --> 05:40:02,176
The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962

5652
05:40:02,432 --> 05:40:06,016
Came terrifyingly close to producing the greatest disaster of them all

5653
05:40:06,272 --> 05:40:07,296
Nuclear war

5654
05:40:07,552 --> 05:40:08,832
The final failure

5655
05:40:09,344 --> 05:40:11,392
The irony of this non-event

5656
05:40:11,648 --> 05:40:15,232
Is it a birding it was the most important event of the 20th century

5657
05:40:15,488 --> 05:40:17,536
So it is necessary both to learn how

5658
05:40:17,792 --> 05:40:18,560
And why

5659
05:40:18,816 --> 05:40:23,680
The United States and the Soviet Union nudged each other to the edge of the nuclear Abyss

5660
05:40:23,936 --> 05:40:28,032
And understand how a suicidal plunge over it was avoided

5661
05:40:28,800 --> 05:40:29,568
And quote

5662
05:40:31,616 --> 05:40:34,432
The lessons of the Cuban Missile Crisis are

5663
05:40:35,200 --> 05:40:35,968
Controversial

5664
05:40:36,224 --> 05:40:40,832
And argued about an often depend on one's political Viewpoint or what country you come

5665
05:40:42,880 --> 05:40:44,672
Definitely scared

5666
05:40:44,928 --> 05:40:49,792
The leaders of these countries I mean Kennedy and Khrushchev will both change their tune in a number of different ways

5667
05:40:50,304 --> 05:40:51,584
Kennedy will revive some

5668
05:40:51,840 --> 05:40:55,936
Ideas from the Eisenhower Administration that never had a real kick in the pants to be

5669
05:40:56,192 --> 05:40:59,520
Implemented you know what stock to get passed a whole lot of other problems well

5670
05:40:59,776 --> 05:41:01,824
A nuclear scare can all of a sudden

5671
05:41:02,080 --> 05:41:05,920
You move mountains in front of you and Kennedy and Khrushchev will start the process

5672
05:41:07,712 --> 05:41:09,760
A creation of a nuclear framework

5673
05:41:10,272 --> 05:41:12,320
Maybe you could call humankind's attempt

5674
05:41:12,832 --> 05:41:14,880
To adapt to their weapons technology

5675
05:41:15,136 --> 05:41:17,952
The Frameworks for limitations on testing

5676
05:41:20,512 --> 05:41:22,048
Safeguards put in place

5677
05:41:22,304 --> 05:41:25,888
To help ease the next crisis situation a hotline for example

5678
05:41:28,192 --> 05:41:30,240
And the beginnings of an understanding

5679
05:41:31,008 --> 05:41:32,800
That if you can

5680
05:41:33,312 --> 05:41:37,152
You should begin to put controls on these weapons so that they don't spread to everyone

5681
05:41:37,664 --> 05:41:40,480
Then you can begin talking about how to reduce the numbers of weapons

5682
05:41:40,992 --> 05:41:42,016
The two biggest

5683
05:41:42,272 --> 05:41:43,040
Holders

5684
05:41:43,296 --> 05:41:49,440
Having their stockpiles United States in the Soviet Union on that last front it will be a failure for quite some time

5685
05:41:49,696 --> 05:41:50,208
Time

5686
05:41:50,464 --> 05:41:51,488
And that also

5687
05:41:52,000 --> 05:41:55,584
Is as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis famously a Soviet Diplomat will

5688
05:41:55,840 --> 05:41:57,120
Sado in American

5689
05:41:57,376 --> 05:41:58,656
You got away with it this time

5690
05:41:59,168 --> 05:42:00,704
But you'll never get away with it again

5691
05:42:02,240 --> 05:42:04,800
The Soviets will race to produce

5692
05:42:05,312 --> 05:42:07,872
Enough intercontinental ballistic missiles

5693
05:42:08,384 --> 05:42:11,200
So that they are never on the short end of

5694
05:42:11,456 --> 05:42:13,504
That numerical disadvantage again

5695
05:42:14,528 --> 05:42:17,600
By the middle 1980s the Soviet Union will have more than 40

5696
05:42:18,624 --> 05:42:19,392
Nuclear weapon

5697
05:42:20,416 --> 05:42:21,952
In the United States somewhere

5698
05:42:22,464 --> 05:42:23,488
/ 30000

5699
05:42:24,512 --> 05:42:27,328
70000 + nuclear weapons

5700
05:42:28,096 --> 05:42:29,888
And that's just the two biggest power

5701
05:42:32,448 --> 05:42:33,728
And while adding

5702
05:42:34,240 --> 05:42:35,520
A hotline

5703
05:42:36,032 --> 05:42:39,104
It's going to help the next time there's a crisis situation

5704
05:42:39,872 --> 05:42:41,408
The one big safeguard

5705
05:42:41,920 --> 05:42:44,224
But nobody can figure out how to implement

5706
05:42:44,480 --> 05:42:46,016
It's still a glaring problem

5707
05:42:47,040 --> 05:42:52,672
The fact the responsibility for you still revolves around a single human being

5708
05:42:53,952 --> 05:42:54,976
Ronald Reagan Road

5709
05:42:55,744 --> 05:43:00,864
After his presidency that that was the big realization that really hit him right when he became president

5710
05:43:01,888 --> 05:43:03,680
That he and he alone

5711
05:43:03,936 --> 05:43:05,216
Control these weapons

5712
05:43:05,728 --> 05:43:10,592
And the amount of time he had to talk over decisions with people about using them

5713
05:43:10,848 --> 05:43:12,640
Was minuscule hero quote

5714
05:43:13,408 --> 05:43:16,480
The decision to launch the weapons was mine alone to make

5715
05:43:16,992 --> 05:43:22,880
We had many contingency plans for responding to a nuclear attack but everything would happen so fast

5716
05:43:23,136 --> 05:43:26,976
But I wonder how much planning a reason could be applied in such a crisis

5717
05:43:27,232 --> 05:43:29,280
The Russian sometimes kept submarines

5718
05:43:29,536 --> 05:43:30,816
Offer East Coast

5719
05:43:31,072 --> 05:43:36,704
Would nuclear missiles that could turn the White House into a pile of radioactive Rubble within 6 to 8 minutes

5720
05:43:37,216 --> 05:43:38,496
6 minutes

5721
05:43:38,752 --> 05:43:41,568
To decide how to respond to a blip on a radar scope

5722
05:43:41,824 --> 05:43:43,616
And decide whether to unleash Armageddon

5723
05:43:44,640 --> 05:43:47,456
How could anyone apply reason at a time like that

5724
05:43:48,224 --> 05:43:48,992
And quote

5725
05:43:50,784 --> 05:43:54,368
Reagan along with every other American president since Eisenhower

5726
05:43:54,880 --> 05:43:55,904
That's had a man

5727
05:43:56,416 --> 05:43:57,440
Following him

5728
05:43:57,952 --> 05:43:59,744
But she went from place to place

5729
05:44:00,512 --> 05:44:02,304
The man carries a briefcase

5730
05:44:03,072 --> 05:44:04,608
Inside the briefcase is something

5731
05:44:04,864 --> 05:44:06,400
Nicknamed the football

5732
05:44:07,424 --> 05:44:09,984
It's the nuclear codes for launching a nuclear attack

5733
05:44:11,264 --> 05:44:11,776
In fact

5734
05:44:12,288 --> 05:44:14,592
I've read that the person with the football

5735
05:44:14,848 --> 05:44:18,176
Is downstairs from the president while the president sleeps

5736
05:44:18,688 --> 05:44:21,504
And they time him routinely and regularly

5737
05:44:21,760 --> 05:44:23,552
To see how long it takes him

5738
05:44:23,808 --> 05:44:27,904
To get from the bottom of the stairs up into the Presidents Room so he can launch a nuclear attack

5739
05:44:28,416 --> 05:44:29,440
If necessary

5740
05:44:33,536 --> 05:44:36,096
The number of nuclear accidents

5741
05:44:36,352 --> 05:44:37,376
Is in the dozens

5742
05:44:39,424 --> 05:44:42,240
Those are called broken Arrow's by the United States

5743
05:44:43,520 --> 05:44:47,360
The number of false alarms and near-misses is

5744
05:44:48,128 --> 05:44:48,640
Scary

5745
05:44:49,152 --> 05:44:52,736
Since the Cuban Missile Crisis there been a couple particularly scary ones

5746
05:44:54,016 --> 05:44:55,296
Perhaps the scariest

5747
05:44:55,552 --> 05:44:59,136
Since the Cuban Missile Crisis but that's an opinion question

5748
05:44:59,648 --> 05:45:01,696
Is something known as the Norwegian rocket incident

5749
05:45:02,208 --> 05:45:07,072
What happened in 1995 that's 4 years after the Soviet Union fell

5750
05:45:07,840 --> 05:45:11,680
When a rocket launch, the Soviet Union off guard

5751
05:45:12,448 --> 05:45:13,984
And their higher-ups

5752
05:45:14,496 --> 05:45:15,008
Put

5753
05:45:15,264 --> 05:45:19,104
In front of Boris Yeltsin the leader of Russia at the time

5754
05:45:19,360 --> 05:45:21,664
Their version of the football opened it up

5755
05:45:22,176 --> 05:45:24,480
And ask him about the nuclear launch codes

5756
05:45:25,504 --> 05:45:31,392
Are those who remember Boris Yeltsin remember that he was known to enjoy happy hour from time to time

5757
05:45:32,160 --> 05:45:34,976
So maybe we can consider ourselves fortunate

5758
05:45:35,232 --> 05:45:37,792
That either he hadn't enjoyed it

5759
05:45:38,048 --> 05:45:38,560
Yet

5760
05:45:38,816 --> 05:45:40,608
Friendly with this decision

5761
05:45:40,864 --> 05:45:41,632
Or maybe

5762
05:45:43,936 --> 05:45:45,984
But he decided not to respond

5763
05:45:46,240 --> 05:45:48,800
Prompting the unusual thought in my mind

5764
05:45:49,312 --> 05:45:52,640
Did Boris Yeltsin just save the world in 1995

5765
05:45:53,920 --> 05:45:55,968
Followed by the scarier thought

5766
05:45:56,480 --> 05:45:59,296
How the hell is the world in Boris Yeltsin hands at all

5767
05:46:01,856 --> 05:46:02,880
Too many people

5768
05:46:03,392 --> 05:46:04,416
Alive today

5769
05:46:04,928 --> 05:46:08,256
Boris Yeltsin in that era is an age ago

5770
05:46:09,024 --> 05:46:10,304
People don't think about

5771
05:46:10,816 --> 05:46:16,960
Nuclear war between the great Powers very much anymore in fact they don't think about war between the great Powers much anymore

5772
05:46:17,472 --> 05:46:19,008
And your history would seem to indicate

5773
05:46:19,520 --> 05:46:21,824
It's the key danger we should worry about

5774
05:46:23,872 --> 05:46:25,664
The only thing that could really kill

5775
05:46:25,920 --> 05:46:28,736
A hundred or a hundred fifty million people

5776
05:46:28,992 --> 05:46:32,832
In the next couple of years is an asteroid hitting the planet

5777
05:46:33,344 --> 05:46:36,160
Or nuclear war between the great Powers what's more likely

5778
05:46:37,440 --> 05:46:38,464
Well it depends

5779
05:46:39,488 --> 05:46:41,280
A lot of people who argue

5780
05:46:41,792 --> 05:46:43,072
The nuclear weapons have kept

5781
05:46:43,328 --> 05:46:43,840
Peace

5782
05:46:44,096 --> 05:46:47,424
Since the second world war that the reason we didn't have World War 3

5783
05:46:47,680 --> 05:46:50,752
Is the fact that everybody realize what would happen if we did

5784
05:46:52,032 --> 05:46:55,104
There's a lot of argument about that and I'm not going to go

5785
05:46:55,360 --> 05:46:57,408
Into that subject but I would like to point out

5786
05:46:58,176 --> 05:46:59,968
But there are trip wires everywhere

5787
05:47:00,992 --> 05:47:02,016
And this idea

5788
05:47:02,272 --> 05:47:08,416
That a nuclear war between the great Powers as sort of a thing of the past ignores the fact that on the geopolitical three dimension

5789
05:47:08,672 --> 05:47:09,440
Chess board

5790
05:47:09,952 --> 05:47:13,792
That is currently in use by the great Powers nuclear weapons are everywhere

5791
05:47:15,840 --> 05:47:19,936
In fact just to name one potential Flashpoint in this doesn't involve any of it

5792
05:47:20,192 --> 05:47:22,496
Many other countries now that have nuclear weapons

5793
05:47:22,752 --> 05:47:26,592
But the United States is pledged to defend with nuclear weapons

5794
05:47:26,848 --> 05:47:28,384
More than 25 Nations

5795
05:47:28,640 --> 05:47:30,688
Any one of whom if they're attacked

5796
05:47:31,200 --> 05:47:33,248
Could lead to the same sort of dynamic

5797
05:47:33,760 --> 05:47:38,112
And the crisis situation and the pressure and the lack of options

5798
05:47:38,624 --> 05:47:39,904
The John F Kennedy

5799
05:47:40,160 --> 05:47:46,304
Nikita Khrushchev face in the Cuban Missile Crisis history did not teach you what the Right Moves In those circumstances RB

5800
05:47:46,560 --> 05:47:47,840
Because the variables always change

5801
05:47:48,864 --> 05:47:50,144
But it does teach you

5802
05:47:50,656 --> 05:47:54,240
But you will have far less control over the situation

5803
05:47:54,752 --> 05:47:57,056
And it appears that you will when you're looking at it

5804
05:47:58,336 --> 05:48:00,128
In a detached theoretical way

5805
05:48:01,408 --> 05:48:02,944
That's why they call it a crisis

5806
05:48:03,200 --> 05:48:03,712
Right

5807
05:48:05,248 --> 05:48:07,808
As I said human beings are 70 + years

5808
05:48:08,320 --> 05:48:10,368
Into an ongoing experiment

5809
05:48:10,624 --> 05:48:14,976
To see if they can adapt or evolve to handle their weapons technology

5810
05:48:16,256 --> 05:48:17,280
So far

5811
05:48:18,304 --> 05:48:18,816
So good

5812
05:48:20,096 --> 05:48:20,608
But let's

5813
05:48:20,864 --> 05:48:21,632
Remember

5814
05:48:21,888 --> 05:48:24,448
That we are a long way from the edge of this tightrope

5815
05:48:25,728 --> 05:48:27,520
These may not even be

5816
05:48:27,776 --> 05:48:29,312
The most powerful weapons

5817
05:48:29,824 --> 05:48:31,616
We are creative enough to invent

5818
05:48:33,920 --> 05:48:35,712
And the systems we have in place

5819
05:48:36,224 --> 05:48:36,992
Still have

5820
05:48:37,760 --> 05:48:39,296
Human beings involved

5821
05:48:40,320 --> 05:48:43,136
Which is one of those variables that makes it tough to think

5822
05:48:43,392 --> 05:48:44,416
That we can go

5823
05:48:44,928 --> 05:48:46,464
Whole another hundred

5824
05:48:46,720 --> 05:48:48,000
30 or so years

5825
05:48:48,512 --> 05:48:50,560
And have the human story and

5826
05:48:50,816 --> 05:48:51,840
With the words

5827
05:48:52,608 --> 05:48:53,632
And they lived happily

5828
05:48:54,144 --> 05:48:54,656
Ever After

5829
05:49:19,232 --> 05:49:24,352
For Hardcore History t-shirts or other merchandise to go to dancarlin.com
