EDL	00:00:14,336	00:00:16,128	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'm a notoriously bad
EDL	00:00:16,640	00:00:17,152	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Topic
EDL	00:00:18,176	00:00:21,760	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And I traditionally pick something that I think I can do much more quickly than
EDL	00:00:21,760	00:00:22,528	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Can
EDL	00:00:22,528	00:00:26,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And then when I get into the middle of it I feel compelled to do the topic Justice
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:29,696	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And we end up traditionally with a very long series of
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:30,208	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Shows
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,768	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What you're about to hear
EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:36,352	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the equivalent of like a double album
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:38,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Buy a music band or something
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:43,264	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We are essentially giving you Parts 3 and 4
EDL	00:00:43,264	00:00:47,360	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I would probably should have been realistically speaking a four-part series
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:48,896	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Achaemenid Persian Empire
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:52,224	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With an obvious focus on their Wars
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:53,760	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks in the makedonia
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:01:02,464	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you missed part one and two you probably want to catch those before you catch this one but there's so much military history in this way
EDL	00:01:02,464	00:01:05,280	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because I knew I'd be crucified if we didn't go into loving detail
EDL	00:01:06,048	00:01:07,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	About what
EDL	00:01:07,072	00:01:09,632	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To several of the best battles in ancient
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,400	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Military history
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:11,936	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So we do that
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:14,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Imma give you what
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:17,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is probably twice the length of what a good
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:20,128	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Hardcore History show should be
EDL	00:01:20,128	00:01:21,408	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Let it last
EDL	00:01:21,920	00:01:22,688	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And hopefully
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:29,344	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It doesn't become like one of those double albums I grew up with what you listen to it you think that they could have cut half that thing you just put up one really good single album
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The way I look at it
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:32,160	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is one of the Great
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:33,696	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's a small world history
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:40,864	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And if anything it probably merited more attention that I gave it but as I told you I'm a terrible topic
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And I'm always trying to recover
EDL	00:01:43,680	00:01:45,472	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	After I make my poor choice
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:47,008	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So without further ado
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:49,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Part 3 and really part
EDL	00:01:49,568	00:01:50,080	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	For also
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,384	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Final
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:55,712	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Summer series on the great Kings of the ancient achaemenid Persian Empire
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:56,480	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Kings of Kings
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:05,440	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	December 7th 1941
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:11,584	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A date which will live in infamy

EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:08,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Remember that we are not descended from fearful men
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:11,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Hardcore history
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:18,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Earlier we had posed
EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:18,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The question
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:21,216	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	About whether or not absolute
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:22,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Power corrupt and absolute
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,336	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,896	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Kind of world
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,176	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Most of us come from
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:33,504	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's sort of taken as a given that you don't want to trust app

EDL	00:03:34,272	00:03:34,784	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Power Brokers
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:36,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	History right
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:39,136	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But look at history
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the story of the
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,512	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Achaemenid Persian Empire
EDL	00:03:44,512	00:03:45,792	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you look at all the different key
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is what we're doing
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are a number of them that almost certainly had
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:53,472	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What amounted to Absolute
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:53,984	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Power
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,800	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And several of them
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,872	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To at least it didn't just not abused it
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:00,896	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Seem to
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Can almost be
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,992	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Prototype
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That you would want
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,040	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Can an absolute
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,552	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Monarch
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really two different kinds of product
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Have to because
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:16,000	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Founder of the achaemenid Persian Empire Cyrus the Great was like the warrior king
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,536	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	His version
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:23,679	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is Empires version of a kind of an Alexander the Great and probably the greatest conqueror before Alexander the Great social
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Prototype right King Arthur
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,567	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But then
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Did you get
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:32,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Psoriasis
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:35,455	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A king or two later and dries is like the gifted
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:38,527	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Administrator person who's a genius
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:39,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe at
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:42,367	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Organization and
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Structure and
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:49,535	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Handling things you know from a cost-benefit ratio I mean the Greek writer said his own people called him a shopkeeper
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Huckster is another name given sometimes
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,167	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Basically a shopkeeper as we said in the last
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	For the program
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:03,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At the shop is Walmart you have a shopkeeper your CEO and you said dries was like the CEO of Persia core because
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:07,455	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persia kind of seemed to almost have like a subcontractor relationship
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Aura
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,503	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Subsidiary

EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:14,623	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	3 person car with their various attributes and provinces
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:19,231	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Absolute power corrupts absolutely one would think that
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:20,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You wouldn't have a Cyrus the Great
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:24,095	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So you wouldn't have a dries and they wouldn't have done so well so
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Obviously there are exceptions to the rule
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:30,239	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But those kind of people don't come along every day in any society
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I mean often times
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:35,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The great Empires throughout history of managed to sustain themselves
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:38,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know with occasional great leadership how many great leaders
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You must you have show up
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:44,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Overture e 250 or 200 years to keep the empire in good Stead

EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:52,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Things are pretty stable you can have a Caligula
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nero no problem but if the barbarians have been smashing up the
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:59,679	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the borders of the Empire now for twenty or thirty years you better have
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,215	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A Diocletian and Hadrian
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,055	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	While the Persian Empire gets off to a really strong start
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Cyrus the Great
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:09,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	His son came by sea was probably better than the sources describe
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:16,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That weird maybe sort of Magi King lasted for 5 seconds and then to Rice a grain to make

EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:29,119	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But then about four or five years

EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,959	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We just talked about

EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:49,215	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Amongst the roughest practitioners
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But they held together
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,335	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A big Empire for a long time that
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:58,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persians have always been sort of
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Portrayed
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As an attempt to see if you can get away
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:05,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With leniency what do we say knife in you with leniency
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,695	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At least compared to the way the Assyrians ran the show
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,999	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And see if that made people more willing
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:16,351	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To live under the rule right of the Assyrian artwork was so horrific
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:21,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some of the experts think because they're trying to tell people this is what will happen to you
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:26,335	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you were about to try to get out of the Empire if you look at the Persian stuff that has survived
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:28,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There is no artwork like you Siri and stuff
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:34,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persians do not have any artwork or or lease or stone carving showing them torturing anyone
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:42,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They actually have Persian officials holding the hands of people that are recognizable before you can date them you can go
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Oh look they're holding the hand of a carry in there
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:50,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Older holding up assideans had that is by Design the Persian propaganda
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,447	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As opposed to be a Syrian propaganda
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:54,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is that the people who are in their empire
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Like that
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:12:00,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But they enjoy being in the Empire that is mutually beneficial that it's an Empire by choice
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:04,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Keeping you here you want to be in the Persian Empire it's good for everybody
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:08,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As we said the earlier show the person who dolphin sell that too
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:11,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Donations before they went to war to do we really have to
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To do this
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:17,535	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It'll listen you join us and everybody will be better off I mean that's the way they sold the empire
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:21,119	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In terms of its propaganda it's it's carved in stone propaganda
EDL	00:12:22,399	00:12:28,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And they generally compared to the in a curve of that era and that area were generally pretty lenient unless of course
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:30,335	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You rebelled against them
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Who told that story and story and maybe
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:37,503	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From Herodotus describing what happened to the Egyptians
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	20 earlier Persian king took over the Egyptians
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,647	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	An Egyptian had to be punished for mistreating some diplomats
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,183	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Erotica sez
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:51,327	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And this would be very person to do that all the nobles were gathered for the aristocracy of Egypt
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Not the poor people who had nothing to do with the decision making
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Upper-crust brought them in and then brought their children in in front of them
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And executed the boys 2000 of them
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Including
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the king of Egypt kid
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And sold an equal number of girls into slavery
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We have wondered
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:12,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That sounded
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:16,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Remember that still a scene in my head what's the movie scene like that how do you recreate that for the film
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:20,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nonetheless that kind of collective punishment Was Not Unusual at all
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which makes you wonder
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know if if that's what faces you
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:28,191	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Let's just say you're the governor your name is borrow
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:32,799	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you run a Syrian City that's about the Persians have taken over and they've come in there
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Find a bunch of documents with you and you maybe prick your finger with blood in you
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:42,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Put at the bottom of the. Yes I will be loyal to the Persian Empire and then for some reason my dad a good reason who knows
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Uribel
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,671	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the person come back because what are the odds
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,975	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But that rebellious city is going to manage to
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,023	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Avoid being recaptured
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:59,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the Persians do something horrible to you and your family when you know you let your imagination run wild the Persians have punished
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:03,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I called the boats for example are sometimes called the ordeal of the boats
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:12,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Top three always on my top three worst execution methods of all time
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:13,759	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Along with
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:16,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Also the death by a Thousand Cuts of the Chinese that wasn't
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:17,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Diabolic
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,719	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I was thinking Myself by the way you know what this Persian
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Penalty somebody had to come up with this
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:26,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Somebody invented this
EDL	00:14:26,815	00:14:28,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Wonder if they'd be proud to find Alison
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,399	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	2500 years later we're still talking about
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:34,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the message supposedly again this comes from Greek author so who knows
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:40,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the method was to get a couple of boats like canoes or flat bottom boats or whatever you no small affair
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:44,735	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But that fit together to put one upside down on the other one you have like a perfect little
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:48,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And it would stick the person to be executed in the bottom boat
EDL	00:14:48,831	00:14:49,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Then they would
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:53,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Put the top coat on top of the but they would leave the head the hands in the feet out
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,463	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	According to the authors
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:59,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And then they would feed the person in the boat a lot of milk and honey and then smear it all over their face

EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:20,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Did all this stuff you have from these Greek writers for example is all movie making and it's all falsify to me where different

EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:31,328	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So it's easy to say all that stuff should be thrown out because all these people in the story rather than being historical figures are more like

EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But if you do that what do you replace it with

EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:37,120	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But you have to ask yourself as a detective don't you if you're a historian which I'm not
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:39,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is why all of a sudden

EDL	00:32:42,752	00:32:49,152	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are they there because there's a legitimate reason to have them cuz they're always is right we all understand it's half the population there was 30
EDL	00:32:49,152	00:32:50,176	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some Authority somewhere
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,224	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Were they there because
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,320	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Storyteller requires them as a tool to do something else

EDL	00:45:56,095	00:45:58,655	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a war hard to hide me for example
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:46:00,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The last time the Persians were there
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:04,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They had problems crossing the peninsula around a certain Mountain
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,823	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Your feet have been wrecked
EDL	00:46:05,823	00:46:07,871	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Right at the tip of the point of the peninsula
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:09,151	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So this time
EDL	00:46:09,663	00:46:11,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's been three or four years ahead of time
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:15,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Digging a canal more than a mile long right through the
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:17,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The neck of the peninsula right at the base
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Even have to go around the next time
EDL	00:46:21,951	00:46:25,023	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Ancient author said two triremes can pass side-by-side
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:29,119	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the canalon apparently they can find remnants of it today
EDL	00:46:30,911	00:46:35,007	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But that's the kind of thing that takes thousands and thousands of people and years and
EDL	00:46:35,007	00:46:36,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks would have no
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:39,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In addition unlike the last assault
EDL	00:46:40,127	00:46:43,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In which culminated at the Battle of Marathon which was essentially an amphibious Landing
EDL	00:46:44,735	00:46:48,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is kind of cool for this. When you think about the capabilities I mean moving Army
EDL	00:46:49,087	00:46:52,671	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Shippan landing and supporting them and all that that's really cool but this time
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:58,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They were going to go with more the old-fashioned route which leads a lot more historians cuz there's no agreement on this
EDL	00:46:59,071	00:47:05,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To think that the second time the Persian come around this time LED in person by Xerxes the great king of
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:06,239	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Kings
EDL	00:47:06,239	00:47:09,823	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This time it's a full invasion this is not a punitive Expedition
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:12,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is not something to
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:17,503	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a scare the locals all although history NPR Breon points out that this also would have been something
EDL	00:47:18,015	00:47:21,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That the new King Xerxes would have used as a way to show the flag
EDL	00:47:21,599	00:47:26,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And it's all the peoples your March the Army through their territory on the way to some other goal
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:28,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And it has the subsidiary effective
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:30,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Reminding the locals
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:31,327	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know who their King is
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:34,655	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Dissuade any attempt to change that situation
EDL	00:47:35,679	00:47:42,079	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nonetheless if they're going to invade by land this time so they can take what is reported to be the largest army that
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:47,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Did ever invaded anywhere in the world up until this time although let's remember these people did not know anything about the Chinese so
EDL	00:47:48,479	00:47:52,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Take that out of your equation who knows how those numbers would have stacked up
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,367	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Unless you can't move in army that
EDL	00:47:55,135	00:47:55,903	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Over the sea
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:48:02,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So you going to move it over the lad you going to attack Europe from Asia there's only one problem as you probably divined
EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:08,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There's water that separates Europe from Asia it's not very much and it's a strip but it's famous

EDL	00:48:34,303	00:48:36,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I think the narrow is like 1700
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:39,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Yards around there but I think there's one that's like two miles long

EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:37,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But you can certainly tell
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:40,735	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks are not foolish and they can see odds
EDL	00:53:41,247	00:53:45,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And when they're not even really Greeks but in this case Athenians on one hand

EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:17,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To look at this more from a Persian point of view
EDL	00:54:17,599	00:54:19,647	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Would point out that in the end
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:21,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You have more Greeks

EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:42,079	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Crazy soda to the modern mind
EDL	00:55:42,847	00:55:45,663	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But once again there are multiple ways of viewing it
EDL	00:55:45,663	00:55:47,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some of them much more cynical that
EDL	00:55:47,711	00:55:49,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Could suggest that some of this stuff

EDL	00:55:58,207	00:56:00,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I totally different way for example
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:03,583	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The kings of Persia traditionally gave lots of good stuff to all the order
EDL	00:56:04,095	00:56:06,655	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Liam play any favorites and they covered all their bases
EDL	00:56:07,167	00:56:07,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Why taking a chance
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:10,751	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the Oracle of Delphi
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:14,079	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Channeling the voice of the god of Apollo

EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:23,551	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Oracle of Delphi was
EDL	00:56:23,551	00:56:25,087	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Usually Pro Persian
EDL	00:56:25,599	00:56:28,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this case the Athenians go to basically say
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:34,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Okay we know the great King's coming back and we're trying to work together to figure out some ideas and
EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:38,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know maybe we should have a Navy maybe we should have an army maybe we should work with the Spartans mean
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:40,447	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Let's ask a little advice go to the

EDL	00:56:46,079	00:56:51,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They are matronly didn't like 50 years old cuz once they used to be like teen virgin and it didn't work out too well
EDL	00:56:52,223	00:56:55,039	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So they just dressed he's 50 year old women like
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:55,807	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Teens
EDL	00:56:56,575	00:56:57,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Put them on
EDL	00:56:58,367	00:57:01,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A tripod that was in a cauldron Maybe
EDL	00:57:01,439	00:57:03,231	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I don't know exactly but one of those

EDL	00:57:07,327	00:57:08,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So that the fumes
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:12,191	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From a crack in the earth that they were placed over
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:16,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Could seep up through the cauldron into their nostrils
EDL	00:57:17,311	00:57:19,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And allow them to channel the god
EDL	00:57:20,895	00:57:23,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is a fascinating thing you could go into oracle's forever

EDL	00:57:45,983	00:57:52,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What the heck made this woman the pythia she was causing it was associated with snakes by the way so that makes it more exotic and
EDL	00:57:52,383	00:57:53,407	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Interesting and weird

EDL	00:58:14,399	00:58:17,215	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know who kind of interpreted here's what she saying
EDL	00:58:17,215	00:58:21,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And sometimes even with the interpretation you had to go back

EDL	01:13:54,431	01:13:55,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because we just told

EDL	01:13:58,527	01:14:00,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the Mexican side
EDL	01:14:00,575	01:14:06,719	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is we got a little delayed at the Alamo they killed a bunch of our guys no big deal but I'm with children last one of them we moved on
EDL	01:14:08,767	01:14:15,167	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the Greek point of view this is an inspirational account and it starts were told to be inspirational from the get-go

EDL	01:14:38,975	01:14:45,375	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We would be remiss if we suggested they had only been 300 Spartans at this battle in the Persian show up and are blocked

EDL	01:14:55,871	01:14:59,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you go look at the Recreations of people have mocked up about where the water used to be

EDL	01:35:25,184	01:35:27,232	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To plan we're told see that the
EDL	01:35:27,232	01:35:31,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persian Fleet is superior not just in numbers
EDL	01:35:31,072	01:35:37,472	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But in order they have better rollers they have guys would let more experience because they took over established
EDL	01:35:37,472	01:35:38,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Athletes remember they sort of
EDL	01:35:39,008	01:35:44,384	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That's one of a subcontractor or a wholly-owned subsidiary sort of approach to some of these Empires like
EDL	01:35:44,896	01:35:51,296	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are these cities that are Phoenicians and have such great seafaring Traditions the Phoenicians may have been the greatest seafaring people.

EDL	01:35:52,320	01:35:54,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So when the Persians get control of these areas
EDL	01:35:54,624	01:35:56,672	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Essentially say okay you're working for us now

EDL	01:36:05,632	01:36:08,960	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Still getting up to speed in terms of okay this is the proper way you
EDL	01:36:09,472	01:36:11,264	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You do this maneuver 8cm mean
EDL	01:36:11,776	01:36:17,920	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I just that developing the muscles you kind of forget that element of it how long could these people you know when you're fighting a battle
EDL	01:36:18,688	01:36:21,248	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Continue to pull the oars before they just exhausted
EDL	01:36:22,016	01:36:24,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And what if one side is better at that than the other
EDL	01:36:25,344	01:36:30,464	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Why did you win they're in better shape they've been pulling mowers for 20 years they've got muscles that these opinions haven't even develop
EDL	01:36:30,976	01:36:31,488	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Who knows
EDL	01:36:33,280	01:36:39,680	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Besides Phoenicians the Persians are using Egyptian fleets they're using ionian Greek Fleet it's a bad situation

EDL	01:36:43,264	01:36:45,056	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But apparently Themistocles in his
EDL	01:36:45,824	01:36:51,200	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Council of strategist have recognized that if you could pull this giant Persian Fleet
EDL	01:36:51,200	01:36:57,600	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Into that little narrow area you could turn it into a land battle and they were confident that the land battle would go better for them
EDL	01:36:57,600	01:36:58,112	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And it did

EDL	01:48:19,840	01:48:23,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Would probably not have offered you a deal of this kind at any time

EDL	01:49:21,024	01:49:21,536	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's going to happen
EDL	01:49:23,328	01:49:25,632	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the parameters for this encounter
EDL	01:49:26,400	01:49:32,032	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Have been in large part determined by the needs and the capabilities of the Persian cat
EDL	01:49:33,824	01:49:38,944	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're in the Strategic place we are cuz this is the good Cavalry country in Greece that's where the Persians want to fight

EDL	01:49:43,808	01:49:45,344	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Why were the Greeks decided to Stan
EDL	01:49:46,112	01:49:47,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They choose a spot
EDL	01:49:47,904	01:49:48,672	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where there
EDL	01:49:49,440	01:49:52,000	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You better protected from that Cavalry they
EDL	01:49:52,000	01:49:52,768	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Appear
EDL	01:49:53,536	01:49:54,304	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the mountain
EDL	01:49:54,816	01:49:55,840	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Through the mountain passes
EDL	01:49:56,608	01:49:58,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Marching up from the south
EDL	01:49:58,912	01:50:00,960	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And when they run into the Persians
EDL	01:50:00,960	01:50:04,544	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They do so from a position High atop these Hills
EDL	01:50:05,568	01:50:08,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persians are camped on the plane below
EDL	01:50:08,640	01:50:11,968	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which stretches out in the distance it's wonderful Cavalry country
EDL	01:50:11,968	01:50:15,040	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They are behind River they have a camp built
EDL	01:50:15,552	01:50:19,648	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So they've got a pretty good defensive position they'd love to have the Greeks Advanced on them
EDL	01:50:19,648	01:50:25,280	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks and picked out a pretty strong defensive position of their own up in the hills and they'd like the person to come up to them
EDL	01:50:27,328	01:50:28,864	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Lost Begins the
EDL	01:50:28,864	01:50:31,936	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Free battle jockeying for position an advantage
EDL	01:50:32,448	01:50:34,240	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And there's a lot of it and it goes on for days
EDL	01:50:34,752	01:50:35,264	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And
EDL	01:50:35,776	01:50:42,176	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know once again it's a good time to remind you that you're getting the Dan Carlin version of the story because this is so argue about
EDL	01:50:42,176	01:50:43,200	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Autumn Oaks historian to work
EDL	01:50:43,712	01:50:48,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Recreating as best they can you know where things happened and so much has changed since in
EDL	01:50:49,344	01:50:52,160	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'm just going to stake out sort of abroad
EDL	01:50:52,160	01:50:56,768	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	View of this for clarity reasons and understand that there's a ton of disagreement about everything
EDL	01:50:58,560	01:51:03,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Basically though what happens if the Greeks try to stay in The High Ground and lower the Persians up there
EDL	01:51:03,168	01:51:04,192	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the Persians
EDL	01:51:04,704	01:51:09,824	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Trying to Skirmish with the Greeks and get them to either break apart go home or come down to fight them
EDL	01:51:11,616	01:51:14,432	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And all through the narrative we have
EDL	01:51:14,432	01:51:15,456	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Herodotus
EDL	01:51:16,992	01:51:18,528	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The ancient screenwriter
EDL	01:51:18,528	01:51:19,552	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Colorizer
EDL	01:51:19,552	01:51:22,112	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And this is his crowning Glory moment
EDL	01:51:22,624	01:51:26,976	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Writes his whole history to talk about any of these events and this is
EDL	01:51:26,976	01:51:28,256	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The climactic battle
EDL	01:51:29,536	01:51:31,840	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's also my favorite battle
EDL	01:51:31,840	01:51:33,888	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the entire history of the achaemenid Persian Empire
EDL	01:51:35,424	01:51:38,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because you can color in Herodotus In Living Color
EDL	01:51:38,496	01:51:39,776	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	2500 years
EDL	01:51:39,776	01:51:41,056	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Dad but you know what I mean
EDL	01:51:41,568	01:51:42,592	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We have
EDL	01:51:43,104	01:51:44,896	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really the only
EDL	01:51:44,896	01:51:48,224	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Colorize story of the Persian army at its height
EDL	01:51:49,760	01:51:50,784	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I love this Army
EDL	01:51:50,784	01:51:54,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	After this. It will change and not be the same in before this.
EDL	01:51:54,624	01:51:56,160	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You really don't have any
EDL	01:51:56,672	01:51:58,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a few for how it operated
EDL	01:51:58,720	01:52:01,280	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this battle you get to see this Army move
EDL	01:52:01,792	01:52:02,560	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And fight
EDL	01:52:06,144	01:52:08,960	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is a lot of disagreement to about how the Greeks fought in this battle
EDL	01:52:09,984	01:52:11,008	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the last
EDL	01:52:11,008	01:52:13,056	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Discussion we had on this I mentioned
EDL	01:52:13,568	01:52:17,152	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In some of the historians like handspan Wiest who suggests that the
EDL	01:52:17,152	01:52:21,504	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Idea that we've always had about how the Greeks fought during this. Is misplaced
EDL	01:52:22,016	01:52:25,088	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And if they don't fight that way till after this.
EDL	01:52:25,088	01:52:27,648	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the one we're going to now is sort of like
EDL	01:52:27,648	01:52:33,792	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a while they're in transition from an old style that you know they would have recognized in Homer's Iliad
EDL	01:52:34,304	01:52:40,704	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To the style that will come to be known in the future after this. The region Phalanx style where everybody stays in the rain
EDL	01:52:40,704	01:52:42,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Banks under penalty
EDL	01:52:42,496	01:52:44,544	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you know you move is a body
EDL	01:52:44,544	01:52:50,688	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because there's so many stories here if they're more than stories where people will spring forward from the ranks and do stuff
EDL	01:52:50,688	01:52:55,808	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Or move backwards fluidly back toward their online which is much more like the fighting
EDL	01:52:55,808	01:52:58,112	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the heroic Greek era of Homer's time
EDL	01:53:00,416	01:53:03,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It would sure explain a lot it been weeks is right about this because
EDL	01:53:03,744	01:53:07,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Herodotus describes this all the time he begins to lay out
EDL	01:53:07,584	01:53:12,192	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know what will become his version of like a Saving Private Ryan type
EDL	01:53:12,192	01:53:14,240	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Battle scene and it's worth pointing out
EDL	01:53:14,752	01:53:17,824	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is like the first battle scene stuff
EDL	01:53:18,336	01:53:24,736	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But we have to admit will set the stage for all the the movies and plays and books and every
EDL	01:53:24,736	01:53:25,248	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Even afterwards
EDL	01:53:27,040	01:53:30,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You start by pointing out that the Greeks and the Persians are trying to
EDL	01:53:30,880	01:53:34,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know maneuver each other out of position and he talks about the skirmishing that's going on
EDL	01:53:34,720	01:53:36,000	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At one point
EDL	01:53:36,000	01:53:39,328	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persian Commander mardonius ends cavalry
EDL	01:53:39,840	01:53:45,216	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To go up into the hills and try to mess with the Greeks you don't know what for and historians all disagree
EDL	01:53:45,728	01:53:49,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A lot of things though sometimes a general does something just to see what will happen
EDL	01:53:49,568	01:53:52,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	REITs how will they respond if I go up there and shoot them
EDL	01:53:54,176	01:53:56,992	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe they'll start dying in large numbers which would be good
EDL	01:53:57,504	01:53:59,552	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Or maybe their morale will suffer
EDL	01:53:59,552	01:54:02,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which would also be good or maybe they'll just leave which would be good too
EDL	01:54:03,392	01:54:06,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I can't catch my cavalry
EDL	01:54:07,232	01:54:12,608	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Calvary basically dominate this field cuz they're the best Cavalry in Asia just calorie country
EDL	01:54:13,376	01:54:15,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the Greeks have no calories at all
EDL	01:54:15,680	01:54:17,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The only Cavalry in Greece
EDL	01:54:17,728	01:54:19,264	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really worth its salt
EDL	01:54:19,264	01:54:21,824	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are in places like thieves and thessaly up in the north
EDL	01:54:22,592	01:54:23,872	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And there on the Persian side
EDL	01:54:24,640	01:54:27,968	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are Greek cavalrymen in this battle they're just fighting
EDL	01:54:28,480	01:54:29,504	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	On the Persian side
EDL	01:54:32,064	01:54:34,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At one point erotica starts the narrative in
EDL	01:54:34,368	01:54:35,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the
EDL	01:54:35,392	01:54:38,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greek line which is been put together sometimes
EDL	01:54:39,232	01:54:41,280	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know sounding like a bunch of
EDL	01:54:41,280	01:54:47,680	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Petulant four-year-olds arguing about who gets to stand on this part of the line in the wicked just stand on this part of the line and its crew
EDL	01:54:47,680	01:54:48,448	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Crazy how
EDL	01:54:48,960	01:54:50,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We have to remember in and
EDL	01:54:51,008	01:54:57,152	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	History of Eyeglass and bean ever Tire of reminding us that it's accepting the Spartan these Greeks are militia troops
EDL	01:54:57,920	01:54:59,968	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are farmers for the most part

EDL	02:19:12,256	02:19:18,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You're in this line you've been shooting at these people for a long time and now they run at you in a giant block of
EDL	02:19:18,656	02:19:21,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Men let's just play with a nice round number
EDL	02:19:21,728	02:19:28,128	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And say 10,000 but it seems to have been more than that and Peter Greene says the Spartan line was three-quarters of a mile
EDL	02:19:28,128	02:19:28,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nia Long
EDL	02:19:30,688	02:19:33,504	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So a line of men maybe a track steep
EDL	02:19:34,016	02:19:36,064	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With 10:40 or so Spears you know
EDL	02:19:36,576	02:19:37,600	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	7/12
EDL	02:19:37,600	02:19:38,112	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Spears
EDL	02:19:38,880	02:19:41,696	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Charges that you and they're basically shoulder-to-shoulder
EDL	02:19:43,744	02:19:44,768	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you stand there
EDL	02:19:46,304	02:19:52,448	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	By the time is like the Napoleonic wars in the u.s. Civil War and stuff almost nobody will stand there
EDL	02:19:52,448	02:19:54,752	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	During a bayonet attack
EDL	02:19:54,752	02:19:57,312	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Big hidden things about the. Of me
EDL	02:19:57,312	02:20:01,920	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The real historians will say nowadays it. Do the evidence seems to show that no one stood around for Bayonetta
EDL	02:20:02,944	02:20:08,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nobody nobody would face Cold Steel yeah but in this. Facing Cold Steel is what it's all about
EDL	02:20:09,856	02:20:11,648	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And even then a lot of people didn't
EDL	02:20:12,672	02:20:14,464	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are a lot of stories about hole
EDL	02:20:15,232	02:20:19,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In almost whole armies running away sometimes before contact
EDL	02:20:19,840	02:20:21,632	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Think about what's involved and think about
EDL	02:20:22,144	02:20:24,704	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know what you have to have happen to make it all work
EDL	02:20:25,216	02:20:27,008	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Just because you're brave
EDL	02:20:27,008	02:20:30,592	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And just because your friends are Braves standing around you what happens if
EDL	02:20:30,592	02:20:36,480	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The 10000 Spartans in a with their 10ft Spears like a giant pin-cushion start charging at you
EDL	02:20:37,760	02:20:40,064	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And half the people around you run away
EDL	02:20:40,576	02:20:46,976	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What the other half do by the Greeks thought that the god of fear Phobos ruled the battlefield
EDL	02:20:46,976	02:20:47,488	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That before
EDL	02:20:48,000	02:20:50,816	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because Panic could take over at any time like a herd creature
EDL	02:20:51,840	02:20:54,400	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As the Spartans charge you
EDL	02:20:54,400	02:20:55,680	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How do you stand there
EDL	02:20:56,192	02:21:02,592	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And accept the charge especially if you're not at least arm simile you're going to pull out your little short-sword you're not going to have any
EDL	02:21:02,592	02:21:06,688	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Armor for the standard Persian infantry behind the front line not going to have any helmet
EDL	02:21:07,456	02:21:09,760	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe a quilted jerkin if you're lucky
EDL	02:21:10,784	02:21:12,320	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You're going to get steamrolled
EDL	02:21:14,112	02:21:17,184	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The front rank of these formations as we talked about earlier the current
EDL	02:21:17,184	02:21:18,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a line of thinking
EDL	02:21:18,720	02:21:23,584	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is that this is a block of men maybe 10 ranks deep but it's the first rank
EDL	02:21:23,584	02:21:29,984	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Actually kind of equipped in a way that might allow them to give a good account of themselves in hand-to-hand combat all those big show
EDL	02:21:29,984	02:21:31,520	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Dealzer carrying are wicker
EDL	02:21:32,032	02:21:35,104	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Shows you the kind of warfare the Persians usually engaged
EDL	02:21:35,616	02:21:39,456	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They're helping to keep their formations safe from missile fire
EDL	02:21:40,224	02:21:43,808	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks are coming at you with a big old heavy spear head
EDL	02:21:43,808	02:21:44,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a with a
EDL	02:21:45,088	02:21:46,112	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Impetus
EDL	02:21:46,112	02:21:50,720	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That a charge provides behind it all the Spartan sometimes Advanced nice and cool
EDL	02:21:51,232	02:21:52,000	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Uno's
EDL	02:21:54,304	02:21:56,352	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And once that front rank is dead
EDL	02:21:56,864	02:22:00,704	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Spartans of broken into a formation that is not prepared
EDL	02:22:00,704	02:22:03,520	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This kind of fighting at all it's one NFL team
EDL	02:22:03,520	02:22:09,152	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With helmets and pads and oh yeah big ol Spears facing another NFL team to know how much Notepad
EDL	02:22:09,152	02:22:10,176	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And short swords
EDL	02:22:12,224	02:22:16,576	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Between the prospective you have to
EDL	02:22:17,344	02:22:18,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Erotica suggest
EDL	02:22:18,624	02:22:20,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Dispersion does he said
EDL	02:22:20,416	02:22:22,208	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're not inferior in Courage
EDL	02:22:22,976	02:22:24,256	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They were not inferior
EDL	02:22:25,280	02:22:26,048	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In Valor
EDL	02:22:26,560	02:22:30,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And let's remember they're fighting not just Greek they're fighting Spark
EDL	02:22:30,144	02:22:31,424	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And they're not just fighting
EDL	02:22:32,192	02:22:38,592	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As we said some Spartans they're fighting Sparta this is the military strength of the Cities
EDL	02:22:38,592	02:22:42,688	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	State of Sparta and these Persians are not inferior Robin his Valor
EDL	02:22:43,712	02:22:44,736	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But he said that they liked on
EDL	02:22:46,016	02:22:47,552	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You basically said they're not equipped
EDL	02:22:47,552	02:22:52,928	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This kind of fighting but you get a sense of the desperation the other Greek states are petrified of Spartans
EDL	02:22:53,952	02:22:55,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And now the Persians are finding out why
EDL	02:22:59,328	02:23:02,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Spartan formation smashes into the Persians remember
EDL	02:23:02,144	02:23:08,032	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	D Spears with your only about 2 in wide width there 10 ft long and 2 in wide you can see how
EDL	02:23:08,032	02:23:09,056	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Likely they are to
EDL	02:23:10,336	02:23:16,736	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	All the Greek sources talk about breaking Spears all the time even if you go into a nice soft human body with your spear trying
EDL	02:23:16,736	02:23:18,016	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How to get it out of that body like
EDL	02:23:18,528	02:23:22,624	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Break the spears of the Spheres are gone very quickly but yours have Herodotus describes
EDL	02:23:23,136	02:23:24,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The moment of impact

EDL	02:23:28,000	02:23:30,560	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	First there was a struggle at the barricade of Shield
EDL	02:23:31,072	02:23:34,912	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Then the barricade down there was a bitter and protracted fight
EDL	02:23:34,912	02:23:37,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Hand-to-hand close by the Temple of Demeter
EDL	02:23:37,728	02:23:41,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	For the Persians would lay hold of the Spartan Spears and break them

EDL	02:23:44,896	02:23:46,432	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But they were deficient in armor
EDL	02:23:46,432	02:23:48,992	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Untrained greatly inferior in skill
EDL	02:23:49,504	02:23:54,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Sometimes tingly sometimes in groups of 10 men perhaps fewer perhaps more
EDL	02:23:54,368	02:23:57,184	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They fell upon the Spartan line and were cut down
EDL	02:23:58,208	02:23:59,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They pressed hardest
EDL	02:23:59,744	02:24:00,512	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He writes
EDL	02:24:00,512	02:24:03,072	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At the point where mardonius the general
EDL	02:24:03,072	02:24:04,352	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Farting person
EDL	02:24:04,352	02:24:08,448	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Riding his white charger and surrounded by his thousand Persian troops

EDL	02:24:17,664	02:24:18,944	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But after his death
EDL	02:24:18,944	02:24:22,784	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the destruction of his personal guard the finest of the Persian troops
EDL	02:24:22,784	02:24:26,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The remainder yielded to the lack of ammonia into a flight
EDL	02:24:26,368	02:24:28,672	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The chief cause of their discomfiture
EDL	02:24:28,672	02:24:29,952	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Was their lack of armor
EDL	02:24:29,952	02:24:32,512	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Fighting without it against heavily armed Infantry
EDL	02:24:33,024	02:24:33,536	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And quote

EDL	02:24:39,168	02:24:41,216	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe from the Persian point of view
EDL	02:24:41,216	02:24:44,288	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You see that the Persians stood up
EDL	02:24:44,288	02:24:45,056	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To the Spartan

EDL	02:25:38,560	02:25:44,704	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What's interesting is Herodotus said the Persians didn't just stand up to it that they were putting up with the death and destruction
EDL	02:25:45,984	02:25:49,312	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	An equalizer of the lack of armor and everything

EDL	02:25:55,456	02:25:58,528	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As we said earlier there's something about these ancient battles where both
EDL	02:25:59,552	02:26:03,648	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There's something expected about that he's he's not there because he's

EDL	02:26:11,584	02:26:13,120	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And when they die
EDL	02:26:13,632	02:26:14,912	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's often catastrophic
EDL	02:26:16,192	02:26:20,032	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this case the story traditionally is a low temperature a long time afterwards
EDL	02:26:20,544	02:26:22,848	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Spartan in the formation
EDL	02:26:22,848	02:26:24,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	While the combat is going on
EDL	02:26:25,152	02:26:27,456	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Lazenby describes it as what must be
EDL	02:26:28,736	02:26:31,040	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because in comprehensible chaos
EDL	02:26:31,808	02:26:36,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And picks up a rock and throws it at mardonius and fractured skull and kill them
EDL	02:26:38,208	02:26:41,024	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you know I've been thinking about this if you think about
EDL	02:26:41,024	02:26:42,816	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A formation of men like that
EDL	02:26:43,328	02:26:49,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How close could anybody get without tons of stuff being thrown at them I mean very soon there must have been every
EDL	02:26:49,728	02:26:56,128	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Rock that was nearby every stick anything that could have been picked up and thrown at the enemy must have been gone in this case it's not so
EDL	02:26:56,128	02:26:56,896	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So hard to imagine
EDL	02:26:57,408	02:26:59,712	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are tons of stuff being thrown

EDL	02:30:17,344	02:30:18,368	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the estimate range
EDL	02:30:18,880	02:30:24,512	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Does anywhere from like 50000 220000 somewhere in there is probably a good number
EDL	02:30:26,048	02:30:30,400	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	On the Greek side if the largest army they've ever put together it involves multiple city-states
EDL	02:30:30,912	02:30:34,752	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	50080 thousand men is the range that people throw out there

EDL	02:30:39,872	02:30:41,920	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is that you have people who are
EDL	02:30:42,432	02:30:42,944	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Temp service
EDL	02:30:43,968	02:30:44,992	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And she lets
EDL	02:30:44,992	02:30:47,040	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Enslaved people whose job it is
EDL	02:30:47,040	02:30:49,856	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The carry the soldiers stop and cook his food and that kind of thing
EDL	02:30:50,368	02:30:55,232	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But on the day of the battle often times especially in Desperate situations they're handed the spear
EDL	02:30:55,232	02:30:57,792	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know when someone to stick that into
EDL	02:30:58,304	02:31:02,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Does that all the sudden make you a fighting man you get the count now in the overall numbers did they
EDL	02:31:02,656	02:31:03,168	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Count
EDL	02:31:03,936	02:31:06,752	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What Herodotus and others do casualty numbers for the Greeks
EDL	02:31:07,264	02:31:08,800	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Fishing ridiculously low
EDL	02:31:09,568	02:31:12,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But some historians have pointed out that they might not have been counting some of those other people
EDL	02:31:13,408	02:31:16,224	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Number to Rodger said there were seven Helix for every Spartan
EDL	02:31:16,736	02:31:20,064	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Tens of thousands of people that maybe nobody decided to count
EDL	02:31:20,576	02:31:23,904	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But it came time to adding up the important people who died in this battle
EDL	02:31:27,232	02:31:33,632	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Now what's more they will be another battle that will happen traditionally happens at the exact same time 40 is going on
EDL	02:31:33,632	02:31:34,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Probably happened to
EDL	02:31:34,656	02:31:40,544	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A little bit afterwards probably but you know maybe even a little bit before they don't know but they do think it was around the same time
EDL	02:31:40,544	02:31:41,824	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Call the Battle of Nicholas
EDL	02:31:43,104	02:31:45,920	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'm basically what happens is the remnants of the Greek Fleet
EDL	02:31:46,688	02:31:52,832	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That were victorious in the Battle of Salamis go find the remnants of the Persian Fleet that lost the Battle of Salamis they're going to have this Naval Base
EDL	02:31:58,208	02:31:59,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The person who defeated again
EDL	02:32:01,024	02:32:07,424	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you actually read the rundown of it it sounds very much like the Battle of plataea all over again the hoplites charging tearing down the wall
EDL	02:32:07,424	02:32:08,448	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Olive wicker Shields
EDL	02:32:08,960	02:32:10,752	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And absolutely ripping apart the
EDL	02:32:11,520	02:32:17,664	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Lightly armored archers in the middle of these Archer blocks and a Cavalry once again mysteriously missing
EDL	02:32:17,664	02:32:20,224	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persian fighting very well until the officer dies
EDL	02:32:21,504	02:32:27,904	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Basically acts as sort of a last kick in the rear end platea throws the Persians out of European
EDL	02:32:27,904	02:32:28,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Greece
EDL	02:32:28,928	02:32:35,328	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the Battle of miqueli kicks him in the rear end on the way out at the! Basically saying and don't come back
EDL	02:32:35,328	02:32:35,840	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Back
EDL	02:32:37,120	02:32:38,656	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I think it's certainly does though
EDL	02:32:39,168	02:32:41,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is answer the question of the Battle of Marathon
EDL	02:32:41,728	02:32:43,776	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Continue as before this. Did not
EDL	02:32:44,544	02:32:45,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is
EDL	02:32:45,568	02:32:47,872	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The question of the Tactical
EDL	02:32:47,872	02:32:54,016	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Superiority of the Greeks in these battles and
EDL	02:32:54,784	02:32:59,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And things that that involve very high-level stuff either decisions or trends
EDL	02:32:59,392	02:33:02,208	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But sometimes they can boil down
EDL	02:33:02,208	02:33:08,352	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Two things that seem like they should be mine or tactical Battlefield superiority questions and
EDL	02:33:08,352	02:33:10,400	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Sometimes people will think no really
EDL	02:33:10,912	02:33:13,216	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But then you say listen how big of a deal was it
EDL	02:33:13,728	02:33:17,568	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the age of discovery that one side had firearms and the other didn't
EDL	02:33:18,080	02:33:21,664	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Or machine gun or artillery I mean there are times when
EDL	02:33:22,176	02:33:26,528	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	One side superiority on the day of the battle or the year of the war
EDL	02:33:27,040	02:33:28,320	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Determines how everything else goes
EDL	02:33:29,856	02:33:31,648	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	These two encounters plataea
EDL	02:33:32,160	02:33:33,184	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And mentally
EDL	02:33:33,696	02:33:37,024	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Show that the Persians can't handle the Greeks for some reason
EDL	02:33:37,792	02:33:41,120	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At least not in these situations and historians ever since I've been trying to
EDL	02:33:41,120	02:33:44,448	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Answer the question you in this great giant upset in history
EDL	02:33:46,496	02:33:48,544	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Without a doubt the greatest
EDL	02:33:48,544	02:33:54,688	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Event in European related military history up until this time right now and maybe for a long time afterward
EDL	02:33:55,456	02:33:58,272	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How did the Greeks do it why did they win how did the Persians lose
EDL	02:33:59,552	02:34:03,392	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are several theories on this and there is wonderful to watch the historians
EDL	02:34:03,392	02:34:09,280	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You put forward their debating points on why they think it's one of the other and it's possible it could be several of them working together
EDL	02:34:09,792	02:34:10,816	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'll go over like 4
EDL	02:34:12,608	02:34:17,472	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And some of these theories started with the Greeks themselves and still have their adherence today
EDL	02:34:17,472	02:34:20,032	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The first one is one of those The Speaker versus the bow
EDL	02:34:21,568	02:34:24,640	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The idea that the Greeks had a lot of history and still today
EDL	02:34:25,408	02:34:26,944	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But you look at the equipment differin
EDL	02:34:26,944	02:34:33,088	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Herodotus writes about it to one side had armor the other didn't once I have these long Spears the other one side head
EDL	02:34:33,088	02:34:34,880	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Your heavy Shield the other really didn't
EDL	02:34:36,672	02:34:40,768	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Greeks also had a subtext to this sometimes it wasn't just
EDL	02:34:40,768	02:34:44,608	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The one side had Spears in the other head bows but the different kinds of men
EDL	02:34:45,120	02:34:46,144	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are created
EDL	02:34:46,656	02:34:50,496	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know when you're in Archer versus when you are a close combat infantryman right
EDL	02:34:51,776	02:34:56,384	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And that when it came time to an actual Clash of Spears the Greeks were
EDL	02:34:56,384	02:34:58,432	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Melee fighters in the Persians really weren't
EDL	02:34:58,944	02:34:59,968	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Certainly not
EDL	02:34:59,968	02:35:05,856	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To the degree the Greek for the Greeks can't win without doing that the Persians can you get a different mentality or so
EDL	02:35:05,856	02:35:07,136	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some people will claim
EDL	02:35:09,696	02:35:14,560	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	People disagree with this Theory will point out quite rightly that the problem is if you want to stay at the equipment
EDL	02:35:15,328	02:35:21,728	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Why can't you just make these people when you see how dominant they are at the Persians look at Greek hoplites and say wow they're real
EDL	02:35:21,728	02:35:23,776	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really affected why don't you just go make their own
EDL	02:35:25,056	02:35:26,848	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because you can for some reason

EDL	02:44:10,880	02:44:14,208	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is start a rolling chain of Revolt maybe that acts
EDL	02:44:14,720	02:44:15,488	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Like a

EDL	02:44:17,792	02:44:22,912	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Get the Persian Empire just would have seen the shake itself apart Like An Earthquake and there are revolts that happened
EDL	02:44:24,960	02:44:27,008	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are several historians I would think that
EDL	02:44:27,008	02:44:30,080	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's logical to assume that Persian losses against the Greeks
EDL	02:44:30,848	02:44:33,920	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Anchorage places like Babylon and Egypt and all the

EDL	02:44:47,744	02:44:50,304	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And here's the thing you know if you look at it
EDL	02:44:50,304	02:44:51,840	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Over the Long Haul
EDL	02:44:52,352	02:44:57,472	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You could make a case that and we're trying to look at this from the Persian Viewpoint the Persians will end up winning
EDL	02:44:57,472	02:45:00,288	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This whole thing to declare Victory now
EDL	02:45:01,056	02:45:03,104	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is a little like declaring victory
EDL	02:45:03,872	02:45:10,272	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It on the second world war in 1942 just going home I mean sure the Persians lost these battle
EDL	02:45:10,272	02:45:13,344	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because of these tactical advantages of the Greek so what are they going to do
EDL	02:45:14,368	02:45:15,904	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Going to come back and fight
EDL	02:45:15,904	02:45:16,416	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Differently
EDL	02:45:17,952	02:45:22,816	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And when you look at Persian strategy here you can really see some of the advantages that the Persians have

EDL	02:45:50,976	02:45:51,744	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the Greeks
EDL	02:45:51,744	02:45:56,352	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Begin to play a large role in the Persian military and what's more this is really

EDL	02:46:46,783	02:46:48,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This begins to be something

EDL	02:46:53,695	02:46:57,279	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persian might not be able to kill Greeks on the battlefield very effectively

EDL	02:47:07,519	02:47:09,823	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The other thing that goes away at this point in the story and
EDL	02:47:10,847	02:47:13,663	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You could argue he's the most important person in the story
EDL	02:47:14,431	02:47:15,199	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is our story teller

EDL	02:49:50,079	02:49:53,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because the people telling you the story are giving you the story that way but

EDL	03:15:31,199	03:15:34,015	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This bodyguard person is working with a eunuch
EDL	03:15:34,783	03:15:35,807	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So what else is new
EDL	03:15:36,575	03:15:38,367	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the two of them are supposed to kill Xerxes
EDL	03:15:38,879	03:15:40,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Now later
EDL	03:15:40,159	03:15:43,743	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A fragment of TCS actually talked about how Xerxes died

EDL	03:16:13,439	03:16:18,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So that kid we're told goes to his brother's house and accuses him of killing their father

EDL	03:16:21,119	03:16:22,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The younger brother doesn't believe him and killed him
EDL	03:16:24,703	03:16:30,335	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And then there were wild and they could be true but you don't know
EDL	03:16:30,847	03:16:36,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Then the conspirators try to get rid of this other son so that maybe the throne clear for them who knows
EDL	03:16:36,735	03:16:38,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the sun figures it out it was told

EDL	03:16:52,863	03:16:55,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The artaxerxes the first is a wonderful example
EDL	03:16:55,423	03:16:58,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How the rest of the story going to go until the very last king
EDL	03:16:58,495	03:17:01,567	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Of the Persian Empire or maybe the second last depending on how you

EDL	03:17:03,359	03:17:06,431	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But that's the here's a guy who will rule

EDL	03:17:15,903	03:17:18,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you look at artaxerxes the first life
EDL	03:17:18,975	03:17:21,023	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's like a few bullet points on a timeline
EDL	03:17:22,047	03:17:25,631	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That's how all the rest of these things are going to be two up until the last one or two
EDL	03:17:26,911	03:17:32,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's tempting to say maybe that's just because there wasn't a whole lot to record maybe artaxerxes the first is a great

EDL	03:42:57,023	03:43:02,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The famous Harem intrigues is we said I mean artaxerxes the third the Contemporary of Philip

EDL	03:43:20,319	03:43:21,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Now there are some
EDL	03:43:22,111	03:43:25,183	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Cuneiform tablets that seem to suggest that
EDL	03:43:25,183	03:43:31,071	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Artaxerxes the third may have died a natural death and Lord knows he was supposedly in his mid-eighties so that's not out of
EDL	03:43:31,071	03:43:31,583	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The question
EDL	03:43:32,863	03:43:36,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the ancient sources place his death at the hands of his vizier
EDL	03:43:36,703	03:43:38,751	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where is counselor may be his General

EDL	03:43:50,015	03:43:55,135	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The king that he poisoned supposedly is this one that we were talking about earlier
EDL	03:43:55,647	03:44:02,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That is vicious enough so you think of him almost like an Assyrian King rather than a more tolerant lenient Persian king but
EDL	03:44:02,047	03:44:04,095	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	When you look at his accomplishments he looks like
EDL	03:44:04,863	03:44:06,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The restorer
EDL	03:44:06,143	03:44:06,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Of the Persian Empire

EDL	03:44:18,431	03:44:20,991	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	By the time this guy dies
EDL	03:44:20,991	03:44:22,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He is restored Persia
EDL	03:44:23,295	03:44:27,135	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To somewhat of its former luster at least if you look at a map
EDL	03:44:29,183	03:44:31,999	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's a remarkable achievement this late in the game
EDL	03:44:33,023	03:44:35,071	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's like an athlete decided they're going to

EDL	03:44:41,471	03:44:42,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Hopefully it's not too hot
EDL	03:44:44,031	03:44:49,151	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But the fun for me if you're a fan of Persia's I am is throughout this time. You're setting up an encounter

EDL	03:44:58,879	03:44:59,647	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Certainly after

EDL	03:45:27,295	03:45:30,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the problem if you're looking at this as a giant championship match

EDL	03:45:32,159	03:45:34,975	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We get the standings for both the people we just lost

EDL	04:01:17,823	04:01:24,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That at the granicus river Alexander's forces ran into the Persian Defenders and that they numbered about 20
EDL	04:01:24,223	04:01:25,759	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Cavalry about 20000 in French
EDL	04:01:27,551	04:01:29,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Modern historians think those numbers are high
EDL	04:01:31,903	04:01:38,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But Alexander's numbers are pretty darn well close self for the first time in a long time maybe
EDL	04:01:38,303	04:01:44,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We have reasonable numbers for at least one side Alexander's forces supposed to have had between 30 and 35000
EDL	04:01:44,703	04:01:47,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Instrument and about 5,000 maybe a little more than 5000
EDL	04:01:48,799	04:01:53,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So even having one number to fill in for a letter in the algebraic historical equation

EDL	04:02:05,951	04:02:09,023	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So take everything with a grain of salt the one thing you can say though
EDL	04:02:09,535	04:02:15,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is that what about to happen here it's easy to see how this all contributes to the myth of Alexander
EDL	04:02:15,423	04:02:19,775	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And one wonders although I haven't heard anybody say this wasn't true if any of this was true
EDL	04:02:19,775	04:02:25,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Theoretically possible that this is all made up about Alexander that he wanted to be portrayed in homeric terms and so
EDL	04:02:25,919	04:02:27,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And he's Superman and all the sources
EDL	04:02:28,479	04:02:30,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Seems very unlikely though
EDL	04:02:30,271	04:02:34,367	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He seems more on the other end of the Spectrum which is somebody who really enjoyed this

EDL	04:02:49,983	04:02:51,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the stuff he did is
EDL	04:02:52,543	04:02:53,055	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Frightful

EDL	04:03:02,015	04:03:04,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	On a personal level what he did was frightful
EDL	04:03:04,831	04:03:08,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you can't judge the people in modern cultural
EDL	04:03:08,415	04:03:09,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Terms because

EDL	04:05:40,479	04:05:42,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the charge into the thick of the mess
EDL	04:05:45,599	04:05:51,999	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We mentioned earlier we were talking about the Persian army from 150 years ago that we changed over time

EDL	04:06:00,703	04:06:07,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Do they got beaten all these battles against the Greeks and they didn't really even change it any appreciably positive way but modern historians
EDL	04:06:07,103	04:06:08,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Answered yes they did
EDL	04:06:08,639	04:06:14,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And it was right under your nose is you're always talking about things like Scythe Chariot and all these other things do you think those are
EDL	04:06:14,783	04:06:18,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Their attempt to come to grips with their weakness and a great advantage in this case
EDL	04:06:18,879	04:06:25,023	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How do you break up those formations of heavy infantry that fight shoulder-to-shoulder with those long Spears they are a pain
EDL	04:06:27,071	04:06:31,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persians hired a lot of those Greek mercenary hoplite to fill the gap for them
EDL	04:06:31,423	04:06:33,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There's 10 to 20 thousand of them at this battle
EDL	04:06:34,751	04:06:36,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They also tried to figure out
EDL	04:06:36,287	04:06:42,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Stratagems and ways to break up that Reformation because once those spearmen were no longer huddle shoulder to show
EDL	04:06:42,687	04:06:43,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They were vulnerable as hack
EDL	04:06:44,991	04:06:48,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That's why this is called the battle of the river granite
EDL	04:06:48,575	04:06:50,111	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because the Persian forces
EDL	04:06:50,623	04:06:52,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're on the other side of a river
EDL	04:06:54,463	04:06:57,279	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And on the far side of the river was a steep Bank
EDL	04:06:58,047	04:07:02,399	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And on top of that awaited a very long line of Persian cavalry
EDL	04:07:05,727	04:07:07,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The thought process seems to be in
EDL	04:07:07,775	04:07:08,799	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Seems pretty sound
EDL	04:07:09,567	04:07:10,847	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're looking at it
EDL	04:07:11,359	04:07:17,759	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That you're going to have to cross if you were the makedonian foot soldiers that give the Persians historically such a hard time

EDL	04:07:20,063	04:07:22,111	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You crossed this body of water
EDL	04:07:22,111	04:07:27,743	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you scramble up to the other side there's no way you're still maintaining your
EDL	04:07:27,743	04:07:29,791	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Shoulder to shoulder cohesion anymore
EDL	04:07:30,559	04:07:35,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And you have Cavalry awaiting you at the top of the rise to charge down on you
EDL	04:07:36,447	04:07:40,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That sounds like a pretty good plan if you're looking at it from the person point of view
EDL	04:07:41,823	04:07:48,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	For some reason they seem to a station there infantry too far back to take any part in the battle I read somewhere I think it's like a mile

EDL	04:07:48,991	04:07:50,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It's a big distance
EDL	04:07:50,783	04:07:53,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The last looks like a pretty good plan on paper if we're

EDL	04:07:57,951	04:08:04,351	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The other thing that has changed over a hundred fifty years apparently this is all very debated but but it's it's starting to be

EDL	04:08:05,375	04:08:07,167	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Cavalry has changed
EDL	04:08:07,167	04:08:11,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And 150 years since the earlier Greek war with the Persians
EDL	04:08:11,263	04:08:13,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Back then if you recall the Persians used to attack
EDL	04:08:13,823	04:08:20,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With missile Weapon by Squadron and sort of try to wear you down and they would attack you in hand-to-hand combat if you were like true

EDL	04:08:31,487	04:08:34,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And that's what the heavy Cavalry units on the Persian side due to

EDL	04:08:54,015	04:09:00,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And unlike the Greek Wars of a hundred fifty years ago where the Persian Cavalry really had no counterparts on the other side
EDL	04:09:00,159	04:09:06,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Here Persian and makedonian Cavalry often faced off against each other often these battles are going to involve infantry in

EDL	04:09:19,871	04:09:21,407	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And a lot of these battles

EDL	04:15:33,887	04:15:35,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As always with the Persian numbers historians know that

EDL	04:15:58,719	04:16:00,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this battle and that's not hard to believe
EDL	04:16:00,511	04:16:02,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Are you considering that you are in the Persian heart

EDL	04:16:04,607	04:16:09,727	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But I would have to remind myself in again this is the value of a historian from 100 years ago like Hans dalebrook from

EDL	04:16:11,263	04:16:16,895	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But delbrook reminds us and uses historical example to point out that just because you have a lot of people at a place
EDL	04:16:16,895	04:16:18,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Doesn't mean those people are soldiers
EDL	04:16:19,711	04:16:25,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We always had this concept that every human being out there was a potential person you could throw into the ranks in his delbrook points out no
EDL	04:16:26,367	04:16:29,183	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Any societies you have people who are warriors
EDL	04:16:29,183	04:16:30,975	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And people who make pottery
EDL	04:16:30,975	04:16:32,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And things like that are Farm
EDL	04:16:33,279	04:16:35,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And sometimes they can be malicious but he points out
EDL	04:16:35,839	04:16:38,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If the Persian army were a lot smaller than you thought it
EDL	04:16:38,911	04:16:41,215	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	An Empire that size your produce
EDL	04:16:41,215	04:16:44,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There are historical analogies all over the place for why that might
EDL	04:16:45,567	04:16:50,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Nonetheless however large this Army is that the Persian king of kings is leading personally
EDL	04:16:51,455	04:16:54,015	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It somehow manages to get behind Alexander the Great's army

EDL	04:17:01,439	04:17:05,791	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you believe in stories Arthur Ferrell says Alexander must have been shocked to find this out
EDL	04:17:06,303	04:17:07,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How did that happen and historians
EDL	04:17:08,351	04:17:12,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Argue over whether or not this was deliberate in a masterstroke by the Persian generals
EDL	04:17:13,215	04:17:16,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Or was it sort of an accident and they kind of found themselves

EDL	04:17:20,639	04:17:24,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This fact though is why if you look at the Battle that's about to happen
EDL	04:17:24,479	04:17:26,527	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It looks like the map needs to be turned upside down
EDL	04:17:27,039	04:17:30,367	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The armies appear to be on the wrong side but that's because
EDL	04:17:30,367	04:17:36,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The positions got reversed and that's why Alexander is coming north and the Persians are going south and they meet in this Coast
EDL	04:17:36,767	04:17:40,351	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Stop playing so you have the ocean on one side once like is guarded by the sea

EDL	04:17:42,655	04:17:45,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe two and a half miles

EDL	04:18:57,151	04:19:00,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is a battle where you see Alexander stand out of something
EDL	04:19:00,223	04:19:01,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really special
EDL	04:19:01,247	04:19:07,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And there are people who will say that even after this battle it still could have been autopilot that's how good this Army was and that's how good

EDL	04:19:42,975	04:19:44,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Opposite sides of a small stream
EDL	04:19:44,511	04:19:46,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Manestream gives you a little cover to deploy
EDL	04:19:47,071	04:19:52,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because in one of the little known fun parts about Ancient battle really even up to Napoleonic times and later
EDL	04:19:52,703	04:19:55,007	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If it takes a long time to deploy
EDL	04:19:55,519	04:19:56,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Think about it
EDL	04:19:56,287	04:20:01,151	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How many people you're talking about they all have to be in specific position so both sides take hours at this
EDL	04:20:01,919	04:20:03,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And in a place like ancient Greece
EDL	04:20:03,711	04:20:09,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a lot of cultures actually they had all these sort of cultural gentlemen's agreement I guess you could call them where we say things like
EDL	04:20:09,343	04:20:14,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Don't don't let nobody attacks anybody else is on Drew Brees right right and we'll say go when we go out
EDL	04:20:14,207	04:20:15,487	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Vikings did that
EDL	04:20:15,487	04:20:16,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Ancient Greeks did that
EDL	04:20:16,767	04:20:21,119	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But when you're fighting cross-culturally all those gentlemen's agreements got the window
EDL	04:20:21,631	04:20:28,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So both sides are on opposite sides of the street and they're all using light infantry and Cavalry to keep the other side from messing with them too much while they get
EDL	04:20:28,031	04:20:29,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They're soldiers in just the right spot
EDL	04:20:31,359	04:20:34,431	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Last-minute moves from one side to the other
EDL	04:20:34,431	04:20:36,223	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Countering this encounter in Latin
EDL	04:20:36,223	04:20:37,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Basically
EDL	04:20:37,247	04:20:40,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Persians line up a whole bunch of Calvary on their right flank
EDL	04:20:41,599	04:20:47,999	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And they're playing according to you know this is argued about to Bud Arthur Ferrell he's a good military has thrown the following and he goes
EDL	04:20:47,999	04:20:52,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Those with a general agreement that the Persians are trying to do a hammer and Anvil tactic and Alexander
EDL	04:20:53,119	04:20:55,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They're just doing it on opposite sides of the battlefield
EDL	04:20:56,959	04:20:59,007	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So Alexander going to lead a charge
EDL	04:20:59,007	04:21:00,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	On his right flank
EDL	04:21:01,311	04:21:07,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And try to crush the person Left Flank and then sweep around and go attack the Persian middle from behind and the Persians are going to try to do the
EDL	04:21:07,711	04:21:11,807	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Exact same thing on the opposite side of the battlefield where they've matched almost all their cowboy
EDL	04:21:13,087	04:21:14,623	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Now I can't help but think
EDL	04:21:15,391	04:21:20,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How much of a morale boost it has to be to your average Persian Soldier there
EDL	04:21:21,023	04:21:25,631	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You may be facing this demon from guide is Darth Vader character
EDL	04:21:25,631	04:21:32,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But all you have to do is look down your own battle line and 100 200 300 yards down the line you see the
EDL	04:21:32,031	04:21:32,799	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Sacred
EDL	04:21:33,311	04:21:35,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Chariot of Persia's
EDL	04:21:35,615	04:21:38,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	King of Kings drawn by the sacred white horses
EDL	04:21:38,943	04:21:40,991	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And surrounded by the royal guard
EDL	04:21:42,271	04:21:46,111	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This guy is not quite a God Like a pharaoh or something
EDL	04:21:46,623	04:21:49,695	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But he's about one tiny half step below that
EDL	04:21:50,463	04:21:52,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You have to feel pretty confident
EDL	04:21:53,023	04:21:56,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you're on the Persian side and you look in the King of Kings is right there
EDL	04:21:57,631	04:22:00,959	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What we said earlier Alexander the greatest makedonija is
EDL	04:22:00,959	04:22:04,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Head of state fighting in hand-to-hand combat in these battles
EDL	04:22:04,543	04:22:07,359	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is the first time that the head of state for makedonija
EDL	04:22:07,359	04:22:11,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Face is on the opposite side of the battlefield under 200 yards away at the start
EDL	04:22:12,479	04:22:15,039	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The head of state of the Empire he trying to take down
EDL	04:22:16,319	04:22:17,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And I love that I mean that
EDL	04:22:17,855	04:22:20,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Reminds me of that video when I was a kid
EDL	04:22:20,927	04:22:27,327	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Genesis did one with during the Cold War that had Ronald Reagan in the head of the Soviet Union fighting hand-to-hand in it
EDL	04:22:27,327	04:22:27,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Order something
EDL	04:22:29,631	04:22:32,191	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I tried to come up with like a modern analogy
EDL	04:22:32,191	04:22:36,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And they're all so ridiculous but they're still fun I mean imagine the Second World War
EDL	04:22:36,031	04:22:36,799	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where
EDL	04:22:36,799	04:22:43,199	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You're fighting this way and on one side of the battlefield as Winston Churchill in the British forces and they look across
EDL	04:22:43,199	04:22:48,063	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	No man's land a hundred two hundred yards across the field and they are surrounded by
EDL	04:22:48,063	04:22:52,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know maybe the mounted SS lifeguard is out of Hitler
EDL	04:22:52,671	04:22:54,719	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	See them on the other side and
EDL	04:22:55,487	04:22:56,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Depending on
EDL	04:22:56,511	04:22:59,071	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How you conduct yourself if you want to
EDL	04:22:59,583	04:23:00,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You can go get them
EDL	04:23:03,423	04:23:07,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is once again we're Alexander looks very homeric in the sense that
EDL	04:23:07,519	04:23:10,847	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	She almost comes through on the sources he wants to make this personal
EDL	04:23:11,615	04:23:13,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And I'm not sure the king of Persian does
EDL	04:23:16,735	04:23:20,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Not wanting to weigh in on the controversy of all the arguments over hubby

EDL	04:23:26,463	04:23:27,231	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'll let him do it
EDL	04:23:28,255	04:23:29,535	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	After saying that the
EDL	04:23:29,535	04:23:31,071	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persians were using
EDL	04:23:31,071	04:23:33,375	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A hammer and Anvil strategy
EDL	04:23:33,375	04:23:34,655	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He goes on to say
EDL	04:23:34,655	04:23:36,191	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That Alexander is to
EDL	04:23:36,191	04:23:36,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Pieces quote
EDL	04:23:37,471	04:23:41,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Ironically Alexander's plan was essentially the same as his opponents
EDL	04:23:41,311	04:23:43,359	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And we can see clearly in this battle
EDL	04:23:43,359	04:23:48,735	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How the traditions of ancient near Eastern and Greco Macedonian Warfare have been fused
EDL	04:23:48,735	04:23:53,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Alexander hope to breakthrough Darius is left Center in a cavalry charge
EDL	04:23:53,343	04:23:59,487	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Andrew Weil around against the rear of the Persian Center in an identical hammer and Anvil operation
EDL	04:23:59,487	04:24:02,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is Alexander near the Persian position
EDL	04:24:02,303	04:24:05,119	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He forced his army to advance of the slow pace
EDL	04:24:05,119	04:24:08,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Just as the Persians had done against Cyrus at chew noxa
EDL	04:24:08,703	04:24:14,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Finally when the macedonians were well within bowshot probably had about a distance of 100 yards
EDL	04:24:14,591	04:24:17,407	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Alexander ordered an attack on the double
EDL	04:24:17,407	04:24:19,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	With contingents of Cavalry on his right
EDL	04:24:19,711	04:24:22,015	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Supported by infantry close behind
EDL	04:24:22,015	04:24:23,807	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He charged the river at a gallop
EDL	04:24:24,319	04:24:28,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Persian skirmishers in front of their line probably fell back in panic
EDL	04:24:28,415	04:24:32,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Creating confusion in the main infantry line on the Persian left fender
EDL	04:24:32,767	04:24:34,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And Alexander smash through
EDL	04:24:35,327	04:24:35,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And quote
EDL	04:24:37,631	04:24:39,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This battle is often portrayed
EDL	04:24:40,191	04:24:41,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A Race Against Time
EDL	04:24:42,239	04:24:48,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because Alexander is blowing away the opponents that he and his Cavalry are facing in front of them the problem is
EDL	04:24:48,639	04:24:49,919	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He's having problems
EDL	04:24:49,919	04:24:51,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In all the other sectors of the battlefield
EDL	04:24:52,223	04:24:56,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the sentries having problems against the Greek mercenaries hired by the Persians
EDL	04:24:56,319	04:25:00,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And his left leg is in real trouble cuz that's where the Persian version
EDL	04:25:00,159	04:25:02,719	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Of the hammer and Anvil tactics are hammering
EDL	04:25:02,719	04:25:07,071	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They put all their Cavalry on their right flank and now the poor makedonian
EDL	04:25:07,071	04:25:10,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Calvary really Greek at the sailing Cavalry on their left leg
EDL	04:25:10,143	04:25:15,007	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is trying to hold their own without collapsing so Alexander has to manage to
EDL	04:25:15,007	04:25:16,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Finish this battle
EDL	04:25:17,055	04:25:17,823	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the
EDL	04:25:18,335	04:25:22,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Distant position he has on one flank before his Center in his left leg collapses
EDL	04:25:24,223	04:25:27,551	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The sources say Alexander in keeping with the original plan
EDL	04:25:27,551	04:25:29,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Swings his Cavalry to his left
EDL	04:25:30,111	04:25:32,927	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And begins attacking the rear of the Persian line
EDL	04:25:33,439	04:25:37,279	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But is he going to be able to win the battle there before his own Army collapses
EDL	04:25:38,303	04:25:39,583	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And then traditionally
EDL	04:25:40,095	04:25:41,887	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're told he spots
EDL	04:25:42,655	04:25:43,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The alternative
EDL	04:25:45,471	04:25:47,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	One way to destroy
EDL	04:25:47,263	04:25:52,895	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	An ancient army used to destroy the ancient army another way to destroy the ancient army is simply to kill the commander

EDL	04:25:56,479	04:25:59,807	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But if the Commander is the head of state and
EDL	04:25:59,807	04:26:01,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A near god-king
EDL	04:26:02,111	04:26:03,903	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Chances are better than normal

EDL	04:26:12,863	04:26:15,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And in true homeric fashion
EDL	04:26:16,447	04:26:17,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Makes right

EDL	04:28:41,855	04:28:42,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this case

EDL	04:29:04,639	04:29:10,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is not a fluke anymore Alexander is in the process of toppling the Persian Empire
EDL	04:29:10,783	04:29:13,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the mood historically speaking seem to change
EDL	04:29:14,367	04:29:15,647	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Now we start getting

EDL	04:29:33,823	04:29:34,847	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What's more
EDL	04:29:34,847	04:29:38,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some of Alexander's generals people he inherited from his father was starting to think that
EDL	04:29:39,455	04:29:42,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What they've conquered to this point looks pretty good
EDL	04:29:42,783	04:29:49,183	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And maybe you might want to walk away from the gambling table at Las Vegas at this point with what you want rather than gamma
EDL	04:29:49,183	04:29:49,695	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Anymore
EDL	04:29:50,207	04:29:51,743	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You know an overreach
EDL	04:29:52,767	04:29:54,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But they're not Alexander
EDL	04:29:55,327	04:29:56,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And he is
EDL	04:29:56,863	04:29:57,631	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A fact
EDL	04:29:58,399	04:30:00,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He continually likes to point out to them
EDL	04:30:03,519	04:30:05,567	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Traditionally at this point in the story
EDL	04:30:06,847	04:30:08,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where the Persians begin
EDL	04:30:08,639	04:30:10,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To offer Alexander
EDL	04:30:10,175	04:30:10,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Deals
EDL	04:30:12,223	04:30:14,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He supposed to get letters or
EDL	04:30:14,271	04:30:20,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Envoys the ancient sources say from the Persian king basically offering him territory and other things in exchange for
EDL	04:30:20,927	04:30:22,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Deciding you've had enough
EDL	04:30:23,743	04:30:24,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I think a little
EDL	04:30:24,767	04:30:26,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Peace inside me died
EDL	04:30:27,071	04:30:33,215	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	When I read theory on story modern history and he suggested that all these traditional accounts which all the historians I grew up reading
EDL	04:30:33,727	04:30:34,495	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As gospel
EDL	04:30:35,263	04:30:41,663	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Almost certainly nothing but makedonian propaganda from the time. As I said earlier you know it's hard enough to try to figure out what
EDL	04:30:41,663	04:30:42,431	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What's going on with the
EDL	04:30:42,431	04:30:46,783	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Normal Source problems you add the makedonian propaganda
EDL	04:30:46,783	04:30:49,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And unfortunately for us some of the best stuff then
EDL	04:30:49,855	04:30:52,927	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is stuff that Brianna would have us believe is a direct
EDL	04:30:52,927	04:30:54,463	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Fabrication for
EDL	04:30:55,231	04:30:56,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	More real-world purposes
EDL	04:30:57,791	04:31:00,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	None the less you know you can actually tell quite a bit about
EDL	04:31:00,863	04:31:02,399	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Other things by
EDL	04:31:02,399	04:31:03,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The propaganda
EDL	04:31:04,959	04:31:05,727	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And in this case
EDL	04:31:06,239	04:31:11,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And what we used to and not still wishes actually like these official you don't from the desk of Alexander the Great

EDL	04:31:17,503	04:31:22,623	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where the makedonian is trying to give you a feel for a certain relationship in a relationship is this new one
EDL	04:31:22,623	04:31:27,231	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At least in the eyes of King Alexander is he calls himself in this propagandistic note
EDL	04:31:27,743	04:31:33,375	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the king of kings of the ancient and Grand Persian Empire he refers to merely as

EDL	04:38:59,839	04:39:05,727	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In contrast to what historians when I was growing up used to say that they didn't learn anything and they could never do any better than

EDL	04:39:07,775	04:39:11,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They did have things to break up the Greek formations and they brought them to this battle
EDL	04:39:12,127	04:39:12,895	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where they were needed
EDL	04:39:14,687	04:39:19,551	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The first of these things that's fascinating from historical standpoint cuz it's probably the first time
EDL	04:39:19,551	04:39:21,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Greeks ever saw this ever
EDL	04:39:22,111	04:39:28,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And must have been the number one talked about item is these makedonian soldiers looked across the battlefield and saw for the first time
EDL	04:39:29,279	04:39:30,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Elephants
EDL	04:39:30,303	04:39:30,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Indian
EDL	04:39:32,351	04:39:33,631	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Traditionally about 15 of them
EDL	04:39:34,655	04:39:39,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That must have been something to talk to your neighbor about in the ranks as you waited to come into contact
EDL	04:39:40,543	04:39:42,847	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And later evidence was show
EDL	04:39:43,615	04:39:49,759	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Elephants are a wonderful tool against the makedonian Army because they're good against both the hammer and the Anvil Elliman
EDL	04:39:50,783	04:39:51,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Against it
EDL	04:39:51,807	04:39:53,599	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Charging heavy Cavalry elephant
EDL	04:39:54,111	04:39:56,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Tacticalories usually won't come near them
EDL	04:39:57,439	04:40:00,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If they ever do get caught by the elephant's it's awful for
EDL	04:40:00,255	04:40:00,767	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The cavalry
EDL	04:40:01,791	04:40:03,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But against the densely packed
EDL	04:40:03,839	04:40:04,607	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Phalanx
EDL	04:40:06,143	04:40:07,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They could be murderous
EDL	04:40:08,447	04:40:12,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You would think they would be easy to kill but later evidence shows not so easy and you get
EDL	04:40:13,311	04:40:16,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Four or five of those things stomping around
EDL	04:40:16,127	04:40:22,015	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And intentionally created crowd of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder and it could be very ugly indeed
EDL	04:40:23,039	04:40:25,087	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you follow up with form troops
EDL	04:40:25,855	04:40:28,671	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To take advantage of that Carnage that's not a bad strategy
EDL	04:40:30,207	04:40:36,351	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But while breaking up these clothes order troops is definitely a part of the Persian strategy doesn't look like the elephants were what they were relying
EDL	04:40:37,631	04:40:38,655	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Instead they have
EDL	04:40:39,679	04:40:45,055	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Something right out of like a Mad Max film or one of those 1950s Ben-Hur movies
EDL	04:40:45,823	04:40:47,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They have saved

EDL	04:40:48,383	04:40:50,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	They have like 200 of them

EDL	04:40:54,527	04:40:56,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I've always thought this was an interesting weapon
EDL	04:40:57,343	04:40:58,623	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But nobody knows what they look
EDL	04:40:59,135	04:41:00,415	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Everybody tries to recreate
EDL	04:41:00,927	04:41:05,279	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	A visual image of it from the literary sources and everyone's take is a little different
EDL	04:41:06,303	04:41:08,095	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To imagine some combination
EDL	04:41:08,095	04:41:08,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Heavy chariot
EDL	04:41:09,375	04:41:11,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Cutting blades you're starting to get there though
EDL	04:41:13,471	04:41:17,567	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I usually run into has the equivalent of about 3 foot long swords
EDL	04:41:18,079	04:41:19,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	1 each
EDL	04:41:19,103	04:41:20,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Sticking out
EDL	04:41:20,127	04:41:23,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From the end of the wheels of The Chariot and then either
EDL	04:41:23,711	04:41:28,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Something projecting forward from the cab of The Chariot like a spear or blades
EDL	04:41:28,575	04:41:33,695	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	We're blades facing downward underneath the cab so it's like a giant human lawn mower
EDL	04:41:35,487	04:41:36,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There were stories
EDL	04:41:37,535	04:41:38,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Earlier in history
EDL	04:41:39,327	04:41:43,679	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Two or three of these things have attacked a Greek Phalanx that was forming up
EDL	04:41:44,191	04:41:50,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And created a ton of Carnage and then Persian Cavalry swooped in to take advantage of the chaos and disorder and destroyed the four
EDL	04:41:50,591	04:41:51,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Formation
EDL	04:41:51,615	04:41:52,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So you can
EDL	04:41:53,151	04:41:56,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	See how the Persians were thinking I mean the two or three side chariot
EDL	04:41:56,479	04:42:00,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Were you able to do that you know 10 20 30 40 50 years ago
EDL	04:42:00,575	04:42:04,927	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What my two hundred of them along our front lines do it's not a bad idea is it
EDL	04:42:07,231	04:42:11,839	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It certainly shows that they were thinking outside the box a little bit contrary to the historical

EDL	04:42:32,831	04:42:33,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Slightly useless
EDL	04:42:34,623	04:42:35,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Almost like

EDL	04:42:39,999	04:42:42,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And in the midst of it all in the center of the traditional place
EDL	04:42:43,327	04:42:46,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Any Secretariat again surrounded by his Royal Guard again
EDL	04:42:47,423	04:42:49,727	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the great king of kings of Persia
EDL	04:42:50,239	04:42:51,775	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Pius the 3rd
EDL	04:42:51,775	04:42:54,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Still able apparently to command
EDL	04:42:54,591	04:42:58,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The Loyalty of enough people to raise an army this big and get it here
EDL	04:42:58,687	04:42:59,455	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Despite the
EDL	04:42:59,967	04:43:01,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Events of two years ago
EDL	04:43:02,527	04:43:05,087	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And as I look at this Persian Army on this field
EDL	04:43:05,855	04:43:07,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I think to myself you know
EDL	04:43:07,391	04:43:10,207	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Not a bad setup I take that Army if you told me
EDL	04:43:10,719	04:43:12,255	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I had to fight one side of the other
EDL	04:43:13,279	04:43:19,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But you know and I'm absolutely using 20/20 hindsight here although I wonder what Alexander the Great was thinking
EDL	04:43:19,423	04:43:20,959	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	If you're looking at that
EDL	04:43:20,959	04:43:21,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Army
EDL	04:43:21,983	04:43:24,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I'm trying to figure out where its weak point is
EDL	04:43:25,311	04:43:27,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What if you thought that the weak point might be sitting
EDL	04:43:28,127	04:43:29,407	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the sacred chariot
EDL	04:43:31,711	04:43:33,503	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What is that Army's weak point
EDL	04:43:34,783	04:43:36,831	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the psychology of it
EDL	04:43:36,831	04:43:38,623	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Quasi Divine ruler
EDL	04:43:40,671	04:43:46,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe it's a sign that Alexander thinks that this is a dangerous Army and that it is deployed well
EDL	04:43:46,815	04:43:50,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	3 doesn't just charge into some spot he thinks he can break through that would be
EDL	04:43:51,679	04:43:53,983	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Standard operating procedure if you saw such a spot
EDL	04:43:54,751	04:43:56,543	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this case he goes to his typical
EDL	04:43:56,543	04:43:57,311	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Plan B
EDL	04:43:57,823	04:44:02,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is to use tactical maneuvering on the battlefield to see if he can create that spot
EDL	04:44:04,479	04:44:07,295	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I got a fully armored and protected enemy can you get them
EDL	04:44:07,295	04:44:10,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To raise up their arm and expose the vulnerable underbelly
EDL	04:44:12,671	04:44:18,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As soon as Alexander sees that vulnerable spot he will launch himself like a requiere into the vitals of the
EDL	04:44:19,583	04:44:20,863	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Enemies
EDL	04:44:20,863	04:44:21,887	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Vulnerable underbelly
EDL	04:44:22,655	04:44:23,423	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As he always does
EDL	04:44:25,983	04:44:32,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this bottle that's what a lot of the early Maneuvers are about Alexander starts moving his army were told kind of forward but to the right
EDL	04:44:32,895	04:44:36,479	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To the right would take Alexander's Army into rough ground
EDL	04:44:36,479	04:44:42,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Rough ground is where those chariots could not operate them in the king that had that land in front of his chariots levels for real
EDL	04:44:42,879	04:44:45,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He can't let Alexandra move the battlefield
EDL	04:44:45,951	04:44:50,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	So he sends out Cavalry that had been in his front rank
EDL	04:44:50,047	04:44:51,583	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	To stop Alexander
EDL	04:44:51,583	04:44:53,887	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Indigo around his flight can you get this
EDL	04:44:53,887	04:44:58,239	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Calorie battle on the right plane to develop with both sides feeding more troops into it
EDL	04:44:58,239	04:45:00,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But this is working for Alexander
EDL	04:45:00,287	04:45:04,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because he's planned to have calorie to feed into that where the Persians are taking their ears
EDL	04:45:04,895	04:45:07,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	From their Frontline denuding a part of their Frontline
EDL	04:45:08,223	04:45:12,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And a certain point Alexander with the Exquisite timing that he's known for
EDL	04:45:12,319	04:45:15,647	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Decides that they've denuded enough so that that's a weak spot
EDL	04:45:16,671	04:45:19,487	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And once again you know the Imagine Darth Vader
EDL	04:45:19,999	04:45:26,143	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Or in this case The Demon King at the head of his troops charging an a wedge so it's like that guy
EDL	04:45:26,655	04:45:31,775	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And then two guys behind them and then for guys behind them I mean he's the tip of the spear literally
EDL	04:45:32,287	04:45:33,567	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the head of state
EDL	04:45:34,335	04:45:36,127	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Charges into the gap
EDL	04:45:36,639	04:45:39,199	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is on the left center of the Persian line
EDL	04:45:39,967	04:45:40,991	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Which is right near
EDL	04:45:41,759	04:45:43,039	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The royal guard
EDL	04:45:43,039	04:45:44,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And Darius the Third
EDL	04:45:46,367	04:45:47,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In the last battle
EDL	04:45:48,671	04:45:52,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	You sort of had the impression from the sources in The Way It Was Written that maybe
EDL	04:45:53,023	04:45:55,327	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Alexander had never intended to go out
EDL	04:45:55,327	04:45:57,887	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The king that got into the back of it
EDL	04:45:57,887	04:46:00,191	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Ranks it became the quickest way to achieve his goals
EDL	04:46:00,959	04:46:04,287	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In this bottle you get the impression that that was the goal
EDL	04:46:05,311	04:46:06,591	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Maybe he decided
EDL	04:46:06,591	04:46:07,615	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That this guy was
EDL	04:46:08,127	04:46:08,895	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Skittish
EDL	04:46:09,407	04:46:10,175	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What did he say
EDL	04:46:10,175	04:46:10,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Benches
EDL	04:46:12,735	04:46:16,319	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because Alexander goes at him and homeric fashion again
EDL	04:46:17,087	04:46:19,391	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This is where you get into the idea
EDL	04:46:20,159	04:46:23,231	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Of this guy maybe being the weak Link in the armor
EDL	04:46:23,231	04:46:23,743	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	At this point
EDL	04:46:25,023	04:46:27,327	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What would one of his predecessors
EDL	04:46:27,327	04:46:29,887	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I've done in a situation that's about to occur
EDL	04:46:30,399	04:46:32,703	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is the situation that's about to occur
EDL	04:46:33,215	04:46:35,775	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Is that this guy is going to relive
EDL	04:46:35,775	04:46:37,823	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	One of the scariest moments
EDL	04:46:37,823	04:46:39,103	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Of his life right now
EDL	04:46:39,103	04:46:43,199	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Dries the third has almost certainly when you imagine he's a human being
EDL	04:46:43,711	04:46:45,759	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Seen this in his dreams before
EDL	04:46:46,271	04:46:49,343	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Alexander and these murderous makedonian
EDL	04:46:49,343	04:46:53,439	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Smashing into the guard that's around him which is like a human wall of people
EDL	04:46:53,951	04:46:55,487	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And beginning to cut
EDL	04:46:55,487	04:46:58,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And hack and stab their way
EDL	04:46:58,559	04:47:00,095	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Person by person
EDL	04:47:00,607	04:47:02,399	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Yard by yard
EDL	04:47:02,399	04:47:05,471	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Towards him as he watches in his chariot
EDL	04:47:05,983	04:47:06,751	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	There is a
EDL	04:47:07,519	04:47:13,663	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Fragment of a mosaic that they found in Pompeii which is a copy of what was thought to be a near contemporary orig
EDL	04:47:14,175	04:47:17,503	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What's famous and it probably shows the scene from the Battle of issus
EDL	04:47:18,015	04:47:21,087	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But it's the same scene we're seeing a replay
EDL	04:47:21,599	04:47:24,927	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Must have seemed like a reply to the King of Persia 2
EDL	04:47:24,927	04:47:27,487	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And in that scene you see Alexander
EDL	04:47:27,487	04:47:30,047	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	On his horse stabbing one of the
EDL	04:47:30,559	04:47:33,375	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Royal Guardsmen in front of the Persian chariot
EDL	04:47:33,887	04:47:40,031	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And the King of Persia with eyes as big as saucers it's like the moment before he takes off at the Battle of issus
EDL	04:47:42,335	04:47:44,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And I have to say is I've been trying to look
EDL	04:47:44,383	04:47:47,711	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Pictures from the Persian side the whole way through I have a lot of sympathy
EDL	04:47:49,247	04:47:50,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Where
EDL	04:47:50,271	04:47:51,551	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Jiraiya 30 is
EDL	04:47:52,575	04:47:53,855	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	This guy wasn't
EDL	04:47:53,855	04:47:56,159	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Really boring Brenda
EDL	04:47:56,671	04:48:02,559	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He's obviously Brave remember he's a guy who killed the rebel leader of the Barbarian leader in single combat
EDL	04:48:04,095	04:48:06,911	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But this is a guy who gets criticized for doing something
EDL	04:48:07,679	04:48:11,519	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I would think all but the most extraordinary people would do
EDL	04:48:13,055	04:48:14,335	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Because for the second
EDL	04:48:14,335	04:48:15,359	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Time in a row
EDL	04:48:16,383	04:48:19,967	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	He's going to look at Alexander and the cutting machine
EDL	04:48:20,479	04:48:22,527	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Getting nearer to him as he watches his
EDL	04:48:22,527	04:48:24,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Kinsman slaughtered in front of him
EDL	04:48:25,599	04:48:27,903	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And he's going to turn around and run
EDL	04:48:31,487	04:48:32,511	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Even a guy
EDL	04:48:33,023	04:48:33,791	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Who will
EDL	04:48:33,791	04:48:37,375	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Fight and kill a person with edged weapons mano-a-mano
EDL	04:48:38,143	04:48:39,935	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Might be forgiven you would think
EDL	04:48:40,447	04:48:46,847	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	When instead of facing a single individual he's facing a crowd of mounted killers were going to roll over him like a
EDL	04:48:46,847	04:48:47,359	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Wave
EDL	04:48:48,383	04:48:50,943	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	How many people would stand there in the chariot
EDL	04:48:51,455	04:48:57,087	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And wait patiently as they cut their way towards you especially if you've already been through this once before
EDL	04:48:58,623	04:49:01,183	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	It had to be the biggest nightmare this guy that had
EDL	04:49:01,695	04:49:06,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Last two years and here it is deja vu all over again as Yogi Berra
EDL	04:49:06,303	04:49:06,815	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I would say
EDL	04:49:09,119	04:49:12,959	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	I got me wondering once again about the ability of a single person to impact history
EDL	04:49:13,983	04:49:20,383	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	As we all know it's it's usually all kinds of things working together and paying off each other and giant Trends and forces and things like that
EDL	04:49:20,383	04:49:22,687	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What we talked about how extraordinary individuals
EDL	04:49:23,199	04:49:25,247	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Can soda sometimes push the envelope in
EDL	04:49:25,247	04:49:30,879	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	And make the difference and pain the meteor off in a different direction and change the impetus and all those kind of things
EDL	04:49:31,903	04:49:32,927	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What's the opposite
EDL	04:49:33,695	04:49:34,719	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Unextraordinary
EDL	04:49:36,511	04:49:38,303	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Did you give somebody in a position
EDL	04:49:39,583	04:49:43,679	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	That is less than what you could normally expect to have in Key West
EDL	04:49:45,983	04:49:49,055	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Counting system is based on clawing your way to the top
EDL	04:49:49,055	04:49:52,639	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	In a theoretical merit-based system you see this less of the time
EDL	04:49:53,919	04:49:58,271	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	But sometimes any inherited systems or systems like this remember this guy got a job for me
EDL	04:49:58,271	04:50:00,575	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Supposed poisoner who put him into
EDL	04:50:01,087	04:50:02,111	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	The royal
EDL	04:50:02,623	04:50:04,671	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Position cuz he thought he could control them
EDL	04:50:06,207	04:50:11,583	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	What is that guy's just an ordinary person for the most part who ends up in this extraordinary roll
EDL	04:50:13,119	04:50:17,983	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Sometimes you can get away with it after almost monarchies have all sorts of safeguards and
EDL	04:50:17,983	04:50:19,263	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Things in place to keep
EDL	04:50:19,775	04:50:25,663	| dchha58_Kings_of_Kings_III |	Some less than talented Manar from destroying the whole thing right won't let him make a stupid military decision that's why you
