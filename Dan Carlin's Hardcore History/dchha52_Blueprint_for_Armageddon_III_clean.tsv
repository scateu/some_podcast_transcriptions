EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who by this time look like

EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or something like a missing link

EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:29,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's for an update on whatever happened with the war he was following
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Inches tell me
EDL	00:05:31,775	00:05:32,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When was the world
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:35,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in one of the more famous
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:41,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Responses you'll ever get about this cuz it says so much in a couple of sentences and that's why I've gone down
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:45,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In history the benefactor supposed to have answered his when was the war over question with
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The war is over
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Millions are dead
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Europe is mad
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:52,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The world is Matt
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Shackleton react to this news
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With horrified disbelief
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And he's just catching up
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The rest of the world
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:04,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because no one can believe
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:09,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At the level of intensity that this conflict displays from minute one
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Can be sustained
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:14,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Remember this war starts very differently than the Second World War
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:17,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The second world war kind of ramps up slowly
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:22,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first world war is like someone pulling the pin on a grenade and everything explodes at once
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:24,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Everyone attacks it
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There are a lot more people
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:29,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Killed in the first month of the first World War
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the first month of the sack
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:32,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In fact so many people are killed
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:36,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the people living through this. Have nothing to compare this to
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The numbers are off the charts
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean look at what
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:43,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They were looking at is normal casual
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:49,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By the way this is considered to be horrible could be bad it could be like the russo-japanese war
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On steroids couldn't it
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That war happened two decades before the first World War

EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know the French and British victory at the Marne
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:52,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans have been the one really dishing out the heavy blows

EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:15,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Backward

EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So that they can

EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,175	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In Airline
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:32,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That was exploited by French and British troops as Churchill famously said is only he can
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Those troops were
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:36,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Probing their way into the German liver
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's a
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:44,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Classic maneuver to try to pull your troops back and reorganize your line when it's also a dangerous
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:46,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it also means
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That the Germans have given up on the silk
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Call Schlieffen Plan
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I find it interesting sometimes when you read
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some of the histories
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first World War
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:01,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You will find yourself in a very similar situation
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the commanders on both sides
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of the western what will become the Western Front
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that is
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:11,999	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You'll be studying this as though you're playing around with
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Toy soldiers
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:19,935	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean I'll read stuff with Hillside in this division did this and pulled back to here and then you're totally losing track
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of the human element
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:26,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the problem with that is if you don't understand the condition of the people on the ground
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:28,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You're going to create all sorts of plans
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:32,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It don't take into account what they can actually carry out
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean for example
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:36,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The general staff
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:37,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of all these armies
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:41,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are tens of miles behind where the fighting is I mean
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:46,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Most of them the German general staff example are sitting in wonderful French chateau
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:50,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With roaring fireplaces drinking wine out of crystal
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:57,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Glasses and playing with maps and little protractors trying to decide where to move people and what to do with them
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:00,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the British and the French commanders are often doing the same thing
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is is that these little
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:06,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Protractors in these armies that they're moving around on maps
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Bear no resemblance
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:11,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To what the human beings on the ground or dealing with
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The human beings on the ground or spent
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Both sides
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:19,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Have worn themselves down to the nub
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:25,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I can hardly function anymore I mean this is the point in the war once the German start retreating after the battle of the Marne
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Where the British and French commanders think they've got them on the Run
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:31,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sir John French the British commander
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:38,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Thanks but he's going to be in Berlin in 6 weeks it's going to be over will unleash the Cavalry will launch this massive Pursuit will just
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who are the enemy whose routing and it'll be all over
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is a Sir John French's troops are in no condition to do that
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:46,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In fact
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Every side is finding out
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Another one of the new realities of Modern Warfare
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:55,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that's that they use ammunition at a pace
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But nobody was prepared for
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At this point in the conflict
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Everybody is actually rationing
EDL	00:13:02,591	00:13:03,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Artillery
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:09,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We can't even use the guns the way they want to because they don't have enough Sheldon take the Russians as a perfect example
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At this point in the war
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:15,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians are producing
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:17,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	35000 artillery shells a month
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sounds great doesn't it

EDL	00:26:46,144	00:26:52,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And putting up barriers in front of you begins to fortify the entire line on both sides and in some spots.
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Germans in the French
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:55,872	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are only a couple hundred yards from each other
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:59,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fortification of the entire line
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Changes this war
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:06,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In ways that the generals on either side or unprepared for they don't know what to do
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,184	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So they go back to the
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In training
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:11,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What would you say
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:13,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Find a flight
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:14,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turn the flank
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Attack in the rear
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:22,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is is that there's only one tiny little area of this more than 400 Mile Line
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:26,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're in heaven calcified into an almost seizure like situation
EDL	00:27:27,104	00:27:28,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that's the area be
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Between
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In this battle at the river and that is just happened
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,504	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the ocean
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the north
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:35,296	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's not very big
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Zone
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:40,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And both the British and the French on one side and the Germans on the other
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,184	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Begin a
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Crab like
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dance of Death
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As one historian
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:46,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Describes it
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:49,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trying to probe their way towards Open Country
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For a very long time
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,240	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This was known as the race to the Sea
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But historians have come to hate that term because
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:28:00,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He gives the false idea that somehow
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Reaching the sea is the goal
EDL	00:28:02,432	00:28:04,224	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All about the sides with in fact
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:06,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If both sides reach the sea
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:08,320	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It means that there are no flanks anymore
EDL	00:28:09,344	00:28:10,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there will be several
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,672	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Big battles between
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:14,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The armies as they collide
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:17,536	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In their attempt to find an open flame to turn
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:19,840	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now
EDL	00:28:20,352	00:28:24,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's worth pointing out here that won't worry about experiences the most complicated War
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:26,240	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I've ever studied
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:30,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's a very unusual conflict because in many cases
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:33,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The battlefield is not going to change
EDL	00:28:34,176	00:28:38,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This area up near the franco-belgian border for example is going to become
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:39,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of the worst
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:42,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Killing ground extended Killing Grounds in all human history
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Later in the war
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:48,000	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Troops marching up to this Battle Ground will be able to smell it
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Before they actually get there
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In addition
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:58,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When one side attacks the other side will often counter-attack so if you look at the battle on a map
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:04,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It makes no sense at all I've got 400 page books that deal with just single encounters
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:07,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Between the two sides and it's impossible to make heads or tails of it
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:10,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Even with maps even if you're an expert
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm part of the reason why because the nature of battle has changed
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:16,672	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Armies are staying in contact with each other
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:23,840	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's very different than through most of human history through most of human history Armies come together there's a short Sharp
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:24,608	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Clash and then they
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:27,680	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Break contact and move in opposite directions again
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:31,776	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Battles that last more than one day are extremely rare
EDL	00:29:31,776	00:29:33,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Up until this time.
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:37,152	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These armies aren't going to break
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:39,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're going to stay
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:44,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On opposite sides of a short little no man's land and hold each other by the
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:44,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The throat
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:47,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Even on so-called
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:52,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Quiet parts of the front hundreds or thousands of men can be killed every day
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:54,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now this is not unheard of
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Near the
EDL	00:29:56,096	00:29:58,656	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	End stages of the US Civil War
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Ulysses S Grant a northern General
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:07,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Will have a similar strategy where he maintains contact with the Enemy grab them by the throat doesn't let them go
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:10,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Island grinds them down the strategy of attrition
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But that's new
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The European experience
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:16,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And neither side's giving up yet they're going to try
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:19,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Define that blank until there is no flying anymore
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:24,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That race to the Sea will involve several more big battles including one that involves
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:27,584	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know what's left of the poor Belgian Army
EDL	00:30:28,352	00:30:32,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Remember the Belgian Army was what the Germans thought we're going to be a bunch of chocolate soldiers
EDL	00:30:32,704	00:30:35,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And instead they put up this heroic
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:36,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Doom resistance to them
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:40,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Enough fighting and being pushed backwards every step of the way
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:41,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Once the Germans
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:43,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Replay on their lines at the riveraine
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:45,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Their entire
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:48,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Blank is threatened by the parts of Belgium that haven't fallen to them yet
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:52,672	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Including the Giant and vital Port City of Antwerp
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:55,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So this is when the Germans go take all that
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:31:02,400	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A pound and work with those same enormous guns that they destroyed the Belgian forts with at the beginning of the war
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:08,288	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they pushed the Belgian Army all the ways that the belgians are sitting there with their backs to the ocean
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There's no place left to run
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:18,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the Belgian King is with them and at one point he orders his officers to stand behind the trenches and shoot anybody
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:23,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Belgian soldiers that their run away and they stay there being pounded by the artillery
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Until they can't
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Stop
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:27,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They realized
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If they don't hold that area
EDL	00:31:29,792	00:31:34,656	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans are going to be the one who find that open flanken the turn the British and the French in this is
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:40,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You the part of the war where it looks like the Germans might actually reverse the entire Battle of the Marne results
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,824	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And went anyway
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the belgians do
EDL	00:31:45,152	00:31:46,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something that is
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are there nuclear option
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:49,504	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Huntington
EDL	00:31:49,504	00:31:52,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's a sacrifice that might have saved the war for the allies
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:31:57,696	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Remember Belgium is one of those areas of Europe it is actually
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:01,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the most part this part of Flanders that were talking about in Belgium
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Below sea level
EDL	00:32:02,816	00:32:05,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the reason that it even exists because
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:09,216	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In Forever the belgians have been pumping out water and building dikes
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:11,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And things like that to keep the ocean out
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:16,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the Belgian When Things become desperate to the point of Doomsday
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:18,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Blows up the dikes
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:23,296	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Belgian King makes the decision to let the sea water in
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:24,320	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	October 22nd
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:30,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's a true sacrifice because he's not just flooding one of the more fertile parts of his country
EDL	00:32:30,208	00:32:31,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's plotting it with seawater
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:37,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the saltwater will do terrible damage to the fertility of the region remember the Roman supposedly
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:40,192	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Would so salt into the ground
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:43,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of the territory of their very worst enemies
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:45,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So that nothing would ever grow there again
EDL	00:32:46,080	00:32:48,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The belgians have done this to themselves
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:49,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Voluntarily
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:50,944	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To protect
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,224	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The very end
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:56,320	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	End of the Allied line and keep the Germans from breaking through and perhaps taking the channel
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:03,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans have no idea what's going on at the water level rises
EDL	00:33:03,744	00:33:05,536	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But within a couple of days
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:09,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There's a five mile wide shoulder deep lake
EDL	00:33:09,632	00:33:10,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Separating them

EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:03,232	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the first time I saw the Rhine
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:06,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As we rode Westward along that's quiet water to defend it

EDL	00:41:30,624	00:41:32,672	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And when the day began to emerge from the Mist
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:37,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing out us over our heads

EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fight of man against man
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:05,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And from the distance
EDL	00:42:05,951	00:42:08,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The strains of a song reached our ears
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:14,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Coming closer and closer leaving from company to company just as death plunge too busy hand into our ranks
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:17,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The song reached out to and we passed it along

EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:34,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But I knew how to die like soldiers
EDL	00:42:34,879	00:42:35,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This was the beginning
EDL	00:42:36,927	00:42:39,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You said that it went on year after year
EDL	00:42:39,743	00:42:42,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the romance of battle have been replaced by horror
EDL	00:42:42,815	00:42:44,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The enthusiasm gradually cool
EDL	00:42:45,119	00:42:47,935	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I need you to enjoy was stifled by mortal fear
EDL	00:42:48,703	00:42:51,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The time came when every man had to struggle
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:55,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Between the Instinct of self-preservation and the admonitions of Duty
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:57,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I too was not spared by the struggle
EDL	00:42:57,919	00:43:02,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Always when death was on the hunt of vague something tried to revolt
EDL	00:43:02,015	00:43:05,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Strove to represent itself to the weak body as reason
EDL	00:43:05,599	00:43:07,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was only cowardice
EDL	00:43:07,135	00:43:09,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which in such disguises tries to ensnare the individual
EDL	00:43:10,463	00:43:13,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A grave tugging and warning set in
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:17,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And often it was only The Last Remnant of conscience which decided the issue
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:20,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Yet the more this voice admonished wanted to caution
EDL	00:43:20,447	00:43:24,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The louder and more insistent explores the sharper resistance group
EDL	00:43:24,543	00:43:27,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Until at last after a long inner struggle

EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:50,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then held up his hand so that the party halted
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:52,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And with the characteristic Quick-Step
EDL	00:46:52,671	00:46:54,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Went up to the doomed man
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:56,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He asked what are you been condemned for
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was for abandoning his post
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:01,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The general then began to talk to the man
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:04,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Quite simply he explain discipline to him

EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:14,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He spoke of the necessity of example
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:17,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How someone could do their Duty without prompting
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But others
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:19,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Less strong
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How to know when understand the Supreme cost of failure
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:27,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He told The Condemned man that his crime was not venal not low
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:30,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How many Must Die is an example so that others should not fail
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:32,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Surprisingly
EDL	00:47:32,863	00:47:34,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The wretch agreed
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nodding his head
EDL	00:47:35,423	00:47:38,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The burden of infamy was lifted from his shoulders
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:40,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He saw a glimmer of something
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Redemption in his own eyes
EDL	00:47:42,847	00:47:43,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A real hope
EDL	00:47:44,127	00:47:45,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Though he knew he was going to die
EDL	00:47:46,175	00:47:47,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The general went on
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:50,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Carrying the man with him to comprehension
EDL	00:47:50,527	00:47:54,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There any sacrifice was worthwhile if it helped France ever so little
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:56,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What did anything matter if he knew this
EDL	00:47:57,183	00:47:58,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Finally the general held out his hand
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:01,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Meaning to Shake The Condemned person

EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:05,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Yours is also a way of dying for France he said
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:07,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The procession started again
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:09,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But now the victim was a willing one
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:13,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The sound of a volley in the distance announced that all was over

EDL	00:48:17,407	00:48:19,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And for the first time perhaps
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:21,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	His hand trembled as he lived his pipe
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:22,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And quote
EDL	00:48:23,807	00:48:24,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's something
EDL	00:48:25,087	00:48:27,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That all sides will do in this war
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:30,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The way of saying yes you may face certain death
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:33,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you walk into the storm that is Modern Combat
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:36,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But you'll also face certain death
EDL	00:48:36,095	00:48:36,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you don't
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:40,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Very important build a bear in mind
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:45,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fact that these soldiers who failed in their Duty somehow or exposed
EDL	00:48:46,079	00:48:47,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To capital punishment
EDL	00:48:48,127	00:48:49,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Does not mean that that's why Soldier
EDL	00:48:51,199	00:48:54,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's something that has been present in most armies throughout history
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:55,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Since ancient
EDL	00:48:56,575	00:48:59,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At the Romans if your unit fart badly
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:00,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Would make the men
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:01,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Draw Lots
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:06,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And one out of every ten soldiers in a unit would be killed that was called decimation
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:09,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And to add insult to injury
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:11,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Romans would make their comrades killed
EDL	00:49:12,191	00:49:15,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So that's a standard part of warfare throughout most of History
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:18,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Most of these soldiers were fighting for much
EDL	00:49:18,591	00:49:19,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Higher values
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:23,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Things that you do more cynical 21st century mind
EDL	00:49:23,967	00:49:25,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sometimes almost sound like

EDL	00:49:29,343	00:49:31,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they meant something to these people
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:33,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean something to soldiers today

EDL	00:57:56,735	00:57:58,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The minister of War
EDL	00:57:58,783	00:58:03,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And war hero himself Lord Horatio Kitchener in Britain
EDL	00:58:03,135	00:58:05,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Famously said when seeing what this whole deal was like
EDL	00:58:06,719	00:58:08,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This is not war
EDL	00:58:11,583	00:58:12,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Maybe you hadn't been
EDL	00:58:13,631	00:58:15,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this was sort of a way of
EDL	00:58:15,935	00:58:17,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Telling everyone in this generation
EDL	00:58:18,495	00:58:20,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Welcome to the 20th century
EDL	00:58:21,055	00:58:22,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This is how it's going to be 4
EDL	00:58:25,407	00:58:26,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These battles in Flanders
EDL	00:58:27,199	00:58:27,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What you do
EDL	00:58:28,735	00:58:29,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Shatter
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:31,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Many of the leaders
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:32,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Confident and what's going on
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:36,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Remember when the war starts they have a plan for winning the war that's been
EDL	00:58:36,671	00:58:39,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a worked out over years but once that fails
EDL	00:58:39,743	00:58:41,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All these generals have to improvise
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:43,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They have to
EDL	00:58:43,071	00:58:48,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Create new offensives in new ways to win the war from where things stand
EDL	00:58:48,959	00:58:55,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And after these battles in Flanders die down and you have this trench warfare setting in General von falkenhayn in German
EDL	00:58:55,359	00:58:56,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Money runs the numbers
EDL	00:58:56,639	00:58:57,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they're horrible
EDL	00:58:58,687	00:58:59,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm in the Battle of Ypres
EDL	00:59:00,479	00:59:02,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All sides combined
EDL	00:59:02,271	00:59:06,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You're talking about another 250000 casualties in a few weeks
EDL	00:59:07,135	00:59:10,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That brings a German totals on the Western Front since the war started
EDL	00:59:10,463	00:59:11,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is August
EDL	00:59:12,255	00:59:14,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	2 more than 750 thousand
EDL	00:59:14,559	00:59:16,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The French you're topping a million
EDL	00:59:17,119	00:59:19,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The British and for all intents and purposes lost
EDL	00:59:20,191	00:59:24,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are professional Army the greatest in the world small but the greatest in the world
EDL	00:59:24,543	00:59:28,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's down to dozens of men in units that had hundreds of men
EDL	00:59:28,895	00:59:30,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know a very short time ago
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:34,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in Britain there trying to scrape up replacements
EDL	00:59:34,015	00:59:38,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you can see how how bad it is by how quickly their changing the requirement
EDL	00:59:38,367	00:59:40,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because when the war starts you have to be 5 foot 8 inches tall
EDL	00:59:41,695	00:59:43,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To be in the British army
EDL	00:59:43,231	00:59:45,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In October they lower that to 5
EDL	00:59:45,791	00:59:47,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Foot five inches tall
EDL	00:59:47,583	00:59:50,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A single month later in November they'll or that the five foot
EDL	00:59:50,399	00:59:51,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	3 in tall
EDL	00:59:52,447	00:59:53,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans
EDL	00:59:53,471	00:59:55,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are having a similar problem they learned a very
EDL	00:59:55,775	00:59:58,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hard lesson in these battles in Flanders
EDL	00:59:58,335	00:59:59,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You must
EDL	00:59:59,615	01:00:05,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Let the troops finish their training cuz they threw away a ton of Lies with people who weren't ready to fight
EDL	01:00:07,807	01:00:10,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But Duncan Hines got a more difficult situation
EDL	01:00:10,367	01:00:16,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because the British and the French as we said have dominions and Commonwealth Nations I mean the Canadians alone in a fit
EDL	01:00:16,767	01:00:20,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Patriotism are sending more than 30,000 fresh troops
EDL	01:00:20,863	01:00:22,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Across the Atlantic
EDL	01:00:22,399	01:00:23,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the largest
EDL	01:00:23,935	01:00:25,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Transportation of

EDL	01:00:25,983	01:00:28,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When the history of the world across the large ocean
EDL	01:00:29,823	01:00:31,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm talkin I have two accounts
EDL	01:00:32,639	01:00:35,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He goes and he tells the civilian leadership
EDL	01:00:35,199	01:00:36,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the war in the west camp B1
EDL	01:00:39,039	01:00:41,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He tells them that they have to come to some sort of an arrangement
EDL	01:00:42,367	01:00:43,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And He suggests making
EDL	01:00:43,647	01:00:44,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Peace with somebody
EDL	01:00:45,183	01:00:46,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Maybe the Russian
EDL	01:00:46,463	01:00:49,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because if you make peace with the Russians maybe the French will lose heart
EDL	01:00:49,791	01:00:53,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He says all of these other nations are simply weapons in the hands of the arch in
EDL	01:00:54,655	01:00:55,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is English
EDL	01:00:55,935	01:00:59,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they have to be at the British have to be the ones
EDL	01:00:59,007	01:01:02,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That the Germans focus on and we have to get these other countries
EDL	01:01:02,335	01:01:06,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which are merely sword in the hand of perfidious Albion he says
EDL	01:01:06,687	01:01:07,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Need to get them out of the war
EDL	01:01:09,759	01:01:13,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now this is going to be very hard to do because way back in September all the allies
EDL	01:01:13,343	01:01:16,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Chinese agreement saying nobody will make A Separate Peace
EDL	01:01:16,927	01:01:18,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nonetheless falkenhayn hopes
EDL	01:01:18,719	01:01:20,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But he can make his War aims
EDL	01:01:20,767	01:01:25,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You no longer Victory but shattering some of these Powers they leave the war
EDL	01:01:25,119	01:01:29,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The civilian leadership in Germany the politicians like bethmann-hollweg
EDL	01:01:29,727	01:01:31,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are appalled by what
EDL	01:01:32,799	01:01:35,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They can't figure out a way to do this because
EDL	01:01:35,615	01:01:40,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans just like all these other countries are so appalled by the casualties in the blood that's been spilled
EDL	01:01:40,735	01:01:42,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The nobody is willing
EDL	01:01:42,783	01:01:44,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To give up anything
EDL	01:01:44,575	01:01:46,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You've already lost too many people
EDL	01:01:46,367	01:01:49,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One thing if you lose all those people in a victory
EDL	01:01:49,183	01:01:52,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Do nothing if you lose all those people in a loss
EDL	01:01:52,255	01:01:52,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Besides
EDL	01:01:53,279	01:01:56,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Batman holding just a couple of months ago was writing up
EDL	01:01:56,863	01:02:01,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Plans for what the victory conditions in the war going to be in he got these grandiose
EDL	01:02:01,215	01:02:07,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Schemes where we're going to push the Russians back we're going to keep the French down forever we're going to all these vassal States and now his Chi
EDL	01:02:07,615	01:02:09,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Military leader is saying listen we can't win the war
EDL	01:02:11,967	01:02:12,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now
EDL	01:02:12,735	01:02:17,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Don't forget Hines Rivals guys like ludendorff in the East who already hate him
EDL	01:02:17,087	01:02:17,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Viscerally
EDL	01:02:18,367	01:02:22,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Say that his attitude you know this early in the war is tantamount to treason
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:28,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I basically insinuating and no one certain terms that I change and Military leadership my change all these sorts of things
EDL	01:02:29,631	01:02:31,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Valkenhayn is told
EDL	01:02:31,679	01:02:32,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But there's no way
EDL	01:02:32,959	01:02:34,239	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That we're ending the war
EDL	01:02:35,007	01:02:37,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He tells his troops on the Western Front
EDL	01:02:37,055	01:02:38,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To hold on to what you have
EDL	01:02:38,591	01:02:44,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Never Surrender a square foot of what you one if you do counter-attack immediately and retake it
EDL	01:02:45,503	01:02:51,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because they take invaluable territory valuable Farmland valuable resources valuable industrial Land from the French
EDL	01:02:52,415	01:02:54,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And if he can't get the war
EDL	01:02:54,719	01:02:58,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Stop from the political leadership he's going to hold on to what he had
EDL	01:02:58,047	01:03:01,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He tells the troops in the west to deepen their fortification
EDL	01:03:01,887	01:03:03,935	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Instead of just one line of trenches
EDL	01:03:03,935	01:03:04,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He wants multiple line
EDL	01:03:05,471	01:03:07,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He and all the other leaders
EDL	01:03:07,775	01:03:09,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On both sides begin to use
EDL	01:03:09,823	01:03:14,175	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This wonderful weapon which doesn't seem like a weapon at all of barbed wire
EDL	01:03:14,175	01:03:15,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something it was first invented
EDL	01:03:15,711	01:03:17,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A generation before to keep
EDL	01:03:17,503	01:03:19,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Title pending in the American West
EDL	01:03:20,063	01:03:22,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in the last couple of Wars since then it been used

EDL	01:03:25,439	01:03:31,327	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now all sides take this wire with all these sharp edges and begin to use it as a fortification
EDL	01:03:32,607	01:03:34,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This will be another one of these
EDL	01:03:34,655	01:03:37,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Iconic things on the Western Front and you don't even think that
EDL	01:03:37,983	01:03:43,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something like wire with little tiny barbs on will make that much of a difference but it proved to be one of the

EDL	01:03:55,135	01:03:56,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Simply overcome the barrier
EDL	01:03:56,927	01:03:58,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Created by things like
EDL	01:03:58,207	01:03:58,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like barbed wire
EDL	01:04:00,511	01:04:01,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now it's not all bad

EDL	01:04:50,687	01:04:52,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We haven't even mentioned that there's fighting going on
EDL	01:04:53,503	01:04:57,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the Pacific because it really is a sidebar to this story
EDL	01:04:57,599	01:04:58,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Japan for exam
EDL	01:04:58,879	01:05:01,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Once the war breaks out quickly throws in their lot
EDL	01:05:01,695	01:05:03,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With Britain and France and Russia in the eye
EDL	01:05:04,511	01:05:07,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They do so for purely opportunistic Ruiz
EDL	01:05:07,839	01:05:10,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans have some territories in the Pacific
EDL	01:05:10,399	01:05:14,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Japan can easily snap up it won't be much fighting it won't be much trouble
EDL	01:05:15,263	01:05:18,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And if the Allies somehow lose the war
EDL	01:05:18,847	01:05:23,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There's not much Germany and Austria-Hungary and stuff can do to Japan way over in the Pacific anyway
EDL	01:05:23,711	01:05:24,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There's no downside
EDL	01:05:26,015	01:05:29,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So the Japanese snap up some of these Drummond Island possessions in the
EDL	01:05:29,087	01:05:31,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Pacific to take some German territories

EDL	01:05:33,439	01:05:35,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the most important part of all of those
EDL	01:05:35,743	01:05:36,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Actions
EDL	01:05:36,767	01:05:39,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Will be the fact that some of those places will be

EDL	01:05:53,919	01:05:56,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Second World War I mean it's more of a long-term situation
EDL	01:05:57,247	01:05:59,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean it's more of a long-term
EDL	01:05:59,039	01:06:00,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cancerous situation but
EDL	01:06:01,087	01:06:04,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Japan's been in the war since the beginning it's part of what makes this a world
EDL	01:06:05,439	01:06:07,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Buddy November 1914 turkey at
EDL	01:06:08,767	01:06:10,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this is a very different
EDL	01:06:11,071	01:06:11,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	First of all
EDL	01:06:11,839	01:06:15,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turks are not United on the idea at all
EDL	01:06:15,167	01:06:16,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some of the more aggressive
EDL	01:06:16,959	01:06:18,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Members of the government
EDL	01:06:18,751	01:06:21,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For now called The Young Turks
EDL	01:06:21,055	01:06:22,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sort of precipitate
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:25,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a way that leaves the rest of the government out of the decision
EDL	01:06:25,663	01:06:28,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They in some Germans working together decide to Shell
EDL	01:06:28,991	01:06:32,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some Russian Port facilities in the Black Sea
EDL	01:06:32,063	01:06:34,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Without getting the rest of the government's position
EDL	01:06:34,623	01:06:37,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then of course Russia declares war on turkey and boom there in
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:41,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans have been trying to set this up for a long time
EDL	01:06:42,559	01:06:44,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They wanted turkey on their side
EDL	01:06:44,607	01:06:45,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is strange
EDL	01:06:45,887	01:06:50,239	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because turkey is one of those Powers that's really having a hard time right now
EDL	01:06:50,239	01:06:52,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the Germans already have one of those
EDL	01:06:53,055	01:06:55,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Allied to Austria-Hungary
EDL	01:06:55,615	01:06:58,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which yunnan for 5 months of War already look
EDL	01:06:58,687	01:06:59,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Doughton
EDL	01:06:59,455	01:07:01,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans will take the saying
EDL	01:07:01,247	01:07:02,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	About their Austrian allies
EDL	01:07:03,295	01:07:05,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That they are fettered to a corpse
EDL	01:07:05,855	01:07:11,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Well now they're adding another corpse I mean you really have to admire how well Germany doesn this war considering
EDL	01:07:11,231	01:07:14,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did they have two of the weakest powers in Europe
EDL	01:07:14,047	01:07:15,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Not just on their side
EDL	01:07:15,839	01:07:17,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But requiring a lot of their help
EDL	01:07:17,887	01:07:19,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the Turks provide
EDL	01:07:19,935	01:07:21,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An interesting
EDL	01:07:21,727	01:07:22,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are you
EDL	01:07:22,495	01:07:23,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the journey
EDL	01:07:23,519	01:07:26,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's not that they have an Army and Navy that's going to be real helpful
EDL	01:07:27,103	01:07:29,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the Turks control a nice
EDL	01:07:29,663	01:07:32,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trunk of what today we would call the Middle East
EDL	01:07:32,479	01:07:35,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And by simply deciding to get into the war
EDL	01:07:35,551	01:07:36,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dayforce
EDL	01:07:36,319	01:07:39,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The British and the French who have a lot of possessions in that area
EDL	01:07:39,647	01:07:40,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To defend them
EDL	01:07:40,927	01:07:42,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They've expanded
EDL	01:07:42,719	01:07:43,999	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The battlefield
EDL	01:07:43,999	01:07:46,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To include a whole bunch of areas
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:48,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But nobody was fighting over before turkey
EDL	01:07:48,607	01:07:49,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He got into the war
EDL	01:07:50,911	01:07:51,935	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's more
EDL	01:07:51,935	01:07:53,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey's historic
EDL	01:07:53,471	01:07:53,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Anime
EDL	01:07:54,495	01:07:55,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is Russia
EDL	01:07:56,031	01:07:58,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A Russia that is putting all their Manpower
EDL	01:07:58,847	01:08:02,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The dealing with the Germans in the austro-hungarian then all of a sudden
EDL	01:08:02,431	01:08:04,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	South of all that fighting
EDL	01:08:04,735	01:08:07,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They now have their historic enemy turkey in the war
EDL	01:08:08,063	01:08:10,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Again it's not that they're so afraid of the Turk
EDL	01:08:10,879	01:08:14,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's they're afraid of taking any troops away from the main Battlefront
EDL	01:08:14,719	01:08:16,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To defend that area at all
EDL	01:08:16,767	01:08:20,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Same thing with the British and the French now they have to take troops away
EDL	01:08:20,607	01:08:23,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From places where they're using them against the Germans
EDL	01:08:23,679	01:08:24,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And use them elsewhere
EDL	01:08:25,471	01:08:29,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So the Germans aren't really getting the Turkish armies help as much as they're getting
EDL	01:08:29,567	01:08:32,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fact that the people they're fighting
EDL	01:08:32,127	01:08:33,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How to fight
EDL	01:08:33,151	01:08:33,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Somewhere else
EDL	01:08:33,919	01:08:34,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	2
EDL	01:08:35,967	01:08:36,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now
EDL	01:08:36,991	01:08:39,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For our purposes there's a wonderful little
EDL	01:08:39,551	01:08:42,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Moment right at the beginning of turkeys involvement where
EDL	01:08:42,879	01:08:45,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The highest-ranking figure in the Muslim World religious
EDL	01:08:46,975	01:08:48,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Proclaims a Jihad
EDL	01:08:49,023	01:08:50,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Against the allies
EDL	01:08:50,047	01:08:52,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain France Russia Serbia
EDL	01:08:53,119	01:08:58,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this is an era where the Muslim world was was more united in a religious sense of me nowadays
EDL	01:08:59,263	01:09:00,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's more like
EDL	01:09:00,287	01:09:04,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Protestant version of Christianity where there's a lot of different religious leaders who
EDL	01:09:04,895	01:09:06,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Kind of all have equal standing
EDL	01:09:07,199	01:09:08,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At this time.
EDL	01:09:08,479	01:09:11,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The guy who was running the religion from Turkey
EDL	01:09:11,551	01:09:12,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Had
EDL	01:09:12,319	01:09:13,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Not total
EDL	01:09:14,111	01:09:15,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Control over their religion
EDL	01:09:15,647	01:09:19,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	3 carried a lot of weight and when the war breaks out on November 14th
EDL	01:09:19,743	01:09:21,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	1914
EDL	01:09:21,023	01:09:22,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He proclaims a holy war against
EDL	01:09:22,815	01:09:24,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain France Serbia Russia
EDL	01:09:24,607	01:09:26,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this is big because
EDL	01:09:26,143	01:09:27,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain France
EDL	01:09:27,423	01:09:28,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Russia all have
EDL	01:09:28,959	01:09:29,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Huge
EDL	01:09:29,727	01:09:31,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Muslim population
EDL	01:09:32,031	01:09:33,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Germany's ambassador
EDL	01:09:33,823	01:09:34,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To Turkey
EDL	01:09:34,847	01:09:36,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Says that now
EDL	01:09:36,127	01:09:38,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know the British are going to burn up in Jihad
EDL	01:09:40,223	01:09:42,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Whether or not that's what really happens
EDL	01:09:42,783	01:09:45,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If your Britain and your friends and your Russia
EDL	01:09:45,343	01:09:49,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You need to be concerned about that and now you need to divert forces
EDL	01:09:49,951	01:09:51,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From other crucial fronts
EDL	01:09:51,743	01:09:53,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To deal with this new dilemma
EDL	01:09:53,791	01:09:55,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey is
EDL	01:09:55,071	01:09:59,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And has been for more than a hundred years known as the sick man of Europe
EDL	01:10:00,703	01:10:01,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They've just bought
EDL	01:10:01,727	01:10:06,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Two Wars before the first world war breaks out the first and second Balkan War
EDL	01:10:06,335	01:10:07,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm lost
EDL	01:10:07,103	01:10:09,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Most of those European possession
EDL	01:10:09,663	01:10:10,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Penniless
EDL	01:10:11,199	01:10:14,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's a disaster they just bought two battleships
EDL	01:10:14,015	01:10:15,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which they had to ask their
EDL	01:10:16,319	01:10:17,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Citizens
EDL	01:10:17,343	01:10:21,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To essentially donate the money for they purchased them from Britain
EDL	01:10:21,439	01:10:23,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then when the war broke out Britain kept on
EDL	01:10:23,743	01:10:26,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which was another reason the church were not too happy with the Ally
EDL	01:10:27,583	01:10:28,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nonetheless

EDL	01:28:29,696	01:28:30,976	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Open fire
EDL	01:28:30,976	01:28:32,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On British coastal town
EDL	01:28:32,512	01:28:34,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Kill more than a hundred
EDL	01:28:34,048	01:28:35,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	British citizens
EDL	01:28:35,584	01:28:38,144	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Becomes a wonderful propaganda tool
EDL	01:28:38,144	01:28:40,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the Allies to cite the baby killers of Germany
EDL	01:28:41,472	01:28:43,776	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But that's nothing compared to what's coming in 1950
EDL	01:28:44,544	01:28:46,848	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first thing that happens is a
EDL	01:28:46,848	01:28:48,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Absolute benchmark
EDL	01:28:48,128	01:28:48,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Arkin
EDL	01:28:48,896	01:28:49,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Warfare
EDL	01:28:49,920	01:28:51,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When in January
EDL	01:28:51,456	01:28:52,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The German start
EDL	01:28:53,504	01:28:54,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Really
EDL	01:28:54,528	01:28:57,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trying to get involved in what we call today strategic bomb
EDL	01:28:58,624	01:29:01,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No aircraft have been in use since the very moment the war started
EDL	01:29:02,464	01:29:03,232	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of these
EDL	01:29:04,512	01:29:06,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Excuses that the Germans used
EDL	01:29:06,816	01:29:13,216	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For attacking France was they said that some plane had come from France and bombs nurenberg at the very moment that the Warsaw
EDL	01:29:13,216	01:29:13,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Started
EDL	01:29:13,984	01:29:15,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is probably nonsense
EDL	01:29:15,776	01:29:20,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it shows that there were airplanes involved in the conflict from the very beginning but anyways.
EDL	01:29:20,640	01:29:23,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Really didn't involve the laws of war
EDL	01:29:23,968	01:29:30,112	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All of the Air Force's put together in the world when the war started had less than 500 plane
EDL	01:29:31,392	01:29:32,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What planes they did have
EDL	01:29:33,440	01:29:37,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turned out to be wonderfully valuable tools for reconnaissance which
EDL	01:29:37,792	01:29:38,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Was what
EDL	01:29:38,816	01:29:41,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Air power has been used for
EDL	01:29:41,120	01:29:44,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Earlier than this time even in the American Civil War there were hot air balloons
EDL	01:29:45,216	01:29:48,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That they would use to see what the enemy was doing in the distance
EDL	01:29:48,544	01:29:50,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Planes were wonderful for that
EDL	01:29:50,592	01:29:55,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They also turned out to be fantastic in the more technologically sophisticated armies
EDL	01:29:55,456	01:29:57,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was known as artillery spot
EDL	01:29:58,528	01:30:03,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that allowed Your Guns to shoot at Targets that the Gunners couldn't see
EDL	01:30:03,904	01:30:05,696	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you could shoot for example
EDL	01:30:05,696	01:30:11,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a Faraway over a hill and if it was an airplane there they could tell you what was happening and that was
EDL	01:30:11,328	01:30:16,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Interesting enough to trying to explain without radios and everything what was happening but they could tell you that your shot.
EDL	01:30:16,960	01:30:20,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tell short or long or was too far to the left or too far to the right
EDL	01:30:21,056	01:30:24,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this gave a huge Advantage the armies that can make that work
EDL	01:30:24,640	01:30:27,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Less sophisticated armies like the Russians couldn't
EDL	01:30:27,456	01:30:30,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And hence were relegated to shooting at things they could own
EDL	01:30:30,016	01:30:30,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Only see you at
EDL	01:30:31,808	01:30:35,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this early on in the fighting you can see how primitive Things Are
EDL	01:30:35,392	01:30:37,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because early on when aircraft
EDL	01:30:37,952	01:30:39,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Wooden counter enemy aircraft
EDL	01:30:40,256	01:30:42,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Didn't have any way to do anything about
EDL	01:30:42,816	01:30:43,584	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they were
EDL	01:30:43,584	01:30:45,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Taking handgun
EDL	01:30:45,120	01:30:47,168	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These Pilots up in the plane with them
EDL	01:30:47,168	01:30:50,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And trying to take potshots with their pistols at the enemy air pilot
EDL	01:30:50,752	01:30:51,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Let me know
EDL	01:30:51,520	01:30:54,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sophisticated things are at this stage in the war
EDL	01:30:54,592	01:30:56,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's only when
EDL	01:30:56,128	01:31:02,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans run up against the in a trench warfare in the Western Front and they're forced to start looking for things
EDL	01:31:02,272	01:31:05,088	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That might help them your break the stalemate
EDL	01:31:05,088	01:31:07,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They noticed they have the greatest Zeppelin
EDL	01:31:07,392	01:31:07,904	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Fleet in the world
EDL	01:31:09,184	01:31:10,976	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Zeppelins of course are lighter than air
EDL	01:31:12,256	01:31:14,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Blimps dirigibles those kinds of things
EDL	01:31:14,816	01:31:17,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And before the war the Germans have built 10 or 12 of them
EDL	01:31:17,632	01:31:21,472	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And had them sort of sitting aside when the war started which scared
EDL	01:31:21,984	01:31:23,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Their enemies
EDL	01:31:23,264	01:31:27,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Probably more than they should have they sort of had a fleet in being role where
EDL	01:31:28,128	01:31:30,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People like Churchill and Britain at the beach
EDL	01:31:30,176	01:31:31,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And worried about
EDL	01:31:31,200	01:31:32,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What are the German Zeppelin
EDL	01:31:32,480	01:31:34,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Mike the German Zeppelin
EDL	01:31:34,016	01:31:38,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That was probably out of all proportion to what the German Zeppelins could do
EDL	01:31:39,648	01:31:41,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans try to use them at the beginning of the war for example
EDL	01:31:42,464	01:31:43,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Renovated
EDL	01:31:43,488	01:31:46,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Belgium and had to try to deal with those forts a couple of zeppelins
EDL	01:31:46,560	01:31:48,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Play Wolverine trying to drop some bombs
EDL	01:31:48,608	01:31:51,680	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When the stalemate on the Western Front reaches its real
EDL	01:31:51,680	01:31:52,448	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Uno
EDL	01:31:52,448	01:31:53,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Calcification moment
EDL	01:31:53,984	01:31:57,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The German start looking for ways to use these tools that they have
EDL	01:31:57,824	01:31:59,872	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there is no metrics
EDL	01:31:59,872	01:32:06,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just like to run any metrics on the Western Front to try to figure out how to break that Stanley there's no metrics that will tell you what these Zeppelin
EDL	01:32:06,272	01:32:07,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Will do if a bomb
EDL	01:32:08,064	01:32:09,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Targets in another country
EDL	01:32:10,368	01:32:11,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Was a British theorist
EDL	01:32:11,648	01:32:13,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who suggested that the very power
EDL	01:32:13,952	01:32:14,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	S&S
EDL	01:32:14,720	01:32:16,000	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The people
EDL	01:32:16,000	01:32:21,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You don't need another country in their home country feel when the enemy is able to with impunity
EDL	01:32:21,632	01:32:24,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Fly over your territory and bomb you
EDL	01:32:24,704	01:32:28,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He suggested that if they bombed the civilians with confetti
EDL	01:32:29,056	01:32:31,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It wouldn't make any difference it would still
EDL	01:32:31,360	01:32:35,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Damage their morale terribly because it's a feeling like you can't be defended even at home
EDL	01:32:35,968	01:32:39,808	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The place that most people tend to feel safe at this stage in military history
EDL	01:32:41,088	01:32:42,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They were people arguing
EDL	01:32:42,624	01:32:44,416	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The German High command saying
EDL	01:32:44,416	01:32:47,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For all we know these Zeppelins could win the war
EDL	01:32:47,744	01:32:49,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And before the war at these
EDL	01:32:49,792	01:32:54,144	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a big conferences that were part of trying to come up with International laws of war
EDL	01:32:54,144	01:33:00,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You're there were rules discussed about how bombing should work I mean should you have to give the city that you're going to vomit
EDL	01:33:00,544	01:33:02,336	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Chance to surrender before we bombed them
EDL	01:33:02,848	01:33:03,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And
EDL	01:33:03,616	01:33:07,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lest you think only the Germans were doing this both the British and the French were sending
EDL	01:33:07,712	01:33:10,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a small bombing raids over into Germany
EDL	01:33:10,528	01:33:16,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Germany was sending small bombing raids with aircraft that were holding little hand bombs out of the open-top
EDL	01:33:16,928	01:33:18,976	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Pits and dropping them but nothing significant
EDL	01:33:18,976	01:33:20,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nothing like sending large
EDL	01:33:20,768	01:33:22,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Numbers of Zeppelin
EDL	01:33:22,816	01:33:24,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All together
EDL	01:33:24,096	01:33:24,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Embalming
EDL	01:33:25,376	01:33:28,192	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	January 1915 the Germans launched
EDL	01:33:28,192	01:33:28,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first one of those
EDL	01:33:30,496	01:33:31,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They go after
EDL	01:33:31,520	01:33:32,288	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Comport
EDL	01:33:32,288	01:33:33,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Facilities
EDL	01:33:33,056	01:33:33,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain
EDL	01:33:34,080	01:33:40,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem with this is the same problem they're going to have any early second world war which is you may say you're trying to hit military
EDL	01:33:40,480	01:33:46,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Target but the accuracy is so terrible you're lucky to fly over a city the size of London
EDL	01:33:46,880	01:33:47,904	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And be able to hit it
EDL	01:33:48,416	01:33:50,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Buddy's Port facilities end up being
EDL	01:33:51,488	01:33:54,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An example of an early example of when civilians get hit
EDL	01:33:54,304	01:33:57,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With these weapons will start bombing London in May 19th

EDL	01:33:58,400	01:34:01,728	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And of course it becomes a propaganda Victory right away for the allies
EDL	01:34:02,496	01:34:05,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Again label the Germans baby killers
EDL	01:34:05,056	01:34:09,920	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which make the Germans defensive as you might imagine there's a wonderful letter from a German Zeppelin leader
EDL	01:34:10,688	01:34:11,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To his mother
EDL	01:34:11,968	01:34:12,736	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trying to

EDL	01:34:15,040	01:34:15,808	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Explain to her before
EDL	01:34:16,320	01:34:17,088	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this isn't
EDL	01:34:17,856	01:34:23,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The evil stop that this is Modern Warfare and yes it's not like you know knights fighting a duel
EDL	01:34:23,488	01:34:26,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But at the same time the Situation's different than win tonight
EDL	01:34:26,560	01:34:27,584	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's fought duels
EDL	01:34:27,584	01:34:30,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People in the homefront are no longer innocent
EDL	01:34:30,912	01:34:31,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In Modern Warfare
EDL	01:34:32,448	01:34:35,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are the ones who make the weapons
EDL	01:34:35,008	01:34:36,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That the soldiers require

EDL	01:38:09,792	01:38:11,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The British were to find out
EDL	01:38:11,840	01:38:16,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At the old Naval orthodoxies about what a weaker Naval power could and couldn't do

EDL	01:38:19,264	01:38:21,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There was no answer at this point in history
EDL	01:38:21,824	01:38:22,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the submarine
EDL	01:38:23,360	01:38:26,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Surface vessels could not detect them unless the submarine
EDL	01:38:26,944	01:38:28,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Surface they couldn't destroy them
EDL	01:38:29,504	01:38:33,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Germany had a lot less submarines than Britain and France but here's the thing
EDL	01:38:33,344	01:38:36,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain and France couldn't do anything with their submarines
EDL	01:38:36,160	01:38:37,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They couldn't use their
EDL	01:38:37,440	01:38:43,584	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Submarines against German Merchant shipping because there wasn't any German Merchant shipping about five minutes after the war breaks
EDL	01:38:44,096	01:38:46,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The surface fleets of France and Britain thought of that
EDL	01:38:47,680	01:38:49,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But Germany surface lead which is one of the
EDL	01:38:50,496	01:38:56,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Things that have precipitated the war one of the many causes it's always cited is the naval arms race between
EDL	01:38:56,128	01:38:57,152	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain and Germany
EDL	01:38:57,920	01:38:59,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	State import for the most part
EDL	01:39:00,224	01:39:02,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Knight of the British know the Germans were willing to risk
EDL	01:39:03,040	01:39:05,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's enormously expensive
EDL	01:39:05,600	01:39:10,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And hard to replace surface ships that were they would have called capital
EDL	01:39:10,208	01:39:12,000	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Battleships
EDL	01:39:12,000	01:39:18,144	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Unbelievably expensive ones mean for example the British had just commissioned the class of ships known as the Queen Elizabeth class battleship
EDL	01:39:18,656	01:39:23,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which was so good in the first world war they still be very effective units in the Second World War
EDL	01:39:23,520	01:39:28,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But if a cheap Little Submarine could sink one of those ships with a torpedo
EDL	01:39:28,896	01:39:31,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's nothing to any Naval commanders are willing to
EDL	01:39:31,712	01:39:37,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Risk and so all of a sudden everybody's being so careful with their big ships that it leaves openings for The Little Ships to make
EDL	01:39:39,392	01:39:41,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Everyone thought at the beginning of the war
EDL	01:39:41,440	01:39:45,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But these submarines would be used in the military sense against other warships
EDL	01:39:46,048	01:39:48,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By February 1915
EDL	01:39:48,864	01:39:51,424	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans are now using them against Merchant
EDL	01:39:51,424	01:39:56,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Shipping and all of a sudden the greatest Navy in the world finds that they can't defend their merchant shipping
EDL	01:39:56,032	01:39:58,848	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because of a new technological creation
EDL	01:39:58,848	01:40:02,944	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or a weaker Naval power has the potential to turn the tables
EDL	01:40:02,944	01:40:04,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the best weapon
EDL	01:40:04,480	01:40:06,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the great Naval Powers have
EDL	01:40:06,784	01:40:08,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Blockading weaker Navy
EDL	01:40:08,576	01:40:09,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Powers
EDL	01:40:09,344	01:40:13,184	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the British were doing a very good job of keeping goods and
EDL	01:40:13,184	01:40:15,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Weapons from flowing into Germany by sea
EDL	01:40:15,488	01:40:19,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are finding out that the Germans had the capability to do the same thing back to them
EDL	01:40:21,120	01:40:22,144	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now the big issue
EDL	01:40:22,656	01:40:24,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Will surface if you'll pardon the pun
EDL	01:40:24,960	01:40:26,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Around whether or not
EDL	01:40:27,008	01:40:31,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Warfare should follow the old famous rules of the sea or not

EDL	01:40:37,248	01:40:40,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Merchant shipping non-military vessels without letting them know
EDL	01:40:41,088	01:40:41,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That piracy
EDL	01:40:42,368	01:40:44,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You basically are supposed to
EDL	01:40:44,672	01:40:47,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Give them a message and say we're seizing your ship let them
EDL	01:40:47,488	01:40:52,352	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Take their people off the ship on lifeboats and stuff and then you can either sink the vessel that you
EDL	01:40:52,352	01:40:55,424	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know more after or you can take it as a prize and capture it
EDL	01:40:55,936	01:40:58,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is when a submarine to try to do this
EDL	01:40:58,752	01:41:00,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It open the damn up
EDL	01:41:00,544	01:41:04,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To being destroyed and the British played this up they started putting guns on all these Merchant ships
EDL	01:41:05,408	01:41:08,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So if the Germans came up and did what they were supposed to do
EDL	01:41:08,480	01:41:14,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tell the merchant ship captured your prize of War now get your lifeboats out get your people off the ship and will sink it
EDL	01:41:15,392	01:41:21,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They'd often pull the canvas off a gun and start shooting at the now vulnerable submarine cuz it had to surface in order to
EDL	01:41:21,792	01:41:24,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Comply with the international laws of war right
EDL	01:41:25,376	01:41:26,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the Germans were having these debates
EDL	01:41:27,424	01:41:28,448	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In 1915
EDL	01:41:28,960	01:41:31,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	About whether or not they should do that at all
EDL	01:41:31,776	01:41:33,824	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Maybe they should just sink these vessels
EDL	01:41:34,336	01:41:36,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Without surfacing or warning them or anything
EDL	01:41:37,152	01:41:39,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this again would look like the Germans were
EDL	01:41:39,968	01:41:42,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know the ones outside international law
EDL	01:41:43,040	01:41:44,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're the ones who were the bad guy
EDL	01:41:45,344	01:41:46,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And worse
EDL	01:41:46,368	01:41:47,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then that
EDL	01:41:47,648	01:41:53,536	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They risk alienating neutral powers the most important of which was the United States which was a very
EDL	01:41:55,328	01:41:57,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A maritime power
EDL	01:41:57,120	01:42:03,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Huge in the trade and by the way at this point in the war if you wanted to say who is gaining from the first World War
EDL	01:42:03,776	01:42:05,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's the United States because
EDL	01:42:05,568	01:42:07,872	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of the things that all these powers do
EDL	01:42:07,872	01:42:12,736	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When they find out they can't produce enough shells and weapons and War materials to keep the war going
EDL	01:42:12,736	01:42:14,784	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is borrow money from the United States
EDL	01:42:14,784	01:42:17,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then turn around and spend that borrowed money
EDL	01:42:17,600	01:42:19,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On stopping production from the United States
EDL	01:42:21,440	01:42:23,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Often called the Great neutral
EDL	01:42:23,488	01:42:27,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The United States just wants to be able to keep delivering your stuff word has to go
EDL	01:42:28,608	01:42:31,168	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're already getting tents with the British
EDL	01:42:31,168	01:42:35,776	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a searching their ships and saying that this ship for that ship can't dock at this point of that port
EDL	01:42:35,776	01:42:37,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When the German start
EDL	01:42:37,312	01:42:39,104	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sinking Merchant vessels
EDL	01:42:39,104	01:42:41,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sometimes those Merchant vessels have Americans
EDL	01:42:41,408	01:42:41,920	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On them
EDL	01:42:42,688	01:42:44,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In early 1915
EDL	01:42:44,480	01:42:46,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of those vessels was called the Lusitania
EDL	01:42:47,296	01:42:49,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Lusitania if you want to think of it
EDL	01:42:49,856	01:42:52,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Inner to conceptualize what we're talking about here
EDL	01:42:52,672	01:42:54,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is very much like the Titanic
EDL	01:42:54,976	01:42:57,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An extremely large ocean liner
EDL	01:42:57,792	01:43:04,192	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A passenger ship this is how people got from the old world to the new world and back again across the Atlantic in the day
EDL	01:43:04,192	01:43:05,728	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's before transatlantic Air flight
EDL	01:43:06,752	01:43:07,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now
EDL	01:43:07,520	01:43:10,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Controversy has raged ever since
EDL	01:43:10,592	01:43:12,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The German submarine
EDL	01:43:12,384	01:43:13,920	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which open fire on the loose
EDL	01:43:13,920	01:43:15,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Betania sank that ship
EDL	01:43:15,456	01:43:18,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On whether or not it was a legitimate Target of War
EDL	01:43:18,528	01:43:20,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It have munitions
EDL	01:43:20,064	01:43:21,088	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If it did
EDL	01:43:21,088	01:43:22,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Supposedly they could sink it
EDL	01:43:22,880	01:43:29,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is a lot of evidence that suggested did and some conspiracy theories out there that suggests that people like Winston Churchill
EDL	01:43:29,280	01:43:31,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Assured that it did
EDL	01:43:31,072	01:43:32,608	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So that it would be another
EDL	01:43:32,608	01:43:38,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In nail in the coffin he was starting to construct that would eventually get the United States into the war more than a hundred Americans
EDL	01:43:38,752	01:43:40,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turn on the Lusitania.
EDL	01:43:42,592	01:43:44,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At various times in the war
EDL	01:43:44,384	01:43:47,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans would start up what was called unrestricted
EDL	01:43:47,968	01:43:49,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Submarine warfare
EDL	01:43:49,248	01:43:52,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With a shot of anything that looked like an enemy ship of any
EDL	01:43:53,088	01:43:54,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And other times where they would stop
EDL	01:43:54,624	01:43:58,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because there was a huge debate within the halls of German leadership
EDL	01:43:58,208	01:44:02,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Over whether or not they gained more or lost more when they did this
EDL	01:44:02,048	01:44:04,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If the United States comes into the war it's a huge loss
EDL	01:44:05,376	01:44:07,168	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it's one of the few ways that
EDL	01:44:07,168	01:44:08,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In 1915
EDL	01:44:08,704	01:44:09,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Vacancy
EDL	01:44:09,984	01:44:11,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they can bring Britain
EDL	01:44:11,520	01:44:12,288	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To its knees
EDL	01:44:13,056	01:44:14,336	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They can starve thataylaa
EDL	01:44:15,104	01:44:18,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In ways that the British never could have imagined before the war
EDL	01:44:18,432	01:44:21,504	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because before the war they thought you had to have a bigger Navy to do that
EDL	01:44:22,272	01:44:23,808	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Technology and turn the table
EDL	01:44:24,576	01:44:26,112	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the greatest naval power in history
EDL	01:44:28,672	01:44:29,184	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Perhaps
EDL	01:44:29,696	01:44:30,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The most iconic
EDL	01:44:31,488	01:44:33,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Asymmetrical Warfare
EDL	01:44:33,792	01:44:35,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of this.
EDL	01:44:35,072	01:44:40,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Has to do with something that was a big worry at the Hague conferences in the late 1800s and early 1900s
EDL	01:44:41,984	01:44:42,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something that
EDL	01:44:43,520	01:44:48,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	New shows the desperation of the Germans at this stage in the war that they would Resort
EDL	01:44:49,408	01:44:50,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Involves the use
EDL	01:44:51,200	01:44:52,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What the Hague conference call
EDL	01:44:53,248	01:44:54,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Asphyxiating
EDL	01:44:55,040	01:44:55,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Gases
EDL	01:44:57,856	01:44:59,904	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Everyone is realized by the late 1800s
EDL	01:45:00,672	01:45:05,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That the modern chemical industry as we would recognize it today it come of age
EDL	01:45:06,048	01:45:08,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Meaning we're all sort of explosive gunpowder's and everything
EDL	01:45:09,376	01:45:11,680	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They were so much more explosive than
EDL	01:45:11,680	01:45:13,728	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know I've been the case in Napoleon
EDL	01:45:13,728	01:45:17,824	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Time less than a century before hand so everyone was aware of the possibilities
EDL	01:45:18,592	01:45:24,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Gunpowder and explosives were just more powerful versions of weapons that have been used for a very long time
EDL	01:45:24,992	01:45:27,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The chemical industry made possible the use of weapons

EDL	01:45:29,344	01:45:30,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No one knew
EDL	01:45:31,136	01:45:35,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And what the effects if they were used would be and so at the Hayden conference in 1899
EDL	01:45:35,744	01:45:37,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The issue was addressed
EDL	01:45:38,816	01:45:41,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The conference outlawed the use of quote
EDL	01:45:41,120	01:45:43,168	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Poison or poisoned weapons
EDL	01:45:43,680	01:45:44,192	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Arms

EDL	01:45:59,040	01:46:01,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Germany's looking at all these laws of war
EDL	01:46:02,112	01:46:03,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Completely different land
EDL	01:46:03,904	01:46:04,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As we said the trade-off
EDL	01:46:04,928	01:46:05,696	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Between
EDL	01:46:05,696	01:46:07,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Follow international law
EDL	01:46:07,488	01:46:08,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or lose the war
EDL	01:46:10,304	01:46:15,424	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's more they're dealing with this front as we said on the Western Front that had solidified an interesting way
EDL	01:46:15,936	01:46:17,216	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You said you have a
EDL	01:46:17,216	01:46:18,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Continuous trench system
EDL	01:46:18,752	01:46:21,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From the Swiss border all the way
EDL	01:46:21,056	01:46:22,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know up to the
EDL	01:46:22,080	01:46:22,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Ocean
EDL	01:46:23,616	01:46:25,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the interesting part is
EDL	01:46:25,664	01:46:29,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A lot of that territory is not really good fighting ground
EDL	01:46:30,528	01:46:34,112	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A lot of its to Marshall a lot of us to Forest did a lot of it
EDL	01:46:34,112	01:46:38,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans are in such an amazingly strong position you'd be an idiot to challenge them
EDL	01:46:38,720	01:46:44,352	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which leaves the same few spots as good areas to launch offensive
EDL	01:46:44,864	01:46:45,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Your campaign
EDL	01:46:46,656	01:46:47,680	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which means
EDL	01:46:47,680	01:46:48,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That those areas but
EDL	01:46:48,960	01:46:51,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Become the most horrific battlefields
EDL	01:46:51,264	01:46:52,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In human history
EDL	01:46:52,800	01:46:56,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because they basically don't move very much for the entire War
EDL	01:46:56,896	01:46:57,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And
EDL	01:46:57,664	01:46:59,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The same ground is
EDL	01:46:59,456	01:47:02,784	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cloud up by artillery shells over and over again
EDL	01:47:03,296	01:47:05,088	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People that died
EDL	01:47:05,600	01:47:07,904	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In some of these places are never buried
EDL	01:47:07,904	01:47:08,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And so you have
EDL	01:47:09,440	01:47:12,256	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A Charnel House of Horrors
EDL	01:47:12,256	01:47:14,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of people who just been killed the other day

EDL	01:47:20,960	01:47:21,472	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This environment
EDL	01:47:22,496	01:47:24,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Kinetochores ignores
EDL	01:47:24,032	01:47:27,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The more mundane aspects which is if you are trapped in a trench
EDL	01:47:27,872	01:47:30,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you can't move without being shot
EDL	01:47:30,688	01:47:31,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What do you go to the bathroom
EDL	01:47:32,736	01:47:34,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Early on in the combat

EDL	02:03:27,104	02:03:30,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's fascinating to look at pictures already in 1915
EDL	02:03:30,944	02:03:33,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Six to eight months after the war has started

EDL	02:03:58,336	02:04:01,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And now you have gas and soon you're going to have
EDL	02:04:01,408	02:04:07,808	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know German Cavalry Lancers for example as soon as 1916 rolls around they start having the same helmet that the Germans were
EDL	02:04:07,808	02:04:09,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Using the second world war the Stahl helm
EDL	02:04:09,856	02:04:16,256	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you have no Cavalry with lances and a Stahl Helm and a gas mask and it's the perfect example

EDL	02:07:02,656	02:07:03,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it was one day
EDL	02:07:05,472	02:07:08,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A week or two before that battle they were in relatively little danger

EDL	02:07:16,736	02:07:19,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They had to deal with these circumstances

EDL	02:07:22,112	02:07:28,256	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And after this war military psychologist looking into the phenomenon of what will later be known as shell shock

EDL	02:07:42,848	02:07:44,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Think about what's involved
EDL	02:07:44,640	02:07:46,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you begin to understand why first
EDL	02:07:46,944	02:07:47,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Take
EDL	02:07:47,712	02:07:49,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The shelling itself
EDL	02:07:49,248	02:07:49,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is
EDL	02:07:50,272	02:07:51,296	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something that
EDL	02:07:51,296	02:07:56,416	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is it really impossible for any of us to understand there are very few people living that have ever

EDL	02:08:01,792	02:08:02,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's
EDL	02:08:02,560	02:08:04,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Very hard to describe
EDL	02:08:04,096	02:08:08,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of the traditional kinds of shelling in that war was something that came to be known as Drum Fire
EDL	02:08:09,728	02:08:11,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Drumfire
EDL	02:08:11,008	02:08:15,104	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is so named because it sounds like a drum roll
EDL	02:08:15,104	02:08:21,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm instead of you just hearing the drum being tapped at that speed each one of those things represent the shell going off
EDL	02:08:21,248	02:08:23,040	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How quickly the shelter Landing

EDL	02:08:39,424	02:08:45,824	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And he was about as Brave as any Soldier you will ever find lost his composure

EDL	02:09:41,632	02:09:43,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We leaped up and ran blindly
EDL	02:09:43,936	02:09:47,776	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Chased by lightning and crushing air pressure from tree to tree
EDL	02:09:47,776	02:09:48,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Looking for cover
EDL	02:09:48,800	02:09:52,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Skirting around giant tree trunks like frightened game
EDL	02:09:52,128	02:09:54,688	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A Dugout where many men have taken shelter
EDL	02:09:54,688	02:10:00,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And which I too was running towards took a direct hit that ripped up the planking and sent heavy Timber spinning through the air
EDL	02:10:01,344	02:10:07,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like a couple of squirrels having Stones thrown at them the NCO and I dodged panting around a huge beech tree
EDL	02:10:08,000	02:10:13,376	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Quite mechanically and spurred on by further explosions I ran after my Superior
EDL	02:10:13,376	02:10:19,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who sometimes turned around and stared at me wild I yelling what in God's name are those things

EDL	02:10:20,032	02:10:25,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Suddenly there was a flash among the root work and a blow on the left Fife lonely to the ground
EDL	02:10:25,408	02:10:30,784	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I thought I've been struck by a clump of Earth but the warm trickle of blood indicated that I've been wounded
EDL	02:10:30,784	02:10:34,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Later I saw that a needle sharp piece of shrapnel had given me a flesh wound
EDL	02:10:34,880	02:10:36,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Don't my wallet had taken the brunt of it

EDL	02:10:38,208	02:10:44,608	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which before slicing into the muscle head split no fewer than nine thicknesses of stout leather looked as though it might have been

EDL	02:10:48,960	02:10:52,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I threw down my haversack and ran toward the trench weed come from
EDL	02:10:52,544	02:10:56,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From all sides wounded men were making tracks towards it from the shelter Woods
EDL	02:10:56,896	02:10:58,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The trench was appalling
EDL	02:10:58,688	02:11:01,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Choked with seriously wounded and dying man
EDL	02:11:01,248	02:11:05,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I figure stripped to the waist with a ripped open back leaned against the parapet
EDL	02:11:05,600	02:11:11,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Another with a triangular flap hanging off the back of his skull emitted short high-pitched screams
EDL	02:11:11,744	02:11:14,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This was the home of the great God pain
EDL	02:11:14,304	02:11:18,656	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And for the first time I looked through a devilish Cinque into the depths of his realm
EDL	02:11:18,656	02:11:20,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And fresh shells came down all the time
EDL	02:11:21,472	02:11:23,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I lost my head completely
EDL	02:11:23,520	02:11:26,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Ruthlessly I barged past everyone on my path
EDL	02:11:26,592	02:11:29,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Before finally having fallen back a few times in my haste
EDL	02:11:30,176	02:11:36,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Climbing out of the hellish Crush of the trench to move more freely above like a bolting horse I rushed through the dense under

EDL	02:26:29,504	02:26:32,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just not his story and I'm not a psychology
EDL	02:26:32,832	02:26:33,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just either so take this with the gray
EDL	02:26:34,880	02:26:37,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this is something that appears to be what they call a spectrum disorder
EDL	02:26:38,464	02:26:39,232	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Meaning
EDL	02:26:39,232	02:26:41,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You can have a severity scale
EDL	02:26:41,280	02:26:42,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Golf like 1 to 10
EDL	02:26:43,584	02:26:45,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And not to minimize anything
EDL	02:26:45,632	02:26:46,656	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Current veterans go through
EDL	02:26:47,168	02:26:48,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They'll often come back from these wars
EDL	02:26:49,472	02:26:50,240	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was Nightmare
EDL	02:26:51,008	02:26:52,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or an inability to sleep or
EDL	02:26:52,800	02:26:53,568	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Eat properly
EDL	02:26:53,568	02:26:57,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the we integrate into society and they've obviously suffered some trauma and damage
EDL	02:26:58,432	02:26:59,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the first world war though
EDL	02:27:00,480	02:27:02,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Those people would often be shot
EDL	02:27:03,552	02:27:07,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you couldn't see visible evidence and often times even if you could
EDL	02:27:08,416	02:27:10,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The people in that are especially
EDL	02:27:10,720	02:27:12,000	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Early in the war
EDL	02:27:12,512	02:27:18,400	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Didn't look at this as some sort of a legitimate problem to them this was just another manifestation of cowardice
EDL	02:27:19,424	02:27:20,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Punishable by Death
EDL	02:27:22,240	02:27:23,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Take for example
EDL	02:27:23,776	02:27:28,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Phillip Gibbs his account and he has a bunch of them because this was one of the things that upset him the most
EDL	02:27:28,896	02:27:30,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He would go to the front
EDL	02:27:30,176	02:27:32,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Report on what the soldiers had to endure
EDL	02:27:32,992	02:27:38,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then once they were damaged by what they had to endure report on how
EDL	02:27:38,624	02:27:42,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The completely clueless militaries of the day
EDL	02:27:42,208	02:27:47,840	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You'll then punish them again for something they were already victimized once for he tells one story for example
EDL	02:27:47,840	02:27:50,400	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm an officer that he's meeting with who comes back
EDL	02:27:50,400	02:27:54,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the meeting with him from a court-martial hearing he just been
EDL	02:27:54,496	02:27:55,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To where
EDL	02:27:55,520	02:27:58,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They'd sentenced one of these people who
EDL	02:27:58,080	02:28:00,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He had his mind blown by his experience
EDL	02:28:01,408	02:28:02,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To death
EDL	02:28:02,944	02:28:03,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He says quote
EDL	02:28:04,480	02:28:09,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Going up the camel one day I had to wait in Battalion headquarters for the officer I'd gone to see
EDL	02:28:09,600	02:28:11,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He was attending a court-martial
EDL	02:28:11,648	02:28:14,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Presently he came into the wooden Hut with a flushed face
EDL	02:28:14,976	02:28:19,584	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sorry I had to keep you you said tomorrow there will be once wine Less in the world
EDL	02:28:20,096	02:28:22,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A death sentence game said he nodded
EDL	02:28:22,912	02:28:23,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A damn coward
EDL	02:28:24,448	02:28:27,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Eddie didn't mind rifle fire but couldn't stand shells
EDL	02:28:27,520	02:28:29,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Admitted he left his post
EDL	02:28:29,312	02:28:31,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He doesn't mind rifle fire well
EDL	02:28:31,616	02:28:35,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tomorrow morning the officer laughed grimly and then listen for a second
EDL	02:28:36,224	02:28:40,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There was some heavy crump's falling over camelhill rather close it seem to our wooden Hut
EDL	02:28:41,344	02:28:43,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's talking about artillery shells falling
EDL	02:28:43,136	02:28:43,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nearby
EDL	02:28:44,416	02:28:46,976	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Damn those German Gunner said the officer
EDL	02:28:46,976	02:28:48,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Why can't they give us a little piece
EDL	02:28:49,024	02:28:50,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Return to his papers
EDL	02:28:50,304	02:28:54,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But several times while I talk with him he jerked his head up and listen to a heavy crash
EDL	02:28:54,912	02:28:55,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the way back
EDL	02:28:55,936	02:28:57,472	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I saw a man on foot
EDL	02:28:57,472	02:29:01,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Walking in front of a mountain man passed the old Hill love the shepherd bird
EDL	02:29:01,824	02:29:03,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who are the village of Lockport
EDL	02:29:03,360	02:29:05,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was something in the way he walked in his attitude
EDL	02:29:06,176	02:29:07,968	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The head hunched forward a little
EDL	02:29:07,968	02:29:09,760	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In his arms behind his back
EDL	02:29:09,760	02:29:11,296	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Would make me turn to look at it
EDL	02:29:11,808	02:29:13,088	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He was manacled
EDL	02:29:13,088	02:29:14,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Tied by a rope to the mountain man
EDL	02:29:15,648	02:29:18,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I caught one glimpse of his face and then turned away cold and sick
EDL	02:29:19,232	02:29:21,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was Doom written on his face
EDL	02:29:21,280	02:29:22,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in his eyes a captured look
EDL	02:29:23,328	02:29:24,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He was walking to his wall
EDL	02:29:25,376	02:29:25,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And quote
EDL	02:29:26,656	02:29:28,448	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean the wall where he was going to
EDL	02:29:28,448	02:29:28,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He put up again
EDL	02:29:29,728	02:29:30,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Shop
EDL	02:29:30,496	02:29:31,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By his compare
EDL	02:29:33,056	02:29:35,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Gibbs later quotes another General saying
EDL	02:29:35,360	02:29:39,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But anyone who comes down with these symptoms is a damn coward and he have them all shot
EDL	02:29:40,480	02:29:40,992	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now
EDL	02:29:41,504	02:29:44,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Early in the war this is how they thought
EDL	02:29:44,576	02:29:47,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because they didn't deal with this routinely
EDL	02:29:47,392	02:29:53,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're doing a little talk of this during the russo-japanese war a decade before this where the Russians were encountering this kind of
EDL	02:29:53,792	02:29:54,560	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No problem
EDL	02:29:54,560	02:29:57,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But this was a new experience this idea
EDL	02:29:57,888	02:30:03,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Combat fatigue battle fatigue shellshock this would be stuff by the way that all the major militaries of the world
EDL	02:30:03,264	02:30:05,824	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Would study after the first World War
EDL	02:30:05,824	02:30:07,872	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Any would incorporate what they learned
EDL	02:30:07,872	02:30:10,688	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Into training procedures and how you
EDL	02:30:10,688	02:30:14,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dealt with combat in the next War to try to minimize these problem
EDL	02:30:14,528	02:30:16,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Even later in the first World War
EDL	02:30:16,576	02:30:18,112	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The generals would learn
EDL	02:30:18,112	02:30:21,184	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you need to rotate your troops away from the front lines
EDL	02:30:21,184	02:30:24,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Regular intervals you can't leave them up there indefinitely
EDL	02:30:24,768	02:30:25,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or they're all going to go
EDL	02:30:26,560	02:30:28,352	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So you'll see these times where
EDL	02:30:28,352	02:30:30,144	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For a week or two
EDL	02:30:30,144	02:30:36,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The troops will have to live in the mud in 3 feet of standing water under shell firing all the time
EDL	02:30:36,032	02:30:38,848	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But then they'll take him to the back to the rear areas that are safer
EDL	02:30:39,872	02:30:41,152	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Can let them recover
EDL	02:30:41,152	02:30:44,224	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then slowly moving back toward the front this rotation
EDL	02:30:44,224	02:30:46,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Was intended to keep them fresh and key
EDL	02:30:46,272	02:30:48,320	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Keep them from becoming psychological casualty
EDL	02:30:49,344	02:30:50,112	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And
EDL	02:30:50,112	02:30:51,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These are people
EDL	02:30:51,648	02:30:53,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who are foaming at the mouth
EDL	02:30:53,440	02:30:54,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sometime
EDL	02:30:54,208	02:31:00,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When they were brought back from the line these are people who are saying I just can't handle it anymore General although sometimes
EDL	02:31:00,096	02:31:01,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's what you encounter
EDL	02:31:01,120	02:31:04,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These are people whose limbs have turned to Rigamortis
EDL	02:31:04,704	02:31:06,496	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or War so palsy
EDL	02:31:06,496	02:31:07,776	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They can't walk
EDL	02:31:07,776	02:31:09,312	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the epileptic seizures
EDL	02:31:09,824	02:31:14,176	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or seizure-like things you're seeing you can actually go see this by the way because after the war
EDL	02:31:14,176	02:31:16,736	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People didn't heal they never heal
EDL	02:31:16,736	02:31:18,784	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	40 years later there still
EDL	02:31:18,784	02:31:21,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm taking up Hospital space in some of these countries
EDL	02:31:21,600	02:31:26,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there are films that the doctors made showing you these people symptoms in their online you can view them
EDL	02:31:28,768	02:31:32,096	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some of these symptoms are so physical in nature
EDL	02:31:32,608	02:31:35,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That this is kind of how the term Shell Shock first became
EDL	02:31:36,448	02:31:37,216	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Fashion Nova
EDL	02:31:37,216	02:31:43,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because there were theories that maybe the concussion in the change in air pressure that the shells nearby
EDL	02:31:43,616	02:31:44,384	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Exploding
EDL	02:31:44,384	02:31:47,456	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Actually did brain damage or nerve damage to these people
EDL	02:31:48,224	02:31:51,808	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because when you actually see some of these cases and how they were affected
EDL	02:31:52,320	02:31:55,392	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That looks like physical damage it doesn't look like mental
EDL	02:31:56,416	02:31:58,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Again that did not prevent the military's
EDL	02:31:59,232	02:32:00,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm treating this as cowardice
EDL	02:32:00,768	02:32:02,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Especially early on
EDL	02:32:02,560	02:32:03,840	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And dishing out
EDL	02:32:03,840	02:32:05,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The capital punishment penalty for
EDL	02:32:07,424	02:32:08,448	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That having been said
EDL	02:32:08,448	02:32:10,240	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Still fascinating to me how
EDL	02:32:10,240	02:32:11,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You actually
EDL	02:32:11,520	02:32:12,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Had to BX
EDL	02:32:12,544	02:32:13,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Executed for this
EDL	02:32:14,080	02:32:16,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sometimes you can read books with a British
EDL	02:32:16,128	02:32:16,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These cells
EDL	02:32:16,896	02:32:18,688	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The 1970s 1970s
EDL	02:32:19,200	02:32:20,480	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's just as outraged
EDL	02:32:20,992	02:32:24,320	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No end and you looking and 330
EDL	02:32:24,320	02:32:26,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People are executed or something for

EDL	02:38:53,184	02:38:57,024	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Floated the idea first Bluetooth picked up most famously by Winston Churchill
EDL	02:38:57,024	02:38:58,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An idea of finding a flying
EDL	02:38:59,328	02:39:00,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In another fighting
EDL	02:39:00,864	02:39:01,376	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Theater
EDL	02:39:02,144	02:39:03,424	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Why do we have to
EDL	02:39:03,424	02:39:04,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Throw more troops into the meat grinder
EDL	02:39:04,960	02:39:05,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the British Empire
EDL	02:39:05,984	02:39:08,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's just starting to produce a decent number of people
EDL	02:39:09,312	02:39:10,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They got some
EDL	02:39:10,592	02:39:12,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Building up of troops happening
EDL	02:39:12,640	02:39:17,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These volunteers that first joined up at the very beginning of the war now
EDL	02:39:17,248	02:39:18,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Gone through their training.
EDL	02:39:19,040	02:39:20,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And I could be thrown in early like
EDL	02:39:21,088	02:39:23,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	General falkenhayn did with those poor
EDL	02:39:23,136	02:39:26,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Student soldiers are going to be husband in for just the right time they're green
EDL	02:39:26,976	02:39:28,000	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they're trained
EDL	02:39:29,024	02:39:30,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Must we throw these precious
EDL	02:39:30,816	02:39:31,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Intrude
EDL	02:39:31,840	02:39:32,608	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Into the meat grinder
EDL	02:39:33,376	02:39:35,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	More Empire troops by the way are also showing up the
EDL	02:39:35,936	02:39:37,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Canadians as we said the Indians were already there
EDL	02:39:37,984	02:39:38,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But other troops
EDL	02:39:39,520	02:39:41,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Really from Dominion I think we should
EDL	02:39:41,056	02:39:42,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Commonwealth earlier
EDL	02:39:42,080	02:39:44,640	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And although the term was in use it's not officially the right
EDL	02:39:44,640	02:39:46,688	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Term until between the two Wars when
EDL	02:39:46,688	02:39:48,736	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Commonwealth status is branded to some of these places
EDL	02:39:49,248	02:39:51,040	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Let's just call them to minions
EDL	02:39:51,040	02:39:52,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Troops from
EDL	02:39:52,064	02:39:53,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	New Zealand and Australia
EDL	02:39:53,856	02:39:56,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Raised up again in patriotic fervor
EDL	02:39:56,928	02:40:01,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the cause and large numbers of people relative to the total population D places
EDL	02:40:01,792	02:40:03,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're on the way
EDL	02:40:03,072	02:40:05,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are you really going to sacrifice all these troops into
EDL	02:40:05,888	02:40:06,400	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hacking
EDL	02:40:06,912	02:40:07,936	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Deepwater vacations
EDL	02:40:09,728	02:40:11,264	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the commanders on the western
EDL	02:40:11,264	02:40:12,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Front French and British war
EDL	02:40:13,568	02:40:14,592	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know of the
EDL	02:40:14,592	02:40:17,408	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Opinion that every person should be thrown into the Western
EDL	02:40:17,408	02:40:18,944	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Confront stay would argue that
EDL	02:40:18,944	02:40:22,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's only a meat grinder on the Western Front cuz we don't have enough men yet
EDL	02:40:22,528	02:40:23,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To overrun that me
EDL	02:40:24,064	02:40:28,160	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You give us enough people we will end this war fast in a lot less people will die
EDL	02:40:30,464	02:40:32,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There was as I mentioned earlier
EDL	02:40:32,512	02:40:33,536	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Kind of cabal
EDL	02:40:34,048	02:40:35,328	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Bankers
EDL	02:40:35,328	02:40:37,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Food come to the conclusion
EDL	02:40:37,120	02:40:38,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But that sort of thinking was mistaken
EDL	02:40:39,936	02:40:42,240	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it surely there are better ideas out the
EDL	02:40:43,008	02:40:44,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then to throw
EDL	02:40:44,032	02:40:47,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are more and more human beings into the teeth of the enemy's defenses
EDL	02:40:48,128	02:40:49,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Decabol had some famous members
EDL	02:40:50,688	02:40:51,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Winston Churchill
EDL	02:40:51,712	02:40:53,504	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For example maybe the most famous
EDL	02:40:53,504	02:40:57,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Call the Lord Horatio Kitchener the war minister not far behind
EDL	02:40:57,344	02:40:58,624	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And these people
EDL	02:40:59,136	02:41:00,928	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Were of the opinion I guess you could
EDL	02:41:00,928	02:41:01,952	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Compare it to
EDL	02:41:01,952	02:41:02,976	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Set up a predator
EDL	02:41:04,256	02:41:06,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They have been trying to take down
EDL	02:41:06,816	02:41:09,632	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The nastiest animal in the herd
EDL	02:41:09,632	02:41:12,960	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	4 months now and they gotten Gordon the process
EDL	02:41:12,960	02:41:15,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Germans had done damage to every
EDL	02:41:15,008	02:41:16,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Major
EDL	02:41:16,032	02:41:18,080	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Member of the Allies by this time
EDL	02:41:18,592	02:41:19,616	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there were
EDL	02:41:19,616	02:41:24,224	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The great Lions of France and Britain and Russia looking around and take you to themselves
EDL	02:41:24,224	02:41:26,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Why don't we just follow the traditional
EDL	02:41:26,528	02:41:27,552	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Predatory
EDL	02:41:27,552	02:41:29,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Son of a protein go after the week
EDL	02:41:30,368	02:41:30,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Anosike
EDL	02:41:31,904	02:41:32,416	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Any ol
EDL	02:41:33,696	02:41:36,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Instead of going after the strong and young and dangerous
EDL	02:41:38,048	02:41:41,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there was a country in the war now that met all three
EDL	02:41:42,400	02:41:45,728	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of those key classifications of the guy like Churchill would have made
EDL	02:41:47,008	02:41:47,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Country
EDL	02:41:50,592	02:41:51,104	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The week
EDL	02:41:53,152	02:41:53,920	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is more than a country
EDL	02:41:54,688	02:41:55,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's an Empire
EDL	02:41:56,736	02:41:57,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dying
EDL	02:41:59,552	02:42:00,832	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I've been calling a turkey
EDL	02:42:00,832	02:42:05,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Throughout this whole show because that's the proper name for the first world war but there's another proper name 2
EDL	02:42:05,952	02:42:11,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Conjures up a whole different set of images than the perhaps modern sounding name of Turkey
EDL	02:42:12,352	02:42:13,376	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the Ottoman Empire
EDL	02:42:15,680	02:42:17,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that conjures up images of salt
EDL	02:42:19,776	02:42:20,544	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Janissary
EDL	02:42:21,824	02:42:22,336	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Harem
EDL	02:42:23,616	02:42:27,712	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And being on the gates of Vienna almost over running into
EDL	02:42:27,712	02:42:30,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Central Europe at one point at the height of their history
EDL	02:42:30,784	02:42:32,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of knocking down
EDL	02:42:32,576	02:42:35,136	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The walls of Constantinople
EDL	02:42:35,648	02:42:37,696	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Formerly known as Byzantium to the Greek
EDL	02:42:38,208	02:42:39,744	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Constantinople to the Romans
EDL	02:42:40,256	02:42:41,280	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then
EDL	02:42:41,280	02:42:42,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	After the sultan
EDL	02:42:42,816	02:42:46,912	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And got through that historic barrier in Concord the city he renamed it
EDL	02:42:46,912	02:42:47,424	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Eastham
EDL	02:42:48,448	02:42:49,984	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As sort of a momento
EDL	02:42:50,496	02:42:52,288	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And giant Monument
EDL	02:42:52,288	02:42:53,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For what his
EDL	02:42:53,824	02:42:55,360	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Ottomans had achieved
EDL	02:42:56,896	02:42:58,432	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That was when the Ottomans were young
EDL	02:42:59,968	02:43:01,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Ottomans were old
EDL	02:43:02,272	02:43:04,576	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they were losing territory
EDL	02:43:04,576	02:43:05,600	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Over the
EDL	02:43:05,600	02:43:07,648	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Decades like nobody's business
EDL	02:43:07,648	02:43:10,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They were seen as a carcass to be picked
EDL	02:43:10,208	02:43:12,256	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The sick man of Europe they were called
EDL	02:43:13,280	02:43:14,304	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And someone like
EDL	02:43:14,816	02:43:15,840	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Churchill
EDL	02:43:15,840	02:43:16,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Looked at
EDL	02:43:16,864	02:43:21,472	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey just sitting there they come into the war in November several months after the war officially start
EDL	02:43:21,984	02:43:23,520	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they're surrounded by water
EDL	02:43:24,032	02:43:24,800	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And there
EDL	02:43:24,800	02:43:29,664	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Maybe not even a second-rate power they have the territory of a big second-rate Power lots of
EDL	02:43:30,176	02:43:33,248	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Places trying to get out of turkey but still stuck in Turkey
EDL	02:43:33,760	02:43:37,856	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hello neighbor might look at it a record might look at it or an Armenian might look at it
EDL	02:43:39,392	02:43:41,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	None the less without them mean to sort of
EDL	02:43:42,976	02:43:45,792	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Territory named one of their main reasons there been a war called the
EDL	02:43:45,792	02:43:47,072	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Crimean War
EDL	02:43:47,072	02:43:48,864	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the middle of the 19th century
EDL	02:43:48,864	02:43:49,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is because
EDL	02:43:49,888	02:43:52,704	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey was so weak and yet soul
EDL	02:43:52,704	02:43:54,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Filled with territory you could take
EDL	02:43:54,752	02:43:58,336	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the British and the French had to get involved to keep the Russians from snapping up too much of it
EDL	02:43:59,104	02:44:03,200	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So this appeared to be the easy animal in the herd to take down
EDL	02:44:03,200	02:44:08,064	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And a crucial place that might have all sorts of impact on the war if you did take him down
EDL	02:44:08,064	02:44:09,344	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Take for example
EDL	02:44:09,344	02:44:14,208	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All the countries that hadn't decided whose side they were going to fight on yet
EDL	02:44:14,976	02:44:16,512	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey enters the war as we said
EDL	02:44:17,024	02:44:21,120	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A headache for the Allies cuz they open up an entire new theater
EDL	02:44:21,632	02:44:28,032	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of operations really there might have been in a little stuff on the side going on but when turkey gets in the war in November 1914
EDL	02:44:28,032	02:44:29,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Middle East is now in
EDL	02:44:29,824	02:44:31,104	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	India maybe in
EDL	02:44:31,104	02:44:36,224	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Southern rushes in play North African Egyptian play the Balkans is in play
EDL	02:44:37,504	02:44:38,528	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Balkans
EDL	02:44:38,528	02:44:42,368	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is territory that when the ottoman Turks were young and Powerful

EDL	02:44:44,416	02:44:47,488	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They'd fought two wars in the past couple of years
EDL	02:44:48,000	02:44:53,888	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With the former territories that they used to own and watch them in a shake off the Ottoman Empire
EDL	02:44:54,400	02:44:59,008	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Serbia Bulgaria Romania Greece all these places have been pulling themselves away
EDL	02:44:59,008	02:45:01,056	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From ottoman influence for some time now
EDL	02:45:02,592	02:45:04,128	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And none of them had decided
EDL	02:45:04,128	02:45:10,272	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which side they were going to fight on in this war yet and it's fascinating and you talk about watching open diplomacy in a way
EDL	02:45:11,552	02:45:17,440	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like watching horse trading going on is watching the Allies on one side and the central powers on the other side
EDL	02:45:17,440	02:45:18,464	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Try to
EDL	02:45:18,464	02:45:22,048	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Convince a country to go their way I mean with Italy for example
EDL	02:45:22,048	02:45:24,352	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's almost open auction time
EDL	02:45:24,352	02:45:30,752	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean one Alliance will walk in the front door and say well if we win the war on you join us you can have this province from the enemy in that prob
EDL	02:45:30,752	02:45:36,896	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Believe in any other door comes together Alliance it something is that all they promised you what if we win you can have this.
EDL	02:45:37,920	02:45:42,016	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this was going on with all these countries in the Balkans and Greece
EDL	02:45:42,016	02:45:43,296	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Revamp on the Aegean
EDL	02:45:43,296	02:45:46,880	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The number two thing they were all concerned with his what were they going to get
EDL	02:45:46,880	02:45:47,904	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They got in the war
EDL	02:45:47,904	02:45:50,720	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What are you promising me and you know going to the highest bidder
EDL	02:45:50,720	02:45:52,768	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the number one thing they were all concerned
EDL	02:45:53,792	02:45:54,816	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who is going to win
EDL	02:45:56,096	02:46:00,448	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These countries knew that they were absolutely like roadkill if they picked the wrong
EDL	02:46:00,448	02:46:01,216	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Inside
EDL	02:46:01,216	02:46:03,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But in early 1915
EDL	02:46:03,519	02:46:04,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No clear-cut
EDL	02:46:04,799	02:46:06,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dominant side head emerged
EDL	02:46:07,359	02:46:10,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Wenzhou Churchill and his compatriots had this idea that
EDL	02:46:10,431	02:46:14,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They could strike a big blow in that theater right in that part of the world
EDL	02:46:14,271	02:46:18,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Even if they didn't knock anybody out with it it might convince a lot of these Powers while you can save
EDL	02:46:18,623	02:46:20,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britney's going to win France going to win let's join them
EDL	02:46:21,183	02:46:22,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Write change the course of the war that way
EDL	02:46:23,999	02:46:25,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So all these good arguments
EDL	02:46:25,791	02:46:26,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Starting to accrue for
EDL	02:46:27,583	02:46:30,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cabal of people like Winston Churchill
EDL	02:46:30,143	02:46:33,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When all of a sudden something intervenes to bring the whole thing to a head
EDL	02:46:34,495	02:46:40,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Put it on the front burner and make the government consider whether or not it's a good idea that one thing to have a good idea to another thing
EDL	02:46:40,895	02:46:42,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You really be thinking about a case of Scooby-Doo
EDL	02:46:43,455	02:46:45,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And a request from the Russians
EDL	02:46:45,247	02:46:48,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Change this from a theoretical question to one that they're debating
EDL	02:46:48,319	02:46:49,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In early January 9th

EDL	02:46:50,367	02:46:51,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians are asking for him
EDL	02:46:53,183	02:46:54,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're facing
EDL	02:46:54,463	02:46:55,999	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turks down near there
EDL	02:46:56,511	02:46:57,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a border the

EDL	02:47:05,215	02:47:06,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because of the distance
EDL	02:47:07,007	02:47:09,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians have pretty much taken their troops in
EDL	02:47:09,823	02:47:12,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're fighting for their lives against the Germans and use them up north
EDL	02:47:13,151	02:47:14,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And now the Turks are attached
EDL	02:47:14,431	02:47:15,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lacking in strength
EDL	02:47:15,455	02:47:16,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Down south
EDL	02:47:16,991	02:47:18,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The situation will get
EDL	02:47:18,271	02:47:19,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Critical and late
EDL	02:47:19,551	02:47:21,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	December 1 on December 29th
EDL	02:47:21,599	02:47:24,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turkish forces up against the Russians on their Mutual border
EDL	02:47:24,927	02:47:26,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Start the Battle of Sarah,
EDL	02:47:26,975	02:47:28,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And try to attack
EDL	02:47:28,255	02:47:29,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russian Defenders
EDL	02:47:30,047	02:47:31,327	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From multiple sides
EDL	02:47:31,839	02:47:32,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tutte
EDL	02:47:32,863	02:47:35,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Very optimistic during Napoleonic in concept
EDL	02:47:36,447	02:47:37,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Plan
EDL	02:47:37,215	02:47:39,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Led by a civilian strategy
EDL	02:47:40,031	02:47:43,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I will take a hundred and twenty thousand men a good Turkish Army
EDL	02:47:44,383	02:47:45,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And ruin it
EDL	02:47:48,479	02:47:49,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because he's Russian
EDL	02:47:50,015	02:47:52,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A smaller Force than the Turks attacking them
EDL	02:47:53,087	02:47:54,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are ensconced

EDL	02:48:01,023	02:48:02,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All this fighting is going to happen
EDL	02:48:02,559	02:48:03,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Elevation

EDL	02:48:06,399	02:48:08,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkish soldiers are going to be fighting
EDL	02:48:08,447	02:48:10,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As though they're dressed for the lowlands
EDL	02:48:11,263	02:48:12,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The logistics of this
EDL	02:48:13,311	02:48:15,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	120000 man army are going to be
EDL	02:48:15,615	02:48:20,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Carried up into these mountains on tiny little windy mountain roads and is not even many of them
EDL	02:48:20,479	02:48:23,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's snowing like you can't believe we're told of
EDL	02:48:23,807	02:48:28,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a multiple days of 14-hour marches through
EDL	02:48:28,159	02:48:33,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a waist-deep snow by the time these poor Turkish troops get to the Russians
EDL	02:48:33,535	02:48:35,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Their darn near defeated that
EDL	02:48:36,095	02:48:41,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some of them surrender ride with several cords Just Surrender that you and you just get this image of these starving
EDL	02:48:41,727	02:48:45,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know units that are just falling apart and at the end of their rope
EDL	02:48:45,055	02:48:51,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Some fight bravely and almost fanatically anyway and then the next part of the story that's famous is the retreat
EDL	02:48:51,455	02:48:52,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of this Turkish Army
EDL	02:48:52,735	02:48:55,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Back to Turkey they lose about half their strength
EDL	02:48:56,319	02:48:57,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're told that of the
EDL	02:48:58,111	02:48:59,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People that do make it back
EDL	02:48:59,391	02:49:03,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is turkey a third of them are so badly wounded that they'll have some part of their body and face
EDL	02:49:04,255	02:49:06,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the stories themselves and
EDL	02:49:06,559	02:49:07,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Amazing how
EDL	02:49:07,583	02:49:09,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A like they are booked a book
EDL	02:49:09,631	02:49:13,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they make they create the sort of mental image of like Napoleon
EDL	02:49:13,471	02:49:17,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Retreating from Moscow in the winter harried the whole way back
EDL	02:49:18,079	02:49:18,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With these
EDL	02:49:19,103	02:49:24,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Soldiers that were freezing on the March cuz it was so cold in the mountain passes in the middle of winter
EDL	02:49:24,991	02:49:26,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the Army is supposed to be followed by
EDL	02:49:28,831	02:49:29,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Through these
EDL	02:49:29,855	02:49:31,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It almost Bram Stoker

EDL	02:49:32,927	02:49:39,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And taking the Frozen soldiers as they freezer is it become too wounded to defend themselves it's a horrifying story
EDL	02:49:39,583	02:49:41,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the church will be very bitter
EDL	02:49:41,375	02:49:42,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And affected by the
EDL	02:49:42,399	02:49:42,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This battle
EDL	02:49:43,423	02:49:45,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians will be though too
EDL	02:49:45,727	02:49:47,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because even though they technically Win It
EDL	02:49:48,287	02:49:53,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For all they know the church could do this in another three weeks or another month and they're not ready for this again
EDL	02:49:53,663	02:49:55,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turkish attack down here
EDL	02:49:55,711	02:49:58,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Prove that this is not a quiet safe front
EDL	02:49:58,271	02:49:59,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you better be ready for more
EDL	02:50:00,319	02:50:01,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're not ready for
EDL	02:50:01,343	02:50:02,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	More
EDL	02:50:02,111	02:50:02,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This is why they are
EDL	02:50:02,879	02:50:03,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For help
EDL	02:50:04,671	02:50:07,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they asked for some diversion to be made
EDL	02:50:07,231	02:50:10,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Will draw some of these Turkish troops away from them
EDL	02:50:10,047	02:50:11,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And maybe something that will
EDL	02:50:12,095	02:50:13,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Open up
EDL	02:50:13,631	02:50:15,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The supply lines again
EDL	02:50:15,167	02:50:16,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because the Turks control
EDL	02:50:16,703	02:50:17,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One of the most
EDL	02:50:17,727	02:50:19,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Strategically important

EDL	02:50:40,511	02:50:41,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You look at it on

EDL	02:51:07,647	02:51:08,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Extreme importance
EDL	02:51:09,439	02:51:10,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the church control
EDL	02:51:11,231	02:51:13,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are fortresses on both sides of this

EDL	02:51:24,799	02:51:26,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they don't want the British to get through
EDL	02:51:26,591	02:51:31,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the French to get through and this is a huge problem for Russia because they don't have a lot of places
EDL	02:51:32,223	02:51:35,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know where people can trade with them via the ocean
EDL	02:51:35,807	02:51:36,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Especially
EDL	02:51:36,575	02:51:38,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know if it's anywhere near the winter months
EDL	02:51:39,391	02:51:40,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If it's near the winter months

EDL	02:51:43,487	02:51:44,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Find the Black Sea port
EDL	02:51:45,023	02:51:46,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now the trucks are closed it
EDL	02:51:46,559	02:51:48,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians are in such bad Straits
EDL	02:51:48,351	02:51:50,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are sending soldiers
EDL	02:51:50,143	02:51:51,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Into battle
EDL	02:51:51,935	02:51:52,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With a rifle
EDL	02:51:53,471	02:51:57,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then another Soldier whose job it is to Shadow the first Soldier
EDL	02:51:57,055	02:52:01,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And when the first Soldier dies pick up his rifle and use it because the second person didn't get it right
EDL	02:52:03,711	02:52:06,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russian industry cannot keep up with the military need
EDL	02:52:06,783	02:52:13,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So they're having problems like that so you can see how important it is for them to be able to trade with Britain and France and maybe I'll
EDL	02:52:13,183	02:52:13,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Outside powers
EDL	02:52:13,951	02:52:18,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If just to get rifles to arm their troops with and now the trucks are closed off
EDL	02:52:18,559	02:52:19,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An important area
EDL	02:52:19,839	02:52:21,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Winston Churchill things he can open it
EDL	02:52:23,423	02:52:24,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He gets an idea
EDL	02:52:24,959	02:52:29,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That will involve any ground troops at all he continually point this out in his book by the way
EDL	02:52:30,591	02:52:31,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Use this book for
EDL	02:52:31,615	02:52:33,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the show but not of the history book
EDL	02:52:33,663	02:52:34,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's not the kind of
EDL	02:52:34,431	02:52:35,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Do you want to use
EDL	02:52:35,199	02:52:36,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Define historical
EDL	02:52:36,223	02:52:36,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Truth
EDL	02:52:37,247	02:52:38,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's the kind of book you want to look
EDL	02:52:38,783	02:52:39,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Define
EDL	02:52:39,551	02:52:42,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The truth as Churchill saw it and Justified it after
EDL	02:52:43,391	02:52:44,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is a very different thing
EDL	02:52:45,695	02:52:47,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Churchill's fingerprints are all over this thing
EDL	02:52:47,487	02:52:48,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This thing is going to go south
EDL	02:52:50,047	02:52:56,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He does what almost any other person with any responsibility for World War in their postwar
EDL	02:52:56,447	02:52:57,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Memoirs
EDL	02:52:57,983	02:52:58,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He defends himself
EDL	02:52:59,263	02:53:01,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Answers his critics justifies this
EDL	02:53:01,567	02:53:02,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Explains that and
EDL	02:53:04,127	02:53:05,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You no different than the German generals
EDL	02:53:05,919	02:53:06,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What not
EDL	02:53:06,687	02:53:07,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In that respect
EDL	02:53:08,479	02:53:09,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But his point is
EDL	02:53:09,759	02:53:12,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When he thought of this idea
EDL	02:53:12,063	02:53:13,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It didn't involve any land troops
EDL	02:53:13,855	02:53:15,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Since its land troops are going to be a huge part of
EDL	02:53:15,903	02:53:20,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tragedy that this unfolds into he basically says he washed his hands of the whole plan once
EDL	02:53:20,767	02:53:22,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That situation changed
EDL	02:53:22,303	02:53:23,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Churchill's plan
EDL	02:53:23,583	02:53:24,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the take
EDL	02:53:24,863	02:53:28,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The largest most powerful Fleet ever assembled in world history
EDL	02:53:28,959	02:53:29,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And force the straight
EDL	02:53:31,519	02:53:32,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Simply
EDL	02:53:32,543	02:53:33,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sail through them
EDL	02:53:33,823	02:53:39,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Wiping out any Fort you know this anywhere nearby with Naval gunfire and go from one side to the
EDL	02:53:40,479	02:53:43,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then once you're on the other side you're right next to
EDL	02:53:43,295	02:53:48,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Formerly Constantinople now Istanbul and you have a giant megalopolis
EDL	02:53:48,671	02:53:50,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Underneath the guns of the greatest
EDL	02:53:50,719	02:53:51,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Fleet ever assembled
EDL	02:53:51,999	02:53:52,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sent to war
EDL	02:53:54,303	02:53:55,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's an idea that looks
EDL	02:53:55,583	02:53:56,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Great
EDL	02:53:56,351	02:53:56,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On paper
EDL	02:53:58,143	02:53:58,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then by the
EDL	02:53:58,911	02:54:03,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Time events go from a all the way through the alphabet to Z though
EDL	02:54:04,287	02:54:05,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You see who rules the alpha
EDL	02:54:07,103	02:54:08,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When it comes to getting
EDL	02:54:08,127	02:54:09,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Something from the
EDL	02:54:09,151	02:54:09,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Leafy erratic
EDL	02:54:09,919	02:54:11,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Full stage 2 the reality
EDL	02:54:11,199	02:54:12,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Beijing that's Murphy's Law
EDL	02:54:13,503	02:54:15,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Murphy's Law grabs hold of these events
EDL	02:54:16,063	02:54:18,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And quickly turns this whole Affair into something
EDL	02:54:18,879	02:54:20,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	No one had ever thought
EDL	02:54:20,671	02:54:21,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the right thing to
EDL	02:54:22,463	02:54:23,999	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Told you how people can get
EDL	02:54:23,999	02:54:28,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Swamped by events sometimes in Churchill spends a good part of his book on this subject
EDL	02:54:28,863	02:54:31,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trying to point out that he was one of the victims of what happen
EDL	02:54:34,239	02:54:35,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's often been portrayed
EDL	02:54:35,519	02:54:36,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As the architect
EDL	02:54:38,591	02:54:39,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you ever want to see
EDL	02:54:39,871	02:54:40,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Frustrating
EDL	02:54:40,895	02:54:41,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	History
EDL	02:54:41,663	02:54:42,175	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Can be sometime
EDL	02:54:43,199	02:54:44,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Look at Churchill's thinking of
EDL	02:54:45,247	02:54:48,831	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because when you examine it it's so logical he's doing exactly what
EDL	02:54:48,831	02:54:52,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Any of us would help somebody in a position of power we do in terms of
EDL	02:54:52,415	02:54:56,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm going down the arguments and the risks and benefits logically
EDL	02:54:56,767	02:54:58,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it still turns out
EDL	02:54:58,559	02:54:59,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Horribly
EDL	02:54:59,583	02:55:00,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the weather
EDL	02:55:00,607	02:55:03,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lesson is that teaching to the other commanders were saying
EDL	02:55:03,167	02:55:05,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Yeah just keep smashing against the wall
EDL	02:55:05,471	02:55:07,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Oh my goodness doesn't scene
EDL	02:55:07,263	02:55:12,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To matter whether you think outside the box we do the same darn stupid pointless thing again and again
EDL	02:55:13,151	02:55:16,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first world war equalizes the results of both of that
EDL	02:55:17,503	02:55:20,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you're darned if you think and you're darned if you don't
EDL	02:55:21,599	02:55:23,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Church of the basic assumption
EDL	02:55:23,135	02:55:26,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Was it the British Empire was sitting on an enormously powerful Fleet
EDL	02:55:27,743	02:55:28,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That was used
EDL	02:55:29,535	02:55:34,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The part that was useless is so useless you can't even use it if the enemy Fleet comes out
EDL	02:55:34,655	02:55:36,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fight is a whole bunch of British ships
EDL	02:55:36,703	02:55:39,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It were made obsolete only in 1906 remember
EDL	02:55:40,287	02:55:41,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	1940-1950
EDL	02:55:42,335	02:55:43,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What happened in 1906
EDL	02:55:44,383	02:55:45,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A brand new type of battle
EDL	02:55:47,455	02:55:50,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Became the name of the initial ship names dreadnought
EDL	02:55:50,783	02:55:53,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that becomes the name for that entire
EDL	02:55:53,599	02:55:54,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Type of vessel
EDL	02:55:55,391	02:55:56,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A dreadnought
EDL	02:55:57,439	02:55:58,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Class name now that's
EDL	02:55:58,719	02:56:00,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because that's how revolutionary this ship was
EDL	02:56:01,535	02:56:02,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is
EDL	02:56:02,559	02:56:04,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is the instant it arrives on the scene
EDL	02:56:04,863	02:56:05,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It makes obsolete
EDL	02:56:06,399	02:56:07,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Fleets of
EDL	02:56:07,679	02:56:13,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hugely expensive vessels dozens and dozens and dozens of the Dead have been built up over a lifetime makes them obsolete overnight
EDL	02:56:15,359	02:56:18,175	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And of course the British being the greatest Navy in the world they had the most of these

EDL	02:56:25,087	02:56:27,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The 1906 are ready for the scrap Heap
EDL	02:56:28,927	02:56:31,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's what Churchill said all these ships were heading for
EDL	02:56:31,487	02:56:35,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What are we saving them for they just going to be scrapped after the war he said that the Admirals had these
EDL	02:56:35,583	02:56:37,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Emotional attachments to these ships
EDL	02:56:37,887	02:56:39,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because they've served on the Moor
EDL	02:56:39,167	02:56:43,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They remember the day when these were the most powerful warships afloat in Churchill
EDL	02:56:43,007	02:56:46,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Attitude is these are assets to be used up for a gain
EDL	02:56:46,335	02:56:49,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We can use him in the Dardanelles and if we lose him we don't lose any
EDL	02:56:54,527	02:56:57,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Winston Churchill's plan of using
EDL	02:56:57,087	02:57:03,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fleet in a lightning attack that the Turks weren't ready for with massive Force I could just force The Straits before anyone
EDL	02:57:03,743	02:57:04,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Could respond to it
EDL	02:57:05,279	02:57:07,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turns into something totally different
EDL	02:57:08,095	02:57:09,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Over the next several weeks
EDL	02:57:10,911	02:57:12,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Churchill has always claimed
EDL	02:57:12,959	02:57:15,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did the events were completely out of his control
EDL	02:57:15,519	02:57:18,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What are uses as an argument the line
EDL	02:57:18,335	02:57:20,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He was told that there were no troops available
EDL	02:57:20,895	02:57:23,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So any plan he came up with pretty much had to have
EDL	02:57:23,455	02:57:27,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A tiny little group of Marines to run on Shore and knock out a gun if necessary
EDL	02:57:27,551	02:57:30,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But nothing else so he says basically he can't be responsible
EDL	02:57:30,367	02:57:32,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sponsible for this land disaster that's about to happen
EDL	02:57:32,927	02:57:34,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He never assumed there be any troops anyway here's what he said
EDL	02:57:35,743	02:57:36,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Quote
EDL	02:57:36,511	02:57:40,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At the evening meeting of the war council on January 28th
EDL	02:57:40,095	02:57:44,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When the final decision to adopt the plan was taken Lord Kitchener repeated quote
EDL	02:57:44,959	02:57:47,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We have at present no troops to spare
EDL	02:57:47,263	02:57:53,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was on that Foundation alone that all our decisions in favor of a purely Naval attack have been taken
EDL	02:57:53,663	02:57:57,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But henceforward a series of new facts and pressures came into play
EDL	02:57:57,759	02:58:01,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which gradually but unceasingly change the character
EDL	02:58:01,599	02:58:04,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	An enormously extended the scale of the Enterprise
EDL	02:58:04,671	02:58:08,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Under these influences in less than 2 months the naval attack
EDL	02:58:08,511	02:58:12,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With its lack of certainty but with its limited costs and risks
EDL	02:58:12,351	02:58:13,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Became subsidiary
EDL	02:58:13,887	02:58:17,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in its place there arose a military development of great magnitude
EDL	02:58:17,983	02:58:21,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Over this new plan the admiralty had no responsible control
EDL	02:58:21,823	02:58:28,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Our advice did not Prevail our criticisms were not welcomed and even inquiries became a matter of
EDL	02:58:28,223	02:58:28,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Delicacy intact
EDL	02:58:29,503	02:58:30,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:58:30,271	02:58:32,831	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By the results of this military operation
EDL	02:58:32,831	02:58:34,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We had to stand or fall
EDL	02:58:35,135	02:58:35,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And quote
EDL	02:58:36,159	02:58:38,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I know you don't need translation from me
EDL	02:58:38,463	02:58:43,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But isn't that the same as saying hey that wasn't my idea you changed it but I still have to be responsible for it
EDL	02:58:44,863	02:58:46,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You see a lot of post World War 1 map
EDL	02:58:46,911	02:58:48,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Martin sound like that
EDL	02:58:48,191	02:58:48,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:58:48,959	02:58:51,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It adequately explains how
EDL	02:58:51,007	02:58:56,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Out of control the process seen once Churchill and his cabal had taken their little private idea
EDL	02:58:56,383	02:59:00,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And had adopted by not just one government but the Allies as
EDL	02:59:00,735	02:59:01,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The plan
EDL	02:59:02,015	02:59:03,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of course in the final analysis
EDL	02:59:04,063	02:59:06,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The people with the most control over your plan
EDL	02:59:06,879	02:59:07,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If your wisdom Church
EDL	02:59:08,927	02:59:10,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are the ones on the scene
EDL	02:59:10,975	02:59:11,999	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Actually have to make it work
EDL	02:59:12,511	02:59:13,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The military can
EDL	02:59:14,303	02:59:15,327	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In this case the Admiral
EDL	02:59:17,119	02:59:18,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On February
EDL	02:59:18,655	02:59:24,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	17th a couple of those Admirals are leading the most powerful Fleet that's ever gone to war
EDL	02:59:26,847	02:59:27,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Bleeding a little
EDL	02:59:27,615	02:59:31,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who poker the most powerful Fleet in the world is the British Fleet sitting
EDL	02:59:31,199	02:59:35,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'll be in scapa flow up in Scotland waiting for the German Fleet to come out
EDL	02:59:35,807	02:59:36,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Play
EDL	02:59:36,831	02:59:38,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But that bleeds never done any
EDL	02:59:38,879	02:59:40,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're waiting for their chance
EDL	02:59:40,415	02:59:44,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's the largest most powerful Fleet that ever gone to war and try to do something so far
EDL	02:59:44,767	02:59:45,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This one
EDL	02:59:46,303	02:59:49,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	18 or so battleships most of the British summer in French
EDL	02:59:50,143	02:59:52,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Most of these the old battleships
EDL	02:59:52,447	02:59:55,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That were made obsolete a decade before but also including
EDL	02:59:55,519	02:59:57,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The newest Super dreadnought
EDL	02:59:57,567	02:59:59,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Queen Elizabeth with 15 inch guns

EDL	03:00:04,735	03:00:07,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This Fleet might not have lasted very long again
EDL	03:00:07,807	03:00:08,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Crack
EDL	03:00:08,575	03:00:10,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	German Fleet
EDL	03:00:10,111	03:00:13,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But in this part of the world it's the most powerful
EDL	03:00:13,183	03:00:13,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Uniforce afloat
EDL	03:00:14,975	03:00:17,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And would have been the greatest thing in the world a decade
EDL	03:00:18,047	03:00:20,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It arrives in off the coast
EDL	03:00:20,095	03:00:21,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turkey and begins
EDL	03:00:21,119	03:00:22,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Selling those
EDL	03:00:22,143	03:00:22,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Straits
EDL	03:00:23,679	03:00:24,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On February 19th
EDL	03:00:25,727	03:00:27,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And things starts
EDL	03:00:27,007	03:00:27,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Slowing down
EDL	03:00:29,055	03:00:32,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Plan is to battle your way through destroy all these fortresses as you continue to move.
EDL	03:00:32,895	03:00:34,175	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Deeper and deeper into this
EDL	03:00:34,175	03:00:35,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A river like
EDL	03:00:35,199	03:00:36,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Piece of geography
EDL	03:00:36,735	03:00:38,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But you know the weather gets bad
EDL	03:00:38,783	03:00:39,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sweet Retreats
EDL	03:00:39,551	03:00:40,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Into a safe distance
EDL	03:00:41,087	03:00:46,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then it comes up and they shall come forth and then something else goes wrong and Church of the sitting back in Britain going crazy pulling his hair out
EDL	03:00:46,975	03:00:49,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sending messages after messages basically saying
EDL	03:00:49,535	03:00:52,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hurry hurry hurry the whole plan requires you to hurry
EDL	03:00:53,119	03:00:54,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because the longer they take
EDL	03:00:54,655	03:00:57,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The more you lose this whole idea that there's some surprise to it
EDL	03:00:57,983	03:00:59,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The catches the Turks off guard
EDL	03:00:59,775	03:01:04,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And so the Turks have already figured out when you see the largest Fleet than it ever going to war
EDL	03:01:04,639	03:01:10,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Show the British are doing something down here the good news is that does take away troops fighting the Russians and take some pressure off
EDL	03:01:12,575	03:01:13,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He asked for help
EDL	03:01:13,599	03:01:14,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first place
EDL	03:01:14,367	03:01:17,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The bad news is instead of the British advancing against a totally
EDL	03:01:17,951	03:01:21,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm ready fo you know when taking advantage of surprise
EDL	03:01:21,279	03:01:25,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're sitting there giving the whole basic idea way
EDL	03:01:25,119	03:01:25,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Vermont
EDL	03:01:27,679	03:01:29,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the 18th of March
EDL	03:01:29,215	03:01:35,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The fleet decide to try again in a big way Churchill's back there prodding and get to work it out there do a big attack
EDL	03:01:35,615	03:01:39,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the 18 battleships in the whole Fleet goes in start selling the Ford
EDL	03:01:39,199	03:01:40,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Submarines are
EDL	03:01:40,223	03:01:44,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Detached and sent on land to go take some of these sports that are particularly troublesome
EDL	03:01:44,575	03:01:45,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then
EDL	03:01:46,111	03:01:47,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A ship hits a mine
EDL	03:01:48,415	03:01:49,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	French battleship
EDL	03:01:49,951	03:01:50,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Range Rover
EDL	03:01:50,975	03:01:51,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Really quick
EDL	03:01:51,999	03:01:53,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	About 700 people died
EDL	03:01:53,279	03:01:53,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Kaboom
EDL	03:01:55,327	03:01:57,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Before anyone's had time to digest.
EDL	03:01:57,887	03:01:58,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Another one
EDL	03:01:59,935	03:02:03,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then another one and by the way on the scene they don't know that these are mine
EDL	03:02:03,519	03:02:09,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Mine's are one of the things I thought about Torpedoes or another all they know is big expensive important ships
EDL	03:02:10,175	03:02:10,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At least in the old
EDL	03:02:10,943	03:02:12,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are starting
EDL	03:02:12,223	03:02:13,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sink and list and
EDL	03:02:13,503	03:02:17,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Explode and the commanders pull everything back and by the time
EDL	03:02:17,599	03:02:18,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They get away from The Straits
EDL	03:02:19,391	03:02:20,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They've lost
EDL	03:02:20,415	03:02:21,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or seen
EDL	03:02:21,951	03:02:22,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Triple six
EDL	03:02:24,767	03:02:28,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now what Winston Churchill would say and what he did say is who cares
EDL	03:02:28,863	03:02:32,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These are old battleships are not of any use to us at all
EDL	03:02:32,703	03:02:35,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So using to take the straight but at least take the straight
EDL	03:02:35,519	03:02:37,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He said the Admirals had a whole different opinion
EDL	03:02:38,591	03:02:41,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They didn't see this as an asset to be used
EDL	03:02:41,151	03:02:42,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They saw it as
EDL	03:02:42,431	03:02:43,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A
EDL	03:02:43,199	03:02:44,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Charge to protect
EDL	03:02:44,991	03:02:51,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Pajamas he said had an emotional attachment to these ships they walk their decks back when they were young officers in
EDL	03:02:51,391	03:02:52,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Chinese ships were the
EDL	03:02:52,415	03:02:54,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Queens of the Seas and he says now they had this
EDL	03:02:54,975	03:02:59,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Attachment they didn't want to lose them and the whole point was they were there cuz they were losable
EDL	03:03:00,351	03:03:05,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Again what's so terrible about what follows is Churchill's attitude was that the sleep was totally expendable
EDL	03:03:05,727	03:03:07,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Put in order to protect this
EDL	03:03:07,519	03:03:10,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Expendable Fleet the high command decides the ground troops how to
EDL	03:03:10,847	03:03:11,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Be sent in
EDL	03:03:12,127	03:03:13,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They pull the fleet back
EDL	03:03:13,407	03:03:16,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I begin assembling these 80000 men that they're going to attack
EDL	03:03:17,247	03:03:19,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	This area within the plan is
EDL	03:03:19,551	03:03:24,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To overwhelm this peninsula called the Gallipoli Peninsula that's right next to the Dardanelles
EDL	03:03:24,671	03:03:28,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And take over all those Forts and all those gun positions with your ground troops
EDL	03:03:29,535	03:03:35,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then those guns won't fire on your little teeny minesweepers were clearing the Straits of the mines
EDL	03:03:35,167	03:03:36,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then your big battleships won't get mine
EDL	03:03:38,239	03:03:39,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it's the tail
EDL	03:03:39,519	03:03:40,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Wagging the dog here
EDL	03:03:41,311	03:03:44,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Churchill and others have said ever since the war was over
EDL	03:03:44,383	03:03:45,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That this was a disaster
EDL	03:03:45,919	03:03:47,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Waiting to happen because the whole point of this
EDL	03:03:47,967	03:03:52,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Plan is to use strategic surprise to catch the enemy off guard
EDL	03:03:52,319	03:03:54,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How's it going to be going to be caught off-guard when it takes
EDL	03:03:55,135	03:03:55,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	5
EDL	03:03:55,903	03:03:58,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Weeks after the battleships pull back
EDL	03:03:58,719	03:04:00,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To get the ground forces on the beach
EDL	03:04:02,303	03:04:03,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turks are commanded
EDL	03:04:03,583	03:04:04,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	My German Jen
EDL	03:04:04,863	03:04:05,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Case
EDL	03:04:06,655	03:04:09,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A very competent guy named liman Von Sanders who supposedly says
EDL	03:04:10,239	03:04:16,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If the Allies will just give him eight days he can put together a defense he's desperate for time
EDL	03:04:16,639	03:04:17,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In 5 weeks
EDL	03:04:18,687	03:04:20,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By the time the landings take place
EDL	03:04:20,991	03:04:23,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In late April early May 1915
EDL	03:04:24,319	03:04:27,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To say that the Turks are ready maybe is a little bit presumptuous
EDL	03:04:28,159	03:04:28,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they're waiting
EDL	03:04:31,743	03:04:33,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you get a chance to see
EDL	03:04:34,559	03:04:37,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What the worst nightmares of Allied planners
EDL	03:04:38,143	03:04:41,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're planning for D-Day in the second world war you know the attack
EDL	03:04:42,239	03:04:43,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Across the beaches
EDL	03:04:43,263	03:04:45,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Across the English Channel Landing
EDL	03:04:45,055	03:04:51,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Allied troops on the occupied French Coastline so you can see what their nightmares must have been like because they were young men when they
EDL	03:04:51,455	03:04:54,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They got to see how something like an amphibious assault could go wrong
EDL	03:04:54,527	03:04:55,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Have they saw it on the
EDL	03:04:55,807	03:04:56,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Beaches of
EDL	03:04:58,367	03:04:59,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	First of all
EDL	03:04:59,647	03:05:01,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was a nightmare
EDL	03:05:01,951	03:05:02,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Improvisation
EDL	03:05:04,511	03:05:06,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These troops were trained
EDL	03:05:06,047	03:05:08,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For war not trained for amphibious assault
EDL	03:05:09,119	03:05:10,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They landed sometimes on the wrong Beach
EDL	03:05:11,423	03:05:16,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They have completely somehow gotten the train all wrong even with aerial surveillance
EDL	03:05:16,799	03:05:19,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean the poor Australians are landed in a
EDL	03:05:19,615	03:05:23,199	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Mile from where they were supposed to land
EDL	03:05:23,199	03:05:25,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's like a reverse Amphitheater
EDL	03:05:25,759	03:05:30,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A historian John Keegan who visited the sites of the one thing that overwhelms you when you go there
EDL	03:05:30,623	03:05:31,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I needed it this
EDL	03:05:31,903	03:05:38,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I need little coal and you drop a ton of Australians there with The High Ground all around them like an Amphitheater
EDL	03:05:38,815	03:05:39,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And just leave them
EDL	03:05:41,119	03:05:42,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm some of these beaches
EDL	03:05:42,399	03:05:47,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Allies are able to land route relatively easily and try to capture The High Ground
EDL	03:05:47,263	03:05:51,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Another Beaches they landed on sure what to do on a couple of these
EDL	03:05:51,359	03:05:53,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Beaches the Turks are waiting for them
EDL	03:05:53,663	03:05:54,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And massacres
EDL	03:05:55,199	03:05:56,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	She would have won
EDL	03:05:56,223	03:05:58,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Allies had taken a a
EDL	03:05:58,527	03:05:59,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Transport ship
EDL	03:05:59,551	03:06:04,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And cut out a hole in it so that they can drive it right up on the beach in the soldiers could just
EDL	03:06:04,671	03:06:06,207	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Jump out and be ready to fight
EDL	03:06:06,719	03:06:08,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The troops trained machine gun
EDL	03:06:08,511	03:06:09,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the door
EDL	03:06:09,535	03:06:14,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm in the door opened and all these troops jumped out they were machine-gunned one by one by one as they hit the
EDL	03:06:15,935	03:06:16,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Less than
EDL	03:06:16,959	03:06:17,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	25 of them
EDL	03:06:19,007	03:06:19,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Several hundred
EDL	03:06:21,055	03:06:25,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Even when the Allied Forces at Great cost sometimes take these beaches
EDL	03:06:25,407	03:06:27,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're not only sure what to do next
EDL	03:06:28,479	03:06:31,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They have no idea how things are going on the beach next to them
EDL	03:06:31,551	03:06:36,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They don't know if the ships know where they are the ships don't know where they are there's no coordination going on
EDL	03:06:37,183	03:06:42,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you really get a wonderful object lesson in which you're also getting on the Western Front
EDL	03:06:43,071	03:06:45,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Concerning what weapon system is really missing
EDL	03:06:46,143	03:06:46,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	War
EDL	03:06:46,911	03:06:52,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Unit exist but not in the way where it's coordinated not in the way that you'll see it come of age in the next World War
EDL	03:06:52,799	03:06:54,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's one of those things that when you
EDL	03:06:54,847	03:07:01,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Considerate in a vacuum it doesn't even sound like a weapon it's like barbed wire you don't think of Barbed wires weapon you don't think of Ray
EDL	03:07:01,247	03:07:03,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Radio communications as a weapon either
EDL	03:07:04,831	03:07:09,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Pin the missing ingredient in so many of these missed opportunities in this war
EDL	03:07:09,439	03:07:15,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If only the troops that broke through knew they broke through if only they could change were the artillery with shootings if only we could
EDL	03:07:15,839	03:07:18,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Bring up reinforcements this happens all the time on the Western Front
EDL	03:07:19,679	03:07:20,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now it's happening
EDL	03:07:20,959	03:07:21,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Gallipoli
EDL	03:07:23,519	03:07:24,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Sometimes these troops land
EDL	03:07:25,311	03:07:31,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Imma just noticed and they don't know what they're supposed to do next or they take the first position that the plans ahead of time called for them to take
EDL	03:07:31,711	03:07:32,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they stop there
EDL	03:07:32,991	03:07:35,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What would you expect them to do they don't know what's going on
EDL	03:07:36,319	03:07:39,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Have to be careful of their own artillery going to Shell them
EDL	03:07:39,647	03:07:40,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem is is once again
EDL	03:07:41,439	03:07:42,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It allows the Turks
EDL	03:07:43,999	03:07:46,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you will see a lot of fighting going on
EDL	03:07:46,559	03:07:48,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the high ground bees areas
EDL	03:07:48,607	03:07:50,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That Overlook the beaches
EDL	03:07:51,167	03:07:55,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know this whole time still might have work if the Turks had turned out to be a soft
EDL	03:07:55,007	03:07:55,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Anime
EDL	03:07:56,031	03:07:58,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know if they turned out to be as weak
EDL	03:07:58,079	03:07:59,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And is decadent and his
EDL	03:07:59,871	03:08:03,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The unmotivated is Allied planner sort of assumed that they would be
EDL	03:08:03,711	03:08:05,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Instead they fought like a lion
EDL	03:08:06,783	03:08:11,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which of the Turks are capable of the Turks are very dangerous Soldiers the ethnic Turks especially
EDL	03:08:11,135	03:08:13,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they'll be an incident at one of the top

EDL	03:08:33,151	03:08:34,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And he ordered his troops there

EDL	03:08:36,223	03:08:37,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To hold them off and he says

EDL	03:26:17,087	03:26:18,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Defeat the Turks in that battle
EDL	03:26:19,135	03:26:20,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who composed of Armenia
EDL	03:26:21,439	03:26:22,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Armenians
EDL	03:26:22,463	03:26:23,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From the Russian song
EDL	03:26:23,999	03:26:24,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Date of the Border
EDL	03:26:26,303	03:26:27,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A bunch of the Ottoman troops
EDL	03:26:27,839	03:26:29,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the defeated Army
EDL	03:26:29,119	03:26:30,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're also Armenians
EDL	03:26:31,167	03:26:32,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And to make matters even more complicated
EDL	03:26:32,959	03:26:34,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	There were some Armenian Rebels
EDL	03:26:34,751	03:26:37,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We're trying to create some sort of a state of Their Own
EDL	03:26:39,103	03:26:43,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And who can blame them for wanting the wrong state after so much persecution for so long
EDL	03:26:43,967	03:26:46,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the way the Ottoman Empire Beauty
EDL	03:26:46,271	03:26:46,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	People
EDL	03:26:47,295	03:26:49,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know what the best of times was unreliable
EDL	03:26:50,367	03:26:56,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Once the Russians win the important battle in late 1914 or early 1950s and the Turks feel their back up against the wall
EDL	03:26:57,023	03:27:01,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Now they begin to worry that the Armenians on their side of the Border are positively dangerous
EDL	03:27:03,167	03:27:04,959	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know the ones who are loyal
EDL	03:27:04,959	03:27:09,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are potentially vulnerable to subversion or propaganda
EDL	03:27:09,567	03:27:11,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or maybe even having to do Guerrilla groups
EDL	03:27:12,895	03:27:16,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You coerced them into cooperation through agile practices
EDL	03:27:16,991	03:27:19,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like killing collaborators as it's called
EDL	03:27:19,807	03:27:24,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's the best-case scenario worst case scenario you Armenian subjects are just loyal to the Core
EDL	03:27:24,927	03:27:28,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And are hoping waiting and actively working behind the scenes
EDL	03:27:29,023	03:27:30,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To help the Russians
EDL	03:27:31,839	03:27:34,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To the Turkish government this is treason
EDL	03:27:35,423	03:27:36,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They are
EDL	03:27:36,191	03:27:41,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Feeling like you're either about to be or are being stabbed in the back and their government
EDL	03:27:41,055	03:27:44,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As we said never all that enthused about Armenians anyway
EDL	03:27:44,639	03:27:48,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Decide that a solution has to be found in their solution is to get rid of the Armenia
EDL	03:27:50,015	03:27:52,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you believe the official Turkish line
EDL	03:27:52,063	03:27:53,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Getting rid of the Armenians Medrol okay
EDL	03:27:55,135	03:27:56,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you believe what
EDL	03:27:56,159	03:27:59,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Majority of historians obviously Armenians believe
EDL	03:27:59,743	03:28:01,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Getting rid of the men killing
EDL	03:28:03,071	03:28:05,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The process when it began with systemic
EDL	03:28:05,119	03:28:05,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One Village
EDL	03:28:05,887	03:28:06,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	After another
EDL	03:28:06,911	03:28:08,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was done with a certain amount of
EDL	03:28:08,703	03:28:10,239	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Understanding
EDL	03:28:10,239	03:28:12,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That it would be bad publicity
EDL	03:28:12,287	03:28:13,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The
EDL	03:28:13,055	03:28:14,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Christian Towers
EDL	03:28:14,591	03:28:17,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Russia mainly but also Britain and France
EDL	03:28:17,151	03:28:18,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Had often times used
EDL	03:28:18,943	03:28:23,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Persecution against the Armenians and other Christian groups as an excuse to
EDL	03:28:23,295	03:28:27,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Intervene in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire that's the way the Ottoman Empire was it got it
EDL	03:28:27,903	03:28:33,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So then there was all the reason in the world not to publicize that you were doing this and not make a big deal out of
EDL	03:28:34,047	03:28:36,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Official line of the Turkish government is the during
EDL	03:28:36,607	03:28:41,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These efforts to move the Armenian people away from the trouble spot
EDL	03:28:41,215	03:28:43,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It won't be a problem if you moving to say Syria
EDL	03:28:43,775	03:28:44,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A lot on.
EDL	03:28:45,311	03:28:46,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Through starvation
EDL	03:28:46,591	03:28:47,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Do disease
EDL	03:28:47,615	03:28:54,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Through hostile ethnic groups that never like the like the Kurds decided to take advantage and swoop in and killed a man in right there
EDL	03:28:54,015	03:28:55,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Women in all the horrible things
EDL	03:28:56,575	03:28:57,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But there's so much ever
EDL	03:28:58,879	03:29:00,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That this was done
EDL	03:29:01,183	03:29:04,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the same sort of fashion that any one of us would recognize
EDL	03:29:04,767	03:29:06,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Genocide being iffy
EDL	03:29:06,047	03:29:11,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It was the Holocaust or Rwanda or it really reminds one of the former Yugoslavia a lot
EDL	03:29:12,447	03:29:13,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the trucks are very sensitive
EDL	03:29:15,007	03:29:17,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Any Armenians are very angry that they won't admit it
EDL	03:29:18,079	03:29:19,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know this is where I get a little upset with this whole
EDL	03:29:21,663	03:29:24,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The idea of genocide as an official
EDL	03:29:24,223	03:29:25,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	International crime
EDL	03:29:26,015	03:29:27,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Only a rose in the
EDL	03:29:27,807	03:29:28,831	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Middle 1940
EDL	03:29:30,111	03:29:31,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And since that time
EDL	03:29:31,647	03:29:33,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That word has become a legal High
EDL	03:29:34,975	03:29:37,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Where it would if someone were actually
EDL	03:29:38,047	03:29:39,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Convicted of genocide
EDL	03:29:39,583	03:29:42,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I trigger all sorts of real-world ramifications
EDL	03:29:42,911	03:29:47,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And so everybody does everything they can for the most part unless it's a pariah state
EDL	03:29:47,263	03:29:49,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To find anything except genocide
EDL	03:29:49,823	03:29:50,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Welts
EDL	03:29:50,847	03:29:52,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Hundreds of thousands of people died
EDL	03:29:52,895	03:29:56,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it's merely a crime against humanity cuz there was no intent mean
EDL	03:29:56,735	03:29:59,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Become a legalistic word where all these different things have to be mad at the

EDL	03:30:14,399	03:30:15,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Did acknowledge
EDL	03:30:15,423	03:30:17,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Their genocidal practices at one time
EDL	03:30:17,983	03:30:23,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They were a group that have Arisen in the more trying to get that overturned in Japan there are right-wing nationalist now we're trying to now
EDL	03:30:24,383	03:30:25,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cover up and down play

EDL	03:30:30,015	03:30:31,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The most normal thing in the world
EDL	03:30:32,063	03:30:33,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But we've all done it
EDL	03:30:34,111	03:30:35,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's why it's hard for me to understand
EDL	03:30:35,903	03:30:36,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Turkish
EDL	03:30:36,927	03:30:39,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Attitude the decisive blow to their pride somehow
EDL	03:30:39,487	03:30:41,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If they hadn't committed the genocide they be
EDL	03:30:42,559	03:30:46,143	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like one of the only people on the planet of any consequence it hadn't

EDL	03:30:51,007	03:30:52,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Go look at the Old Testament of the Bible
EDL	03:30:53,567	03:30:54,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A book that Jews
EDL	03:30:54,847	03:30:57,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Christians and Muslims all hold sacred
EDL	03:30:58,431	03:31:00,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The god of the Old Testament orders

EDL	03:31:12,255	03:31:14,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The reason it's in the Old Testament
EDL	03:31:14,047	03:31:15,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is because that was such
EDL	03:31:15,583	03:31:18,911	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Common behavior that those people at the time would have understood it

EDL	03:31:27,103	03:31:28,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Same is true for

EDL	03:31:29,407	03:31:30,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We've all
EDL	03:31:30,431	03:31:31,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Had ancestors

EDL	03:31:49,119	03:31:50,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is that we act as though

EDL	03:31:52,191	03:31:56,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or that bad people committed this unusual act when in reality as they say

EDL	03:33:13,087	03:33:14,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And what's interesting is
EDL	03:33:14,367	03:33:19,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Armenian Genocide actually overshadows something similar to it involving
EDL	03:33:19,487	03:33:23,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians retreating in 1915 from a German offensive in Poland

EDL	03:33:28,191	03:33:29,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And a lot of those people never return

EDL	03:33:38,431	03:33:41,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And interstingly enough in a wonderful sort of karmic way

EDL	03:34:29,631	03:34:30,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is not just
EDL	03:34:30,655	03:34:33,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Beginning to look like the equation in these horrible
EDL	03:34:33,983	03:34:34,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Criminal
EDL	03:34:34,751	03:34:35,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Genocides
EDL	03:34:36,287	03:34:38,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Starting to look like the equation
EDL	03:34:38,847	03:34:40,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In that algebra
EDL	03:34:40,383	03:34:41,407	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Problem

EDL	03:34:43,455	03:34:44,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How you win the war

EDL	03:34:52,415	03:34:53,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know after
EDL	03:34:53,695	03:34:56,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Another horrible battle on the Western Front
EDL	03:34:56,255	03:34:57,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	1915 when the Allies lose

EDL	03:35:02,143	03:35:05,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The French General Patton becomes one of the first Allied Commander to openly say
EDL	03:35:05,983	03:35:08,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If this war is not going to be one by some miraculous
EDL	03:35:08,543	03:35:09,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Breakthrough
EDL	03:35:09,567	03:35:11,615	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or some tactical or strategic
EDL	03:35:11,615	03:35:13,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Bit of Brilliance that opens up
EDL	03:35:13,663	03:35:15,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know flying for a breakthrough
EDL	03:35:15,967	03:35:18,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Going to be one by killing more of the enemy
EDL	03:35:19,039	03:35:19,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then we lose ourselves
EDL	03:35:21,087	03:35:22,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The war's turning into a war
EDL	03:35:22,879	03:35:23,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Attrition
EDL	03:35:24,159	03:35:26,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And while that might sound like an ultimate Allied victory
EDL	03:35:27,743	03:35:29,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because if everybody kills
EDL	03:35:29,279	03:35:34,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know one person on the other side until there's no one left the Allies have a lot more people than the central
EDL	03:35:35,423	03:35:36,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The problem with that
EDL	03:35:36,447	03:35:37,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Little bit of mathematics
EDL	03:35:37,983	03:35:39,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Set the Central Powers
EDL	03:35:39,007	03:35:40,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are killing
EDL	03:35:40,031	03:35:42,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	More Allied troops in a losing themselves
EDL	03:35:43,359	03:35:44,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And will do so ever

EDL	03:35:48,223	03:35:50,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So that mathematical equation is as yet

EDL	03:35:52,063	03:35:52,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And I'm predict
EDL	03:35:54,111	03:35:54,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But of course

EDL	03:36:07,423	03:36:08,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which means they'll fight

EDL	03:37:27,039	03:37:28,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Indy start with
EDL	03:37:28,063	03:37:30,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The piano and then build off the battery start
EDL	03:37:30,111	03:37:31,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Destruction and fill in the middle or
EDL	03:37:31,647	03:37:32,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And he's supposed to say
EDL	03:37:32,927	03:37:33,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it comes to him
EDL	03:37:34,463	03:37:34,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like
EDL	03:37:36,511	03:37:37,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The same time
EDL	03:37:37,791	03:37:38,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	All together
EDL	03:37:38,559	03:37:42,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that phrase keeps popping into my head because that's the biggest challenge
EDL	03:37:42,911	03:37:45,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In telling this first world war story
EDL	03:37:45,215	03:37:48,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The second biggest challenges the ungodly amount
EDL	03:37:48,031	03:37:48,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Material
EDL	03:37:49,055	03:37:51,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It is produced from many different
EDL	03:37:51,103	03:37:52,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Countries in viewpoints
EDL	03:37:52,639	03:37:56,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	About the story I've never been so overwhelmed with material as I have been for this
EDL	03:37:56,991	03:38:00,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's all controversial so you really need to read a bunch of different
EDL	03:38:01,087	03:38:03,135	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In authors and viewpoints tutu
EDL	03:38:03,135	03:38:04,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Get a sort of a nice
EDL	03:38:04,927	03:38:06,719	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Broadview some of these
EDL	03:38:07,487	03:38:10,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the stories can't even be compartmentalize because they affect each other
EDL	03:38:11,583	03:38:17,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What's going on in the Eastern front affects outcomes on the Western Front which affect outcomes in the Mediterranean theater and
EDL	03:38:17,983	03:38:19,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So you can't even tell the stories
EDL	03:38:21,055	03:38:22,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Separately they all have to
EDL	03:38:22,591	03:38:26,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The kind of weave together and it's really easy with this much going on
EDL	03:38:26,431	03:38:27,967	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To lose track of the story
EDL	03:38:28,991	03:38:31,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So I thought we would have a rare
EDL	03:38:31,551	03:38:32,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Little Rico
EDL	03:38:32,831	03:38:37,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As to where we are right now so the broad Trends to get us up to speed
EDL	03:38:37,695	03:38:38,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And a few thoughts
EDL	03:38:38,975	03:38:41,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From the last show that I'd like to do
EDL	03:38:41,023	03:38:42,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just throw in a little extra
EDL	03:38:42,303	03:38:44,351	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Love here at the end no extra charge
EDL	03:38:44,863	03:38:47,167	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just bring us up to speed make sure I cover
EDL	03:38:47,679	03:38:49,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I have a list of things I want to make sure I
EDL	03:38:51,519	03:38:53,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I hate to get through this whole show Tayo I left
EDL	03:38:53,823	03:38:54,335	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That out
EDL	03:38:55,871	03:38:57,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A quick recap
EDL	03:38:57,663	03:38:58,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Can be done relatively soon
EDL	03:38:59,711	03:39:00,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The war breaks out
EDL	03:39:00,991	03:39:02,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In August 9th
EDL	03:39:02,015	03:39:02,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	1914
EDL	03:39:03,295	03:39:09,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A bunch of these countries have been ready for predicting yet they mobilize quickly it's all on a time scale and everybody
EDL	03:39:09,695	03:39:11,743	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Launches their pre-war battle plan
EDL	03:39:11,743	03:39:14,559	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Switch for the Germans is most famously called the Schlieffen
EDL	03:39:15,583	03:39:17,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Advance through Belgium in a wide Arc
EDL	03:39:18,399	03:39:20,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Smashed the French armies on the head while you're
EDL	03:39:21,215	03:39:23,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Keeping them occupied to the front as well
EDL	03:39:24,031	03:39:25,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That doesn't go too well
EDL	03:39:25,823	03:39:27,103	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It does for a while
EDL	03:39:27,103	03:39:29,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I mean the armies clash in the first month of the wars
EDL	03:39:30,687	03:39:33,759	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Commonly referred to as the battle of the Frontiers
EDL	03:39:33,759	03:39:37,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When you get these 19th century tactics
EDL	03:39:37,087	03:39:40,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Running into twentieth-century mechanized Warfare
EDL	03:39:40,159	03:39:45,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which leads to the worst single month in terms of casualties that you're going to get in the whole War
EDL	03:39:45,791	03:39:47,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because you're not going to see
EDL	03:39:47,839	03:39:48,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A lot of
EDL	03:39:48,607	03:39:51,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cavalry Charges against machine guns and artillery
EDL	03:39:51,679	03:39:52,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Prepositions
EDL	03:39:52,447	03:39:53,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	After the first
EDL	03:39:54,495	03:39:55,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's when
EDL	03:39:55,519	03:39:56,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The really
EDL	03:39:56,799	03:40:02,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Mind-blowingly shocking things mean guys with armor and swords and white gloves and red pants and
EDL	03:40:02,943	03:40:07,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A bayonet charging prepared positions I mean the whole thing is is Cookie and that last for bottom
EDL	03:40:08,831	03:40:11,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The next month is what happens after the Germans
EDL	03:40:11,391	03:40:12,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lose the battle of the Marne
EDL	03:40:12,927	03:40:13,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And they're sleeping play
EDL	03:40:14,207	03:40:14,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Is broken
EDL	03:40:14,975	03:40:19,327	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	As of the second month of the wars then basically running away from there earlier position
EDL	03:40:19,327	03:40:21,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Trying to find a place to regroup
EDL	03:40:21,375	03:40:25,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Finding a really good place to regroup on the other side of the river rain
EDL	03:40:25,727	03:40:26,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And digging it
EDL	03:40:27,007	03:40:29,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And the Allies following them
EDL	03:40:29,311	03:40:30,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Unable to take those
EDL	03:40:31,359	03:40:34,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Wonderful positions on the other side of the river rain and digging in themselves
EDL	03:40:35,455	03:40:36,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Inaugurating
EDL	03:40:36,735	03:40:38,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Officially trench warfare
EDL	03:40:39,551	03:40:41,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you have the so-called race to the Sea
EDL	03:40:42,111	03:40:48,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When the Germans and the French and the British you don't want to run into each other's prepare defenses anymore start trying to find a flank in the only
EDL	03:40:48,511	03:40:49,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A open party
EDL	03:40:49,535	03:40:51,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of the battle line left
EDL	03:40:51,071	03:40:54,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From the riveraine up north towards the sea
EDL	03:40:54,399	03:40:57,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Both sides reach the sea before they find a flag
EDL	03:40:57,983	03:41:03,359	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They have a couple of terrible battles including the first battle of Ypres up there and then
EDL	03:41:03,359	03:41:07,455	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We settled down to the 1915 Warfare basically
EDL	03:41:07,455	03:41:08,735	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Which is going to involve
EDL	03:41:08,735	03:41:11,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Both sides launching offenses that don't do
EDL	03:41:12,575	03:41:18,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that City read the book sometimes they can make him exciting oh they almost broke through and all of their only been modern communication
EDL	03:41:18,975	03:41:20,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But the bottom line is the bottom line
EDL	03:41:21,023	03:41:24,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You have a bunch of battles during 1915 on the Western Front
EDL	03:41:24,095	03:41:24,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nothing changes
EDL	03:41:26,143	03:41:27,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On the Eastern Front
EDL	03:41:27,423	03:41:29,471	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nothing changes either
EDL	03:41:29,471	03:41:30,751	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But a lot of movement happen
EDL	03:41:31,263	03:41:33,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Why do people die a lot of movement happens
EDL	03:41:33,567	03:41:36,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The overall strategic situation Remains the Same
EDL	03:41:36,639	03:41:42,783	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because when the Russians and the Germans Clash right at the war start the Russians get crushed in a couple of big battles
EDL	03:41:42,783	03:41:44,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tannenberg masurian Lakes
EDL	03:41:44,575	03:41:46,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then they beat the austro-hungarians
EDL	03:41:46,879	03:41:50,975	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The serbians be the austro-hungarian whole bunch of stuff happens when you turn around
EDL	03:41:50,975	03:41:55,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And subtract all the deaths and all the movement everything else the situation is the same
EDL	03:41:55,583	03:41:56,863	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians are there
EDL	03:41:56,863	03:42:00,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They're not defeated they can replace all their losses
EDL	03:42:00,191	03:42:06,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And if you really want to chase them they'll run all the way back to Moscow like they did against Napoleon and like they'll do against Hitler
EDL	03:42:06,591	03:42:08,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	How do you really want to follow them all the way back there
EDL	03:42:10,175	03:42:14,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So they don't have trench warfare they have movement Warfare
EDL	03:42:14,015	03:42:16,319	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The movements not ending anything
EDL	03:42:16,319	03:42:17,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then of course
EDL	03:42:17,599	03:42:21,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because the Russians and the Turks start getting into it down in the south
EDL	03:42:21,439	03:42:25,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Russians at the Allies for help which leads to Winston Churchill's cabal
EDL	03:42:25,791	03:42:32,191	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Having yet another good argument to argue that maybe we should take the Dardanelles with all these pre Dreadnought battleships
EDL	03:42:32,191	03:42:33,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then the Dardanelles happen
EDL	03:42:33,727	03:42:35,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Here's what we can kind of
EDL	03:42:35,263	03:42:37,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Add the Flop I was just promising you because
EDL	03:42:38,079	03:42:39,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Remember one of the sidebar hope
EDL	03:42:40,383	03:42:46,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With this Dardanelles campaign is that it might influence some of those countries down in that region
EDL	03:42:46,015	03:42:50,111	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The head and decided which side to join yet but it was obvious that they were sort of taking bids
EDL	03:42:50,623	03:42:52,415	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Italy most among them
EDL	03:42:52,415	03:42:54,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They like the Allied been better
EDL	03:42:54,463	03:43:00,607	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They saw the Dardanelles campaign looking pretty strong back in May 1915 you know when they were Landings and true
EDL	03:43:01,119	03:43:03,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Assaulting the heights everyday and want to look like
EDL	03:43:03,423	03:43:04,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Britain and France were strong
EDL	03:43:04,703	03:43:05,983	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Italians join the war
EDL	03:43:06,495	03:43:09,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They instantly attacked the austro-hungarians
EDL	03:43:09,055	03:43:12,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At really the only good spot on their border to do that
EDL	03:43:13,407	03:43:15,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because the rest of their borders basically the Alps
EDL	03:43:16,223	03:43:21,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And basically the austro-hungarian have The High Ground although they find and have found recently
EDL	03:43:22,623	03:43:25,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Almost like something out of the old Captain America comic books
EDL	03:43:25,951	03:43:28,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In which Captain America Frozen in the snow except
EDL	03:43:28,767	03:43:29,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of course he was alive when they
EDL	03:43:30,303	03:43:31,327	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Defrosted them
EDL	03:43:31,327	03:43:33,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These poor Austrian
EDL	03:43:33,375	03:43:38,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And Italian soldiers that their finding with these glaciers melting up in the Alps
EDL	03:43:38,495	03:43:40,543	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In these caves and I mean they look
EDL	03:43:40,543	03:43:44,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Perfect like they were frozen yesterday their uniforms their weapons
EDL	03:43:44,383	03:43:48,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Their facial characteristics everything I mean it's crazy it's like a time capsule of the most
EDL	03:43:50,015	03:43:51,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Grotesque kind
EDL	03:43:52,063	03:43:54,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nevertheless the one area that's good for fighting
EDL	03:43:54,623	03:43:55,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	At least compared to the Alps
EDL	03:43:56,159	03:43:57,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's on the river re songs
EDL	03:43:57,695	03:44:01,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Italians attacked the austro-hungarians right away at the river is Alonzo
EDL	03:44:01,535	03:44:02,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And lose
EDL	03:44:03,071	03:44:08,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So then they attack again on the River Song so this will be called the Second Battle of the river so I'm gonna lose again
EDL	03:44:08,959	03:44:10,239	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They do it again third bottle
EDL	03:44:10,751	03:44:12,287	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Riverssance all they do it again the 4th.
EDL	03:44:12,799	03:44:13,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	River sounds
EDL	03:44:13,567	03:44:16,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By the last year of the war there on the 12th
EDL	03:44:16,127	03:44:17,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Battle of the river isonzo
EDL	03:44:18,175	03:44:20,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And hundreds of thousands have died
EDL	03:44:20,223	03:44:21,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in fact
EDL	03:44:21,247	03:44:26,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In only 6 months of warfare the Italians will have 200,000 casualties and are quickly
EDL	03:44:26,879	03:44:27,647	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Playing catch up
EDL	03:44:28,159	03:44:28,927	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	With the rest of
EDL	03:44:28,927	03:44:31,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The power I should point out something by casualty
EDL	03:44:31,231	03:44:33,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Please do we keep using that term in its worth to finding it
EDL	03:44:34,303	03:44:37,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Casualties of the military term in many of you know
EDL	03:44:37,119	03:44:39,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it simply refers to the loss of battle
EDL	03:44:40,447	03:44:43,775	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Your general and it's your army were talking about
EDL	03:44:43,775	03:44:45,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Casualties simply means
EDL	03:44:45,567	03:44:47,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The number of people you don't have available to fight
EDL	03:44:48,639	03:44:53,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Those who've been killed those who've been wounded those who've been captured and those who are missing
EDL	03:44:53,759	03:44:55,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So when I say casualties
EDL	03:44:55,551	03:44:58,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That's what it means all the missing in this war usually means
EDL	03:44:58,367	03:45:00,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dad if I say Dad well
EDL	03:45:00,671	03:45:01,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That means killed in action
EDL	03:45:03,487	03:45:06,303	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Tell the Italians 200000 casualties within six months
EDL	03:45:06,303	03:45:09,375	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The other power that gets into the war does so in October
EDL	03:45:09,887	03:45:13,727	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's the bulgarians another one of these Powers at Churchill and his friends at home
EDL	03:45:13,727	03:45:14,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To convince
EDL	03:45:14,495	03:45:20,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	To join the Allied side when they saw how the Dardanelles campaign was going but by October the Dardanelles campaign is really going poor
EDL	03:45:20,895	03:45:27,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Morley and the Bulgarian have been promising good land and they don't like the serbs anyway so they joined with the Germans in the
EDL	03:45:27,295	03:45:30,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The austro-hungarians all three of them promptly attacks Serbia
EDL	03:45:30,879	03:45:32,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And knock them out of the war
EDL	03:45:33,183	03:45:35,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Nobi the story this harrowing story of
EDL	03:45:36,511	03:45:37,791	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Serbian Army
EDL	03:45:37,791	03:45:39,839	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I'm going all the way through Albanian
EDL	03:45:39,839	03:45:41,631	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Mountain passes like a bunch of
EDL	03:45:41,631	03:45:47,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	REITs starving until they reach the C&O be evacuated by French British warship to fight another day
EDL	03:45:49,055	03:45:54,431	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	One thing I wasn't sure if I mentioned in the story you know we talked about the Second Battle of Ypres where the Germans use
EDL	03:45:54,431	03:45:56,223	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Poison gas for the first time
EDL	03:45:56,223	03:45:58,271	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In a successful way was used on the
EDL	03:45:58,271	03:45:59,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Eastern front in a weird way once
EDL	03:46:00,063	03:46:05,695	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But after the Second Battle leave for the Allies start using gas to and by the end of 1915
EDL	03:46:05,695	03:46:10,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The standard mix of shells is you want some high explosive in your mix
EDL	03:46:10,047	03:46:16,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you want some shrapnel shells in your mix which are like giant balls filled with tiny little babies when they explode is like a
EDL	03:46:16,447	03:46:18,239	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Giant hand grenade going off
EDL	03:46:18,239	03:46:21,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And then the last shells you want mixed into your little Triad
EDL	03:46:22,847	03:46:25,151	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Infrared Fitness are your gas shells
EDL	03:46:25,151	03:46:28,479	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	SO gas high explosive shrapnel you shoot it all the same time
EDL	03:46:28,479	03:46:30,015	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It makes a nasty little cock
EDL	03:46:30,015	03:46:31,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	For the poor troops
EDL	03:46:31,039	03:46:31,551	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The ground
EDL	03:46:32,575	03:46:35,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Everyone got gas and everybody wearing gas masks now
EDL	03:46:35,903	03:46:39,487	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And you end up with these images that are still to my mind
EDL	03:46:39,487	03:46:41,023	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The greatest images of
EDL	03:46:41,023	03:46:42,815	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The first world war cuz they say the most
EDL	03:46:42,815	03:46:45,887	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	When you'll see for example I love the one that shows
EDL	03:46:45,887	03:46:47,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A German
EDL	03:46:47,423	03:46:48,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Cavalry
EDL	03:46:48,447	03:46:49,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lancer
EDL	03:46:49,727	03:46:52,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In 1916 or 1917
EDL	03:46:52,031	03:46:53,311	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Who's wearing
EDL	03:46:53,311	03:46:59,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The Stahl Helm which will come into Vogue in 1916 which is basically the same basic design you'll see the
EDL	03:46:59,711	03:47:04,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	German Army have in the second World War II is wearing like a German wehrmacht Helmet
EDL	03:47:04,063	03:47:04,831	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Little Lamb
EDL	03:47:05,599	03:47:06,623	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On a horse
EDL	03:47:06,623	03:47:08,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And wearing a gas mask
EDL	03:47:08,927	03:47:11,231	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	He's like half medieval Knight
EDL	03:47:11,231	03:47:13,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And half Stormtrooper from Star Wars
EDL	03:47:14,047	03:47:20,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And that to me encapsulate what this war is these meetings of the modern world with the pre-modern world
EDL	03:47:20,447	03:47:22,495	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Like a historical Estuary like I said
EDL	03:47:23,775	03:47:24,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And in fact
EDL	03:47:24,799	03:47:29,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You know what seat is Uber modern because really there hasn't been a major war fought with gas
EDL	03:47:30,175	03:47:30,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Since this
EDL	03:47:31,199	03:47:33,247	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Time. I mean there been incidents
EDL	03:47:33,247	03:47:35,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Of chemical weapons and gas use
EDL	03:47:35,039	03:47:37,343	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But you've never had the major mean the second world war there was no
EDL	03:47:39,647	03:47:44,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Also it should be obvious that there have been several theaters that have not gotten much or perhaps
EDL	03:47:44,255	03:47:45,535	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Any attention
EDL	03:47:45,535	03:47:50,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From yours truly and it's not because I don't find them interesting and I think you could do a whole
EDL	03:47:50,655	03:47:51,935	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Podcast just
EDL	03:47:51,935	03:47:52,703	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	On
EDL	03:47:52,703	03:47:55,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The African experience in the first World War
EDL	03:47:55,775	03:47:57,567	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But it's not important to the out
EDL	03:47:57,567	03:48:00,895	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Come of the first world war when you have to chop in places for
EDL	03:48:00,895	03:48:02,687	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	4 time these are long enough already
EDL	03:48:02,687	03:48:05,503	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You naturally look at the Pacific in the first World War
EDL	03:48:05,503	03:48:07,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Or Africa because it didn't affect the outcome
EDL	03:48:08,575	03:48:10,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What had more of an effect on the outcome
EDL	03:48:11,135	03:48:17,279	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are the soldiers from those two areas that were trucked into places like the Western Front and who fought the
EDL	03:48:18,303	03:48:19,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lots of North Ave
EDL	03:48:19,839	03:48:21,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lots of sub-Saharan
EDL	03:48:21,631	03:48:25,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Lots of people from the Far East fought on the Western Front
EDL	03:48:25,215	03:48:27,519	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And places like the Dardanelles
EDL	03:48:27,519	03:48:30,079	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And eventually at Salonika and places like that
EDL	03:48:30,591	03:48:32,383	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the funny way
EDL	03:48:32,383	03:48:33,919	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The place where
EDL	03:48:33,919	03:48:39,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Africans and Asians had the most impact on the war going one way or the other
EDL	03:48:39,551	03:48:41,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Was the same Western Front that
EDL	03:48:41,599	03:48:43,391	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We normally think of as being a British
EDL	03:48:43,903	03:48:45,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	French Canadian
EDL	03:48:45,439	03:48:46,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Soda preserving
EDL	03:48:47,231	03:48:48,255	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Down the road and American Way
EDL	03:48:49,791	03:48:51,583	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	So by the end of 1915
EDL	03:48:52,607	03:48:55,423	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	You basically have a static situation
EDL	03:48:55,423	03:48:56,447	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Western Front
EDL	03:48:56,447	03:48:57,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Stays unchanged
EDL	03:48:57,727	03:49:00,031	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Eastern Front keeps moving around
EDL	03:49:00,031	03:49:02,591	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But everybody still standing there facing each other
EDL	03:49:02,591	03:49:03,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Dalian Turkey
EDL	03:49:04,383	03:49:07,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The war's been extended to down there but it's just stable
EDL	03:49:08,735	03:49:11,039	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Turn of the reasons this is called the year of
EDL	03:49:11,039	03:49:12,575	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Stalemate in the first World War
EDL	03:49:13,087	03:49:15,903	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you want to talk about something new that has happened
EDL	03:49:15,903	03:49:16,671	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Helmets
EDL	03:49:16,671	03:49:17,183	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Just started right
EDL	03:49:18,207	03:49:22,047	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We mentioned the German stahlhelm a minute ago the first one is the French help
EDL	03:49:22,047	03:49:25,119	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But then the British metal helmet than the German one appears
EDL	03:49:25,119	03:49:31,263	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it's one of those things that doesn't seem like a big deal but all of those helmet designs will be the basic design
EDL	03:49:31,263	03:49:33,055	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That the second world war helmets
EDL	03:49:33,567	03:49:35,871	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	They'll all look very familiar and being
EDL	03:49:36,383	03:49:38,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Vogue for quite a while at least in their basic
EDL	03:49:38,943	03:49:39,711	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Look the German one change
EDL	03:49:40,223	03:49:40,991	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Oil change
EDL	03:49:42,271	03:49:43,295	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But also
EDL	03:49:43,295	03:49:44,831	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Because it boggles the mind
EDL	03:49:44,831	03:49:45,599	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And a little bit
EDL	03:49:45,599	03:49:46,367	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Doesn't it
EDL	03:49:46,367	03:49:52,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	If you don't get your first metal helmet really till late 1915 which means all these people have been

EDL	03:50:42,431	03:50:42,943	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And I think this

EDL	03:50:55,999	03:50:56,767	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Change
EDL	03:50:56,767	03:50:59,071	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	In the way the casualty death to wounded figure
EDL	03:50:59,583	03:51:00,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Show up in the
EDL	03:51:01,375	03:51:02,655	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Normally
EDL	03:51:02,655	03:51:08,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The number of people wounded and the number of people who die are pretty close together and take the Crimean War
EDL	03:51:08,799	03:51:09,823	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	What happened in the 1800
EDL	03:51:10,591	03:51:12,127	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	More people died
EDL	03:51:12,127	03:51:12,639	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	From disease
EDL	03:51:13,151	03:51:18,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Then from combat-related wounds that might have been a little extreme but not that far off the norm
EDL	03:51:18,527	03:51:20,063	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	By the first World War
EDL	03:51:20,063	03:51:21,855	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	That changes immensely
EDL	03:51:21,855	03:51:22,879	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	It's because
EDL	03:51:22,879	03:51:25,439	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	The medical situation has been Revolution
EDL	03:51:25,439	03:51:26,463	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Modern
EDL	03:51:26,463	03:51:28,511	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Military medicine really begins in
EDL	03:51:29,279	03:51:32,095	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	A lot of these doctors especially on the Western Front
EDL	03:51:32,095	03:51:35,679	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Are doctors from private practice who have been drafted or
EDL	03:51:35,679	03:51:40,799	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Joined and volunteered for the war effort they're often doing surgeries right near the front
EDL	03:51:40,799	03:51:45,663	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	These are people who live in the modern era when medicine is starting to be pretty darn good
EDL	03:51:45,663	03:51:50,527	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And it completely changes the game I mean these people are not just able to save lives
EDL	03:51:50,527	03:51:51,807	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	And this is sort of a mixed by
EDL	03:51:51,807	03:51:53,087	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	I guess if you're a soldier
EDL	03:51:53,087	03:51:56,159	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	But they will be able for the nation-states that they work
EDL	03:51:56,159	03:51:57,951	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Work to send a lot of these

EDL	03:52:05,119	03:52:06,399	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Increasing
EDL	03:52:06,399	03:52:09,215	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Ability of many of these states to keep fighting pass
EDL	03:52:09,215	03:52:11,007	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	Where they otherwise would have been able to
EDL	03:52:11,519	03:52:14,847	| dchha52_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_III_clean |	We don't have to do for example is look at the burn rate on some of these armies
