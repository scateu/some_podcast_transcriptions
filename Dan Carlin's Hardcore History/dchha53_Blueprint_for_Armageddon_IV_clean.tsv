EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:24,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With World War 1 and the Western Front specifically
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:25,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's part of the tragedy
EDL	00:20:25,983	00:20:26,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It adds
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:27,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To the pain
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because after all
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you seen the same
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Event over and over and over again
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:34,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Doesn't it
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:37,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Become a different kind of tragic
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:41,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you watch the first wave of those young soldiers
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:44,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Leave the safety of their trench go over-the-top at the
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:49,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a whistle of their officer get mowed down by Machine Gun fire
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,327	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before they've even gone 10ft
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,095	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's tragic
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:56,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another level of tragedy when the next wave gets up right behind them
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:58,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To follow in their footsteps
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Having already seen what
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And to them
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's what we wanted to capture
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:06,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are discussions of the western
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:10,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because it became an issue
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:14,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Early on how we're going to deal with all these battles that were roughly the same
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:15,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Equally tragic
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:18,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And for the soldiers on the ground
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Eerily similar
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When trying to figure out
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:24,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What we wanted to highlight
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A Shakespeare quote kept popping into my head when I was working on this
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was just lying that all the world's a stage
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:33,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all the people merely
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:34,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Players
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I thought to myself well that's what we have here
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We have
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:43,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the most extreme stages
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In human history
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We've created
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:49,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With these Western Front battles in 1915 19
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:50,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	16 - 17
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A hell like environment
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:54,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We forced millions of
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:57,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	2
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Acton
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:04,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Some of the most extreme situations
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:06,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People have been put into ever
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:06,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In his
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:10,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And watching how they endure
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:12,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is sometimes
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Soul crushing
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Put another X
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's absolutely life-enhancing
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Yeah sometimes you can
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Benefit quite a bit
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From the suffering
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As we sat down
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:36,032	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When we started this series and tried to figure out a creative approach to dealing with all these battles
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One thing becomes very clear
EDL	00:22:39,104	00:22:40,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We did some creative experiments
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You quickly find out
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Set the battles
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In an emotional sense
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Reach a point of diminishing returns very quick
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:50,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You just become
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Vietnam
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The mall
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:56,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the scale the intensity the sheer horrific repetitive pounding
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:23:00,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Eventually makes you stop feeling
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a rather than go from
EDL	00:23:04,448	00:23:05,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Indecisive and
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Horrific battle to the next indecisive in horrific battle
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:11,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We thought we would focus on a few
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:16,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What we would consider to be almost signature battles if you will but
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:20,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They provide a very similar backdrop for the poor individuals who have to live
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In that environment
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:28,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And allow us to sort of examine at a human level what's going on here a little bit as best we can
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:34,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And to explore some of the questions that are very intriguing about the story and not just about the human suffering what about
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:35,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Command Decisions
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And some of the technology and some other things
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hopefully interspersed with a little bit of
EDL	00:23:41,312	00:23:44,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a comment about what's going on in the rest of the world while this is half
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:49,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And part of what makes 1916 so difficult is there a lot of overlapping stuff
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:55,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So if you tell it in the he said that she said that he said fashion
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It becomes very confusing very quickly
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The first thing to understand
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:02,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is that 1916 comes about
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:05,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Obviously because of plans made in late 1950
EDL	00:24:06,656	00:24:07,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Weed said you earlier
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:10,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But this was a real question for the general
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But how you solve this gordian knot that is the Western Front
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:20,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will in late 1950 in the Allied commands got together in a place called Chantilly in France
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:22,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To deal with this question
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:23,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Their plan
EDL	00:24:23,808	00:24:26,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was going to be to continue to pound
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:28,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And pound harder
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the new aspect was
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They were going to make sure that everybody
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,584	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the different allied powers
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How did the
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Central Powers Germany and Friends
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	At the same time
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:42,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They were going to coordinate the rapper
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This was going to
EDL	00:24:44,288	00:24:45,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nullify
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:50,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What the Germans have been doing so far the Germans have a great Army but they can't be everywhere at once
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Luckily for them
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:55,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Up until 1916 they weren't attacked everywhere at 1
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:57,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They would use something called
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:25:00,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Interior lines it's a little like taking the center
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:02,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Square in a game of tic-tac-toe
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans were able to use their wonderful
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:05,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Railway system
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:10,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To transfer troops from less threatened sectors to more hotspots
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:17,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And thereby frustrate Allied efforts of the Allied plan for knocking down German fortifications to 1960s if they're all go
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,360	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Attack it basically the same time
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:21,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Frustrating the Germans ability to move troops to hotspot
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:24,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans had a different plan entirely
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:27,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You see the people that Chantilly
EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:30,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1952 get together and decide to attack the Germans from multiple
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In allocations at the same time
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are still for the most part envisioning the classic
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Military in
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To this war
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:45,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They see the chances increased by attacking multiple locations that you're going to crack the German summer
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:51,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When you crack them you're going to send your forces through the breach and you're going to send the calvary through and now the Germans are going to break in there going to be
EDL	00:25:51,616	00:25:56,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Berlin and you know that's how these things and the minds of people who have a very
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Especially old-fashioned View
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:00,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of War
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There are additional
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:09,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Dance to this idea who say even on the Allied side you got it all wrong it's not going to happen that way the technology
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:12,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The specific circumstances the fact there are no flags on the Western Front
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:13,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You're dreaming
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:16,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because you're dreaming your plans are going to work
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the German side the people who have this attitude
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:22,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That that old-fashioned Viewpoint is just that
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:24,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Old fashioned

EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:05,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	French historians though often assert that this site did have military
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Importance and that that
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:09,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You did create a real military need to do
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What's a French ended up doing
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:12,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:13,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German plan
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is to use all this artillery first

EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Around this important site

EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:46,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Prepare defenses
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:51,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The French are just going to bash themselves up against your barbed wire you

EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:07,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it's not a bad idea
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It also should be no surprise
EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:15,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The battle that was designed to act like a meat grinder

EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That puts it in a special place
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In military history
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:43,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sort of like if you said you know where is the worst place in the world ever be in military history like a tie

EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:07,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Probably about as bad as a lot of other terrible situation
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's a few
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:11,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or you just go okay that's as bad
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As the Battle of cannae sort of
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:14,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But at artillery

EDL	00:31:32,352	00:31:37,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When fogging hind comes up with the idea that he's going to bleed France

EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:53,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Year-and-a-half ago wearing white gloves with people who dualed when they were in school together
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:56,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And who thought of this in almost especially on the Western Front
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:32:01,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Gallant kind of sense right we exchange swords when we surrender and all the stuff
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:06,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And now we have generals thinking okay how can I lower millions of men into a confined space
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:09,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And just pound them into marmalade
EDL	00:32:10,752	00:32:12,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To quote one French soldiers
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Way of explaining what happened
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:20,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the things I love by the way about this. Just like I love it about the Second World War
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:24,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is that we have a lot of the actual words of the generals themselves
EDL	00:32:25,088	00:32:31,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They all wrote Memoirs as we said after the war most of the time trying to defend their reputation against their critics
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:33,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cuz after this war everyone's pointing fingers at everybody
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know because it was so terrible and people were so angry and and so

EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:31,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Everything was in place for an offensive with the potential to change the course of the war

EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:42,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This was one of the great defensive spots in French history
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:45,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're done watching just a fortress it was a fortress Zone
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:48,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Multiple Fortress is all working together

EDL	00:40:05,632	00:40:07,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then when the war started

EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:13,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Do do do
EDL	00:40:13,312	00:40:16,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The limits of new technology or rather the lack of limit
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:23,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They decided that those Belgian forts being pounded by that artillery signaled that these Sports were nothing but a death trap
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It would be better to take
EDL	00:40:25,344	00:40:27,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The weapons on them in the truth that man them
EDL	00:40:27,904	00:40:30,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And put them to where the hot spots were in the fighting after all if

EDL	00:41:05,536	00:41:09,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know to these areas because they can sense a buildup in the Germans are launching
EDL	00:41:09,376	00:41:13,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Distracting a packs elsewhere this would have been a confused a french-owned where everything's coming from

EDL	00:41:30,368	00:41:33,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Apparently and long Max fires a shell
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:34,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The travels
EDL	00:41:34,720	00:41:38,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Somewhere between 15 and 20 mile these are in Norman
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:42,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that becomes the first shell to drop
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As part of the Giant
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Why
EDL	00:41:45,728	00:41:46,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The kicks off the bottle
EDL	00:41:47,008	00:41:47,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Verdun
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:51,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And right after long Max's barrage kicks off
EDL	00:41:51,104	00:41:53,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All these enormous weapons
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:54,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Open up C

EDL	00:42:19,519	00:42:20,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they open up
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:25,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All at once and begin pounding this relatively small area of the front
EDL	00:42:26,431	00:42:28,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What makes this so incredibly damaging is you have

EDL	00:47:46,431	00:47:52,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They directed their fire not merely on to positions they wish to take we're on two lines they wish to a blitter

EDL	00:48:47,359	00:48:52,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now. Jankowski says the difference in this artillery barrage is not just in the amount of stuff but the way they do it
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:58,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They are employing every little trick that they've learned in the last year year-and-a-half of warfare

EDL	00:49:04,255	00:49:05,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another example.
EDL	00:49:05,279	00:49:06,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Deviousness only

EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:11,423	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the Germans start this artillery barrage in a little after 7 in the morning
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:17,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they pound these French positions all morning and into the lunchtime hour and then they stopped at midday they
EDL	00:49:17,823	00:49:19,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stop on queue all at once
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:20,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not even

EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:28,063	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the receiving end of the worst artillery barrage in human history know what this means
EDL	00:49:28,575	00:49:31,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It always means the same thing it means the German ground troops are coming
EDL	00:49:32,415	00:49:37,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In an offensive that's why you stopped shooting so that you don't blow your own men up now that they're on the way right
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:40,095	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So the French run up to their positions they man
EDL	00:49:40,095	00:49:41,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Defensive spots
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:48,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They uncover any guns they've got hit and they get ready to push back the German assault now that it's coming except it isn't coming
EDL	00:49:48,799	00:49:49,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a trick
EDL	00:49:50,079	00:49:52,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all of a sudden all the guns open up again
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:59,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And start smashing the now exposed French survivors who showed those planes up in the air I'm another observe
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:02,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Oh yeah that guy survival there's a machine gun that we didn't see
EDL	00:50:02,879	00:50:04,671	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was an intermission
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:06,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To get the French to expose themselves
EDL	00:50:07,999	00:50:11,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And this feeling goes for the rest of the day until the late afternoon so

EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:17,215	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then the French survivors

EDL	00:51:55,775	00:51:56,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They are using
EDL	00:51:57,567	00:52:02,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What at the time seemed like very newfangled very modern
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:09,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Techniques on the battlefield are known as infiltration tactics they pretty much are the same small unit tactics every millet

EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:20,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Suggested the first time anybody sees them is with the storm troops but the storm troops are the first to integrate everything
EDL	00:52:20,351	00:52:21,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Into their system
EDL	00:52:22,655	00:52:29,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not only are they going to use these infiltration tactics but look at the weapons that they burned themselves within they train with all this another where they've integrated all the

EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they call him the field
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:47,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm going to run into in a significant opposition they stop or move around it and places where everyone's been killed by

EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:57,215	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is a trap
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:02,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The cheese in the Trap has to be captured by the Germans
EDL	00:53:02,079	00:53:03,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before I can play the role
EDL	00:53:03,359	00:53:03,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the cheese

EDL	00:53:14,111	00:53:14,623	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is BS

EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:24,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you believe that they're not trying to capture beta try to capture Verdun
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:26,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Either way the point of this
EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:27,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Initial attack
EDL	00:53:27,935	00:53:28,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is to get the height
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:36,127	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The problem is the Germans find out to degree exactly with the French and the British and found out the whole year before
EDL	00:53:36,639	00:53:39,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which is that no matter how good the artillery barrage
EDL	00:53:39,967	00:53:42,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There are just units that survived
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:44,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then when they strike back at you
EDL	00:53:45,343	00:53:46,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's amazing
EDL	00:53:46,879	00:53:48,159	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the casualties Mount up
EDL	00:53:48,671	00:53:49,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unbelievably fast
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:52,255	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the very first day
EDL	00:53:52,255	00:53:54,559	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As the German troops pour into an area
EDL	00:53:55,071	00:53:56,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And begin to
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:54:00,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cowlicks in front of Master innocent in a specific area
EDL	00:54:00,959	00:54:03,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	French artillery opens up on them
EDL	00:54:03,007	00:54:05,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And this is an account by French staff off
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:07,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With the artillery
EDL	00:54:07,103	00:54:10,431	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who first describes what the German artillery attack on his position
EDL	00:54:10,943	00:54:11,455	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is like
EDL	00:54:11,967	00:54:14,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then describes responding in kind
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:17,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	His was one of the few batteries that did by the way
EDL	00:54:17,855	00:54:18,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He writes quote
EDL	00:54:19,647	00:54:26,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Thousands of projectiles are flying in all directions some whistling others howling others moaning low
EDL	00:54:26,047	00:54:28,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When all uniting into one infernal Roar
EDL	00:54:28,351	00:54:31,423	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From time to time an aerial torpedo passes
EDL	00:54:31,423	00:54:33,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Making a noise like a giant motor car
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:37,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With a tremendous thud a giant shell bursts
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:39,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quite close to our observation post
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:42,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Breaking the telephone wire and interrupting all communication with our batteries
EDL	00:54:43,455	00:54:45,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A man gets out at once for repairs
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:50,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Crawling along his stomach through all this place of bursting minds and shells
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:52,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It seems quite impossible he writes
EDL	00:54:52,927	00:54:54,975	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Addition escape the rain of shells
EDL	00:54:54,975	00:54:57,023	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which exceeds anything imaginable
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:59,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There has never been such a bombardment in war
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:01,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Our man seems to be enveloped in explosion
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:05,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And shelters himself from time to time in the Shell craters which honeycomb the ground
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:09,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Finally he reaches a less stormy spot
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:10,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Men's his wires
EDL	00:55:10,335	00:55:13,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then as it would be Madness to try to return
EDL	00:55:13,151	00:55:15,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Settles down in a big crater and wait for the storm to pass
EDL	00:55:17,247	00:55:18,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now he looks up
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nce
EDL	00:55:20,319	00:55:21,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German assault
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:22,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Approaching
EDL	00:55:22,111	00:55:22,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quote
EDL	00:55:22,879	00:55:27,743	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Beyond in the valley dark masses are moving over the snow-covered ground
EDL	00:55:27,743	00:55:30,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It is German infantry advancing impact formation
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:32,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Along the valley to the attack
EDL	00:55:32,607	00:55:36,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They look like a big gray carpet being unrolled over the country
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:38,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We telephone through to the batteries
EDL	00:55:38,495	00:55:39,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the ball begin
EDL	00:55:40,031	00:55:45,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The site is hellish in the distance in the valley and upon the slopes regiment spread out
EDL	00:55:45,919	00:55:48,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And if they deploy fresh troops come pouring in
EDL	00:55:49,503	00:55:52,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's a whistle over our heads it's our first shell
EDL	00:55:52,575	00:55:54,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It falls right in the middle of the enemy Infantry
EDL	00:55:55,391	00:55:58,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We telephone through telling our batteries are there hit
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:56:01,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And a deluge of heavy shells is poured on the enemy
EDL	00:56:01,535	00:56:03,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Deposition becomes critical
EDL	00:56:03,583	00:56:06,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	True glasses we can see men Madden
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:09,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Men covered with hair or thin blood falling one upon the other
EDL	00:56:09,471	00:56:12,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the first wave of the assault is decimated
EDL	00:56:12,031	00:56:16,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The ground is dotted with heaps of corpses but the second wave is already pressing on
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:20,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Once more are shells Carvalho for gaps in their ranks
EDL	00:56:20,223	00:56:25,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nevertheless like an army of rats the bushes continue to advance in spite of our marmite
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:26,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I turn the French
EDL	00:56:26,879	00:56:27,647	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are there shells
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:28,671	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He says quote
EDL	00:56:28,671	00:56:31,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Then our Heavy Artillery burst forth in Fury
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:34,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The whole valley is turned into a volcano
EDL	00:56:34,047	00:56:36,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it said you to stop by the barrier of the slain
EDL	00:56:37,631	00:56:38,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:42,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's a foretaste of what's to come
EDL	00:56:42,239	00:56:43,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right there
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:47,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans have to be on the offensive for a little while in this battle
EDL	00:56:47,359	00:56:50,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A battle that is probably built upon the
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:53,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Presumption that the defense has a huge advantage on the office
EDL	00:56:54,271	00:56:56,319	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This artillery was meant to make up for some of that
EDL	00:56:56,319	00:56:58,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the Germans are taking higher than expected loss
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:00,415	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From minute one
EDL	00:57:01,951	00:57:03,743	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is a problem to cuz remember
EDL	00:57:03,743	00:57:10,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Regardless of which historical School you would hear to on the point of this battle it was always part of the plan.
EDL	00:57:10,143	00:57:11,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lose as few people as possible
EDL	00:57:11,935	00:57:17,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So the Germans are concerned with losses and part of the reason they're suffering so many is the French or resisting
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:18,847	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Heroically
EDL	00:57:18,847	00:57:19,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On these first few days
EDL	00:57:20,639	00:57:23,455	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Their units that surrender their units that are just
EDL	00:57:23,455	00:57:24,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Gone
EDL	00:57:24,223	00:57:25,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From the artillery barrage
EDL	00:57:25,759	00:57:28,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But there are units including Elite ones but also
EDL	00:57:28,575	00:57:32,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Rather pedestrian one sitting there and dying to the last man to delay
EDL	00:57:32,927	00:57:37,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This German Advance these infiltration troops are looking for places to push through they find a couple
EDL	00:57:37,791	00:57:39,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But they find a bunch with these
EDL	00:57:39,583	00:57:42,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Decimated Defenders resisting heroically
EDL	00:57:42,399	00:57:45,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By the country time to get
EDL	00:57:45,471	00:57:48,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fresh troops reinforcing that area
EDL	00:57:48,031	00:57:52,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To that area ever done is actually supplied on the French Side by one little Kenny Road
EDL	00:57:53,407	00:57:55,711	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German to build multiple Railway
EDL	00:57:55,711	00:57:57,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The nearsighted Supply the battlefield
EDL	00:57:57,503	00:58:03,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right so as French reinforcements are coming up these heroic Defenders are holding the Germans off as long as they can
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:05,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There are more big bombardments
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:08,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans push more troops in with more tenacity
EDL	00:58:08,767	00:58:09,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On
EDL	00:58:10,047	00:58:11,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	February 25th
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:17,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans in an almost Indiana like Jones movie kind of drama
EDL	00:58:18,239	00:58:22,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Capture the big Ford in this region the sort of overlooks the whole battle
EDL	00:58:23,103	00:58:25,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We told you that the French High command
EDL	00:58:25,151	00:58:25,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Kind of
EDL	00:58:25,919	00:58:30,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lost interest in fourth after the Germans to match the ones in Belgium smash the early ones in France
EDL	00:58:30,783	00:58:37,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But they still had people in them and they were still guns in them in slowly but surely they were starting to realize that sometimes and in some places they were
EDL	00:58:37,183	00:58:40,511	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're worth having didn't matter these troops were in this
EDL	00:58:40,511	00:58:45,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ford which is mostly below ground when a German soldier gets blown into it somehow
EDL	00:58:45,887	00:58:48,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Due to a shell exploding nearby
EDL	00:58:48,191	00:58:54,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lansdowne on the ground has a pistol with him and eventually will let in some friends but by and large is walking
EDL	00:58:54,591	00:58:56,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Around this underground giant Ford
EDL	00:58:56,639	00:59:03,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And as he opens doors into rooms there's a couple of French soldiers playing cards or whatever any capture them and lock them in a room and you
EDL	00:59:03,039	00:59:04,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He does this over and over and over again
EDL	00:59:05,343	00:59:07,391	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Finally has everybody kind of captured
EDL	00:59:07,391	00:59:09,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nobody dies on either side
EDL	00:59:09,695	00:59:13,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And this major feature in the early part of the battle Falls
EDL	00:59:13,279	00:59:13,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To the German
EDL	00:59:15,583	00:59:18,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's one of those situations that sort of rocks
EDL	00:59:18,655	00:59:19,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The French morale
EDL	00:59:20,447	00:59:21,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they start
EDL	00:59:21,471	00:59:22,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To follow
EDL	00:59:22,239	00:59:22,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Part
EDL	00:59:23,775	00:59:25,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They've been through a ton
EDL	00:59:26,335	00:59:27,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And now
EDL	00:59:27,615	00:59:34,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's this crisis moment we're all of a sudden it looks like the Germans are going to break through in the French were just going to fall apart before any reason for
EDL	00:59:34,015	00:59:35,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Porsche Macan stiffen the line
EDL	00:59:35,551	00:59:38,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is where things get really Wiggly in this battle by the way
EDL	00:59:40,671	00:59:43,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He gets right down to what the hell the point of it is
EDL	00:59:44,511	00:59:46,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you're falkenhayn
EDL	00:59:46,303	00:59:50,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And historians who think he tried to create a meat grinder all that's true
EDL	00:59:50,143	00:59:51,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You don't want a breakthrough
EDL	00:59:52,191	00:59:55,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You don't want Verdun it's not really what you want
EDL	00:59:55,519	00:59:57,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's the cheese in your trap
EDL	00:59:57,567	01:00:03,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you take it then you're just going to get counter-attack you're going to lose a lot of troops again and that been that's 1915 all over again
EDL	01:00:03,967	01:00:04,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What are we do differently right
EDL	01:00:07,039	01:00:08,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you're from the other school of thought though
EDL	01:00:09,087	01:00:15,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The idea of breaking through to Verdun at this point is to nearly achieved what the whole bottle
EDL	01:00:15,487	01:00:20,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What design to do unexpectedly quickly the Crown Prince was commanding this Army's really excited in there
EDL	01:00:20,351	01:00:25,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All sorts of messages where they say hi I will take it I mean it expected this fast but we'll take it and then
EDL	01:00:26,751	01:00:29,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They get within 2 miles of the city at one point
EDL	01:00:29,823	01:00:32,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then the French put a new commander in charge
EDL	01:00:32,639	01:00:36,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A guy who will be famous by the way in both world wars for different reasons
EDL	01:00:36,479	01:00:37,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A guy named Peyton
EDL	01:00:39,551	01:00:42,623	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And pathan becomes you know it's so hard to
EDL	01:00:42,623	01:00:46,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To separate the myth from the man went went with his connection to Verdun
EDL	01:00:47,231	01:00:49,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But at the narrative is
EDL	01:00:49,279	01:00:51,327	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The pathan gets in there
EDL	01:00:51,327	01:00:54,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And changes the French morale
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:55,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By himself pract
EDL	01:00:55,679	01:00:57,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's all these and you know General
EDL	01:00:57,471	01:01:03,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Travel with her on press Corps so there's going to be this guy is going to have a bunch of people helping to to pump up the myth
EDL	01:01:03,103	01:01:09,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What is famous for coming to the battlefield and you know any situations where the French just look desperate in a looking
EDL	01:01:09,503	01:01:13,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Troops and going now we have them right where we want them that kind of thing and you know
EDL	01:01:14,111	01:01:16,671	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maybe it's the 19th century mentality but that seems to work
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:21,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The famously says or somebody says for him and then he stands behind it
EDL	01:01:21,279	01:01:23,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They shall not pass
EDL	01:01:23,071	01:01:27,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And this becomes too big Narrative of Verdun and it turns into like a French Thermopylae
EDL	01:01:27,679	01:01:32,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What the french aren't going to die 2 the last man they're going to win in the end right again part of this this
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:34,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Overriding narrative
EDL	01:01:35,359	01:01:40,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now morale is kind of a hard to quantify sort of thing hard to measure heart
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:41,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Look back in history prove anything
EDL	01:01:41,759	01:01:45,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You don't have to prove the real world terrafirma things that
EDL	01:01:45,343	01:01:46,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Attended
EDL	01:01:46,111	01:01:47,135	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tanzanite jewelry guy
EDL	01:01:47,647	01:01:49,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He's a defensive specialist
EDL	01:01:49,183	01:01:50,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the first thing he does
EDL	01:01:52,255	01:01:57,375	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is bringing his own artillery and consolidate it and ask for more and slowly but surely begins to build up
EDL	01:01:57,887	01:01:59,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	His own meat grinder
EDL	01:02:00,191	01:02:02,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Two can play at that game
EDL	01:02:02,751	01:02:06,847	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And pathan start stocking up the French side with artillery to
EDL	01:02:07,871	01:02:09,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all this artillery
EDL	01:02:09,919	01:02:12,735	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Turns this entire area
EDL	01:02:13,503	01:02:14,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Into the Moon
EDL	01:02:16,319	01:02:17,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But weirder
EDL	01:02:18,367	01:02:21,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Seashell holes in your head you think of something Symmetra
EDL	01:02:21,183	01:02:23,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Trickle like a meteorite crater
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:25,023	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it doesn't happen that way because you get
EDL	01:02:25,023	01:02:29,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Seashell holes which can be 30 ft deep with absolutely straight up and down edges
EDL	01:02:30,399	01:02:31,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But then they get hit with another shell
EDL	01:02:31,935	01:02:37,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Some weird angle Orleans imagine then they get hit with another one and another one and another one and it turns it into
EDL	01:02:37,311	01:02:38,847	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Super weird formation
EDL	01:02:40,127	01:02:43,711	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It still looks weird today if you go look at modern pictures of Verdun Battlefield
EDL	01:02:43,711	01:02:44,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It looks
EDL	01:02:45,247	01:02:45,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Totally
EDL	01:02:47,295	01:02:52,415	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it creates a battlefield is a painting by a Frenchman lularoe I think is his name called hell
EDL	01:02:52,415	01:02:54,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it shows a couple of French soldiers
EDL	01:02:54,719	01:02:56,255	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In one of these craters
EDL	01:02:56,767	01:02:59,839	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And a dead body near them and they're wearing gas masks
EDL	01:02:59,839	01:03:06,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the garage is going on a giant Timbers are part of this enormous crater and craters everywhere in the distance is
EDL	01:03:06,239	01:03:06,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Far as you look
EDL	01:03:08,287	01:03:10,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We said this is like making War worse
EDL	01:03:11,359	01:03:13,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These craters are the grossest thing
EDL	01:03:13,407	01:03:15,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You can imagine I mean really just
EDL	01:03:15,711	01:03:16,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Awful
EDL	01:03:16,735	01:03:21,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They fill with water very quickly everyone of them practically with a dead body or two in them
EDL	01:03:21,087	01:03:23,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If there was water there's tons of trash tons of stuff
EDL	01:03:23,903	01:03:28,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm all kinds of I mean they're mostly uses latrines if it's close enough we can get to them
EDL	01:03:29,535	01:03:30,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The water is
EDL	01:03:30,815	01:03:31,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bedded
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:32,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	01:03:32,351	01:03:35,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Horrible and greasy from the bloated bodies that float in it
EDL	01:03:35,679	01:03:36,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	01:03:36,447	01:03:37,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Interesting in a poisonous
EDL	01:03:37,983	01:03:41,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because the gas that used on the battlefield I know it
EDL	01:03:41,567	01:03:43,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tempting to think of it as vapor
EDL	01:03:43,615	01:03:45,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it's really almost a solid
EDL	01:03:45,663	01:03:48,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Where when a gas shell explodes it covers
EDL	01:03:48,223	01:03:50,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An entire area would like a pollen like
EDL	01:03:51,039	01:03:53,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Coding and that pollen like coating
EDL	01:03:53,599	01:03:54,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is deadly
EDL	01:03:54,623	01:04:01,023	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So it's like putting insecticide on a given area to keep you out of it for a while and eventually the rain will come and dissolve that
EDL	01:04:01,023	01:04:04,095	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the dissolve runoff just goes into all these gel holes
EDL	01:04:04,095	01:04:06,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That are filled with water and makes them just poison
EDL	01:04:07,167	01:04:07,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There will be
EDL	01:04:07,935	01:04:14,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Riders will talk about how at first in in the spring the Verdun Battlefield will try to recover a little of its life and they will see little girl
EDL	01:04:14,335	01:04:15,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Green shoots
EDL	01:04:15,103	01:04:16,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pop up for a minute before
EDL	01:04:16,639	01:04:20,735	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The poisonous air and Soil and Water and everything just kill them right away
EDL	01:04:21,247	01:04:22,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a giant
EDL	01:04:22,527	01:04:23,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Burnt out
EDL	01:04:23,551	01:04:25,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Insecticide Zone
EDL	01:04:25,343	01:04:29,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's what Verdun is an Invicta landscape itself
EDL	01:04:29,951	01:04:34,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is horrifying to a degree that's hard to describe unless you want to say
EDL	01:04:34,303	01:04:36,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is Mordor
EDL	01:04:37,375	01:04:40,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is JRR tolkien's conception
EDL	01:04:40,703	01:04:41,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of the dark light
EDL	01:04:41,983	01:04:43,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He was in the first World War
EDL	01:04:44,031	01:04:44,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maybe got it from
EDL	01:04:45,567	01:04:50,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The match is perfect. I mean once this artillery has been going for not even that long at this levels of intensity
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:55,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You have around you on this battlefield and we talked about stage
EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:56,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all the
EDL	01:04:56,831	01:04:59,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People merely players will look at the stage these people are playing on
EDL	01:05:00,415	01:05:03,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know very shortly into the battle it's a lunar landscape it's the Moon
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:05,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Okay
EDL	01:05:06,047	01:05:09,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And these trenches are places where people meet there and very often.
EDL	01:05:09,887	01:05:15,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lots of stories about soldiers with big heavy packs in the night losing their way falling into one of these
EDL	01:05:15,775	01:05:16,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Terrible
EDL	01:05:17,055	01:05:18,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Craters & just drowning
EDL	01:05:19,359	01:05:21,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The worst story are these people who
EDL	01:05:21,151	01:05:27,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But you hear stories about people drinking kneeling down and drinking out of these green colored poisonous Waters with bodies float
EDL	01:05:27,551	01:05:28,319	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Coding in it
EDL	01:05:28,319	01:05:30,623	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because the water isn't making it up to the front
EDL	01:05:30,623	01:05:36,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The people whose job it is to bring food and water to the people on the front edge of the meat grinder are getting killed trying to bring it up
EDL	01:05:38,303	01:05:39,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is a terrible.
EDL	01:05:39,839	01:05:42,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's the battles of 1915
EDL	01:05:42,143	01:05:46,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Taken to the next level which is what this war is going to be about every time the world thinks
EDL	01:05:46,751	01:05:50,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They come to the limits of their interest surely this is the worst battle there will ever be
EDL	01:05:51,103	01:05:52,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The standard gets up
EDL	01:05:52,895	01:05:53,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Again
EDL	01:05:53,663	01:05:55,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And this happens continually
EDL	01:05:57,503	01:05:58,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a
EDL	01:05:58,271	01:05:59,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pressure cooker
EDL	01:05:59,039	01:06:00,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who's going to break first
EDL	01:06:01,087	01:06:04,415	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you know you thought last year was bad welcome to next year
EDL	01:06:06,463	01:06:07,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm on next year's deadlier
EDL	01:06:07,999	01:06:11,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm on the scale is more and perhaps unsustainably Titanic
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:14,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The pattern is
EDL	01:06:14,143	01:06:15,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unfortunately for the troops on the ground
EDL	01:06:15,679	01:06:16,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Horrific Lee
EDL	01:06:16,703	01:06:17,215	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Familiar
EDL	01:06:18,239	01:06:20,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About a week into the assault
EDL	01:06:21,055	01:06:22,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German attack
EDL	01:06:22,591	01:06:23,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Jordan Staal
EDL	01:06:24,895	01:06:25,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Just like
EDL	01:06:25,919	01:06:26,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All these other
EDL	01:06:26,943	01:06:28,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battles we've seen in
EDL	01:06:28,223	01:06:29,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A lot more we will
EDL	01:06:29,759	01:06:31,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The initial assault is the most
EDL	01:06:31,807	01:06:34,623	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tense nail-biting up in the air kind of time
EDL	01:06:34,623	01:06:38,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Once it stopped there may be abs and flows and scary moments
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:39,743	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By and large
EDL	01:06:40,255	01:06:43,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We have descended into what Churchill called did you say
EDL	01:06:43,071	01:06:45,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Prolonged operations are extended operations
EDL	01:06:46,655	01:06:47,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're now into combat
EDL	01:06:48,959	01:06:50,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And for the troops on the ground
EDL	01:06:51,519	01:06:55,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's the most horrifying environment when we want to study the idea
EDL	01:06:55,871	01:06:57,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Human beings
EDL	01:06:57,151	01:06:57,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can do
EDL	01:06:58,687	01:07:01,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It seems to me you want to see them in some of the most if you want to see if
EDL	01:07:01,759	01:07:02,783	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Just like a product
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:03,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Test did you want
EDL	01:07:03,807	01:07:06,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To put it under the most extreme stress and see how behave
EDL	01:07:06,623	01:07:07,647	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Look at what we're done but
EDL	01:07:08,927	01:07:10,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Over the next many months
EDL	01:07:12,767	01:07:13,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Do I have to live
EDL	01:07:14,815	01:07:15,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How do they induce
EDL	01:07:17,119	01:07:17,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	01:07:17,887	01:07:19,423	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When you hear the stories
EDL	01:07:19,423	01:07:20,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	East from this place I mean
EDL	01:07:21,215	01:07:21,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Start with the approach
EDL	01:07:22,751	01:07:23,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The French
EDL	01:07:23,775	01:07:24,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As we said
EDL	01:07:24,799	01:07:29,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And a lot of trouble to rotate their troops in and out of this battle cuz they get worn down like a
EDL	01:07:29,919	01:07:31,455	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pencil in a pencil sharp
EDL	01:07:31,455	01:07:32,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Do you have to
EDL	01:07:32,223	01:07:33,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And rotate them
EDL	01:07:33,759	01:07:38,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the soldiers approached Verdun they can see it a long way away
EDL	01:07:38,879	01:07:43,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I mean the guns of the opening barrage were said to be audible a hundred miles away
EDL	01:07:43,999	01:07:46,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So when they're approaching Verdun it looks like a giant
EDL	01:07:46,815	01:07:47,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Forest fire
EDL	01:07:47,583	01:07:48,095	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fire in the distance
EDL	01:07:49,631	01:07:51,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One French soldier on the way to it said
EDL	01:07:51,679	01:07:53,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Reminded him quote
EDL	01:07:53,471	01:07:55,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm a gigantic Ford
EDL	01:07:55,263	01:07:57,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Neither day or night
EDL	01:07:57,567	01:07:58,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	01:07:59,103	01:08:00,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The fires of Mordor
EDL	01:08:00,383	01:08:00,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like I said
EDL	01:08:01,663	01:08:04,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The air becomes Smoky and hazy
EDL	01:08:04,991	01:08:11,391	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you don't see the sun clearly anymore and all the vegetation disappears one artist said the only color in the landscape
EDL	01:08:11,391	01:08:13,439	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	After a while cuz it's just overturned
EDL	01:08:13,951	01:08:17,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And bodies and debris and everything turned up concrete
EDL	01:08:18,047	01:08:24,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a hellish environment but there is a smear of red here are there with the horses have just been splattered by artillery
EDL	01:08:24,959	01:08:27,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I mentioned that it sounds like hell yet
EDL	01:08:29,567	01:08:32,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We mentioned earlier how hard it was to get food and water to
EDL	01:08:32,895	01:08:33,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The troops fighting
EDL	01:08:33,663	01:08:34,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The front line
EDL	01:08:34,943	01:08:36,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it was hard to get anything
EDL	01:08:36,735	01:08:37,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To the Troops
EDL	01:08:37,503	01:08:39,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fighting at the front line for example
EDL	01:08:39,295	01:08:41,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To get new troops to the front line
EDL	01:08:41,599	01:08:43,391	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Could kill off half your troops
EDL	01:08:44,415	01:08:44,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In his book
EDL	01:08:45,439	01:08:47,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The price of Glory Alistair Horne
EDL	01:08:48,767	01:08:50,559	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Takes a couple of different accounts
EDL	01:08:50,559	01:08:52,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And put them together and quotes a few
EDL	01:08:52,863	01:08:54,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People who were there
EDL	01:08:54,143	01:08:57,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About what it was like simply trying to get to the front of the meat drying
EDL	01:08:57,983	01:09:02,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Edward on imagine suffering a 40 or 50% casualties trying to get to the moon
EDL	01:09:02,847	01:09:03,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Reminder here's what he writes
EDL	01:09:05,151	01:09:05,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quote
EDL	01:09:06,431	01:09:08,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A mile or two from the Frontline
EDL	01:09:08,479	01:09:11,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Troops entered the First Communication trenches
EDL	01:09:11,039	01:09:13,855	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Go to call them this was generally both an exaggeration
EDL	01:09:13,855	01:09:14,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And an anachronism
EDL	01:09:15,391	01:09:18,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Parapets gradually grew lower and lower
EDL	01:09:18,207	01:09:21,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Until the trench became little deeper than a roadside ditch
EDL	01:09:21,791	01:09:26,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Chills now began to fall with increasing regularity among closely packed men
EDL	01:09:26,655	01:09:27,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the Darkness
EDL	01:09:27,935	01:09:31,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He says for obvious reasons approach marches were usually made at night
EDL	01:09:31,519	01:09:35,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Columns trampled over the howling wounded lay under foot
EDL	01:09:35,615	01:09:38,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Suddenly the trench became nothing more than a track
EDL	01:09:38,687	01:09:40,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Harley traced out amid the shell holes
EDL	01:09:40,991	01:09:42,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the mud
EDL	01:09:42,015	01:09:45,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which the shelling had now turned to a consistency of sticky butter
EDL	01:09:45,599	01:09:48,159	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Troop stumbled and fell repeatedly
EDL	01:09:48,159	01:09:52,511	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cursing in low undertones as if fearful of being overheard by the enemy
EDL	01:09:52,511	01:09:55,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Relentlessly pursued them with a shells at every step
EDL	01:09:56,095	01:09:59,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sometimes there were duckboards around the lips of the huge shell crater
EDL	01:09:59,935	01:10:01,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But more often there were not
EDL	01:10:01,727	01:10:07,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And heavily Laden men falling into the water filled holes remain there until they drown
EDL	01:10:07,103	01:10:09,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unable to crawl up the greasy side
EDL	01:10:09,663	01:10:12,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If a comrade pause to lend a hand he writes
EDL	01:10:12,991	01:10:16,063	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It often meant it to Wood round instead of one
EDL	01:10:16,063	01:10:22,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the chaos of the battlefield where all reference pointed long since been obliterated relieving detachments
EDL	01:10:22,463	01:10:23,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stopped and got lost
EDL	01:10:23,487	01:10:25,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And wondered hopelessly all night
EDL	01:10:25,279	01:10:29,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Only to be massacred by an enemy machine gunner is Dawn betrayed them
EDL	01:10:29,119	01:10:30,911	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was not unusual for relief
EDL	01:10:30,911	01:10:34,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To reach the front line with only half the numbers that set out
EDL	01:10:34,239	01:10:38,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nor for this nightmare approach march to last 10 hours or longer
EDL	01:10:38,847	01:10:39,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	01:10:40,639	01:10:41,663	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Seems to me
EDL	01:10:42,431	01:10:44,735	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maybe I can speak for some of my generation
EDL	01:10:45,247	01:10:48,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If I just spent 10 hours struggling through that

EDL	01:35:17,504	01:35:20,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The one thing in 1916 you're beginning to see if we've eluded
EDL	01:35:20,832	01:35:21,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Did this before
EDL	01:35:22,112	01:35:24,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is that these people have put up already
EDL	01:35:24,928	01:35:26,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With a lot more pounding than we would
EDL	01:35:27,488	01:35:28,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Only put up with today
EDL	01:35:29,024	01:35:31,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But there's a breaking point for all human beings
EDL	01:35:31,840	01:35:33,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In my mind
EDL	01:35:33,120	01:35:35,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The breaking point that's coming
EDL	01:35:35,168	01:35:36,448	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was Quicken
EDL	01:35:37,216	01:35:37,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But experience
EDL	01:35:38,496	01:35:39,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ever done
EDL	01:35:39,264	01:35:43,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And we mentioned that the French had a policy of rotating troops during the battle to keep them
EDL	01:35:44,128	01:35:44,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ever done
EDL	01:35:45,408	01:35:46,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What that meant was
EDL	01:35:47,200	01:35:48,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Virtually the entire
EDL	01:35:48,480	01:35:49,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Higher French army
EDL	01:35:50,016	01:35:50,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Timer another
EDL	01:35:50,784	01:35:52,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was rotated through that
EDL	01:35:52,576	01:35:53,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sector
EDL	01:35:54,112	01:35:54,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Verdun
EDL	01:35:55,392	01:35:56,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Took the French
EDL	01:35:57,184	01:35:58,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Ratchet it up
EDL	01:35:58,464	01:36:00,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The discontent levels in Waze
EDL	01:36:01,024	01:36:03,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It will probably out of proportion to what you could have expected
EDL	01:36:03,584	01:36:04,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A problem or normal
EDL	01:36:05,120	01:36:06,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It got you closer to the break
EDL	01:36:08,448	01:36:09,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The idea of
EDL	01:36:09,984	01:36:15,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pushing your adversary to the point where their society literally implodes
EDL	01:36:16,128	01:36:17,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is a Thoroughly Modern idea
EDL	01:36:18,432	01:36:19,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By 1916
EDL	01:36:19,968	01:36:23,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Most of the military leaders in this conflict
EDL	01:36:23,040	01:36:26,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	See that as the endgame in this conflict
EDL	01:36:26,112	01:36:30,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The reason it's a Thoroughly Modern concept isn't because people of the past didn't understand it
EDL	01:36:31,488	01:36:32,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was because
EDL	01:36:32,768	01:36:36,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They could never take enough damage to get to that point
EDL	01:36:36,864	01:36:38,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I reset the route this series
EDL	01:36:38,656	01:36:41,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nations in the past for the most part couldn't take a punch
EDL	01:36:42,496	01:36:48,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The ones who could stand out like sore thumbs the Roman Republic for example what makes it so unusual in the
EDL	01:36:48,896	01:36:49,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Terry history sent
EDL	01:36:50,176	01:36:51,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They could sustain
EDL	01:36:51,712	01:36:52,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Defeat
EDL	01:36:52,480	01:36:53,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	After defeat
EDL	01:36:53,760	01:36:54,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	After defeat
EDL	01:36:55,296	01:36:56,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And not capitulate
EDL	01:36:57,600	01:37:02,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They could lose a battle of cannae they can lose a battle of lake trasimene in the same War
EDL	01:37:02,720	01:37:05,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And keep coming back for more very unusual
EDL	01:37:06,816	01:37:09,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know what generation before those defeats
EDL	01:37:09,632	01:37:12,448	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Alexander the Great defeats the massive
EDL	01:37:12,448	01:37:17,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the greatest Empire the world has ever seen the achaemenid Persian Empire with a couple of big shots
EDL	01:37:18,336	01:37:19,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's never enough time
EDL	01:37:19,872	01:37:21,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For the society to implode
EDL	01:37:22,944	01:37:23,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A society
EDL	01:37:24,480	01:37:30,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Collapsing at the foundation's requires that they be able to stand there and exchange enough punches to go
EDL	01:37:30,880	01:37:31,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Get to that point
EDL	01:37:32,416	01:37:33,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	R19 16
EDL	01:37:33,696	01:37:37,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The grinding down of Nations is well underway
EDL	01:37:37,280	01:37:40,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As author David fromkin says the real war
EDL	01:37:40,608	01:37:41,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can become an economic
EDL	01:37:42,400	01:37:43,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And social survival Khan
EDL	01:37:45,216	01:37:48,032	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the generals are beginning to organize their strategies
EDL	01:37:48,544	01:37:50,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To Quicken and hasten this outcome
EDL	01:37:51,616	01:37:52,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Example win
EDL	01:37:52,640	01:37:54,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Falkenhayn talks about
EDL	01:37:54,176	01:37:56,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know the idea of using attrition
EDL	01:37:56,224	01:37:58,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To bleed the French White
EDL	01:37:58,016	01:38:01,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Explains that you don't have to worry about the Russians anymore
EDL	01:38:01,600	01:38:06,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because they're well on their way to having their entire Society collapse Jesus quote
EDL	01:38:07,232	01:38:08,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	According to all reports
EDL	01:38:09,024	01:38:12,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The domestic difficulties of the giant Empire
EDL	01:38:12,096	01:38:13,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are multiplying rapidly
EDL	01:38:14,144	01:38:15,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Even if we cannot perhaps
EDL	01:38:15,680	01:38:18,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Expect a revolution in the grand Style
EDL	01:38:18,496	01:38:21,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're entitled to believe that Russia's internal troubles
EDL	01:38:21,568	01:38:24,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will compel her to give in within a relatively short period
EDL	01:38:25,408	01:38:30,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this connection it may be taken for granted that she will not revive her military reputation meanwhile
EDL	01:38:30,784	01:38:33,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We need not be anxious about that
EDL	01:38:33,856	01:38:35,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the contrary
EDL	01:38:35,136	01:38:36,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It is probable he writes
EDL	01:38:36,928	01:38:42,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Did any such attempt in the law says it must involve would only hasten the process of disintegration
EDL	01:38:42,816	01:38:43,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	01:38:45,376	01:38:46,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I should also point out that
EDL	01:38:46,656	01:38:49,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the nineteenth Century for example that kind of disintegration
EDL	01:38:50,240	01:38:52,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not only wasn't the goal
EDL	01:38:52,288	01:38:54,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It would have been seen as a negative by Prada
EDL	01:38:55,872	01:38:57,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the era where
EDL	01:38:57,152	01:39:03,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A military defeat meant that one General gave his sword to the other General in exchange some provinces or something
EDL	01:39:03,552	01:39:04,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Colonies are what nut
EDL	01:39:04,576	01:39:07,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The goal wasn't for the society to collapse
EDL	01:39:08,160	01:39:08,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was now
EDL	01:39:11,488	01:39:12,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Military leaders
EDL	01:39:12,768	01:39:14,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Began to employ strategies
EDL	01:39:14,816	01:39:17,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Designed to make that outcome a reality
EDL	01:39:17,888	01:39:18,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Spriggs amp
EDL	01:39:18,912	01:39:20,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the war starts
EDL	01:39:20,704	01:39:22,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British use their Navy
EDL	01:39:23,008	01:39:25,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To clamp down a blockade on Germany
EDL	01:39:26,336	01:39:27,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now the French
EDL	01:39:27,616	01:39:31,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Don't look at that as a very useful strategy because after all
EDL	01:39:31,456	01:39:37,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Something like that going to take a long time and no one win this war starts you know a very small minority who turned out the
EDL	01:39:37,856	01:39:38,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because sand
EDL	01:39:38,624	01:39:44,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Prophetic no one thinks the wars going to go long enough for something like a blockade
EDL	01:39:44,000	01:39:45,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To actually take effect

EDL	01:39:48,096	01:39:54,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Everyone is starting to understand that those long-term Anaconda like strangling strategies
EDL	01:39:54,496	01:39:55,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are very viable
EDL	01:39:56,800	01:39:59,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the British are not the only ones
EDL	01:39:59,104	01:39:59,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who can do this

EDL	01:40:04,736	01:40:08,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is the point in the story where it becomes worth talking about it
EDL	01:40:10,624	01:40:11,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Easy
EDL	01:40:11,904	01:40:13,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This German fleet was a
EDL	01:40:13,440	01:40:14,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Key reason
EDL	01:40:14,464	01:40:17,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The tensions especially with Britain increased in the pre-war
EDL	01:40:17,536	01:40:19,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Call the anglo-german naval
EDL	01:40:20,608	01:40:23,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What is considered to be worth it by a Kaiser
EDL	01:40:23,680	01:40:28,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And a government that thought it was important to be able to hold your own at CSO
EDL	01:40:28,288	01:40:29,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These ships were built and they cost
EDL	01:40:30,336	01:40:31,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An amazing amount of money
EDL	01:40:32,640	01:40:37,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A huge amount of industrial capacity of sucked up into this every said you you turn them

EDL	01:40:41,600	01:40:44,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now that you got what you wanted

EDL	01:41:14,624	01:41:15,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And if you are
EDL	01:41:15,648	01:41:19,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not for this. Like I am I like to call it the battleship era

EDL	01:41:39,712	01:41:42,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But I think these vehicles are incredible
EDL	01:41:42,784	01:41:44,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And there is so little
EDL	01:41:44,576	01:41:47,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Evidence of them actually being used
EDL	01:41:47,392	01:41:53,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Did on the few occasions know where it happens I tend to look at them rather deeply there's only one occasion and
EDL	01:41:53,024	01:41:54,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I don't think I count the
EDL	01:41:54,816	01:41:58,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Russo-japanese War pre-dreadnought think only one occasion in history where
EDL	01:41:58,912	01:42:01,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These armored ships from this era
EDL	01:42:01,728	01:42:02,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	50 years
EDL	01:42:03,520	01:42:07,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Actually fought the way these Admirals had envisioned they would
EDL	01:42:07,616	01:42:10,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In long lines miles long lines
EDL	01:42:10,432	01:42:12,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stretching off to the Horizon you know
EDL	01:42:12,736	01:42:15,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lord Nelson style Pirates of the Caribbean style
EDL	01:42:15,808	01:42:21,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And facing a fleet similarly arrayed in shooting you know when the distance between them that only happened once
EDL	01:42:21,952	01:42:24,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this whole 50-year Battleship era
EDL	01:42:24,512	01:42:26,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And only happened once in this war obviously
EDL	01:42:27,072	01:42:28,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a battle in 19
EDL	01:42:28,352	01:42:29,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Call the Battle of Jutland
EDL	01:42:30,656	01:42:34,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Coop's Like Yours Truly this is a fantastically interesting encounter
EDL	01:42:35,520	01:42:37,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When we were thinking about organizing the story
EDL	01:42:37,824	01:42:39,360	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I know you try to carve out
EDL	01:42:39,360	01:42:40,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Places to take a little
EDL	01:42:40,896	01:42:46,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Direction change the momentum you go from the Carnage of Verdun and those of you who know the story Noah
EDL	01:42:46,784	01:42:48,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What's coming up in the future of it
EDL	01:42:48,320	01:42:51,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you take a little interlude to talk about other elements not just
EDL	01:42:51,392	01:42:52,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The navel
EDL	01:42:52,416	01:42:55,744	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Inside of this but also the fact that the Navy really is a wonderful
EDL	01:42:55,744	01:42:58,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Canvas on which to represent the technology of this era
EDL	01:42:59,072	01:43:01,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How big of a deal that is to the people here
EDL	01:43:02,400	01:43:04,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Perpetual problem isn't it
EDL	01:43:04,704	01:43:06,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm going back in time and seeing
EDL	01:43:06,496	01:43:10,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What looks to be ancient technology to us looking at it the way
EDL	01:43:10,336	01:43:13,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The people back there looking at it to whom it's cutting-edge stuff
EDL	01:43:14,432	01:43:15,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Give me first of all
EDL	01:43:15,712	01:43:18,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I was trying to think about the best way to sort of explain
EDL	01:43:18,272	01:43:20,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Create an analogy for how these people see the fleet
EDL	01:43:20,832	01:43:22,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They having the fleets in the Navy
EDL	01:43:22,880	01:43:25,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Along with this new thing these are crap
EDL	01:43:25,440	01:43:28,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are the real cutting-edge technology out there
EDL	01:43:28,768	01:43:29,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	01:43:29,792	01:43:32,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The reason why is because it's just death to be
EDL	01:43:32,608	01:43:33,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Too far behind
EDL	01:43:33,632	01:43:40,032	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As I said the best Navy from 1900 would lose to several navies from 1914
EDL	01:43:40,032	01:43:43,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's me you're 14 years I don't think those 1914 Navy lose a ship
EDL	01:43:44,128	01:43:45,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's how quickly
EDL	01:43:45,152	01:43:45,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Things are changing
EDL	01:43:47,200	01:43:49,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Robert Massey in his book Dreadnought have a great life
EDL	01:43:49,760	01:43:51,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He says in 1900
EDL	01:43:51,296	01:43:54,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nothing you're 14 years before the first world war breaks out
EDL	01:43:54,624	01:43:58,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Every single British Admiral commanding a British battleship
EDL	01:43:58,720	01:43:59,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Have been
EDL	01:43:59,488	01:44:00,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Train
EDL	01:44:00,256	01:44:02,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When they came up in the Navy in the age of sail
EDL	01:44:04,352	01:44:06,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So that's an example of how cutting-edge this is
EDL	01:44:07,936	01:44:13,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you want a mental image think of the Titanic the ship that struck the iceberg and went down and everything that's from this
EDL	01:44:13,824	01:44:16,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's sort of a steampunk e
EDL	01:44:16,384	01:44:19,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sherlock Holmes a kind of feel
EDL	01:44:19,200	01:44:23,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I always think about it as I mean if you eat if you are up in the command center Wendy's battleships
EDL	01:44:23,808	01:44:25,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's like Star Trek meets
EDL	01:44:26,112	01:44:32,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a Sherlock Holmes are steampunk and instead of having a digital display you'd have one of those in a round dial
EDL	01:44:32,512	01:44:33,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nails with one of those
EDL	01:44:33,536	01:44:39,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Arrows that looks like the elevator arrow in a nice New York hotel that goes around on a gold background of me
EDL	01:44:39,936	01:44:40,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know very
EDL	01:44:40,960	01:44:43,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Very beautiful accident ships were beautiful
EDL	01:44:43,520	01:44:46,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Polish would the whole thing they were just gorgeous
EDL	01:44:46,336	01:44:49,408	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they were The Cutting Edge technology of their day
EDL	01:44:50,176	01:44:51,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And I had to
EDL	01:44:51,712	01:44:52,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Resist
EDL	01:44:52,736	01:44:54,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Comparing them to spaceship
EDL	01:44:55,040	01:45:00,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As a way to try to have us feel like the people back then felt cushion of me that would be just be so amazing
EDL	01:45:00,672	01:45:01,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like a Starship
EDL	01:45:01,952	01:45:04,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it's a little like one but not enough for the compare
EDL	01:45:04,512	01:45:06,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right as I thought to myself I thought you know
EDL	01:45:06,816	01:45:13,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Those people saw battleships has really cutting it but not as much as we would spaceships with an equal number of men
EDL	01:45:13,216	01:45:13,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Crew members on board
EDL	01:45:14,496	01:45:16,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That would be bigger deal but then I remembered
EDL	01:45:17,056	01:45:18,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The submarine
EDL	01:45:19,616	01:45:26,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For the people again hard for us to get all wild about them but to the people back then that is science fiction
EDL	01:45:26,016	01:45:30,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The very definition of the word right out of Jules Verne's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea
EDL	01:45:30,368	01:45:32,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all of a sudden we have ships that go underwater
EDL	01:45:33,696	01:45:36,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like they have cloaking devices they become
EDL	01:45:36,256	01:45:37,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Invisible
EDL	01:45:37,792	01:45:38,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And worse
EDL	01:45:38,816	01:45:41,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you're you know an able official back then
EDL	01:45:41,888	01:45:43,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is it they now carry
EDL	01:45:43,424	01:45:44,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	New weapons
EDL	01:45:44,960	01:45:47,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The threatened everything you have
EDL	01:45:48,544	01:45:49,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is what really
EDL	01:45:49,824	01:45:51,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Accounts for the cautious nature
EDL	01:45:51,872	01:45:56,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of Naval Warfare in this. Why didn't the ship just all come out blazing and everything
EDL	01:45:56,480	01:45:58,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Well there's all these uncertainties
EDL	01:45:59,552	01:46:03,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Part of this. Attraction is that you begin to see a showdown
EDL	01:46:03,648	01:46:09,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In Naval Warfare when you haven't had any test of any of the technology long time no one knows what's going to happen
EDL	01:46:10,560	01:46:15,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When you get whole fleets out here blazing away with this modern technology it hasn't happened before
EDL	01:46:17,216	01:46:19,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the things everyone kind of scared about is
EDL	01:46:19,776	01:46:21,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Torpedoes for exam
EDL	01:46:21,568	01:46:23,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He's mines you know these floating mines that
EDL	01:46:23,872	01:46:26,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It lay in the water and then the ship runs into the man bun they explode
EDL	01:46:27,456	01:46:30,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because these weapons are very very cheap
EDL	01:46:30,016	01:46:31,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right you can make a lot of them
EDL	01:46:31,808	01:46:33,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they can sink
EDL	01:46:33,600	01:46:34,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These
EDL	01:46:34,368	01:46:35,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Massively expensive
EDL	01:46:36,416	01:46:38,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know ships that take years to build
EDL	01:46:38,976	01:46:41,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And whose loss is catastrophic
EDL	01:46:41,280	01:46:42,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I can sync those
EDL	01:46:43,328	01:46:46,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's a huge change because it most and Naval Warfare
EDL	01:46:46,144	01:46:46,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	General
EDL	01:46:46,912	01:46:50,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There are exceptions but when you want to sink a massive expensive
EDL	01:46:50,496	01:46:51,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	First class
EDL	01:46:51,520	01:46:54,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ship you generally need either another massive
EDL	01:46:54,848	01:46:56,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	First class ship or a lot of other one
EDL	01:46:57,664	01:46:59,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They have huge survivals
EDL	01:46:59,712	01:47:02,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Write a stick and justify their cost in the investment
EDL	01:47:02,784	01:47:03,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now all of a sudden
EDL	01:47:04,320	01:47:07,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Free simple Churchill talked about the British admiralty just being
EDL	01:47:07,136	01:47:07,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Petrified
EDL	01:47:08,416	01:47:14,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That you would turn around one day and these great huge expensive ships that took forever to build and that you only have a limited number of we're just
EDL	01:47:14,816	01:47:17,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Disappearing in the blink of an eye boom quick explosion
EDL	01:47:17,632	01:47:18,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Mothership gone
EDL	01:47:19,424	01:47:20,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the war starts
EDL	01:47:20,704	01:47:22,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Am I the first couple of months that happen
EDL	01:47:23,008	01:47:24,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They lose a super dreadnought
EDL	01:47:25,312	01:47:27,360	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Creme Dela Creme of the British
EDL	01:47:27,360	01:47:28,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battleship forces
EDL	01:47:29,408	01:47:31,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the HMS audacious trikes of mine
EDL	01:47:31,968	01:47:34,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like in a month or two after the war starts in that
EDL	01:47:34,784	01:47:36,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pretty brand-new ship almost
EDL	01:47:36,320	01:47:39,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And boom goes down 191 battleship
EDL	01:47:39,136	01:47:39,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wow
EDL	01:47:40,416	01:47:42,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Again if you're in the admiralty you're going okay what is this mean
EDL	01:47:43,744	01:47:45,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then
EDL	01:47:45,024	01:47:50,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A submarine like since a couple of old British cruises boom boom boom Lemme one right after another
EDL	01:47:50,144	01:47:51,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And all of a sudden
EDL	01:47:51,936	01:47:56,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Yeah these people who got these big expensive ships are kind of petrified about using them
EDL	01:47:56,800	01:48:00,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Military strike Martin Van creveld have spoken about this we just have this
EDL	01:48:00,896	01:48:02,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Strange dichotomy with you
EDL	01:48:02,944	01:48:09,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Spend so much money on these vessels cuz they're very important but that because you spend so much money on them you don't want to risk them and so
EDL	01:48:09,344	01:48:11,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So you have the German Navy in the British Navy
EDL	01:48:12,672	01:48:16,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Dealing with each other as maybe two snipers hunting each other would deal with
EDL	01:48:16,768	01:48:17,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Each other
EDL	01:48:17,536	01:48:18,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Waiting for
EDL	01:48:18,560	01:48:21,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The other side to make a mistake and then when they do pouncing
EDL	01:48:22,656	01:48:23,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The problem is is that
EDL	01:48:24,192	01:48:25,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the war starts the British
EDL	01:48:25,984	01:48:27,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Clampdown that blockade
EDL	01:48:27,776	01:48:29,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that's all they need to do
EDL	01:48:30,080	01:48:32,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The pressures on the Germans to do something about
EDL	01:48:33,408	01:48:36,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And every said Winston Churchill who was the civilian
EDL	01:48:36,736	01:48:39,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Head of the Navy for a while in the conflict wrote down that
EDL	01:48:39,296	01:48:45,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Really well they would have been a lot of advantages that sending the you know numerically Superior British Fleet to go in there and
EDL	01:48:45,696	01:48:46,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is Kik German
EDL	01:48:46,720	01:48:47,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tail
EDL	01:48:48,000	01:48:51,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The downside if you failed to do that
EDL	01:48:51,328	01:48:55,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was so bad it wasn't worth it he said yeah you know we can get all these good things if we
EDL	01:48:55,424	01:48:58,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Decisively defeated the Germans because but if we lost
EDL	01:48:58,496	01:48:59,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Remember
EDL	01:48:59,776	01:49:06,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is all untried technology and Naval Combat weird and unpredictable anyway you could bring the superior
EDL	01:49:06,176	01:49:07,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If lead in there and somehow
EDL	01:49:07,968	01:49:10,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lose or just lose enough
EDL	01:49:10,272	01:49:15,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So that you don't have the numerical Advantage anymore you got parody with the Enemy and that was unthinkable
EDL	01:49:15,392	01:49:17,952	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Churchill said the chances of that happening
EDL	01:49:17,952	01:49:21,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Might not be great but if it happens it could cost us the whole War
EDL	01:49:22,816	01:49:25,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I remember reading that and thinking to myself I don't know if I buy it
EDL	01:49:26,144	01:49:28,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But a whole lot of interesting thoughts come to mind
EDL	01:49:28,960	01:49:30,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you believe what Churchill says
EDL	01:49:31,776	01:49:32,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About it
EDL	01:49:32,544	01:49:34,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Basically having the potential
EDL	01:49:34,336	01:49:35,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To end the war
EDL	01:49:35,104	01:49:40,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now here's how we explained it in this book he said if the German Navy were even to have a nice victory
EDL	01:49:40,480	01:49:44,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Against the British cut down the numerical superiority so that they both have the same number of big ships
EDL	01:49:45,600	01:49:48,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Then the German Navy would be able to interdict
EDL	01:49:48,672	01:49:51,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Just off heading for Britain and Churchill says that that would result
EDL	01:49:52,000	01:49:52,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quote
EDL	01:49:53,024	01:49:55,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The trade and food supply of the British Isles
EDL	01:49:55,840	01:49:56,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Would have been paralyzed
EDL	01:49:57,376	01:50:01,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Our armies on the continent would have been cut off from their Base by Superior Naval Force
EDL	01:50:02,240	01:50:06,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the transportation of the Allies would have been jeopardized in Hanford
EDL	01:50:06,336	01:50:09,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The United States could not have intervened in the war
EDL	01:50:09,152	01:50:12,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Starvation an invasion would have descended upon the British people
EDL	01:50:12,992	01:50:13,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ruin
EDL	01:50:13,760	01:50:16,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Otterbein final would have overwhelmed the Allied cause
EDL	01:50:17,600	01:50:20,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He says the great disparity of the results
EDL	01:50:20,160	01:50:22,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stake in the battle between the British and German navies
EDL	01:50:22,720	01:50:24,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can never be excluded from our thoughts
EDL	01:50:26,304	01:50:26,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	01:50:27,840	01:50:30,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So if you buy Churchill's theory that means instead of being
EDL	01:50:31,424	01:50:33,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The most secure of the Great
EDL	01:50:33,216	01:50:37,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Powers that I think most of us assume Britney is after all your talking about an island nation
EDL	01:50:37,824	01:50:38,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Country with a motor
EDL	01:50:39,360	01:50:42,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right and then you add the greatest Navy in the world looks pretty secure to me
EDL	01:50:42,432	01:50:44,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Churchill's idea here is that
EDL	01:50:44,224	01:50:47,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Yeah but we are one lucky punch
EDL	01:50:47,040	01:50:48,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Away from that situation changing
EDL	01:50:49,600	01:50:50,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To stay with our boxing and
EDL	01:50:50,880	01:50:51,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Analogy
EDL	01:50:51,648	01:50:52,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And if that's true
EDL	01:50:53,184	01:50:54,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans
EDL	01:50:54,464	01:51:00,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maybe are justified in keeping that Fleet safe in Port in case you need a lucky punch maybe you're losing the war
EDL	01:51:00,864	01:51:01,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or else wrong you decide
EDL	01:51:02,144	01:51:08,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You'll send your in a ship's on a death run and take your chances maybe you get lucky right maybe you get a knockout blow
EDL	01:51:08,800	01:51:13,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If again you buy into what Churchill saying means that the Germans will
EDL	01:51:13,152	01:51:15,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As long as they still have a fleet somewhere
EDL	01:51:15,456	01:51:19,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maintain the ability to win the war with a lucky punch at any time
EDL	01:51:19,296	01:51:20,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Find it fast
EDL	01:51:20,064	01:51:21,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Don't know if I believe it that's fine too fast
EDL	01:51:23,648	01:51:25,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now the only time in this war
EDL	01:51:26,208	01:51:31,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That the attempt at a lucky punch happened it wasn't thrown that way
EDL	01:51:31,072	01:51:37,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the only time that this decisive encounter that could be potentially horrifying if it totally went the wrong way
EDL	01:51:37,472	01:51:39,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For Britain the only time this happens
EDL	01:51:40,288	01:51:41,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is in this part of the story where are they now
EDL	01:51:43,104	01:51:44,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1916
EDL	01:51:44,128	01:51:47,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And happens because of that Admiral we mentioned earlier his name is Reinhard Scheer
EDL	01:51:47,968	01:51:49,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He takes over in early 1916
EDL	01:51:50,272	01:51:52,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he feels about the German Fleet
EDL	01:51:52,064	01:51:53,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pretty much the same way everyone else
EDL	01:51:54,368	01:51:57,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's time to earn your keep and let's start acting more aggressively with it
EDL	01:51:57,952	01:51:58,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Apple Hill start
EDL	01:51:58,976	01:52:00,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Trying to
EDL	01:52:00,512	01:52:02,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The best way to put in a trap the British
EDL	01:52:03,584	01:52:08,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British have more big ships in the German so sheers ideas will let's see if we can ambush
EDL	01:52:08,704	01:52:10,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Small numbers of those big ships
EDL	01:52:11,008	01:52:15,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Overwhelm them and slowly but surely Whittle down the advantage in numbers that the British have
EDL	01:52:16,640	01:52:17,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's one of these
EDL	01:52:17,664	01:52:19,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Attempted traps
EDL	01:52:19,712	01:52:20,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That result in this
EDL	01:52:21,760	01:52:24,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Really only time for enthusiast like yours truly
EDL	01:52:24,832	01:52:26,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To see what these
EDL	01:52:26,112	01:52:28,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fleets could do in an all-out encounter
EDL	01:52:29,952	01:52:30,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Play Both Sides
EDL	01:52:31,488	01:52:33,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Curling steal the horizon
EDL	01:52:33,792	01:52:37,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And with all these weapons that you know from a spectator standpoint
EDL	01:52:37,888	01:52:40,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You're just dying to see what the heck they can do
EDL	01:52:41,472	01:52:43,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I mean let's start with the guns
EDL	01:52:43,264	01:52:48,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The guns on these ships are the same kind of guns you saw leveling the Belgian forts in that the Germans were using it
EDL	01:52:49,664	01:52:52,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're done those are the big Naval guns being used on land
EDL	01:52:52,992	01:52:55,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Well why didn't they call him Naval guns right
EDL	01:52:55,552	01:52:58,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These new battleships I mean for example the britisher
EDL	01:52:58,880	01:53:00,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bring it in for 5
EDL	01:53:00,928	01:53:05,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Brand new ones that will fight in the Second World War II that have 15 inch guns
EDL	01:53:05,792	01:53:09,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And multiple that me like 8 to 12 15 inch guns
EDL	01:53:10,144	01:53:13,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's incredible 13in of armor they wear like 30 thousand tons
EDL	01:53:14,496	01:53:19,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The new Queen Elizabeth plaster called they can do like 25 knots if they're really smoking
EDL	01:53:20,384	01:53:22,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These are incredible incredible modern worship
EDL	01:53:22,944	01:53:25,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when you realize that they can hurl a shell
EDL	01:53:26,016	01:53:28,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The size of a small Volkswagen
EDL	01:53:29,088	01:53:35,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	18 miles across the Horizon at a Target that's a hundred ft wide
EDL	01:53:35,488	01:53:39,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	While both shooter and Target are moving
EDL	01:53:39,072	01:53:41,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And hope to hit it reasonably well
EDL	01:53:42,912	01:53:45,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's shocking I mean the Spanish American War
EDL	01:53:45,984	01:53:49,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'll less than 20 years before this time. They would fire hundreds of shots
EDL	01:53:50,336	01:53:51,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Add about
EDL	01:53:51,616	01:53:53,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Just Less Than 3 miles distance
EDL	01:53:53,920	01:53:57,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And every now and then they'd score hit you know hundreds to get a few
EDL	01:53:57,760	01:53:58,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the
EDL	01:53:58,784	01:54:04,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Russo-japanese War they broke all records when they open fire at each other at 8 Miles distance
EDL	01:54:05,696	01:54:06,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's 11 years
EDL	01:54:07,744	01:54:08,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before the Battle of java
EDL	01:54:08,768	01:54:10,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	8 Miles breaking all record
EDL	01:54:10,560	01:54:13,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battle of Jutland has ship that can fire 18 mile
EDL	01:54:14,912	01:54:21,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How do you even hit anything on the horizon will both sides British and German are incorporating against like steampunk techno
EDL	01:54:21,312	01:54:22,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Media rudimentary
EDL	01:54:23,104	01:54:25,408	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fire Control computer you might call it
EDL	01:54:25,408	01:54:30,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And both sides have different versions of the Germans have Superior Optics and so they'll score
EDL	01:54:30,272	01:54:33,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The early hits in it when in this encounter that happens
EDL	01:54:33,856	01:54:34,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In large part
EDL	01:54:35,392	01:54:37,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because the British are reading
EDL	01:54:37,184	01:54:39,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The naval Communications of the German

EDL	01:55:04,064	01:55:05,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like in the next war and all that stuff
EDL	01:55:05,856	01:55:09,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Leaves the realm of the theoretical and gets

EDL	01:55:12,256	01:55:15,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The land Powers already saw this happen to them right at the start of the war
EDL	01:55:16,608	01:55:21,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Their military lands their reason all that the people have speculated about for decades
EDL	01:55:21,216	01:55:23,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Got their acid test in the first month
EDL	01:55:23,520	01:55:26,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Places like the battles of the Frontiers where
EDL	01:55:26,336	01:55:29,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Those sort of high-minded academic debates

EDL	01:55:38,880	01:55:41,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the first month of the war and the results are of course
EDL	01:55:41,952	01:55:45,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bloody and decisive even if they won't be absorbed writer
EDL	01:55:46,560	01:55:49,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The naval side of this war hasn't had this kind of nasty
EDL	01:55:49,120	01:55:53,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Little encounter one of the Falkland Islands another one

EDL	01:55:56,544	01:55:57,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To there
EDL	01:55:57,312	01:55:59,360	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But nothing like what's going to happen
EDL	01:55:59,872	01:56:01,408	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when you realize how
EDL	01:56:01,408	01:56:02,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Careful these animals are being
EDL	01:56:03,200	01:56:06,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because of the nature Naval Combat I mean
EDL	01:56:06,016	01:56:11,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You could provide an opportunity for someone to get a lucky punch if you're not careful so none of these Admirals wants to go out
EDL	01:56:11,904	01:56:13,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unless they have in it
EDL	01:56:13,184	01:56:16,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unless they have an advantage on their side favorable conditions
EDL	01:56:17,280	01:56:18,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British don't have to do anything
EDL	01:56:19,328	01:56:25,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cuz they got this blockade going so worst case scenario if things just stay as they are there wearing the Germans down
EDL	01:56:25,984	01:56:27,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're going to create
EDL	01:56:27,776	01:56:29,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Disintegration
EDL	01:56:29,568	01:56:31,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	August 8th just like we told you
EDL	01:56:31,872	01:56:34,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nina was the goal now of these leader
EDL	01:56:34,176	01:56:38,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know if the Germans begin to starve at home
EDL	01:56:38,272	01:56:44,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the caloric intake is already being reduced for their civilians you will see revolution in the street so this Brie
EDL	01:56:44,672	01:56:47,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Free strategy blockade will eventually bring Germany
EDL	01:56:48,512	01:56:50,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So it's incumbent upon the Germans to do something
EDL	01:56:51,072	01:56:56,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That situation when they get their new album reinhart's year in 1916 who wants to be more aggressive
EDL	01:56:56,192	01:56:57,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He decides to create his own at
EDL	01:56:59,008	01:57:00,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Weather conditions
EDL	01:57:00,288	01:57:02,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For his own advantage
EDL	01:57:02,336	01:57:03,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	John the naval battle
EDL	01:57:03,616	01:57:05,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Reset the traps
EDL	01:57:05,152	01:57:06,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In late May
EDL	01:57:06,432	01:57:12,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1960 Nissan S14 what he hopes will be a Detachment of big British warships
EDL	01:57:12,832	01:57:13,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Five or six
EDL	01:57:13,600	01:57:14,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battle Cruisers
EDL	01:57:14,880	01:57:19,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And entice them past your submarines are into your mind field
EDL	01:57:19,232	01:57:24,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or into an area where they think they can Feast on some of your light forces and then pounce on them with your big fat
EDL	01:57:25,888	01:57:27,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But that's what sheer plan
EDL	01:57:27,168	01:57:27,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Things to do
EDL	01:57:27,936	01:57:30,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Three sets out all these forces
EDL	01:57:30,240	01:57:31,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Appears this little ambush
EDL	01:57:32,032	01:57:33,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And what he doesn't know
EDL	01:57:33,824	01:57:35,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is it the British as we said
EDL	01:57:36,128	01:57:38,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are reading all these Naval communication
EDL	01:57:38,688	01:57:41,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are the British the greatest cryptographers on the planet
EDL	01:57:41,760	01:57:43,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or is that just the 20th century sort of
EDL	01:57:44,320	01:57:45,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Coloring my view
EDL	01:57:45,856	01:57:52,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because boy with a great the 20 Century in the second world war they will famously be reading all the German Enigma traffic among other things
EDL	01:57:52,512	01:57:56,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this war in the first couple of months of German Naval codes fall into their hands
EDL	01:57:57,376	01:57:59,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And while they may not be
EDL	01:57:59,424	01:58:01,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Deciphering every single message
EDL	01:58:01,472	01:58:02,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Winning Tire
EDL	01:58:02,752	01:58:06,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	German high seas Fleet as it's called hundred ships about
EDL	01:58:06,592	01:58:10,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Decides to weigh anchor and go out in a looking to play in the North Sea
EDL	01:58:10,944	01:58:14,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British know about that Dobby big Communications bikes and everything
EDL	01:58:14,272	01:58:16,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So when she decides to sit this ambush
EDL	01:58:16,832	01:58:21,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British reading the naval codes tell the fleet guess what the Germans are out there
EDL	01:58:21,696	01:58:27,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they don't know that we know they're out there and so the British Grand Fleet things okay now we have the advantage we will
EDL	01:58:28,352	01:58:29,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Crap
EDL	01:58:29,120	01:58:29,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Trappers
EDL	01:58:30,656	01:58:33,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And so the British Grand Fleet which is like 28
EDL	01:58:34,240	01:58:40,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know super dreadnoughts and dreadknots I mean it's the biggest Fleet in the world it's the most powerful Fleet in world history up to this
EDL	01:58:40,640	01:58:41,408	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	West Point
EDL	01:58:41,408	01:58:44,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And in terms of size and tonnage it may be the biggest feet ever
EDL	01:58:45,248	01:58:50,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It weighs anchor it starts making its way to where this Ambush point is
EDL	01:58:50,880	01:58:55,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it leaves so early by the way because it's got all this Advanced information
EDL	01:58:55,232	01:59:00,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But it totally screws up a lot of Admiral shares Ambush cuz his forces and who had these submarines that were going to be
EDL	01:59:00,864	01:59:03,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Outside the British ports and they could shoot at the
EDL	01:59:03,936	01:59:06,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	British ships as they left the harbor none of that stuff ready
EDL	01:59:07,264	01:59:11,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And so the the British ships make their way to the Rendezvous point where the with the Germans
EDL	01:59:12,128	01:59:15,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you're setting up another Trafalgar he I mean if the British
EDL	01:59:16,736	01:59:18,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Emerges
EDL	01:59:18,272	01:59:23,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Interview and catches the German Fleet there you could sink half of it before they get away
EDL	01:59:24,160	01:59:24,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then
EDL	01:59:25,440	01:59:26,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Murphy's Law
EDL	01:59:27,232	01:59:30,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Joins the battle movies not take Center Stage
EDL	01:59:30,048	01:59:33,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this encounter by the way which would have made a great dress rehearsal
EDL	01:59:34,400	01:59:36,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Early 20th century Naval Warfare
EDL	01:59:36,960	01:59:39,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unfortunately it's opening night
EDL	01:59:39,776	01:59:40,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you know
EDL	01:59:40,800	01:59:47,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You have troubles on opening night with all of the Loose Ends that haven't been fixed yet imagine instead of opening night you're doing the dress rehearsal
EDL	01:59:47,200	01:59:52,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And yet you have 250 ships in about 15 square miles when these things come together mean
EDL	01:59:52,832	01:59:59,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Things that can go wrong and do go wrong effect this battle mightily and it's a good argument for why these apples
EDL	01:59:59,232	02:00:00,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Those are so cautious they know this
EDL	02:00:02,048	02:00:04,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Murphy's Law intervenes while the British
EDL	02:00:04,352	02:00:10,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are about to pounce on the German because of British send a message back to their intelligence service one of the confirmation of this or that
EDL	02:00:10,752	02:00:16,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Any intelligent people reading the German Naval codes tell them that they made a mistake earlier
EDL	02:00:16,896	02:00:21,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They said oh yeah the German fleets not at Sea like we thought they're still safely in Port don't worry about it
EDL	02:00:22,784	02:00:28,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So now these Admirals who 5 minutes ago knew where the German fleet was and we're ready to pounce on it
EDL	02:00:28,416	02:00:29,952	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Don't know they're there anymore
EDL	02:00:30,720	02:00:31,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But of course
EDL	02:00:32,000	02:00:32,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They are
EDL	02:00:33,536	02:00:36,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And so now we have both main fleets
EDL	02:00:37,120	02:00:39,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Close to each other in the North Sea
EDL	02:00:39,936	02:00:42,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	None of them aware of the other's existence
EDL	02:00:45,568	02:00:48,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So the rhythm of this battle of Jutland
EDL	02:00:48,128	02:00:50,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is wonderful starts off as a trap
EDL	02:00:50,176	02:00:55,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Flips into a counter trap and now it is serendipitously morphed into
EDL	02:00:55,296	02:00:56,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An encounter battle
EDL	02:00:57,088	02:00:58,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that's how it get started
EDL	02:01:00,160	02:01:02,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	German light forces on one side of the horizon
EDL	02:01:02,720	02:01:05,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	British light forces on the other side of the horizon
EDL	02:01:05,024	02:01:07,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Spot a civilian
EDL	02:01:07,328	02:01:08,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Trawler
EDL	02:01:08,352	02:01:14,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Between the two of them they can't see each other cuz they're so far away the curvature of the earth limit their site but they can both see the trawler
EDL	02:01:14,496	02:01:15,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bud light units
EDL	02:01:15,520	02:01:21,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unit conversion the trolley to investigate it discover each other start shooting and send messages back to the main Fleet saying guess what
EDL	02:01:21,920	02:01:23,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I found over here on the other side of the horizon
EDL	02:01:24,480	02:01:26,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The enemy Fleet right
EDL	02:01:27,552	02:01:30,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This creates like a war Vortex were all these
EDL	02:01:30,880	02:01:33,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Naval forces start converging on this area
EDL	02:01:33,696	02:01:35,744	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ships that arrived first
EDL	02:01:36,256	02:01:36,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are the battle
EDL	02:01:38,304	02:01:41,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is an interesting side of the story because the battlecruisers
EDL	02:01:41,632	02:01:43,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are experiencing a test right now
EDL	02:01:44,448	02:01:48,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's the test of whether or not the Admiral that backed this entire
EDL	02:01:48,800	02:01:50,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Design
EDL	02:01:50,080	02:01:51,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the decades before this.
EDL	02:01:52,384	02:01:53,408	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What correct about it
EDL	02:01:55,200	02:01:58,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is a theoretical argument until there's data
EDL	02:01:58,528	02:02:01,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There hasn't been a chance to have any data now we're going to have data
EDL	02:02:02,112	02:02:03,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are these ships viable
EDL	02:02:04,672	02:02:08,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But first of all you need to know what they are and battlecruiser is a hybrid design
EDL	02:02:08,768	02:02:10,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's supposed to combine
EDL	02:02:10,816	02:02:12,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The punching power of a battleship
EDL	02:02:13,376	02:02:14,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With the speed of a cruiser
EDL	02:02:15,680	02:02:17,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So if a battleship is like some
EDL	02:02:18,240	02:02:19,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Giant
EDL	02:02:19,008	02:02:19,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Lion
EDL	02:02:19,776	02:02:20,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For exam
EDL	02:02:20,800	02:02:21,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or tiger
EDL	02:02:22,336	02:02:24,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These battle Cruisers are more like panthers
EDL	02:02:25,920	02:02:30,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now this is going to be confusing because they are all named after like giant cats and so
EDL	02:02:30,528	02:02:36,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The flagship of this battle cruiser Squadron on the British side of the lion so don't get confused if I start talking about
EDL	02:02:36,160	02:02:36,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About the lion
EDL	02:02:38,208	02:02:39,744	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But that describes him pretty well
EDL	02:02:39,744	02:02:42,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The hypothetical problem here though
EDL	02:02:42,560	02:02:44,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is that you had to give up
EDL	02:02:44,352	02:02:45,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To get the speed of a cruiser
EDL	02:02:46,400	02:02:48,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You had to give up the armor of the battleship
EDL	02:02:49,472	02:02:51,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So what we have here is a
EDL	02:02:51,520	02:02:54,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ship with all the Striking power of a battleship
EDL	02:02:54,592	02:02:56,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But one that can't take
EDL	02:02:56,640	02:02:57,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A punch by a battle
EDL	02:02:58,688	02:02:59,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or
EDL	02:02:59,456	02:03:00,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Its counterparts
EDL	02:03:01,248	02:03:02,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another battle cruiser
EDL	02:03:03,808	02:03:08,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When this was pointed out before the war the Admirals who liked the battlecruiser concept
EDL	02:03:08,160	02:03:10,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Waived off this worry by saying don't worry
EDL	02:03:10,976	02:03:12,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Speed will be their armor
EDL	02:03:13,536	02:03:17,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that's where the argument is because nobody knows if speed will be there armor
EDL	02:03:18,400	02:03:23,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bees battlecruisers approach this battle at 26 or 27 not
EDL	02:03:23,008	02:03:23,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which is
EDL	02:03:24,032	02:03:28,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Amazingly fast worship their size there are six of them on the British side
EDL	02:03:28,640	02:03:31,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Five of them on the German side and when they meet
EDL	02:03:32,736	02:03:34,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They begin to open fire
EDL	02:03:34,784	02:03:37,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And only about like eight miles which is short
EDL	02:03:38,368	02:03:40,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British have the longer-range guns by the way
EDL	02:03:41,184	02:03:44,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But don't open fire first this becomes the first of many things
EDL	02:03:44,768	02:03:49,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That the British Admiral of these battle cruiser the guy named 80 will be critiqued about
EDL	02:03:50,144	02:03:51,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know after this battle
EDL	02:03:52,704	02:03:54,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The battle opens up in about
EDL	02:03:54,240	02:03:55,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	3:45 in the afternoon
EDL	02:03:56,288	02:03:57,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Visually
EDL	02:03:57,568	02:03:58,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It is hard to see
EDL	02:03:59,872	02:04:00,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The ships
EDL	02:04:00,896	02:04:07,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you actually see a picture of them at Full Tilt are smoking like they're on fire and when you have a bunch of them there
EDL	02:04:07,296	02:04:09,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Putting tons of this dark suit into the air
EDL	02:04:10,368	02:04:13,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Add to that the fact that were over by Denmark
EDL	02:04:13,184	02:04:14,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the North Sea
EDL	02:04:14,464	02:04:15,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's fog
EDL	02:04:15,488	02:04:18,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're squalls there's mist
EDL	02:04:18,304	02:04:21,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's rain is all kinds of things that inhibit
EDL	02:04:21,120	02:04:22,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The ability to see very well
EDL	02:04:22,656	02:04:24,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And sometimes one Fleet
EDL	02:04:24,960	02:04:30,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will be in a position where they see the other Fleet really well but the other Fleet doesn't see them and vice versa so the
EDL	02:04:30,592	02:04:33,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Part of being a good animal is trying to arrange your Fleet
EDL	02:04:33,152	02:04:39,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So that the other Fleet is highlighted against the horizon or in some way that makes them an easier Target and your Fleet is kind of a
EDL	02:04:39,552	02:04:40,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sheraton hard to hit
EDL	02:04:41,344	02:04:46,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But ships had not tried to shoot at each other and some of the ranges they're going to try to shoot at each other here
EDL	02:04:48,000	02:04:51,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Boonies battlecruiser start shooting at about 3:45
EDL	02:04:51,584	02:04:52,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British
EDL	02:04:52,608	02:04:53,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cute long
EDL	02:04:53,888	02:04:59,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Initially over the heads of the German ships the German ships are disconcertingly accurate
EDL	02:05:00,544	02:05:02,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They strike the battlecruiser Tiger
EDL	02:05:02,592	02:05:05,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like 6 times in quick succession with 11 inch shells
EDL	02:05:08,480	02:05:09,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Anaphora
EDL	02:05:10,272	02:05:11,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They strike the flagship
EDL	02:05:12,064	02:05:14,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The lion with Admiral baby on board
EDL	02:05:14,880	02:05:16,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The shells penetrate
EDL	02:05:16,928	02:05:17,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The terror
EDL	02:05:17,696	02:05:18,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which is the
EDL	02:05:18,720	02:05:20,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sort of armored bubbled
EDL	02:05:20,256	02:05:21,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That contains the big guns
EDL	02:05:22,048	02:05:26,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The turret either explodes or catches on fire and there are photographs by the way
EDL	02:05:26,912	02:05:30,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Moments in the Battle of Jutland are not great and I always imagined them
EDL	02:05:30,752	02:05:32,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Zoomed in and colorized
EDL	02:05:32,544	02:05:34,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But you can see the lion burning
EDL	02:05:35,360	02:05:36,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it looks bad
EDL	02:05:36,896	02:05:40,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Admiral Beatty didn't realize at the time how closely he came
EDL	02:05:41,504	02:05:43,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To being blown to Kingdom Come
EDL	02:05:43,808	02:05:45,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To find out later
EDL	02:05:45,088	02:05:45,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That
EDL	02:05:45,856	02:05:50,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A guy who was dying and who lost both his legs
EDL	02:05:50,208	02:05:52,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the line
EDL	02:05:52,256	02:05:56,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Save the ship by flooding the magazine the last order he gave was to
EDL	02:05:56,352	02:05:57,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Flood the whole area
EDL	02:05:57,888	02:05:58,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Where the
EDL	02:05:58,912	02:05:59,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Explosives
EDL	02:05:59,680	02:06:00,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To keep them from
EDL	02:06:00,704	02:06:01,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Blowing the ship
EDL	02:06:01,984	02:06:05,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now if Beatty was wondering what it would be like to see one of these
EDL	02:06:05,824	02:06:06,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Modern
EDL	02:06:06,848	02:06:08,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Amazing ships
EDL	02:06:08,384	02:06:09,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Explode
EDL	02:06:09,664	02:06:11,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He only had to wait about two minutes
EDL	02:06:11,968	02:06:13,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You actually look at the
EDL	02:06:13,248	02:06:16,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Moment-by-moment rundown of this battle and that's part of the fun of naval battle
EDL	02:06:17,088	02:06:18,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All these ships kept
EDL	02:06:18,624	02:06:19,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Very
EDL	02:06:19,648	02:06:26,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Descriptive and detailed logs about their movement Moment by Moment by moment they've reconstructed this entire battle
EDL	02:06:26,048	02:06:28,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From almost each individual ships viewpoint
EDL	02:06:28,864	02:06:33,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the part that strikes you when you read a rundown as how quickly everything is happening to
EDL	02:06:33,472	02:06:37,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Baby suffers this hit on his own turret like for 2 minutes later
EDL	02:06:37,568	02:06:38,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Thms in the figurative
EDL	02:06:39,360	02:06:42,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A somewhere in the 20000 tonnes
EDL	02:06:42,688	02:06:44,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A battle cruiser
EDL	02:06:44,480	02:06:45,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Explode
EDL	02:06:47,296	02:06:48,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Just explode in the moment
EDL	02:06:49,088	02:06:52,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's Churchill in the admiralty is nightmare come true
EDL	02:06:52,160	02:06:53,952	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a blink of an eye
EDL	02:06:53,952	02:07:00,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You have a towering Cloud reaching up like 1500 ft Witnesses say you could see

EDL	02:07:00,864	02:07:03,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tunnels in guns and everything shooting up
EDL	02:07:03,936	02:07:05,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Into the horizon
EDL	02:07:06,240	02:07:09,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And both sides German and British watch this happen together
EDL	02:07:11,872	02:07:15,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Out of the more than 1000 Sailors aboard the independable to

EDL	02:07:17,504	02:07:20,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's hard not to include an account by one of them
EDL	02:07:20,320	02:07:22,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I did not include an account of the Survivor
EDL	02:07:23,648	02:07:26,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm a ship whose magazine gets penetrated
EDL	02:07:26,720	02:07:33,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And explode with him on it I guess he was way up high in the top observational are these still call that a crow's nest he said

EDL	02:07:38,240	02:07:42,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And here's how he described the explosion of the HMS indefatigable
EDL	02:07:42,336	02:07:43,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	While he was on board
EDL	02:07:43,872	02:07:44,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quote
EDL	02:07:44,896	02:07:47,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There was a terrific explosion aboard the ship
EDL	02:07:47,200	02:07:48,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Magazine's went
EDL	02:07:48,736	02:07:51,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I saw the guns go up in the air just like matchsticks
EDL	02:07:51,552	02:07:52,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	12-inch guns
EDL	02:07:53,088	02:07:53,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bodies and everything
EDL	02:07:54,624	02:07:56,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	She was beginning to settle down
EDL	02:07:56,416	02:07:58,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Within half a minute the ship turned right over and she was gone
EDL	02:08:00,000	02:08:04,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I was 180 feet up and I was thrown well clear of the ship otherwise I would have been sucked under
EDL	02:08:04,864	02:08:06,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I was practically unconscious
EDL	02:08:06,656	02:08:07,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Turning over really
EDL	02:08:07,936	02:08:10,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	At Last I came on top of the water
EDL	02:08:10,240	02:08:13,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When I came up there was another fellow named Jimmy Green
EDL	02:08:13,056	02:08:14,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And we got a piece of wood
EDL	02:08:14,336	02:08:16,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He was on one end and I was on the other end
EDL	02:08:17,152	02:08:19,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A couple of minutes afterwards some shells came over
EDL	02:08:19,712	02:08:21,760	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Jim was minus his head
EDL	02:08:21,760	02:08:23,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So I was left on my lonesome
EDL	02:08:24,064	02:08:24,576	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	02:08:25,856	02:08:26,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now
EDL	02:08:27,648	02:08:29,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About 20 minutes after that
EDL	02:08:30,464	02:08:33,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The HMS Queen Mary another one of these battlecruiser
EDL	02:08:34,048	02:08:34,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Explode
EDL	02:08:35,328	02:08:39,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Same way I mean a little bit different minute she gets hit and then there's this pause and
EDL	02:08:39,424	02:08:41,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sailors are jumping into the water and then she explodes
EDL	02:08:42,752	02:08:49,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're accounts from Sailors who were in the water who said the sky was all of a sudden just filled with all this massively heavy debris
EDL	02:08:49,152	02:08:52,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was now falling down on them in the water
EDL	02:08:52,224	02:08:54,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're all diving into the water trying to
EDL	02:08:54,528	02:08:57,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Escape giant funnels and big metal objects falling on them
EDL	02:08:57,856	02:08:59,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And probably a lot of them didn't this guy
EDL	02:09:00,160	02:09:01,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Again more than a thousand
EDL	02:09:01,952	02:09:04,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'll be Sailors on board a small handful
EDL	02:09:04,768	02:09:05,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Rescued after
EDL	02:09:05,792	02:09:07,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Less than less than 25
EDL	02:09:08,608	02:09:09,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And at one point
EDL	02:09:10,144	02:09:14,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Admiral Beatty turns to a subordinate said there seemed to be something wrong with our bloody ships today
EDL	02:09:15,776	02:09:16,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Detroit
EDL	02:09:17,312	02:09:18,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're not passing
EDL	02:09:18,848	02:09:20,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The acid test the hypothesis
EDL	02:09:21,664	02:09:28,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That you know was the philosophical underpinnings of this entire class of Warships at least on the British side it
EDL	02:09:28,064	02:09:29,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Proven to be
EDL	02:09:29,088	02:09:29,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Floss
EDL	02:09:31,392	02:09:32,672	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They don't have enough
EDL	02:09:32,672	02:09:33,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Armor
EDL	02:09:33,952	02:09:36,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Speed is not turning out to be there armor
EDL	02:09:37,280	02:09:39,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when their Armor gets pierced
EDL	02:09:40,352	02:09:45,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Yeah the way they're handling this ammunition and the lack of flash protectors and some other things means
EDL	02:09:45,728	02:09:49,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The magazine is catching on fire exploding way too easily
EDL	02:09:49,568	02:09:53,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you can tell that it's happened too easily become a German side it's not happen
EDL	02:09:54,432	02:09:55,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They sacrificed
EDL	02:09:55,456	02:09:56,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In some other areas
EDL	02:09:56,736	02:09:57,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If their guns are smaller
EDL	02:09:58,272	02:09:59,296	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're a little slower
EDL	02:09:59,296	02:10:00,320	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In order to
EDL	02:10:00,320	02:10:04,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Slap some more armor over some of these vulnerable point and are not blowing up
EDL	02:10:07,488	02:10:09,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Again these Germans build ships like
EDL	02:10:09,792	02:10:11,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Mercedes and they're taking a pounding
EDL	02:10:13,120	02:10:14,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	While they are run
EDL	02:10:14,656	02:10:15,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Away
EDL	02:10:17,728	02:10:24,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's what you have to notice and what's happening at these battling of these ships are not stationary they're not anchored and staying in the same spot there
EDL	02:10:24,128	02:10:24,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All movie
EDL	02:10:25,152	02:10:27,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they're all moving in a specific Direction the
EDL	02:10:27,456	02:10:30,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	British are chasing the Germans and the Germans are moving away
EDL	02:10:31,040	02:10:37,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now if you were the British Admiral this makes perfect sense to you you've got the bigger ships right and then till they start explode
EDL	02:10:37,440	02:10:38,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Going around you you have more of them
EDL	02:10:38,976	02:10:42,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Besides that you have a bunch of big brand new the newest
EDL	02:10:42,560	02:10:45,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Most awesome battleships in the world are Queen Elizabeth class
EDL	02:10:45,888	02:10:47,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I've already mentioned
EDL	02:10:47,680	02:10:52,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Warspite Malaya Valiant all these famous ships that will all fight in the Second World War
EDL	02:10:52,544	02:10:58,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're Fresh Off The Docks 15 inch guns 30,000 tons 13 inch of armor end
EDL	02:10:58,432	02:11:00,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Baby's got them with him
EDL	02:11:01,248	02:11:05,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So you darn right these Germans are going to run away never mind that
EDL	02:11:05,088	02:11:08,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know I tried to communicate with those battleships using
EDL	02:11:08,672	02:11:09,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Flags
EDL	02:11:10,464	02:11:12,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Let me talk about Murphy's Law
EDL	02:11:12,512	02:11:14,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Interposing its will on this battle
EDL	02:11:15,072	02:11:17,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Part of it has to do with things that just looks so silly
EDL	02:11:17,888	02:11:19,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ships have radio
EDL	02:11:19,936	02:11:22,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sometimes these animals are not that cool about using
EDL	02:11:22,496	02:11:25,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sometimes it have problems by the way so sometimes they're blameless
EDL	02:11:25,312	02:11:28,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But a lot of times these animals are like the old
EDL	02:11:28,384	02:11:30,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Guy trying to use the computer
EDL	02:11:30,944	02:11:37,344	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And there's so much more comfortable with the way they were brought up in and the things that they did in the Maneuvers in peace
EDL	02:11:37,344	02:11:39,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the ways these the ships communicate
EDL	02:11:40,416	02:11:46,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is by running the orders of the Admiral up on a flagpole they have all these different flags and each one means something different so many ads
EDL	02:11:46,816	02:11:48,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I don't want to communicate
EDL	02:11:48,096	02:11:52,448	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know to the fleet his order they run a flag up the flagpole on his ship the flagship
EDL	02:11:52,960	02:11:57,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then every other ship is supposed to as they see it run up the same one and you get the message across
EDL	02:11:57,312	02:12:01,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But this is a method that was used a hundred years before
EDL	02:12:01,152	02:12:03,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Lord Nelson's time when they're fighting Napoleon
EDL	02:12:05,248	02:12:06,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It ranges
EDL	02:12:06,784	02:12:11,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That are exponentially shorter does that make sense exponentially shorter than the distances in this battle
EDL	02:12:12,160	02:12:14,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Went out to smoke and all these other things
EDL	02:12:14,464	02:12:17,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the peacetime training it seemed to work fine
EDL	02:12:17,536	02:12:19,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the rigors of combat
EDL	02:12:19,840	02:12:21,120	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's not working fine
EDL	02:12:21,120	02:12:24,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the big battleships don't see the flag change
EDL	02:12:25,472	02:12:29,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When Beatty tells him to do things and they're not here
EDL	02:12:29,312	02:12:30,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When this
EDL	02:12:30,080	02:12:36,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battle first half as they've been playing catch-up the whole bottle but now you know they're arriving on the scene and their shells are falling soda by the germ
EDL	02:12:36,480	02:12:37,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Herman's now
EDL	02:12:37,248	02:12:43,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British think they've got these German battlecruisers pin down even if you know you're losing a few of your battle Cruisers while you
EDL	02:12:43,648	02:12:44,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Chase them
EDL	02:12:44,672	02:12:47,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But what they don't know is the throwing battlecruisers
EDL	02:12:47,488	02:12:50,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are leading them into the mall
EDL	02:12:50,048	02:12:54,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The entire German Navy which is coming up from about 40 miles away moving towards them
EDL	02:12:55,936	02:12:56,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What started off
EDL	02:12:57,216	02:12:58,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As the German trap
EDL	02:12:58,752	02:13:00,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Slipped into the British counter trap
EDL	02:13:00,800	02:13:03,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Evolved and morphed into the encounter battle
EDL	02:13:03,872	02:13:05,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As now
EDL	02:13:05,152	02:13:06,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By almost
EDL	02:13:06,944	02:13:08,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Improvisational lock
EDL	02:13:09,504	02:13:10,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Become a German
EDL	02:13:11,296	02:13:11,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ambush
EDL	02:13:13,344	02:13:14,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If successful
EDL	02:13:15,136	02:13:17,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German Fleet could wipe out
EDL	02:13:17,696	02:13:20,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Four or five battlecruisers
EDL	02:13:20,512	02:13:22,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And four of the newest ships
EDL	02:13:22,816	02:13:24,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the British Navy
EDL	02:13:24,352	02:13:28,448	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It would be I'm sure Winston Churchill would say after I could speak for him here
EDL	02:13:28,448	02:13:29,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Catastrophe
EDL	02:13:30,240	02:13:32,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the Germans are on the verge of making it happen
EDL	02:13:34,336	02:13:35,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then
EDL	02:13:35,616	02:13:37,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A light Cruiser
EDL	02:13:37,920	02:13:39,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Scouting For the British
EDL	02:13:39,968	02:13:42,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	See the entire German Fleet
EDL	02:13:42,784	02:13:43,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the horizon
EDL	02:13:44,320	02:13:49,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And radios the message back to Admiral Beatty in the grand Fleet under Admiral jellicoe farther away
EDL	02:13:49,952	02:13:53,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And baby sees those Germans very quickly to with the naked eye
EDL	02:13:54,560	02:14:00,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The first thing he does when he realizes he's been baited into this trap is turn his battlecruisers 108
EDL	02:14:00,960	02:14:03,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	80 degrees in the other direction and start
EDL	02:14:03,008	02:14:04,032	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Booking out of there
EDL	02:14:05,312	02:14:06,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Once again
EDL	02:14:06,848	02:14:07,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Annie's law
EDL	02:14:07,616	02:14:09,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Say that many times in this battle if I
EDL	02:14:09,664	02:14:16,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Go to deeply into it once again he runs up the flag sang turn around and the big battleships the brand new ones.
EDL	02:14:16,064	02:14:22,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I don't see it and they will end up exposed out there to the entire German Fleet for a while taking a pounding and dishing
EDL	02:14:22,464	02:14:24,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One out to it should be pointed out
EDL	02:14:25,024	02:14:25,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:14:25,792	02:14:29,888	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What Admiral Beatty has done by turning 180 degrees away
EDL	02:14:29,888	02:14:30,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is

EDL	02:14:33,216	02:14:34,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the Germans are following
EDL	02:14:35,264	02:14:38,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And baby is running back towards his big
EDL	02:14:38,336	02:14:43,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fleetwood just coming up from also about 40 miles away so now he's flipped the Ambush once again
EDL	02:14:43,968	02:14:50,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And now the Germans are heading toward the only Fleet that is still invisible on this Naval Base
EDL	02:14:50,368	02:14:51,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battlefield to anyone
EDL	02:14:52,416	02:14:53,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans don't know that
EDL	02:14:53,696	02:14:54,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Does the British Grand Fleet
EDL	02:14:58,048	02:15:00,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But now the British Grand Fleet nose
EDL	02:15:00,096	02:15:00,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the Germans are
EDL	02:15:02,144	02:15:03,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An admiral Jellico
EDL	02:15:03,680	02:15:09,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In-N-Out in a very brave move them he's operating without enough information once again I'm real baby gets blamed for not
EDL	02:15:09,312	02:15:11,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Giving him your good positional information or what not
EDL	02:15:11,872	02:15:14,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A lot of This falls into the category of
EDL	02:15:14,432	02:15:18,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a dress rehearsal of these guys a lot of their errors are the kind of things they would have corrected
EDL	02:15:19,296	02:15:21,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If they had a chance to practice it in
EDL	02:15:21,856	02:15:23,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Combat situations
EDL	02:15:23,904	02:15:30,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Unfortunately these are a lot of you know you wouldn't call them rookie mistake but but you would correct these before the next battle nonetheless
EDL	02:15:30,560	02:15:32,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Jellico takes a chance
EDL	02:15:32,096	02:15:32,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Deploys
EDL	02:15:33,376	02:15:36,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The entire British Grand Fleet with chinos
EDL	02:15:36,704	02:15:37,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	More than a hundred ships over
EDL	02:15:38,496	02:15:40,800	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1520 square miles of ocean
EDL	02:15:40,800	02:15:42,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It takes 15 to 20 min
EDL	02:15:42,336	02:15:43,872	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's how well-trained this weed is
EDL	02:15:44,384	02:15:45,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He deploys the whole thing
EDL	02:15:45,920	02:15:50,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he's waiting for the Germans to arrive in the Germans are now in the Mist
EDL	02:15:50,528	02:15:55,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Write this battlefields marry Misty and you will you run through fog Banks you won't see things for a while
EDL	02:15:55,392	02:15:57,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the Germans can't see what's going on
EDL	02:15:58,208	02:16:01,792	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And famously Admiral hipper who's the German Admiral in charge of the battlecruiser

EDL	02:16:03,584	02:16:08,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Admiral Scheer the head of the entire German Navy who's with the German Fleet here
EDL	02:16:08,960	02:16:11,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he famously looks off in the Mist until sheer
EDL	02:16:13,056	02:16:14,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Something lurks in that soup
EDL	02:16:14,592	02:16:17,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We would do well not to thrust into it too deeply
EDL	02:16:18,432	02:16:18,944	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Too late
EDL	02:16:20,736	02:16:22,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The first thing that happens is
EDL	02:16:22,528	02:16:26,880	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is the German start taking some fire and they don't know from where big guns
EDL	02:16:26,880	02:16:29,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then all of a sudden the Mist parts for a second
EDL	02:16:29,696	02:16:32,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's a another British battlecruiser
EDL	02:16:33,792	02:16:34,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The invincibles
EDL	02:16:35,584	02:16:39,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And as soon as the Mist Parts in the Invincible becomes clear
EDL	02:16:39,424	02:16:42,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It doesn't take 90 seconds before big German guns
EDL	02:16:42,752	02:16:49,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are opening fire the shells pouring down on the Invincible and like the other two battlecruisers the
EDL	02:16:49,152	02:16:49,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Vincible explode
EDL	02:16:51,712	02:16:54,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So if anybody has forgotten in the intervening
EDL	02:16:54,784	02:17:01,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know an hour or two since the earlier battlecruisers exploded that this design is proving to be someone
EDL	02:17:01,184	02:17:01,952	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What flawed
EDL	02:17:01,952	02:17:06,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The explosion of the Invincible before the two main fleets Collide is a
EDL	02:17:06,304	02:17:07,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Historical reminder
EDL	02:17:08,864	02:17:10,144	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless it's only
EDL	02:17:10,144	02:17:12,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Soon after that the Germans emerge from the Mist
EDL	02:17:13,472	02:17:14,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Defined
EDL	02:17:14,752	02:17:17,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The entire deployed British Fleet
EDL	02:17:18,080	02:17:18,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Waiting
EDL	02:17:18,848	02:17:22,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For the men like a crescent around the Horizon and Shear says
EDL	02:17:22,944	02:17:28,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The minute that they can see what's happening the entire Horizon erupts in a sheet of flame
EDL	02:17:28,576	02:17:34,464	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Bishops are long way from each other almost invisible to the naked eye smudges up against the horizon
EDL	02:17:34,464	02:17:37,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You see like the smoke of all the ships
EDL	02:17:37,536	02:17:43,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then you see like the flash of the guns and just like lightning and thunder where you see the lightning and then there's this.
EDL	02:17:43,936	02:17:45,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Play in the Thunder ride
EDL	02:17:45,216	02:17:47,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Same thing you see this Flash and it's
EDL	02:17:47,520	02:17:48,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Silent
EDL	02:17:48,288	02:17:51,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then boom the boom hit you after the shells of already passed over
EDL	02:17:53,408	02:17:59,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know there are destroyers in these battle giving the talk about all the light ships running around you know sooner parrying and like
EDL	02:17:59,808	02:18:00,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A bunch of little gnats
EDL	02:18:00,832	02:18:02,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Between the battle Fleet
EDL	02:18:02,112	02:18:05,952	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And these destroyers sometimes describe what it's like when he's giant shells
EDL	02:18:06,464	02:18:09,280	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pass over their heads and they say they sound like a locomotive
EDL	02:18:09,792	02:18:12,352	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When they Screech over your little ships head
EDL	02:18:12,864	02:18:16,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But when they fall in front of your little ship you're like your little Destroyer
EDL	02:18:16,960	02:18:19,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They raised geysers of water
EDL	02:18:19,776	02:18:24,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sometimes 500 sometimes 200 feet up into the air and it's composed of
EDL	02:18:24,128	02:18:25,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tons of liquid
EDL	02:18:25,920	02:18:29,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which then falls back down to earth in these destroyers these little ships
EDL	02:18:29,760	02:18:32,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are sometimes beaten up pretty severely by all this water
EDL	02:18:32,832	02:18:35,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Smashing back down into them some people are
EDL	02:18:35,136	02:18:37,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Splashed overboard and all these kinds of
EDL	02:18:39,232	02:18:40,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:18:40,512	02:18:46,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Admiral jellicoe has performed a famous Naval maneuver that you never want to be on the receiving end of Paul Crossing
EDL	02:18:46,912	02:18:48,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The tea where he's formed
EDL	02:18:48,704	02:18:52,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The top crossbar the tea and poor Sheeran the Germans form
EDL	02:18:54,336	02:18:58,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a vertical line of the T in every one of the British ships
EDL	02:18:58,176	02:19:01,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can fire on the German ships individually is they
EDL	02:19:01,504	02:19:03,808	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Come to the front of the line it's a disaster
EDL	02:19:03,808	02:19:09,440	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Very quickly she ever gets hit with more than 22 heavy shells fast and within 10 minutes she or has
EDL	02:19:09,952	02:19:10,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quite
EDL	02:19:10,720	02:19:11,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tactically
EDL	02:19:12,000	02:19:16,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Adroitly by the way turned his Fleet around and disappeared back into the Mist
EDL	02:19:17,120	02:19:19,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And once again without radar and all that kind of stuff
EDL	02:19:19,680	02:19:26,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A hard to you know where he is at that point he sends out a bunch of light units in destroyers and what not to cover his Escape so the
EDL	02:19:26,080	02:19:29,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British can't just run after the midnight run into a bunch of torpedoes in mines and stuff
EDL	02:19:30,944	02:19:32,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An inexplicably not to
EDL	02:19:33,248	02:19:37,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How long after the she arrives back into visual range and Little People fire again
EDL	02:19:39,136	02:19:45,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ashera escapes again cuz he got his T crossed for a second time in one battle which is almost unheard of it shows your jellicoe
EDL	02:19:45,536	02:19:46,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Cuz pretty darn good Abril
EDL	02:19:47,072	02:19:49,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then there's a little night action between the light units
EDL	02:19:49,888	02:19:52,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What about this time Admiral shares had enough
EDL	02:19:52,704	02:19:55,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You get your T crossed twice in one day
EDL	02:19:55,520	02:19:57,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's time to call it a battle
EDL	02:19:57,312	02:19:58,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ed Sheeran the Germans manage
EDL	02:19:59,360	02:20:00,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To limp home
EDL	02:20:02,176	02:20:05,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When all is said and done the British lose three battle Cruisers
EDL	02:20:05,248	02:20:06,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Three armored Cruisers
EDL	02:20:06,784	02:20:08,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	N8 Destroyers
EDL	02:20:08,576	02:20:10,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	While one German battle cruiser
EDL	02:20:10,624	02:20:15,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1 pre Dreadnought Battleship for light Cruisers in 5 destroyers are sent to the body
EDL	02:20:16,768	02:20:18,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The casualties at Jutland
EDL	02:20:18,816	02:20:22,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are not significant they don't hurt either Navy badly
EDL	02:20:23,168	02:20:25,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British learn their lesson about the battlecruiser design
EDL	02:20:26,240	02:20:27,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the Germans are humbled
EDL	02:20:28,544	02:20:34,176	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know they don't come out again in strength mean if it'll be a little encounter here in a little try there but but this is it
EDL	02:20:34,944	02:20:36,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They gave it an attempt
EDL	02:20:36,992	02:20:37,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	02:20:38,016	02:20:40,064	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They seemed permanently shaking
EDL	02:20:41,856	02:20:42,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The German service
EDL	02:20:43,392	02:20:46,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will not perform another militarily significant

EDL	02:21:16,928	02:21:20,512	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	War on this scale is like when it becomes

EDL	02:21:32,544	02:21:36,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's been sucking up more and more of the energy of these
EDL	02:21:36,128	02:21:38,432	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nation states are involved in the conflict
EDL	02:21:38,944	02:21:40,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's very unlike the way most wars

EDL	02:21:53,792	02:21:55,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This war is different
EDL	02:21:56,352	02:21:57,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	First of all it's life or death

EDL	02:22:06,592	02:22:08,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Have the Germans call this material slot

EDL	02:22:26,304	02:22:28,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Came into use during World War 1
EDL	02:22:28,608	02:22:32,960	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the role of Munitions workers in the civilian production more generally
EDL	02:22:32,960	02:22:36,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was becoming as important to Victory of the soldiers in the trenches
EDL	02:22:36,800	02:22:39,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Without a constant flow of supplies
EDL	02:22:39,104	02:22:41,664	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Equal to the vast consumption at the front
EDL	02:22:41,664	02:22:43,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The soldiers would soon be helpless
EDL	02:22:43,712	02:22:50,112	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And since the mobilization of so huge and number of men left vast gaps in the normal Workforce

EDL	02:23:25,440	02:23:26,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was diverted into the war effort

EDL	02:23:54,624	02:23:56,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And I think about all these skills

EDL	02:23:59,232	02:24:03,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Above and beyond what you would think of is a normal generals

EDL	02:24:03,840	02:24:07,424	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you saw this in earlier Wars as famous stories of General Sherman
EDL	02:24:07,424	02:24:10,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the Civil War in the United States being

EDL	02:24:20,480	02:24:22,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Things about logistics
EDL	02:24:22,016	02:24:23,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stuff like that
EDL	02:24:23,040	02:24:25,088	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But by 1916
EDL	02:24:25,088	02:24:27,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A guy like Hague
EDL	02:24:27,136	02:24:29,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A Cavalry commander looks like he would be
EDL	02:24:29,696	02:24:30,976	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Totally out of his element

EDL	02:24:33,280	02:24:36,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Production needs of warfare as indeed he was

EDL	02:24:43,520	02:24:45,568	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know what played a lot of those in my time
EDL	02:24:46,592	02:24:48,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And I got assigned
EDL	02:24:48,640	02:24:51,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because I don't think I would take Germany if I had a choice of
EDL	02:24:51,968	02:24:58,368	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On which side of the war game Germany I command play Germany in this war game and I'm fall

EDL	02:24:59,904	02:25:06,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know the estimates are especially during this time. If you include the colonial subjects of the of the power
EDL	02:25:06,304	02:25:08,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hours in Europe during this time.
EDL	02:25:08,096	02:25:13,984	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	My enemies in this war if I'm falkenhayn have 750 million people
EDL	02:25:14,496	02:25:15,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They can call on
EDL	02:25:16,288	02:25:18,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know for their value in their effort and
EDL	02:25:19,104	02:25:20,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In some cases their lives
EDL	02:25:20,640	02:25:23,712	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	My side of the alliance has about a hundred and fifty
EDL	02:25:23,712	02:25:24,224	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	50 million
EDL	02:25:25,248	02:25:31,392	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	My enemies have the greatest Fleet in the world and I just learned at the Battle of Jutland that my Navy can't come anywhere near touching them
EDL	02:25:33,952	02:25:36,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they shut down all of my overseas trade
EDL	02:25:37,536	02:25:40,864	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So fine General falkenhayn already I'm sitting here going
EDL	02:25:40,864	02:25:41,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wow
EDL	02:25:42,144	02:25:48,544	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now you look at the lineup in terms of the kind of countries in each Alliance which of the British and the French in the Russian
EDL	02:25:48,544	02:25:49,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can just a three big guys

EDL	02:25:57,248	02:25:59,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Biggest power all three together
EDL	02:25:59,552	02:26:03,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wow and then a bunch of other countries like Italy and and smaller powers
EDL	02:26:03,904	02:26:07,232	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's a very powerful force who do I have on my side

EDL	02:26:15,680	02:26:17,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Start asking me for help all the time
EDL	02:26:17,472	02:26:18,496	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Vulcan 900
EDL	02:26:18,496	02:26:21,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're putting on a pretty brave fight they've managed to
EDL	02:26:21,056	02:26:22,592	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Kick the British French
EDL	02:26:22,592	02:26:24,128	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	South African Indians
EDL	02:26:24,128	02:26:26,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	New zealanders and Australian out of Gallipoli
EDL	02:26:26,688	02:26:28,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In January 1916
EDL	02:26:29,504	02:26:30,784	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not unexpected
EDL	02:26:31,296	02:26:37,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They managed to beat the British forces mostly Indian troops in a place called coot in modern-day Iraq

EDL	02:26:40,256	02:26:41,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	02:26:41,024	02:26:43,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Took them on a Death March but it really
EDL	02:26:43,072	02:26:45,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Doesn't impact falkenhayn very much one way or the other
EDL	02:26:45,632	02:26:52,032	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's just nice for him to know that the Turks are winning as opposed to losing because they are losing against the Russians but it's a mixed bag
EDL	02:26:52,032	02:26:53,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Remember the Turks are tough
EDL	02:26:53,824	02:26:55,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But they are
EDL	02:26:55,104	02:26:59,200	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not quite a twentieth-century army so those are all gravy

EDL	02:27:11,232	02:27:17,632	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then they go do what they want anyway and then they screw up cuz they didn't follow your advice and then they come to you and so will you be able to
EDL	02:27:17,632	02:27:20,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Without your falkenhayn there pain in the rear

EDL	02:27:34,784	02:27:39,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Anyway they may not have been a country in 1920 even if there hadn't been a first World War

EDL	02:30:00,448	02:30:01,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hard to know
EDL	02:30:01,984	02:30:07,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the worst is the fact that the left hand and the right hand don't know what each other were doing in the Central Powers

EDL	02:30:13,504	02:30:15,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's a handicap
EDL	02:30:15,552	02:30:16,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Especially when

EDL	02:30:57,280	02:30:59,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As though the Russians were willing to throw tons

EDL	02:31:01,632	02:31:07,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	At the Germans simply to scare them enough so that they would pull some units out of her down and take some pressure off the French
EDL	02:31:08,032	02:31:09,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was so inept
EDL	02:31:09,824	02:31:13,920	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That some of the casualties of Russian soldiers suffered were because of
EDL	02:31:13,920	02:31:16,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Being shelled by their own sides artillery which is always a tree
EDL	02:31:18,272	02:31:19,040	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And

EDL	02:31:25,696	02:31:31,840	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bought a bunch of people that just you know where out there in the cold without the proper stuff I mean the Russian Logistics are
EDL	02:31:31,840	02:31:34,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Traditionally pretty horrible especially in this.
EDL	02:31:35,168	02:31:36,448	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It shows you the nature
EDL	02:31:36,960	02:31:37,728	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of
EDL	02:31:37,728	02:31:38,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An operation

EDL	02:31:45,664	02:31:47,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	March 1916
EDL	02:31:47,968	02:31:50,016	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They don't handle it well again
EDL	02:31:51,296	02:31:53,600	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The worst part probably from the Russian respect
EDL	02:31:53,600	02:31:56,416	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That way they went to all that trouble and it didn't take any pressure off the
EDL	02:31:57,696	02:31:58,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Ever done
EDL	02:31:59,744	02:32:00,256	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The
EDL	02:32:00,768	02:32:03,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Follow-up effort though by the Russians
EDL	02:32:03,584	02:32:06,400	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On June 4th 1916
EDL	02:32:06,400	02:32:07,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will be handled
EDL	02:32:07,680	02:32:11,520	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Much better surprisingly well if you're a guy like falkenhayn
EDL	02:32:11,520	02:32:14,848	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you've written off with a lot of your other generals any

EDL	02:32:19,712	02:32:23,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On June 4th 1916 the Russians do something very significant
EDL	02:32:23,552	02:32:27,648	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Led by their unquestionably best General in the first World War
EDL	02:32:28,416	02:32:29,184	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A guy named
EDL	02:32:29,184	02:32:29,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Brusilov
EDL	02:32:31,488	02:32:34,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Weed mentioned in an earlier episode that the Russians
EDL	02:32:35,072	02:32:36,608	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Simply couldn't.
EDL	02:32:36,608	02:32:39,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I mean they weren't they were okay sometimes on the defense but they couldn't attack
EDL	02:32:39,936	02:32:40,704	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The problem
EDL	02:32:40,704	02:32:42,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is always the same they just have
EDL	02:32:42,752	02:32:45,312	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Such an old-fashioned not up to date
EDL	02:32:45,312	02:32:47,360	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Logistics system that the farther
EDL	02:32:47,872	02:32:53,504	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You moved away from where you started the harder it was to get the supplies necessary for a modern Army to run
EDL	02:32:54,272	02:32:55,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But where she loved
EDL	02:32:55,552	02:32:58,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is the most modern Commander the Russians have
EDL	02:32:59,136	02:33:04,768	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He's been learning from fighting the best army in the world the Germans all this time
EDL	02:33:04,768	02:33:06,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And even that was a Cavalry
EDL	02:33:06,304	02:33:09,376	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Commander and they have a reputation for always being sort of old-fashioned
EDL	02:33:09,376	02:33:10,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We're still out and braces
EDL	02:33:11,424	02:33:14,752	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The new systems out there in the new technology for example
EDL	02:33:14,752	02:33:19,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He does something almost no Russian army ever does in the first world war he uses aircraft
EDL	02:33:19,616	02:33:24,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To help as spotters in to locate positions behind the lines in for reconnaissance
EDL	02:33:25,248	02:33:26,272	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right there
EDL	02:33:26,272	02:33:30,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He's acting in a much more Modern Way than Russian armies do remember we talkin about an army
EDL	02:33:31,136	02:33:34,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That for the entire length of the first World War
EDL	02:33:34,720	02:33:38,048	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Will still be wearing cloth cap they never get
EDL	02:33:38,048	02:33:38,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Metal helmet
EDL	02:33:39,328	02:33:43,168	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	During the duration the first world war is a very old-fashioned fashioned Army
EDL	02:33:43,168	02:33:47,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Takes what he can do that's modern and uses it
EDL	02:33:49,056	02:33:52,384	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The launch is his famous offensive named after him
EDL	02:33:52,384	02:33:56,736	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On June 4th and he does so with a very modern artillery barrage intense but short
EDL	02:33:58,016	02:34:00,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He's used also to camouflage to
EDL	02:34:00,832	02:34:02,624	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hide his intentions even as far as
EDL	02:34:03,136	02:34:03,904	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Painting
EDL	02:34:04,416	02:34:06,208	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Fake trenches on the ground
EDL	02:34:06,208	02:34:08,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Behind his lines to confuse
EDL	02:34:08,512	02:34:10,816	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans in the austro-hungarians on the other side
EDL	02:34:13,632	02:34:14,912	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when he launches his attack
EDL	02:34:16,192	02:34:18,240	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He does so along
EDL	02:34:18,240	02:34:19,264	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	An enormous front
EDL	02:34:19,776	02:34:21,824	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Eastern Front different than the Western Front
EDL	02:34:21,824	02:34:23,616	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Disturbing this really constrained
EDL	02:34:23,616	02:34:29,248	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Small area which they can build a wall from side-to-side really easily it's a huge error
EDL	02:34:29,248	02:34:32,832	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So it's much more thinly defended in leprosy love does

EDL	02:37:09,248	02:37:10,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To let us not forget
EDL	02:37:10,528	02:37:16,928	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That this War began when a Slavic National assassinated the austro-hungarian air.

EDL	02:40:44,800	02:40:46,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The French still have Joffrey
EDL	02:40:46,336	02:40:47,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Crazily enough
EDL	02:40:47,616	02:40:48,640	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But
EDL	02:40:48,640	02:40:52,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know about reputation of the miracle of the Marne in 1914 only

EDL	02:40:54,784	02:40:55,552	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To go either
EDL	02:40:56,064	02:41:00,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the British in late 1950s actor John friends like we told you the last episode
EDL	02:41:00,160	02:41:02,720	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The guy who gets his gig is a guy named Douglas Haig
EDL	02:41:03,232	02:41:07,072	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you feel Marshall he's another one of these Cavalry Commanders
EDL	02:41:07,584	02:41:13,472	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's always weird we have a war Cavalry become something you keep off to the side and don't use cuz it just gets killed
EDL	02:41:13,472	02:41:15,776	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the horses are more important to move
EDL	02:41:15,776	02:41:16,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stop
EDL	02:41:16,800	02:41:18,336	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is crazily enough
EDL	02:41:18,336	02:41:20,896	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And we haven't talked enough about this and will get to it
EDL	02:41:20,896	02:41:22,688	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Horses are everywhere there's
EDL	02:41:22,688	02:41:24,480	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Millions of them in this war
EDL	02:41:24,992	02:41:26,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And your casualties too by the way
EDL	02:41:27,552	02:41:32,160	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But all these Cavalry commanders French Hague all these guys have these visions that we're going to
EDL	02:41:32,160	02:41:37,024	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Break the German line somewhere in the Cavalry going to go rushing in the hole we create
EDL	02:41:37,024	02:41:38,304	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm going to the back and it's

EDL	02:43:26,336	02:43:27,104	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Got
EDL	02:43:27,104	02:43:29,152	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And one real feather in his cap and that's
EDL	02:43:29,152	02:43:32,992	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Those armies that he helped recruit in 1914 and 1915 and that he is

EDL	02:43:42,208	02:43:47,328	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Really make use of their patriotic contribution did people want to win the war let's put them in a position where they can do that
EDL	02:43:47,840	02:43:50,656	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He done an admirable job of that in about three weeks before
EDL	02:43:51,168	02:43:51,680	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Those
EDL	02:43:52,192	02:43:56,288	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Soldiers known sometimes as the Kitchener armies are the Kitchener divisions after him

EDL	02:43:58,592	02:44:03,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That was probably most responsible for seeing that they weren't used up already in the first place
EDL	02:44:03,968	02:44:06,528	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Kitchener dies about 3 weeks before his Legions

EDL	02:44:13,696	02:44:16,000	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Has any one of those big modern deaths
EDL	02:44:16,000	02:44:17,536	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So the same as a

EDL	02:45:11,808	02:45:13,856	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's one of the great conspiracy
EDL	02:45:13,856	02:45:19,488	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The fountainheads to come out of the first world war nonetheless it meant the three weeks later when kitchener's you know
EDL	02:45:20,000	02:45:22,560	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Parentally preserved armies are finally

EDL	02:45:26,656	02:45:27,936	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The guy who is
EDL	02:45:27,936	02:45:29,216	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is Douglas Haig the new guy
EDL	02:45:30,240	02:45:33,056	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now known to some in history as
EDL	02:45:33,568	02:45:34,080	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The butcher
EDL	02:45:34,848	02:45:39,456	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So that should give you an idea of what we're about to get into here on a wide variety
EDL	02:45:39,456	02:45:39,968	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The fronts
EDL	02:45:40,992	02:45:47,136	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This battle is won the Sir Douglas Haig has been preparing for since the year before
EDL	02:45:48,160	02:45:49,696	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the French told him
EDL	02:45:49,696	02:45:56,096	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They were in danger of disintegrating he's moving up something he's been working on for a while now at everyone

EDL	02:45:58,144	02:46:00,192	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The big 1916 offensive
EDL	02:46:00,192	02:46:03,008	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is no secret haakenson newspapers basic
EDL	02:46:03,519	02:46:07,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Remix that we find out all the ways that everybody knew this was coming
EDL	02:46:07,615	02:46:13,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It makes you wonder right again how intelligent it is to be launching something that everybody knows it's coming but
EDL	02:46:13,247	02:46:15,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It couldn't really be helped if you're going to fight

EDL	02:46:21,183	02:46:24,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the Western Front with with a British line ends in the French line begins
EDL	02:46:25,279	02:46:30,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That's where they're going to hold this joint defensive maybe for the sole reason that that's where both armies
EDL	02:46:31,679	02:46:33,215	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That would be a really silly reason
EDL	02:46:33,727	02:46:34,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	2 attack
EDL	02:46:35,007	02:46:40,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The greatest defenses on the Western Front which of the greatest defenses ever in the world
EDL	02:46:40,639	02:46:43,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right now these are defenses that make the old Roman

EDL	02:46:44,735	02:46:48,063	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that you would cross Europe with these giant wall I mean

EDL	02:48:43,519	02:48:44,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Bombarding it with art
EDL	02:48:46,079	02:48:47,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Start June 20
EDL	02:48:47,615	02:48:48,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	1916
EDL	02:48:50,431	02:48:51,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A lot of Art
EDL	02:48:52,735	02:48:57,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As a matter of fact the song becomes one of about four or five First World War battle
EDL	02:48:57,855	02:49:00,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They compete for like the Guinness Book of World Records
EDL	02:49:01,439	02:49:05,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For the biggest largest worst more intense most numerous you know
EDL	02:49:05,535	02:49:07,839	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Picture category artillery bombardment of the war
EDL	02:49:09,631	02:49:13,215	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Serafino's a history geek I would be arguing it with other history
EDL	02:49:13,215	02:49:16,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's always about criteria right are we talkin about the
EDL	02:49:16,287	02:49:17,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The largest number
EDL	02:49:17,055	02:49:17,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Rochelle's Foxboro
EDL	02:49:18,335	02:49:19,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Battle
EDL	02:49:19,103	02:49:20,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	4060 million at Verdun Maybe
EDL	02:49:21,151	02:49:24,735	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who are we talking about the most number of shells used in the initial part of the bat
EDL	02:49:25,247	02:49:30,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or the most number of she'll drop in the shortest. Of time or the smallest space I mean
EDL	02:49:30,111	02:49:36,255	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's literally a measurement of how many tons of shells fell on each square meter of these battle
EDL	02:49:36,255	02:49:37,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By the way if you use that
EDL	02:49:37,791	02:49:38,559	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As You Are
EDL	02:49:40,863	02:49:41,375	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Perdon
EDL	02:49:45,215	02:49:46,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless the fact that
EDL	02:49:46,495	02:49:48,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The song is in this argument
EDL	02:49:48,543	02:49:50,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Show you the level of artillery were talking about here
EDL	02:49:51,103	02:49:52,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when it opens up on the 24th
EDL	02:49:53,919	02:49:55,455	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's it's incredible
EDL	02:49:55,455	02:49:57,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When it's volume but the Germans laugh a lot
EDL	02:49:58,783	02:50:00,319	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Compartment
EDL	02:50:01,087	02:50:03,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the Germans are mostly underground Undercover
EDL	02:50:03,903	02:50:06,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And most of them are bent is once again
EDL	02:50:06,719	02:50:07,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Shrapnel shell
EDL	02:50:07,999	02:50:11,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sounds like a little teeny point doesn't it for about a battle to turn on
EDL	02:50:12,095	02:50:15,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But had those shells been high explosive instead or maybe even gas
EDL	02:50:16,447	02:50:20,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This battle may go another Direction and every story and brings up
EDL	02:50:20,287	02:50:21,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Shrapnel
EDL	02:50:21,311	02:50:22,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pretty much pointless
EDL	02:50:23,871	02:50:28,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's remember it's like a giant hand grenade or shotgun shell exploding in the air and all these little pellets
EDL	02:50:28,223	02:50:31,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a ground devastating to infantry out in the open but the Germans are in the open
EDL	02:50:33,343	02:50:34,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In addition
EDL	02:50:34,367	02:50:36,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The artillery is meant to do more than just kill German
EDL	02:50:37,695	02:50:39,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The artillery has to clear
EDL	02:50:39,743	02:50:40,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The battlefield
EDL	02:50:40,767	02:50:42,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the stuff that
EDL	02:50:42,047	02:50:43,327	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There is defenses
EDL	02:50:43,327	02:50:46,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So let the troops on the British I can actually get to the German Trench
EDL	02:50:47,423	02:50:48,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's full of barbed wire
EDL	02:50:49,215	02:50:50,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	No man's land
EDL	02:50:50,751	02:50:51,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another train
EDL	02:50:52,031	02:50:54,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another no man's land in another Trench
EDL	02:50:54,335	02:51:00,735	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Trenches are all going uphill and these no man's land areas besides being filled with concrete bunkers and
EDL	02:51:00,735	02:51:01,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Everything you told me about
EDL	02:51:01,503	02:51:03,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before The Killing Zone
EDL	02:51:03,039	02:51:05,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They have yards barbed wire
EDL	02:51:05,599	02:51:06,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sticking your finger
EDL	02:51:07,903	02:51:09,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Metaphysical empath
EDL	02:51:09,951	02:51:11,743	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It has to be overcome by The General
EDL	02:51:11,743	02:51:15,327	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The generals have figured out in their minds that an artillery barrage of this
EDL	02:51:15,839	02:51:20,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know caliber the amounts were talking about here in barbed wire will just explode into
EDL	02:51:20,959	02:51:23,775	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It will not be an impediment when the artillery barrage is over
EDL	02:51:24,287	02:51:25,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Except the shrapnel shell dontrel
EDL	02:51:29,151	02:51:30,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There was a benefit
EDL	02:51:30,687	02:51:31,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Artillery
EDL	02:51:32,735	02:51:34,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Recorded before Napoleon has the
EDL	02:51:34,271	02:51:35,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The great lion
EDL	02:51:35,039	02:51:35,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Comes in handy all the time
EDL	02:51:36,575	02:51:38,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Quantity has a quality all its own
EDL	02:51:38,879	02:51:41,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the sheer intensity this barrage
EDL	02:51:41,695	02:51:45,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Life began to have an effect on the Germans even though they were physically protected from being
EDL	02:51:45,535	02:51:46,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Do injured
EDL	02:51:47,327	02:51:48,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I began to play on them
EDL	02:51:48,863	02:51:49,375	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	First of all
EDL	02:51:49,887	02:51:52,959	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They know they got something really nasty awaiting them
EDL	02:51:52,959	02:51:53,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In their future
EDL	02:51:53,727	02:51:55,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You try to put yourself in their shoes
EDL	02:51:55,775	02:51:56,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Okay
EDL	02:51:56,543	02:51:59,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They know that when this artillery barrage is over
EDL	02:51:59,359	02:52:05,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The British are going to be on them they've been training for this moment for months right run up the stairs how quickly can you get
EDL	02:52:05,759	02:52:06,783	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Find the machine gun
EDL	02:52:06,783	02:52:08,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In time to stop the British from taking over your Trench
EDL	02:52:09,343	02:52:10,623	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So they're going to either
EDL	02:52:10,623	02:52:11,647	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Be killed
EDL	02:52:11,647	02:52:13,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Be grievously wounded
EDL	02:52:13,183	02:52:15,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	See your friend killed or wounded or happy
EDL	02:52:15,487	02:52:19,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The kill someone and they're going to have a really nasty day and they're very near future
EDL	02:52:19,583	02:52:20,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the meantime
EDL	02:52:20,863	02:52:24,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You going to have one of the greatest artillery barrage in history going on
EDL	02:52:24,447	02:52:25,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Around you

EDL	02:52:26,751	02:52:32,127	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who will be at this battlefield in about a month and can artillery barrage that is not as bad as this one
EDL	02:52:32,639	02:52:34,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He will compare it to the Roar of the ocean
EDL	02:52:36,223	02:52:38,783	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He will say that there are no individual sound
EDL	02:52:39,295	02:52:43,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He says he will it will achieve at times and last 4 hours A demented intense
EDL	02:52:44,927	02:52:47,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he says when it eventually calmed down
EDL	02:52:47,743	02:52:50,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Calm down to Mere drumfire
EDL	02:52:51,071	02:52:52,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which is you know the sound of
EDL	02:52:52,607	02:52:53,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of a drum roll
EDL	02:52:53,631	02:52:57,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What's how fast your children shelter dropping he says even when it's the drumroll you can't
EDL	02:52:57,471	02:52:59,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pick out any individual explosion
EDL	02:52:59,519	02:53:01,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's just one big loud sound

EDL	02:54:11,967	02:54:14,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So here's the biggest artillery barrage the British have ever launched
EDL	02:54:15,295	02:54:16,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They shoot off 2 million shells in node

EDL	02:54:26,815	02:54:30,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So you're two million shells in a week or two thousand
EDL	02:54:31,423	02:54:33,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Crazy the level of artillery we're going to see here
EDL	02:54:33,983	02:54:39,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A little bit Lowe's good commanders into this sense that it's going to accomplish so much more than it does

EDL	02:59:29,407	02:59:31,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To suffer the kind of casualties that some

EDL	02:59:50,655	02:59:51,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To take the German defense
EDL	02:59:53,983	02:59:55,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is where they find out
EDL	02:59:56,031	02:59:59,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That the assumptions made in the planning stages of this conflict
EDL	03:00:00,383	03:00:02,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Haven't come to pass the way the military

EDL	03:00:05,503	03:00:06,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And because of that

EDL	03:00:08,831	03:00:10,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the very first day

EDL	03:00:19,839	03:00:20,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In British history
EDL	03:00:20,863	03:00:22,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And now all of a sudden
EDL	03:00:22,143	03:00:23,935	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They can understand how the French belt
EDL	03:00:24,447	03:00:29,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On that August day in 1914 when they suffered 22,000 dead in an afternoon
EDL	03:00:30,847	03:00:33,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	These are Thoroughly Modern casualties in

EDL	03:00:36,479	03:00:38,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the finger start pointing media
EDL	03:00:39,039	03:00:39,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What the heck happened
EDL	03:00:41,599	03:00:42,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Generation of people who
EDL	03:00:42,879	03:00:44,159	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Felt this viscerally
EDL	03:00:44,159	03:00:48,511	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Have kept this debate going and it continues between historians even today
EDL	03:00:49,791	03:00:50,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What the hell
EDL	03:00:51,583	03:00:52,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who's responsible
EDL	03:00:53,887	03:00:58,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What happened to the Troops will they got out of the trenches only to find that in most areas
EDL	03:00:58,751	03:01:02,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The assumption that this artillery would Smash Up The Wire
EDL	03:01:02,591	03:01:04,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wasn't true when the wire was there
EDL	03:01:05,407	03:01:06,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was a physical in Panama
EDL	03:01:07,199	03:01:11,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In no-man's-land trapping troops in the open so they could be raped
EDL	03:01:11,807	03:01:15,647	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	By Machine Gun fire archery fire too but mainly machine-gun fire
EDL	03:01:15,647	03:01:19,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	From those Germans who were not as badly affected by the artillery either
EDL	03:01:19,999	03:01:21,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As the planners had assumed they would be
EDL	03:01:23,839	03:01:26,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Tens of thousands of British soldiers are being mowed down
EDL	03:01:26,655	03:01:28,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All the time one German
EDL	03:01:28,191	03:01:29,727	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the other side
EDL	03:01:29,727	03:01:30,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of this human trash
EDL	03:01:31,519	03:01:32,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I love the song on the first date
EDL	03:01:32,799	03:01:35,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is quoted Indian passing his book all the Kaiser's men
EDL	03:01:36,127	03:01:37,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he said quote
EDL	03:01:37,663	03:01:39,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Deleting wave
EDL	03:01:39,199	03:01:39,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A British troops
EDL	03:01:39,967	03:01:42,271	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Was now halfway across no-man's-land
EDL	03:01:42,783	03:01:45,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Get ready was passed along our front
EDL	03:01:45,343	03:01:50,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And heads appeared over each shell crater edge of final positions were taken up with the best view
EDL	03:01:50,463	03:01:52,511	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And machine guns mounted firmly in place
EDL	03:01:53,023	03:01:56,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A moment later when the first British line was within a hundred yards
EDL	03:01:56,351	03:02:00,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The rattle of Machine Gun and Rifle fire broke out along our whole line of shell hole
EDL	03:02:01,215	03:02:03,775	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Followed soon after by deadly accurate shellfire
EDL	03:02:04,543	03:02:07,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The advanced rapidly crumpled under this Halo shells and bullets
EDL	03:02:08,383	03:02:13,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	All along the line meant to be singing throwing up their arms and collapsing never to move again
EDL	03:02:14,015	03:02:17,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The extended line the badly shaken with many gaps
EDL	03:02:17,087	03:02:18,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now came on all the faster
EDL	03:02:19,391	03:02:25,535	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Instead of a leisurely walk they covered the ground in short rushes at the Double and within a few minutes the leading troops at Advance
EDL	03:02:26,047	03:02:28,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Two within a stone's throw of our front Trench
EDL	03:02:28,863	03:02:35,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Again and again the extended lines of British infantry broke against the German defense like waves against the cliff
EDL	03:02:35,007	03:02:36,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Only to be beaten back
EDL	03:02:36,799	03:02:42,431	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was an amazing spectacle of unexampled gallantry courage and Bulldog determination on both sides
EDL	03:02:43,967	03:02:44,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	03:02:45,503	03:02:47,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now those are the troops who made it through the wire
EDL	03:02:48,319	03:02:51,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There were places where gaps have been blown in The Wire
EDL	03:02:51,903	03:02:56,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The problem was that the troops would congregate at those gaps cuz they're the only way to the other side
EDL	03:02:56,767	03:03:02,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then get stuck in giant backup this as a small stream of troops made it through the corridor
EDL	03:03:02,399	03:03:08,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And those those backups in those Globs of soldiers just waiting for their chance to get through the corridor the wire would be mowed down
EDL	03:03:08,799	03:03:10,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I shall fire and machine gun
EDL	03:03:11,359	03:03:12,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This day
EDL	03:03:12,895	03:03:18,015	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Has so affected the British in fact it's their version of Verdun what would Verdun is to the French sole
EDL	03:03:18,015	03:03:19,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The song is to the British one
EDL	03:03:19,807	03:03:22,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it has divided historians ever since
EDL	03:03:22,367	03:03:25,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you can see normally calm and sedate
EDL	03:03:25,183	03:03:29,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Rather cold sometimes British historians lose their head over this subject
EDL	03:03:30,303	03:03:33,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	John Keegan who I've said is not my favorite
EDL	03:03:33,887	03:03:37,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the two World Wars I think are his strong point
EDL	03:03:37,471	03:03:40,287	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you can tell he's a guy who's hung out
EDL	03:03:40,287	03:03:42,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With some of the enlisted troops
EDL	03:03:42,079	03:03:44,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That were trapped that day at the song because
EDL	03:03:44,383	03:03:45,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There
EDL	03:03:45,663	03:03:47,455	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Continued anger and
EDL	03:03:47,967	03:03:51,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Incredulously about this whole thing has rubbed off on him and by the way
EDL	03:03:51,807	03:03:54,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If you were trapped there like a Sitting Duck
EDL	03:03:54,367	03:03:55,135	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On
EDL	03:03:55,135	03:03:58,975	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You don't open playing in No Man's Land watching your body's get blown to bits
EDL	03:03:58,975	03:04:02,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you're freaking out you would be thinking to who the hell put me here
EDL	03:04:02,047	03:04:05,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Who's responsible for this if I ever get out of this Heads Will Roll
EDL	03:04:05,631	03:04:06,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of course most of these
EDL	03:04:07,167	03:04:09,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	British troops at this battle or not of a

EDL	03:16:52,607	03:16:53,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Then came the winter
EDL	03:16:54,143	03:16:57,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Pouring down rain from the sky to clog the feet of men
EDL	03:16:57,471	03:16:59,519	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And drawing veils of mist
EDL	03:16:59,519	03:17:01,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before the Hawkeyes of their artillery
EDL	03:17:01,823	03:17:06,431	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The arena has used to happen in the Colosseum in those miniature Roman days

EDL	03:18:24,767	03:18:29,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Creates this introspective mood where all of a sudden they're focusing
EDL	03:18:29,631	03:18:32,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On subjects that people don't usually spend
EDL	03:18:32,703	03:18:37,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hour after hour day after day focusing on but it's right in front of the right if you have terminal

EDL	03:18:51,135	03:18:54,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But you'd spent a couple of months thinking intensely

EDL	03:18:55,743	03:19:00,607	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And death and the meaning of things and what you would have done differently in all these really heavy-duty thoughts
EDL	03:19:00,607	03:19:02,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But most people can only stand to

EDL	03:28:25,087	03:28:27,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when this happens every man in his trench
EDL	03:28:28,415	03:28:29,951	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Feels like he's going through
EDL	03:28:29,951	03:28:31,743	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm sort of a moral test
EDL	03:28:32,511	03:28:34,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And one man has it
EDL	03:28:34,047	03:28:34,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With flying colors
EDL	03:28:35,583	03:28:36,095	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Raised right
EDL	03:28:38,655	03:28:40,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the morning of the 27th
EDL	03:28:40,447	03:28:42,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Briar Rose from no man's land
EDL	03:28:42,751	03:28:47,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A wounded soldier of the Middlesex unit have recovered Consciousness after 2 days
EDL	03:28:47,615	03:28:49,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Delite close to the German wire
EDL	03:28:49,919	03:28:51,711	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Are men heard it and looked at each other
EDL	03:28:52,223	03:28:55,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We had a tender-hearted lance corporal name Baxter
EDL	03:28:55,551	03:29:00,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He was the man to boil up a special Dixie for the centuries of his section when they came off duty made him a little
EDL	03:29:00,927	03:29:01,439	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Super T
EDL	03:29:01,951	03:29:03,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As soon as he heard
EDL	03:29:03,231	03:29:08,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The wounded Middlesex man he ran along the trench calling for a volunteer to help fetch him in
EDL	03:29:08,863	03:29:10,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Of course no one would go
EDL	03:29:10,911	03:29:12,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was death to put one's head over the
EDL	03:29:12,703	03:29:13,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The parapet
EDL	03:29:13,471	03:29:15,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When he came running to ask me
EDL	03:29:15,263	03:29:18,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I excused myself as being the only officer in the company
EDL	03:29:18,335	03:29:19,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I would come out with him at dusk
EDL	03:29:19,871	03:29:20,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I said
EDL	03:29:20,639	03:29:21,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not now
EDL	03:29:21,663	03:29:22,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So he went alone
EDL	03:29:23,199	03:29:25,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Jump quickly over the parapet
EDL	03:29:25,247	03:29:28,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then strolled across no-man's-land waving a handkerchief
EDL	03:29:29,087	03:29:33,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans fire to frighten him but since he persisted they let him come close
EDL	03:29:34,207	03:29:35,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Baxter continue tour
EDL	03:29:35,999	03:29:37,791	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And when he got to the Middlesex man
EDL	03:29:38,303	03:29:39,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stop
EDL	03:29:39,071	03:29:41,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And pointed to show the Germans what he was at
EDL	03:29:41,887	03:29:42,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What he was up to
EDL	03:29:43,423	03:29:45,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Venidress the man's wounds
EDL	03:29:45,471	03:29:50,847	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Gave him a drink of rum and some biscuit that he had with him and promised to be back again at nightfall
EDL	03:29:50,847	03:29:53,151	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He didn't come back grades right
EDL	03:29:53,151	03:29:56,223	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	With a stretcher party and a man eventually recovered
EDL	03:29:56,223	03:30:01,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I recommended Baxter for the Victoria Cross being the only officer who would witness the action
EDL	03:30:01,087	03:30:04,415	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But the authorities started worth no more than a distinguished Conduct Medal
EDL	03:30:04,927	03:30:05,439	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And quote
EDL	03:30:07,231	03:30:08,767	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Sounds worthy of a Victoria Cross
EDL	03:30:10,303	03:30:12,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And that's one of those incidents where you see
EDL	03:30:12,863	03:30:15,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The opposite of man's inhumanity to man
EDL	03:30:15,679	03:30:19,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In an environment designed to Foster the former
EDL	03:30:20,543	03:30:22,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It stands out all the more doesn't it
EDL	03:30:23,359	03:30:29,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Baxter could have easily been mowed down and if you don't think it happens remember three people were mowed down trying to say
EDL	03:30:29,759	03:30:31,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	That wounded Samson character in the first
EDL	03:30:34,111	03:30:34,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I can't help
EDL	03:30:34,879	03:30:35,391	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wonder
EDL	03:30:36,159	03:30:38,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How am I generation would handle what these B
EDL	03:30:38,719	03:30:39,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People Workforce
EDL	03:30:39,487	03:30:39,999	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What to do
EDL	03:30:40,511	03:30:42,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You think of the first day on the battle of the Somme
EDL	03:30:42,815	03:30:44,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Think of yourself in the second
EDL	03:30:44,863	03:30:45,375	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Wave
EDL	03:30:45,887	03:30:46,911	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Or the Third Way
EDL	03:30:47,935	03:30:51,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you hear all this stuff from the officers about all them
EDL	03:30:51,007	03:30:53,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Killer will destroy everybody that nobody be Left Alive
EDL	03:30:53,567	03:30:57,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then the first wave in front of you units that you know go over the top
EDL	03:30:57,919	03:31:00,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And don't even get near their objective before their cuts a ribbon
EDL	03:31:00,991	03:31:03,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's an absolute catastrophe
EDL	03:31:03,551	03:31:05,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And screw up and everybody can see it happen
EDL	03:31:06,367	03:31:07,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And then they turn to the next wave
EDL	03:31:07,903	03:31:09,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	If maybe that's not you maybe you're in the third
EDL	03:31:09,695	03:31:14,559	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And tell them to go do the same thing and they doing the same thing happens right it's suicide
EDL	03:31:15,071	03:31:16,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now they turn to you
EDL	03:31:16,863	03:31:18,655	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Let me say okay it's your units turn
EDL	03:31:19,679	03:31:20,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What you do
EDL	03:31:20,447	03:31:22,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Forget cowardice for a second
EDL	03:31:22,239	03:31:24,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because there are people who simply ran away
EDL	03:31:24,543	03:31:26,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Aarhus nerves failed them or whatever
EDL	03:31:27,103	03:31:28,127	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is not a question of
EDL	03:31:28,639	03:31:29,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know
EDL	03:31:29,407	03:31:30,431	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What could you
EDL	03:31:31,199	03:31:31,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Physically
EDL	03:31:31,967	03:31:33,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is a question of what
EDL	03:31:33,247	03:31:33,759	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Would you
EDL	03:31:36,831	03:31:37,343	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	See I think
EDL	03:31:38,111	03:31:38,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A lot of us
EDL	03:31:38,879	03:31:39,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We think to ourselves
EDL	03:31:40,671	03:31:42,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	There's no way I'm surviving
EDL	03:31:42,975	03:31:44,255	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Going out onto that battle
EDL	03:31:45,279	03:31:49,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But if this officer wasn't here telling me to do this and my buddies and I just sort of
EDL	03:31:49,631	03:31:52,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Decided all together we're not doing this
EDL	03:31:52,703	03:31:54,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Maybe something would change you know
EDL	03:31:54,495	03:31:56,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the first war novel
EDL	03:31:56,031	03:31:58,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What's come out of the first world war actually came out during the
EDL	03:31:59,615	03:32:00,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Frenchman name
EDL	03:32:00,895	03:32:01,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Henry Barber
EDL	03:32:01,919	03:32:02,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he wrote
EDL	03:32:02,943	03:32:03,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Something
EDL	03:32:03,967	03:32:06,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Where he as a soldier had served our
EDL	03:32:06,527	03:32:12,415	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Already he was a disabled veteran he wrote this piece while the war was still going on and it's surprisingly anti-war
EDL	03:32:12,927	03:32:15,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For the government to put up with it during the conflict
EDL	03:32:15,743	03:32:19,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And he implied that the soldiers on both sides the common soldiers
EDL	03:32:20,095	03:32:21,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To just agree with each other
EDL	03:32:22,143	03:32:22,911	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Vinegar fighting
EDL	03:32:23,423	03:32:29,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And what if they gave a war and no one came right what if the soldiers on both sides of the government can tell it to 5
EDL	03:32:30,079	03:32:31,615	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Barbara said that in the book that
EDL	03:32:32,127	03:32:34,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Truthfully the only people who really understood
EDL	03:32:34,687	03:32:38,783	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What the French soldier and a British soldier were going through in these hellish conditions
EDL	03:32:39,295	03:32:42,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Were the German soldiers on the other side of the nomad
EDL	03:32:42,111	03:32:44,159	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Plant living under the exact
EDL	03:32:44,159	03:32:45,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Same hellish condition
EDL	03:32:47,231	03:32:50,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	When the Germans don't fire on the British were getting their wounded
EDL	03:32:51,071	03:32:54,143	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	A lot of times it's because there's an Unwritten deal that says
EDL	03:32:54,655	03:32:56,447	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm going to leave you alone right
EDL	03:32:56,447	03:32:57,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How to get your wounded
EDL	03:32:57,471	03:33:00,031	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People are there in the hopes that when it's my wounded
EDL	03:33:00,031	03:33:03,359	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Did people in no man's land and I'm trying to get them out of there
EDL	03:33:03,359	03:33:03,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You'll let me
EDL	03:33:06,687	03:33:08,991	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	One of the real phenomenons of this war
EDL	03:33:10,015	03:33:13,855	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is the fact that when left alone a lot of soldiers on both sides
EDL	03:33:14,623	03:33:16,671	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Decided to adopt what's what's
EDL	03:33:16,671	03:33:19,231	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Officially known as a live-and-let-live attitude
EDL	03:33:19,999	03:33:23,583	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this war and it was it was common everywhere but the Western Front more than any other
EDL	03:33:24,095	03:33:25,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Where for example
EDL	03:33:26,143	03:33:28,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Soldiers would be required and they hated this job
EDL	03:33:29,215	03:33:30,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To go out at night
EDL	03:33:31,007	03:33:33,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And put more barbed wire
EDL	03:33:33,055	03:33:33,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Stop in the middle of nowhere
EDL	03:33:34,335	03:33:35,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Once you sneak out cuz it's dark
EDL	03:33:35,871	03:33:39,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And you bring wire with you and wire cutters and all these thinking of to go hang new wire
EDL	03:33:39,967	03:33:42,783	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Extremely dangerous job in both sides hated
EDL	03:33:42,783	03:33:43,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right
EDL	03:33:43,807	03:33:44,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It's a lot of time.
EDL	03:33:44,831	03:33:45,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They just wouldn't shoot
EDL	03:33:46,367	03:33:47,135	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	At the other pee
EDL	03:33:47,135	03:33:49,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People who were putting wire officers hated this
EDL	03:33:50,463	03:33:51,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And one of the big
EDL	03:33:52,255	03:33:54,559	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Scandals was after the Christmas Truce
EDL	03:33:54,559	03:33:57,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The so-called Christmas Truce of 1914 both sides with fractions
EDL	03:33:57,631	03:34:03,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The officers had to make all these arrangements so that next Christmas nothing like this happened again in a minute
EDL	03:34:03,263	03:34:05,311	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Preserved a proper fighting spirit
EDL	03:34:05,311	03:34:06,079	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I could be the way

EDL	03:43:00,095	03:43:06,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know that this is the solution to the problem right if you go to your engineers when the war starts and say listen we got this bar

EDL	03:43:14,431	03:43:15,967	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They did they got a giant track
EDL	03:43:16,991	03:43:19,039	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And it's so long that he can
EDL	03:43:19,039	03:43:20,831	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Most of these
EDL	03:43:20,831	03:43:21,599	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Trenches
EDL	03:43:21,599	03:43:22,367	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So

EDL	03:43:28,767	03:43:30,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The point isn't to
EDL	03:43:30,303	03:43:34,399	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In a drive around real fast everywhere the point is to not get killed

EDL	03:43:44,895	03:43:51,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hurt them shrapnel won't hurt them and they'll get to the other side and I'll wipe out strong points and when they debut nobody has any
EDL	03:43:51,295	03:43:52,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Any idea what that's going to be like
EDL	03:43:53,855	03:43:57,695	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Another one of those moments where you had bite your nails in that you watch the new technology
EDL	03:43:58,207	03:43:59,487	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In this case
EDL	03:43:59,487	03:44:05,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Not stuff developed in the last hundred years that never had a chance to be tested in this case stop develop
EDL	03:44:05,119	03:44:08,191	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Specifically in response to problems the first World War
EDL	03:44:08,703	03:44:09,983	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Gina brings up like
EDL	03:44:09,983	03:44:10,751	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	No man's land
EDL	03:44:12,287	03:44:13,055	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	03:44:13,055	03:44:14,847	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They perform
EDL	03:44:14,847	03:44:15,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Astoundingly well
EDL	03:44:17,663	03:44:19,711	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now they break down a lot
EDL	03:44:20,223	03:44:22,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And other terribly uncomfortable today
EDL	03:44:22,527	03:44:25,855	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	People inside these are large to there like 15 people in these
EDL	03:44:25,855	03:44:26,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I mean you're like
EDL	03:44:26,879	03:44:27,903	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Almost a boss
EDL	03:44:28,671	03:44:30,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they don't have a turret
EDL	03:44:30,207	03:44:35,327	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They have either machine gun that come out of the side or a couple of 6-pounder guns with your about 57 mm
EDL	03:44:35,839	03:44:36,863	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And yet
EDL	03:44:36,863	03:44:39,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The Germans don't know what they're dealing with here and we
EDL	03:44:39,167	03:44:40,959	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Have stories of them surrendering to tanks and
EDL	03:44:41,471	03:44:44,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How the reaction on the part of the British troops is either really
EDL	03:44:44,799	03:44:46,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Excited and happy or
EDL	03:44:46,591	03:44:48,895	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They almost laughing cuz it looks kind of comical
EDL	03:44:49,919	03:44:51,199	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But in a sense
EDL	03:44:51,199	03:44:55,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This is what we talked about earlier this is the Star Wars steampunk
EDL	03:44:55,807	03:44:57,855	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Imperial Walker thing for real
EDL	03:45:00,415	03:45:06,815	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Churchill and the people who would back this idea from the time trench warfare got started that's when the the fur
EDL	03:45:06,815	03:45:11,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	First plans were drawn up in the ideas brainstormed for something like this in the French were working on the two by the way
EDL	03:45:12,959	03:45:16,543	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Churchill was mad and forever afterwards yelled and screamed that
EDL	03:45:16,543	03:45:22,431	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	This concept could have really done a ton if they had just waited till there were enough of these land battleships
EDL	03:45:22,943	03:45:25,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	To unleash and have pad make a difference
EDL	03:45:25,759	03:45:28,575	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The counter-argument which we also understand right is that
EDL	03:45:29,087	03:45:33,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	What if they don't work what if we don't know how they work how do we do this if we don't have a
EDL	03:45:33,183	03:45:34,719	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Dress rehearsal
EDL	03:45:34,719	03:45:40,351	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Before opening night so Churchill in the people on his side or saying no you wasted it should have been one big opening night that
EDL	03:45:41,375	03:45:42,911	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Broke the Western Front
EDL	03:45:43,423	03:45:47,263	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The other side saying are you kidding me there is an open invitation to Murphy's Law
EDL	03:45:48,287	03:45:52,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But if you were looking to try to decide how you like your land battleship
EDL	03:45:52,639	03:45:54,175	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Concept in practice
EDL	03:45:54,687	03:45:59,551	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	After it was debuted at the Battle of the Somme well all you have to know is Cavalry commander Douglas Haig
EDL	03:46:00,319	03:46:01,855	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Radioed back to
EDL	03:46:01,855	03:46:04,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Your corporate headquarters at the British Army and said that
EDL	03:46:05,439	03:46:06,463	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	We want more of those tanks
EDL	03:46:07,999	03:46:08,511	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now
EDL	03:46:09,279	03:46:10,303	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Other things happen
EDL	03:46:10,815	03:46:11,839	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Because of the battle of
EDL	03:46:11,839	03:46:13,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The song two in one was
EDL	03:46:13,631	03:46:14,911	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	It was just yet
EDL	03:46:14,911	03:46:16,703	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	For poor Erich von Falk
EDL	03:46:16,703	03:46:23,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Can find the head of the German military remember he took over after they sacked Von moltke the guy who they started the war with
EDL	03:46:23,103	03:46:24,127	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And now
EDL	03:46:24,127	03:46:29,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Like a bunch of leaders who owned a football team and continually like

EDL	03:46:38,719	03:46:41,279	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Brusilov offensive and then the last straw
EDL	03:46:41,279	03:46:47,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is everybody's Whispering that Romania is going to get in the war which doesn't sound like a big deal to watch now
EDL	03:46:47,167	03:46:53,567	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But if you actually look at the literature especially German austro-hungarian the stuff from that side of your toe they're really like biting their nails
EDL	03:46:53,567	03:46:54,335	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	About the song
EDL	03:46:54,335	03:46:57,407	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Romania to get in the war half-million bayonets oh my goodness
EDL	03:46:57,407	03:47:02,527	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Everybody's really worried and apparently Kaiser Wilhelm II German Emperor is really worried in Falcon Heights and now don't worry about it
EDL	03:47:03,039	03:47:07,135	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They're not going to come in anytime soon maybe later but no but no time soon and then boom almost
EDL	03:47:07,135	03:47:08,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Right after he issues

EDL	03:47:18,399	03:47:24,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The last card by the way I love how he knows his Emperor William and William's little quirks about power
EDL	03:47:24,799	03:47:27,103	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And Falcon Heights last car that he plays is
EDL	03:47:27,103	03:47:28,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You know if you replace me

EDL	03:47:30,687	03:47:35,295	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Replacing with have you replaced me with Hindenburg and ludendorff that's it they're not going to listen to you
EDL	03:47:35,295	03:47:38,111	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I'm the last chance you have of having an influence
EDL	03:47:38,111	03:47:38,879	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	My word
EDL	03:47:38,879	03:47:42,207	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	But that's basically what you said to the Kaiser you won't have any role in this at all
EDL	03:47:42,207	03:47:47,839	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	You better stick with me cuz if you put Hindenburg and ludendorff in charge they going to tell you to go play with your toys in the corner
EDL	03:47:49,119	03:47:51,423	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Apparently the Kaiser felt like he had no choice

EDL	03:47:55,007	03:47:56,799	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Spore a military command
EDL	03:47:56,799	03:48:00,383	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is giving some people think almost as an insult
EDL	03:48:00,383	03:48:02,943	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The command to go attack Romania
EDL	03:48:02,943	03:48:05,503	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which he didn't foresee them coming into the war
EDL	03:48:05,503	03:48:07,807	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	He takes over a military command and
EDL	03:48:08,319	03:48:11,647	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Conducts a brilliant campaign against Romania
EDL	03:48:11,647	03:48:13,183	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Conquering them quick
EDL	03:48:14,719	03:48:18,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Which makes you turn around go now why won't you so scared of those Romanian bayonets
EDL	03:48:18,559	03:48:19,071	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	La Terranea
EDL	03:48:20,351	03:48:21,119	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Think about
EDL	03:48:21,631	03:48:26,495	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	How that's like a minor league team jumping into the middle of a game against the
EDL	03:48:26,495	03:48:27,775	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Perhaps best army
EDL	03:48:28,287	03:48:31,871	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	In the 20th centuries of Romania so unequipped for this
EDL	03:48:31,871	03:48:33,919	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Without a ramp up. And they just got
EDL	03:48:33,919	03:48:34,687	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Smashed
EDL	03:48:34,687	03:48:41,087	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And the worst part about the whole thing from the Allied standpoint again the Allies work so hard to get Romania in the conflict is it
EDL	03:48:41,087	03:48:45,439	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Germany takes over Romania they're going to loot that country of every bit of weed
EDL	03:48:45,439	03:48:48,255	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And oil in anything they can take to offset
EDL	03:48:48,767	03:48:55,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The damage that the British blockade is doing so in the sentence like they come upon this Romanian store room and they Luther
EDL	03:48:55,167	03:48:55,679	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The whole thing
EDL	03:48:56,191	03:48:56,959	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So it
EDL	03:48:56,959	03:48:58,239	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	So the backfires
EDL	03:48:58,239	03:48:59,007	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	On the Allied cause
EDL	03:49:01,311	03:49:01,823	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Nonetheless
EDL	03:49:02,335	03:49:08,479	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Hindenburg and ludendorff this new command team the people who have been in charge on the Eastern front for so long and so
EDL	03:49:08,991	03:49:12,063	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Being the armchair quarterbacks from over there telling
EDL	03:49:12,063	03:49:16,927	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	The rest of the German command what they were doing wrong on the Western Front right now in charge of among other things

EDL	03:49:19,487	03:49:22,047	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And they're going to bring A New Perspective in a different way of looking at
EDL	03:49:23,327	03:49:23,839	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	And
EDL	03:49:24,863	03:49:25,631	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	They will
EDL	03:49:26,399	03:49:27,167	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Essential
EDL	03:49:27,167	03:49:29,471	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Command this German Army for the rest

EDL	03:49:32,031	03:49:34,591	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Now how long the rest of the wars going to be able to
EDL	03:49:35,871	03:49:36,639	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	Is an open question
EDL	03:49:38,175	03:49:41,247	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	As 1960 begins to wonder if you begin to see the discontent

EDL	03:53:08,607	03:53:09,887	| dchha53_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_IV_clean |	I did that on purpose
