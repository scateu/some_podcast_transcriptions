December 7th 1941

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
I welcome this kind of examination

27
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Whether or not their president

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,888
We are not descended from fearful men

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
It's hardcore history

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
What's the most dangerous weapon in the world

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
I've had this discussion many times

32
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
With many people

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And I seen it Go all over the

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
But generally you focus on nuclear war

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
Because that's an obvious thing to put

36
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
You don't win the number 1 spot for most dangerous weapon in the world

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
But there are some that are little bit more Insidious and potentially worse

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Take for example

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Biological

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Think about some of the worst

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Plagues that if ever

42
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,640
Infested mankind now imagine human Ingenuity in a laboratory used to make

43
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Such plagues worse

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
And now imagine releasing those upon your

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Anime

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
The reason they're so extra dangerous

47
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
Is because of the way they spread

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,744
And the fact that once you open the Pandora's box of biological warfare

49
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
You generally lose the ability to shut the box again

50
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,424
You may exchange a few nuclear weapons with an opponent and decide to stop

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Once you open up that box and unleash

52
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Super smallpox or what have you

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
You can't turn that off again

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,944
Another reason is very dangerous is that super smallpox

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,272
Doesn't differentiate between the people you targeted

56
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
And everyone else that it may spread to

57
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
It's a bit of a doomsday device when you think about how something like that could backfire

58
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
On the very people who decide to use it

59
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
It's a little light to siding

60
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,400
To get rid of your next-door neighbor in your apartment complex by burning down his place

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
This potential for the fire to hurt you

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Is very real

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,872
But sometimes if you run out of options gambling like that might make sense

64
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
In late 1917

65
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,064
Where we are in the store even though we've been using sliding time scale that's about where we are

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
In late 1917 the Germans are desperate enough to

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Try

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
All sorts of things

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,000
Including the equivalent of biological warfare

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
But instead of using some sort of contagious

71
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
Disease

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
They're using contagious ideas

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
But you might be able to make a case

74
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
But in this situation

75
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
An actual disease would have been prefer

76
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Whenever I think about this idea I think about Napoleon

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,272
The famous French emperor of late 1700 early 1800

78
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
It was such a force in Europe

79
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
Napoleon was someone who spread

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
An intellectual Contagion

81
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Remember professors in college

82
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Suggesting that this was the thing that scared

83
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
The Kings and czars and Emperors of Europe the most about Nepal

84
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
Because Napoleon arose in the wake of the French Revolution

85
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,567
The era where Frenchmen were infused with these ideas

86
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Rebelution

87
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
Equality of republicanism

88
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
All these things that seem

89
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
A relatively moderate

90
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
The people today even beneficial

91
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,439
But those with the scariest things on earth to people who were Kings and Emperors and czars

92
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
And many of them figured

93
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
That they would eventually be able to throw the French out of these territories

94
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
And get their Thrones back

95
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,007
But they were less sure about their ability to cleanse their population of these dangerous radical ideas

96
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,567
The French occupying troops had spread to the

97
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
In fact many

98
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Historians believe

99
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
At the famous

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
Revolutionary period in the middle 1800s

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,831
Was the blossoming of seeds that were planted

102
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
By Napoleon's troops

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
As they

104
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
Occupied all these countries talk to the locals and spread

105
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
The equivalent of an intellectual Contagion

106
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Of course if you're one of those types who would View

107
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,519
The ideas of the American Revolution or the French Revolution or the ideas of the thinkers who helped

108
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Prompto's Revolution

109
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
As a negative thing

110
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
Then perhaps you would view the 1800's as an example not a seed flowering into some wonderful plant

111
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
What is a virus beginning to more

112
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
And mutate

113
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,135
And evolve into new and maybe more dangerous form

114
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
The eighteen-hundreds is

115
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Up until that time.

116
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
Almost certainly the greatest. For

117
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Intellectual examination of forms of government that ever existed

118
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
And part of it is because of the increase in communication and how people all over Europe can begin to have conferences and discussions

119
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
Magazines and newspapers that each other reads and have

120
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,991
All sorts of attempts at trying to apply

121
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Rationality

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
And logic

123
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
To the idea of government

124
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,695
Because most of the government's in a place like you're up at this time.

125
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Are things that have existed in

126
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
One form or another for centuries

127
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Someone in the distant past was a great military leader who establishes a dynasty

128
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
Who rules for hundreds of years and no one ever really asks

129
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,383
Whether or not that's the right thing to do for whether or not as smart or anything else

130
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
In the 1800 people began to think

131
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Along with

132
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
Any changes in science and all kinds of different things that maybe

133
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
People could come up with smarter approach

134
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
But it was wide disagreement though I'm what that smart approach might be

135
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,047
And some of the great figures of the 1800s

136
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Who played roles in this

137
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
Will become extremely important figures

138
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
In the 19

139
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
In fact

140
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
Someone who is involved in trying to come up

141
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,127
With a system that seem to be an improvement over what Europe was living with in the 1800's

142
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
Explodes in importance

143
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
In 1917

144
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
Exactly where we are in this first world war story

145
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
He was

146
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,951
Renowned in his own Day within his own Circle but he certainly wasn't a household name

147
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
He becomes a historical superstar in 1970

148
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
And there's a little bit of iron needed that because in 1917

149
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
This week has been dead 34 35 years

150
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
One of the best

151
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
One of the worst

152
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Aspects

153
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
Have an idea depending on whether you consider it good or dangerous

154
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Is the fact that it doesn't die

155
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
With the originator

156
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
In 1917

157
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
All of a sudden everybody starts hearing the name Karl Marx

158
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Marx is often credited with being the

159
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Originator of

160
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
Modern communism Marxism

161
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
But I think that's probably giving him a little too much credit after all

162
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Very few people

163
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
Come up with ideas out of nowhere and Mark

164
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Like most people

165
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
Stood on the shoulders of giants with his ideas

166
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,967
He was reading guys like the German philosopher Hegel and a lot of other people

167
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
What if a guy like hagel's an example of

168
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
The intellectual Contagion

169
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Denmark is an example of someone

170
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Cool

171
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Mutated it

172
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Farther

173
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,815
Of course perhaps the ironic tragedy of marks

174
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Is that Mark

175
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
Didn't get to be the implementer of his ideas

176
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
His ideas

177
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Wer

178
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Adapted

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
And more

180
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
In two different

181
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
Like many figures from history if you could go back and show

182
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Karl Marx

183
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
How he's treated in the history books in the things he's associated with

184
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
I think you might jump off a bridge

185
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
There's a lot of figure

186
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Or remembered for things

187
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
That are almost 180 degrees different

188
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
Then what they devoted their lives to working for

189
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
Mark study was doing good

190
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
And yet today we think about his role

191
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
In the deaths of tens of millions of people

192
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
And the creation of some of the worst

193
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Slave states in all human history

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
If you read Marx

195
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
And find out what he was all about

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
That's exactly what he was hoping to

197
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Prevent and stop

198
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Eliminate

199
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,279
You can bring Karl Marx back from the dead and have him analyzed where things went wrong

200
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
I wouldn't be surprised at all

201
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
If he blamed

202
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
A botched

203
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Implementation

204
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
For the way things turned out

205
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
We might argue that Marx's ideas from the get-go we're poor

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
But I think he would probably say that you never got a chance to see what he wanted

207
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Because he wasn't the guy

208
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,271
Built the house he was the architect maybe or maybe the last guy to design blueprint

209
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
The guy who actually built the

210
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Dwelling

211
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Was a guy named Vladimir Lenin

212
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
And i'm reminded of a quote by the writer aldous Huxley

213
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
About how ideas

214
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
End up influencing

215
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
People and it's not so much a question always

216
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
How many people

217
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
But who they are

218
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Huxley Road quote

219
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
It is possible to argue that the really influential book is not that which converts 10 millions of casual

220
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Will readers

221
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
But rather that which converts the very few

222
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
At any given moment

223
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Succeed in seizing power

224
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
Marks and Sorrel have been influential in the modern world

225
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Not so much because they were best sellers

226
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Stop because among their few readers

227
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,119
We're two men called respectively Lenin and Mussolini

228
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
And quote

229
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
Vladimir Lenin is the hinge point

230
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Between Theory

231
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
An application

232
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
When it comes to modern-day communes

233
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Easy implement

234
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Marx is the originator

235
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
And Lenin is the implementer

236
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
He's a figure

237
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
The combines

238
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Some rather

239
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
Unusual qualities in one human being

240
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
Often times the intellectual in the deep thinker in the philosopher

241
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Is a different sort of human being

242
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
Then the person of action

243
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Raichu for the man of action

244
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,751
And often times are two different kinds of people linen is one of these strange individual

245
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
The possesses the qualities of both an intellectual

246
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
And a person of action

247
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Annie's dynamic

248
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Abilities

249
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
We recognize even by the people

250
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Who were his opponent

251
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Take for example the description

252
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Elora Gorge

253
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,719
The man who is the prime minister of Britain during really the second half of the first World War

254
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
George will write his Memoirs in the 1930s and he will say this

255
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Vladimir Lenin

256
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Quote

257
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
He was a communist

258
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:56,031
But whilst fanaticism does not always endowed with possessor with great administrative ability

259
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
It is not incompatible with a genius for government

260
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,967
And no one can doubt that Lennon was one of the greatest leaders of men ever thrown up in any yet

261
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
And quote

262
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
He then goes on to compare him

263
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
What he calls

264
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
Plague bacillus

265
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Lenin was certainly up

266
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Most revolutionaries are

267
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,399
People who tend to not see Too Many Shades of Grey things tend to be black and white

268
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Winston Churchill famously defined the Fanatic is

269
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Someone who can't change their mind

270
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
And won't change the subject

271
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Churchill had his own opinion of Lenin and once again

272
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
It evoked this idea of an intellectual contagion he also compared Lennon to some sort of bacteria

273
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
And he blamed the Germans

274
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
For unleashing it

275
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
On your

276
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Playing an active role

277
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
In

278
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
Implementing a form of germ warfare

279
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
It would have

280
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Horrible effects down the road

281
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Churchill Road quote

282
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,775
Lenin was sent into Russia by the Germans

283
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
In the same way that you might send a file containing a culture of typhoid

284
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
For cholera

285
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
To be poured in the water supply of a great City

286
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
And it worked with amazing accuracy

287
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
And quote

288
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,391
That brings us to the third person who is very important

289
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
In

290
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Implementing

291
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
This

292
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
Intellectual contagion Warfare kind of approach

293
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
The facilitator

294
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
If March is the originator

295
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
And linen is the implementer

296
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Lennon needed some help

297
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,543
To get to the point where he could in fact

298
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
If you will

299
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Anyone

300
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
In the beginning of 1917 Vladimir Lenin

301
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Is an exile

302
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
He's living in Switzerland

303
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Next to a sausage back

304
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,415
On the second floor of a rented flat with his wife

305
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Trying to make a living

306
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
In what you might call

307
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
The professional revolutionary

308
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
I'd like to get back to Russia in 1917 because it's apparent that

309
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,799
Huge things are happening in Russia the Tsar has been overthrown a provisional government is taking over

310
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
But Lennon can't get from where he is

311
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
To Russia

312
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,015
There's a war going on and there's a lot of territory in between Switzerland and Russia to deal with

313
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
And then he get

314
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Somehow

315
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
From the facility

316
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
The leader of Germany's military

317
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
And for the most part by this time civilian government

318
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Erich ludendorff

319
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Ludendorff in the Germans have long been

320
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Associated with Lenin's rise to

321
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Power

322
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
The exact amount

323
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Responsibility

324
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
The Germany

325
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,735
Manhattan that story is debatable and has been debated since 1917

326
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
One of the reasons

327
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Historians

328
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Have a hard time nailing down to finitive answers

329
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Is because it's

330
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
One of those things that falls into the category

331
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Of what we would call today

332
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Covert operation

333
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Or Black Ops

334
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Tzatziki

335
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,935
Stop both sides in the war

336
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
We're trying to undermine the cohesiveness

337
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
And the stability

338
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Of their Epona

339
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
A potentially wonderful way to do that was to give money

340
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
Or arms or sometimes military advisors

341
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
Two revolutionaries

342
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Insurrectionist

343
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
And Breakaway group

344
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
An ethnic separatist

345
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
And people who lived in countries that were colonies of some of the great Powers but who wanted their independence and both sides as I said we're doing

346
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
There's

347
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
A lot of alligators

348
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Things about German involvement for example

349
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,007
In the famous Easter rising in 1916 in Ireland

350
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
How much Germans support

351
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
That's questionable 2 and part of the reason why is

352
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Nobody was exactly advertising

353
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Chevy's top secret affairs

354
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Most of the stories Trace German involvement

355
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
At least as far back as 1915

356
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
Most of the story suggest that it was

357
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,815
Contacts with leftist individuals who pointed out to the German government

358
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
That there were shared goals

359
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
On the part of Germany

360
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
And some of these Russian revolutionaries

361
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,127
Take for example Lennon and his particular offshoot of the communist

362
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,175
In a mainstream known as the Bolshevik

363
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
One of the things Lenin was calling for

364
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Was peace

365
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
That's exactly what the Germans wanted from the Russian

366
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
By 1917

367
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
They wanted the Russians out of the war

368
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
The Russians were tying down

369
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
Millions of German troops on the Eastern Front

370
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
That the Germans would love to be able to switch over to the Western Front

371
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,799
To fight the exhausted French and British before the Americans arrived in any sort of decisive numbers

372
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Now the big gamble here

373
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Of course

374
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
Is that the Bolsheviks while they may share a common goal and getting Russia to leave the war

375
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
I'm not Germany's friend

376
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Ludendorff deciding to use them as a tool

377
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,535
Is a Cantu adding another Boxer into the World War 1 boxing match

378
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,399
We use that analogy throughout the series the idea of two boxers fighting each other

379
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
Part of ludendorff gamble here

380
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
Is he talking about introducing a third boxer into the ring

381
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
One that wants to fight both the other two boxers

382
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
But ludendorff has a pretty good idea that he'll go after

383
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,527
The one ludendorff on the Germans are fighting first

384
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,647
The Bolsheviks and Lenin are preaching the equivalent of a global

385
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Civil War

386
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
If the American President Woodrow Wilson

387
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
Is calling the first world war the war to end all wars

388
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Lenin has his own idea

389
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,983
The war to end all wars is Irish historian William Mulligan points out

390
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
Lenin's idea

391
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
Of the war to end all wars

392
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Is revolutionary

393
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
War

394
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
The Bolsheviks are calling for

395
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
The poor

396
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
And working classes

397
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Of all Nations to rise up and over

398
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,415
Germany is only a little less vulnerable to that sort of message then Russia is

399
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
This is why I ludendorff

400
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
Is playing with fire or in this case

401
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Play

402
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,631
He stands a really good chance of getting burned

403
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
By this very same weapon

404
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
That he in 1917 decides to help

405
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Use against Russia

406
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
The actual mean

407
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
To get Lenin from

408
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,967
Switzerland back to Russia is provided

409
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,319
By the Germans in April 1917 so we're going backwards a little bit in the story

410
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
The Germans provide a single

411
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Seal

412
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Train car

413
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
For Lenin and his cowboy

414
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Historians have

415
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Disagreed over

416
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Who demanded that it be sealed

417
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Some say the Germans wanted this train car sealed so that when Lenin and his cohorts are going through Germany they don't intellectually in Fair

418
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
The Germans on the way through

419
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
How do you say it was Lenin in the Bolsheviks who demanded it

420
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
The last thing that they wanted was to have

421
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
People in Russia find out that they were accepting help from the country Russia was fighting oh yeah and a people who have

422
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
I happened to be capitalist 2

423
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
Nonetheless whomever it was who made the decision

424
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:17,887
As the train car goes through Germany there's a famous incident where Lennon or one of his cohorts looks out the window

425
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
And happens to notice

426
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
That there are no mature men

427
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
Anywhere to be seen

428
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
It's children

429
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
And women

430
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
And old people

431
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Germany's mature male population is either

432
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Dead

433
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
When did

434
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Or at the front

435
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,879
Lenin and his party then we'll have to board a ferry and go by

436
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,999
Boat for a little bit then I'll get back on another train the train will then arrive

437
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
In petrograd formerly St Petersburg the Russian Capital just before midnight

438
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
On April 16th 1917

439
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
There will be a crowd

440
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
Waiting to welcome him because like many other

441
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Dangerous ride

442
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Kohl's

443
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
Lenin is coming home from exile

444
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
The Tsar for decades have been exiling all these

445
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Barry

446
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Formidable intellectual contagions at those are the ones he wasn't executing by the way Lenin's brother have

447
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Been executed by the czar

448
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Now all these people were coming back to Russia

449
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,559
At roughly the same time creating a seditious

450
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Soup

451
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,399
Politically speaking in Russia during this time.

452
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
And believe me rush it was ready for

453
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,079
There in this precarious situation after the Tsar Falls where you have

454
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Short of a moderate government

455
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,479
Known as the provisional government sharing power

456
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
With these

457
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,879
Groups of soldiers and peasants and workers who have gotten together and elected leaders

458
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
And we're shooting

459
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
Trying to lead from the bottom and they're sharing power in and not very comfortable sort of an arrangement with the provision

460
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
It is absolutely a setup for problems

461
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
And yet you kind of

462
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
You have to feel a little bit for them

463
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
I mean think about what these people are trying to do

464
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
They are trying

465
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
To run a country

466
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,711
After toppling the regime that have been in power for centuries

467
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
This is a tough thing to do in the best of time

468
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
But this isn't the best

469
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
The time

470
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
The equivalent of a bus passenger

471
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,744
Try to get ahold of the wheel in the bus is already careening off a cliff

472
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
And then you get a guy like linen arriving

473
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
And he gets off the platform

474
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,704
At a little before midnight and tells us enthusiastic crowd of supporters quote

475
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,592
The piratical imperialist war is the beginning of a civil war throughout Europe

476
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,432
The worldwide socialist revolution has already gone

477
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
Germany is seething

478
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,808
Any day now the whole of European capitalism a crash

479
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Sailors

480
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Comrade

481
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
We have to fight for a socialist Revolution

482
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
The fight until the proletariat wins full directory

483
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,048
Long live the worldwide socialist Revolution

484
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
And quote

485
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Even

486
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Lenin's friends

487
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
Thought this way to optimist

488
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
In fact

489
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
At that very moment the current

490
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,176
Russian government power-sharing Arrangement was trying to put together

491
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
An offensive against the Germans

492
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Schedule for July 1st

493
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,880
With an army that was sketchy

494
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
At best at this point

495
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
If you are Russia's provisional government

496
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,304
You are between a rock and a hard place in 1970

497
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
You are barely holding on to power

498
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,520
You have strikes you have on rest you have all kinds of problems and now you haven't been in here taking the already

499
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
Kind of extreme Bolsheviks and pushing them into greater

500
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Extremism

501
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:46,016
He's calling for three main things that are impossible for the provisional government to really contend with

502
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
He's calling for peace

503
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Bread

504
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
And land

505
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,000
A triple threat of a message that would be effective across much of Europe in nineteen

506
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
19

507
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
I have to provisional government

508
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Hose

509
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:07,520
It has to prove to the British in the French that it's still a viable partner in this war they're funneling tons of

510
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Subsidies to this government

511
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
In fact they need to

512
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,176
Convince the Germans in the Central Powers of the same

513
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,040
But you can't just assume we're done in the best way to do that is to launch an attack

514
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
The problem is is that this Army

515
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,928
Might have been willing to stay and defend

516
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Mother Russia soil

517
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,120
But most of them are not willing to go on the offensive and run into the machine guns in the artillery barrage Isabel

518
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
The Germans

519
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
They may not give a hoot about

520
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,080
Bolshevism or communism or any of that but they understand peace bread and land

521
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
On July 1st

522
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
The kerensky offensive is it sometimes called at the July offensive lead by the great Russian general Brazil

523
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
Launches an attack on a wide front against

524
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
The Germans in the austro-hungarian

525
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
It becomes

526
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
A disaster

527
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
This is the way historian Peter hard disk

528
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Quote

529
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
After a two-day bombardment

530
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,728
The second brusilov offensive attack began with a flourish

531
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
With the attack of the Russian 7th and 11th armies on the Southwest Front

532
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,432
When the Infantry went over the top on 1st July early results were promising

533
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
But then everything started to go wrong

534
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
The best and most loyal units have been chosen as the assault troops

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
While the follow-up and Reserve formations were far less committed

536
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Indeed

537
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
When it came to moving forwards

538
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
Many regiments simply refuse

539
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
The attack petered out an ignominious

540
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
And further planned attacks reader cancelled or abandon

541
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
Then a vigorous austro-hungarian counteroffensive was launched at ternopil in glitzy on 19th July

542
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,360
The Russians broke and retreated in chaos

543
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:54,016
This Disaster triggered the replacement of brusilov as commander-in-chief by General coronal off on the 1st of August

544
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
The Russian army was falling apart

545
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
And such a taxes had been carried out only serve to call the few remaining loyalists unit still willing to act

546
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Did we prosecute the war

547
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,632
The vast majority of Russian soldiers wear now content to be passive observers at best

548
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Indeed

549
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,240
Periotome it was estimated that some 2000000 had deserted

550
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
In quote

551
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
For a while

552
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:23,456
The German High command in the austro-hungarian high command encourage their troops to fraternize with Russian troops

553
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
To sort of undermine

554
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
Their willingness to fight

555
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
They stop doing that

556
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,208
When they found out that the Russian troops were spreading socialist and Bolshevik propaganda back

557
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
To the German and austro-hungarian

558
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Nonetheless

559
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
What that

560
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Disaster

561
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
At the kerensky offensive did

562
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,472
What's essentially prove that Russia's Army was done

563
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
And open the door even more

564
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
To the Bolshevik

565
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Message

566
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Calling for

567
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
4 piece

568
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Writer GJ Meyer describes

569
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
A letter

570
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
From

571
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Rudolph

572
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Hatsune the next

573
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,672
World War will be one of Hitler's henchmen

574
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
Writing back to his parents

575
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
About what the Russians are doing

576
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,816
Opposite the German lines

577
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
They're basically fighting amongst themselves

578
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
He writes quote

579
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Yesterday we saw heavy fighting

580
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
But only among the Russians themselves

581
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,408
A Russian officer came over and gave himself up he spoke perfect German

582
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
He was born in Baden

583
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
What is a Russian citizen

584
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
He told us that whole battles are going on behind their lines

585
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Their officers are shooting each other

586
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
And the soldiers are doing the same

587
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
He found it all too ridiculous

588
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
They can all get lost

589
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
As far as he's concerned

590
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
We invited them to eat with us anything

591
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
Pa-12 and drink plenty of tea before going off

592
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
There was a lot of noise coming from the Russian side yesterday

593
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
They were fighting each other in the trenches

594
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
We also heard shots coming from their infantry but they were firing at each other

595
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Charming

596
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
And quote

597
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Lennon said

598
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,856
That the Russian soldiers were voting for peace with their feet

599
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,720
The failure of the July offensive was another nail in the coffin

600
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
For the provisional government

601
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,584
An added to the support of Lenin and the Bolsheviks to

602
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,656
Were able to portray themselves as the

603
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Real alternative

604
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,544
The provisional government the one party that didn't have any responsibility and what was going on

605
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
And the more Russians didn't like what was going on

606
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,200
The more the only choice to change that seem to be the Bolsheviks and over the months

607
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,528
Between the February Revolution the top of the czar

608
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,136
And just about November the Bolsheviks increase their support

609
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
In these

610
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Councils

611
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,488
Peasants and soldiers and workers known as the Soviet

612
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,560
I don't November 7th 1917

613
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
They move

614
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
In a Triumph

615
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
AB Superior organization

616
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
They were able to take over

617
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
The most important government buildings in the Russian capital

618
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
In a coup

619
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,200
That most Russians awoke to find a fait accompli

620
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Already finished

621
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
And

622
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,624
The most radical government in power in a major state

623
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Since the French Revolution

624
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
All the sudden Lenin and the Bolsheviks

625
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Or in charge

626
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Of Russia

627
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
And

628
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Marc's

629
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
And the other 19th

630
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
Century thinkers

631
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
We're about to have their ideas

632
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
Updated evolve morfin changed

633
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,664
Put into practice in what was about to become a giant

634
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
Human experiment

635
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,112
But you're most of Old Europe This looked like a human experiment conducted by a mad scientist

636
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Too damn it look like

637
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,536
The second coming of the French Revolution did Lenin and the Bolsheviks might as well have been Jacobin

638
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,168
How long before The Guillotines are brought out and everyone starts getting their head shot

639
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,032
Within 24 or so hours of taking power

640
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,616
Lenin starts to make good on some of his promises

641
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
Understand the Lenin's promises had attacked

642
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
Medical purpose in mind

643
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
They would end up

644
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
In his mind helping to spread

645
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Revolution.

646
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Water Country

647
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
The fire caused

648
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:21,792
Buy German general ludendorff attempt to burn down his neighbor's apartment

649
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,632
We're beginning to Fan the Flames to degree

650
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
When many other countries were likely to get burned

651
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Lenin's decree on land said among other things

652
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Quote

653
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,896
Private ownership of land shall be abolished forever

654
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
All land shall become the property of the whole people

655
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
I'm passing to the use of those who cultivate it

656
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
And quote

657
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
Ben Lennon started

658
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Spreading

659
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,720
The sort of propaganda the most horrifying

660
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
The powers who have been fighting the first world war for more than 3 years by this point

661
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
He said quote

662
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
We shall offer peace for the peoples of all the belligerent countries upon the basis of the Soviet turn

663
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,384
No annexations no indemnities and the right of self-determination of peoples

664
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,016
At the same time according to our promise we shall publishing repudiate the secret treaties

665
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
And quote

666
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Secret treaties

667
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,648
Were the treaties amongst

668
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:25,280
The Allied powers that were in the files of The Winter Palace at the Bolsheviks had just taken over

669
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
By making

670
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
What was in those files public

671
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
The Bolsheviks were pulling the

672
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Wikileaks maneuver

673
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,824
Or the Edward Snowden disclosure of their day

674
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
By the way another

675
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Similarity

676
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
To the release of the secret treaties

677
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,760
And the Wikileaks Edward Snowden

678
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
Revelations of of the more modern era

679
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,440
The newspaper in Britain that released the information to British readers

680
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,000
It was the Manchester Guardian

681
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
That published in Britain

682
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
The

683
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
Secret treaty information that Leon Trotsky and the Bolsheviks released of the world

684
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,312
That's the same newspaper in Britain that took the lead almost a hundred years later

685
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
In revealing the Edward Snowden Revelations

686
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Historians Michael nyberg and David Jordan right in their history of the Eastern front in the first World War

687
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Quote

688
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:25,184
The Bolshevik leaders had little interest in working with the capitalist Western allies

689
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,840
They soon publish the text of the secret treaties and diplomatic understanding that they found in the Winter Palace

690
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
And the government archives

691
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,240
These agreements showed French and British support for Russian territorial gain

692
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,824
Especially a turkey's expense with regard to Constantinople

693
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,664
This seemingly revealed with the Bolsheviks have been arguing all along

694
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,992
Namely that the war had been fought for Imperial interests

695
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Not out of self-defense

696
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,112
The publication of these terms embarrassed Allied diplomat

697
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,184
Put claimed in public that no such agreements existed

698
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
This also angered The Americans

699
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,536
Who would advocated a peace without annexations

700
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
And quote

701
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
The new

702
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Bolshevik government

703
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
Began to

704
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,312
Tell generals along the entire front with the Germans and austro-hungarian turksat they should start making

705
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
Local peace treaties that called

706
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
For an armistice

707
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
430 days along the entire front

708
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
All of a sudden

709
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Russia was in the process of dropping out of the war

710
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
Lenin is supposed to have said

711
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
A famous quote

712
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,768
Aptly describes the situation in November 1917 he said quote

713
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
There are decades when nothing have

714
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
And there are weeks when decades happen

715
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
And quote

716
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
And look at the change in Fortune for him

717
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Personally

718
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,616
Six or seven months ago he's living in a rented

719
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Flat

720
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
On the second floor

721
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,736
Next to a Sausage Factory in Switzerland

722
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
Now by November 1917

723
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
He's basically the guy in charge of the largest Nation on Earth

724
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
But this leadership

725
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,048
Is not uncontested a Russian Civil War starts almost immediately

726
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
With the people who

727
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,472
Opposed Lenin in the Bolsheviks and it will go on for several years and be terribly bloody and draw in the great Powers as well

728
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
It also will not include

729
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,896
50 million or more people who are counted as the citizens of old Russia

730
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,736
As some of these territories begin to break away from Russia

731
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Again one of the really

732
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Dangerous things that the new Bolshevik government

733
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Professor

734
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
This is a belief in self determination

735
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,536
Well there are lots of different people who didn't want to be a part of the Russian government

736
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
The fins

737
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Polls

738
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
The ukrainians and others

739
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Who were starting to think maybe they would just leave

740
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
They were far from the only peoples

741
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,384
Who were members of larger State entities around the world

742
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
Who thought that they would like a crack itself

743
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Determination

744
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,344
All these European countries that had colonies were in the same position

745
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
And there was no message more dangerous than the idea

746
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,536
The time it come to perhaps allow all these people to decide for themselves

747
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
Whether they wanted to stay colony

748
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Already

749
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
The plague bacillus

750
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
What's begins to spread

751
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,032
And threaten not just the Allies in the Anton powers

752
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,432
But soon the power that made it possible for linen to get back and start the fire in Russia to begin with

753
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
This is the point in the story

754
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Where

755
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Russia

756
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
And communism

757
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,160
Veer off into their own tail

758
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
A very long complex Tale

759
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,072
It impacts the rest of the 20th century you can easily make the case

760
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
The perhaps the most important

761
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,704
Long term effect of the first World War

762
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,520
Is the collapse of the Russian czar

763
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
An eventual replacement

764
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
By the Bolshevik

765
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
It will eventually lead to Joseph Stalin

766
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
And the horrors of the gulag

767
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
And the Cold War

768
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
There was a wonderfully prophetic line

769
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,208
Around the time of Karl Marx so you can see how long

770
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
Before this time.

771
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Bed

772
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,096
Revolutionary thinkers like bakunin were saying

773
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Quote

774
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
If you took the most Ardent revolutionary

775
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,800
Vested him and absolute power within a year he would be worse than the Tsar himself

776
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
And quote

777
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
And for all his high-minded rhetoric

778
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Very quickly

779
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
Vladimir Lenin

780
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
Was proving a coonan

781
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Right

782
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Play late 1917 early 1918

783
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,232
That side of the Bolsheviks and the Communist Regime in Russia

784
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
Was still

785
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Debatable

786
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
An unknown

787
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
If you actually read their public pronouncements

788
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,264
They look like an almost an ending in hindsight this sounds terrible. Almost a refer

789
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Flexing

790
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,664
Group of idealist who refused to play by the old cynical hard-bitten

791
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
In the rules of the European powers

792
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:11,392
And to get an idea of how difficult it is to figure out you know what's going on there and what these people are like you can look

793
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
Diaries written during the time. Where people try to make sense of what they're seeing in Russia take for example

794
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Evelyn princess

795
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
Lucia and we talked about her before she's in English

796
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
White

797
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,776
I'm in German nobleman living in Germany she kept a diary that's often referred to

798
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
To give sort of an impression

799
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,944
Of what's going on in Germany in the feelings of they having she writes about this new government in Russia

800
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
While the peace negotiations to end the war in the East or going on

801
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
Those negotiations will end up with

802
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
One of the most one-sided treaties in all history

803
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
Call brest-litovsk

804
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:51,840
And the only reason it's so one-sided is that the Bolsheviks were in such danger of getting overthrown before they hit him

805
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
Consolidated power

806
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,264
Did eventually they just agree to one of the worst deals of all time assuming that the Communist Revolution is soon

807
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
Going to come and sweep all these Western European governments in central European governments away anyway

808
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
So who cares what they agree to

809
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
During the negotiations Leon Trotsky

810
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,344
I mean we've also quoted earlier key figure in the Bolshevik

811
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Government

812
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
Is negotiating this deal

813
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,000
Andalusia writes in her diary in January 1918 quote

814
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,608
The brest-litovsk negotiations seem likely to come to nothing

815
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,424
As Trotsky seems to be playing a double part

816
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,800
And people say he's only toying with the central powers to be better able to sow the seeds of sedition

817
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
And Rebellion amongst the West European people

818
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,712
They say that already the German prisoners have been set free in Russia

819
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,808
Common soldiers are being placed in command over their former officers

820
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
She continues quote

821
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,952
There are many different opinions about Trotsky hear some calling him a dreamer

822
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
And ideally

823
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,048
Others abusing him as a bloodthirsty tyrant

824
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,192
Whilst there was a whole class of admirers who declare him to be the greatest man since Christ lived upon the Earth

825
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
And the prophet of a new religion which is to regenerate Mankind and create a new Paradise after the deluge

826
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Loser of the war

827
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,712
Who knows what part this man may be going to play in the future fates of Europe

828
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,296
Some 120 years ago people were saying almost the same things

829
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,600
I'm a certain unknown little officer

830
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
Who are the reign of terror and bloodshed developed into the vampire Emperor who almost succeeded in

831
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
Draining the blood of all Europe

832
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
And quote

833
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,680
She of course is referencing Napoleon who grew out of the French Revolution

834
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:36,800
Two people at the time. That's what the Revolution in Russia kind of resembled

835
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:42,176
And her quite a few similarities they're pointed out by various historian between the French Revolution

836
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
And the Napoleonic era

837
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
And the arrow in the Bolshevik

838
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
Take charge in Russia

839
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
Take for example

840
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,440
One of the stipulations that the Bolsheviks were making during the peace negotiations at brest-litovsk

841
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,536
They wanted their troops to have the right during the negotiations

842
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
To fraternize

843
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,912
With the German and austro-hungarian Soldiers on the other side of no-man's-land

844
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
Why did they want that

845
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
Because they felt that just like Napoleon's troops spreading the ideas the intellectual contagion the sedition

846
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
Of the French revolutionary ideas

847
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,016
To the lands of the Kings and emperors

848
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,088
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century Europe

849
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:26,208
The Bolsheviks assumed that their troops would do the same thing to the Germans in the austro-hungarian

850
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
In early 20th century

851
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,888
Combine that with the impact that the release of the secret treaty agreements was having

852
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,264
And the Russian government the new Russian government the idealistic at least on the surface new Russian government

853
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Was doing

854
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,408
Amazing damage to the Allied war effort by undercutting all the propaganda

855
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
And they had help by the way

856
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,320
The other really idealistic power that was starting to have an impact on the world scene

857
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
What's across the Atlantic

858
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
It was the United States

859
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
Into the hard-bitten

860
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Cynical

861
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,048
Bismarckian realpolitik Europe of that day

862
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,632
It would have been hard for them to decide who was more idealistic

863
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,704
The new Russian Bolshevik government

864
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
Or the American government of Woodrow Wilson

865
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
In a sense though

866
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
It's hard to blame

867
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,480
Britain and France annie's other European powers for the fact

868
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
That they had gone into the war

869
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Making agreements with each other and their allies for carving up this territory or exchanging that tear

870
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,512
Territory that was standard operating procedure

871
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,816
When the war started and had been

872
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,144
You know forever the 19th century was full of those kinds of

873
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
The problem is in just a couple of years

874
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Things have changed

875
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
In so many ways

876
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,920
The first world war at the transitionary. From the 19th to the 20th century and that includes

877
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Things like

878
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
B

879
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
Proper

880
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
And moral justifications for war

881
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
I'm part of the problem is

882
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Dip for 3 years now

883
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
DIYs

884
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,768
To name just one example the Central Powers were doing similar things

885
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
Had made the warframes out to be these

886
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,888
High-minded ideals right

887
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,680
The war to end all wars

888
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,008
I'm making the world safe for democracy

889
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,616
For fighting if you know German militarism I mean there were all these very high-minded ideals

890
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
So when you sell people on those ideas

891
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,064
When they find out that really what those soldiers are dying for is much more pedestrian

892
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
It's hard to square

893
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Those two realities

894
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
In fact

895
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,072
There were Nations involved in the first world war that essentially head

896
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
Join sides with

897
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,448
You know the the alliance that promised them the best outcome

898
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,848
Italy Bulgaria Romania to name just three countries got into this war for no other reason than

899
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,479
In one side of the other promise them some territorial gain that was more than the other side promised

900
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,063
That was a very common reality from the 19th century

901
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,391
Part of what change that animated

902
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Unacceptable

903
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,535
What's the price that Europe was being forced to pay for these territorial Act

904
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Positions

905
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,399
I mean a perfect example is 20 years before this time. Where we are now

906
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:18,751
Instead of 1917 8-19-17 imagineering 1898

907
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
And you're the British army

908
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,127
I'm in an area that's going to become part of you know your

909
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,967
Colonial the territories that you have direct or indirect control over in

910
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
The Modern Nation of Sudan

911
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,575
There's a very big battle called alderman

912
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,695
Bought in 1898 Winston Churchill was there as a very young man his first real exposure to

913
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Peking duck

914
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Battle

915
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,863
Underarm German had about 8000 or so British troops and then they had

916
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
The bunch of Ally

917
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Size of theirs from Egypt

918
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Places like that

919
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,495
Natives

920
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Work as you think of like

921
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,079
Tribesmen butt butt butt troops from

922
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
Egypt

923
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,711
And they were fighting people who were kind of tribesmen a bunch of Sudanese

924
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,111
Under Armour leader in that country more than 50,000 of them show up to this battle against the small group of

925
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
British and British Isles

926
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
And using modern Weaponry including

927
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
Basically machine guns modern rifles I mean it's essentially in a beta version of the first World War army that Britain

928
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
Go to war with and they're fighting guys who have like muskets price

929
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
And in one afternoon

930
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:32,223
Inflict some 30000 or more casualties on the tribesmen and

931
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Folks that they're facing

932
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
10000 dead

933
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
5000 capture the rest wounded

934
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
And the British lose 45

935
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
250

936
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
British soldier

937
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
In the Endeavor

938
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
45

939
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
250

940
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Then they just demolish this native

941
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,215
We are only losing that number of people

942
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
For such great games

943
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
Sometimes you don't

944
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Always

945
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:04,223
Think too much about the deeper questions involved in the cost of the cost isn't that great

946
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
And let's be honest in this era

947
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,855
If those British soldiers have been wiping out

948
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Frenchman

949
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,463
Or Germans or swedes or people like themselves

950
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
There might have been more of an outrage

951
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
It was an ERA where sometimes

952
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,215
The killing of native peoples in other places was not given the same sort of

953
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,287
A sense of horror and outrage that

954
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Killing people who look like

955
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
Yourself

956
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Mike

957
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,175
Engender we all understand how that might work

958
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
And so instead of a battle of omdurman where

959
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
The changing of territory with a relatively

960
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,927
Small affair with relatively few casualties

961
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,535
You don't like 1917 the Germans in the British in just one battle in this war

962
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,399
You know suffer between 200 and 500 thousand casualties each

963
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
You think of deeper

964
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,031
Different more fundamental questions

965
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,567
When you not only suffer

966
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
4 casualties light

967
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,175
But you do so over and over and over again

968
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Again

969
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,271
With no appreciable change nothing certainly worth all that

970
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,647
He began asking fundamental questions about these treaties you wrote and then earlier time in this war

971
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
How many Frenchmen

972
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
Is it worth losing

973
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
To regain the Lost territories of Alsace and Lorraine

974
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
How many German young people is it worth

975
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
To hold on to Belgium

976
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,055
How many austro-hungarian troops are conversely Italian troops

977
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
You know is that particular

978
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Area

979
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Near Trieste

980
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Morris

981
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
How many

982
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,319
Dominion lies in Indian lives in British lives

983
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,159
Is post war British involvement in the Middle East worth

984
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,279
Well if it's the Battle of omdurman and were talking tiny numbers it certainly worth

985
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,351
There's a number that you're going to get to

986
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
When it's not

987
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,495
The first world war challenges a lot of people to ask

988
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
Those kinds of questions

989
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,895
And the people that were operating under the same sort of mentality that would have been present at the Battle of omdurman

990
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,503
Are red-faced when these treaty show up showing that that's just what they're like

991
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
They have

992
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,599
Changed yet and the treaties are going to have to be fulfilled anyway

993
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,159
Meanwhile if you didn't feel bad enough

994
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:24,255
In late 1917 when the Bolsheviks released this information

995
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,863
In January 1918 in part because the Bolsheviks did release this information

996
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
President Woodrow Wilson in the United States release something called

997
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
The Fourteen Points

998
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
Number 14 points

999
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
What is the Bolshevik

1000
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
Move

1001
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,223
It makes the rest of the world look like a bunch of capitalist warmongers is like a left hook

1002
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:50,367
The American move in 1918 in January it's like a right cross right after work

1003
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,951
To all these European old Power cuz the United States hitting from

1004
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,511
From the other side of the idealism scale

1005
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
AR

1006
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:03,423
Suggesting that you should have a war based on things like mutual respect

1007
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:09,567
Woodrow Wilson says nice things for example about the Germans about the Americans in the rest of the world do not begrudge

1008
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,967
The Germans are shot at German greatness and all this kind of stuff another word conciliatory stuff if you're trying to have a deal and make every

1009
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Everybody come to the table

1010
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Feeling like yes we can work together

1011
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,391
But if you're the French and you've already suffered more than a million casualties against these people

1012
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,023
You had a war against them a generation in the past mean you're not really in the mood to be very conciliatory

1013
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
And then Wilson starts talking about stuff that's as idealistic as anything the Bolsheviks are putting out and a lot

1014
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
I have it sounds very similar for example

1015
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,591
Here's how Wilson leads into his 14 points and notice how often he talks about

1016
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
A change

1017
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
In

1018
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
You know

1019
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
What we can maybe call today

1020
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Global public opinion

1021
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,831
Or International morality and values

1022
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,647
He says from the beginning of his statement

1023
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Turn down

1024
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
In history of the Fourteen Points

1025
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Quote

1026
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
It will be our wish and purpose

1027
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
That the processes of peace

1028
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
When they are be gone

1029
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,423
Shall be absolutely open

1030
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,543
Initial involving permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind

1031
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
The day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by

1032
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,687
So is also the day of secret Covenants

1033
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,247
Entered into in the interest of particular government

1034
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,599
And likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the Peace of the world

1035
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,135
It is this happy fact

1036
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
Now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts you're not still linger in an age that is dead and gone

1037
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,423
Which makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with Justice in the Peace of the world

1038
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
To avow

1039
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,775
Nor any other time the object it has in view

1040
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
An event goes into

1041
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,639
You know the kinds of things he's talking about here

1042
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,991
That will make a difference in the postwar world of it everybody should start to agree to

1043
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
He says

1044
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,063
As the number 114

1045
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
Your number one point in the Fourteen Points quote

1046
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
Open covenants of peace

1047
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:07,071
Openly arrived at after which there shall be no private International understandings of any kind

1048
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,631
But diplomacy shall proceed always

1049
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Frankly and in the public View

1050
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
And quote

1051
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
Can you imagine

1052
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
Even the governments of our world today

1053
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
Even talking about doing that

1054
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:27,295
The idea that you should have treaties with other countries and all the agreement should be public and open to everyone. I mean

1055
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,599
That's radical stuff even today

1056
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
It sounded every bit like what the Bolsheviks were calling for

1057
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,999
And all of a sudden you have Old Europe

1058
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,607
The three for five years ago was sitting at the height of its Fame everything was fine

1059
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
And now they've got this on both sides of them

1060
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
Powerful Nations

1061
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
It's a real change in Attitude

1062
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
As I said though

1063
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
It's not going to be allowed to

1064
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
2 Chainz

1065
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,663
Agreements that countries have between each other

1066
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:58,271
And the juiciest stuff that came out of the secret treaty released

1067
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
The Edward Snowden like dump

1068
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,111
The Manchester Guardian another's

1069
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Was the

1070
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
Treaties that have been

1071
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,023
Sign some of them as late as 1916 the most famous is known as

1072
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
The sykes-picot agreement but there are others

1073
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,751
Catalog the great Powers plan for ripping apart the Ottoman Empire the great powers on the owl

1074
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031
Allied side won the war

1075
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
They were going to go totally Imperial

1076
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
The old Empire

1077
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Meijer

1078
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,967
The Russians were going to finally after hundreds of years of wanting it to get

1079
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,759
Constantinople

1080
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,319
Istanbul later

1081
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
Byzantium Once Upon a Time

1082
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
This great City that controls

1083
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,719
Are the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus and the

1084
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,559
You know the access to the Black Sea would be a huge to

1085
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,399
The Russians were prevented from doing this by the very British and French

1086
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,959
That they were now negotiating with to get it

1087
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
In the 1850s in the Crimean War

1088
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,919
Which propped up the Ottoman Empire for another generation but now the Russians were on the same side as the French and the British they had all the

1089
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:02,271
Decided that the Ottomans had to go and they were all going to agree on what pieces they got

1090
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,879
Now the payoff for the Russians getting Constantinople the regions around that

1091
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:11,231
Was that the French and the British we get to carve up much of what is now the modern middle

1092
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,119
I just don't write me to email I know that even saying the term Middle East

1093
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,191
Is a reference to their colonial past in that region

1094
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:24,543
Because really if you were going to announce it properly should call it West Asia

1095
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,919
Or something like that but that doesn't really didn't know the exact area you're talking about you can get into the

1096
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:36,063
The area's I bet you could take the Levant or Anatolia for Mesopotamia but those are all just pieces of

1097
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,671
The term Middle East and Compasses so I apologize I know it's not the right phrase

1098
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:47,071
Nonetheless we all know what we mean and certainly if we're going to talk about the era where Middle East becomes the colonial term for the era

1099
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,655
Why not start with the arrow where it becomes a colonial possession

1100
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,447
4 non-islamic powers

1101
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,335
The sykes-picot agreement and others have France carving up large chunks of the modern Arab world

1102
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
And the British

1103
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,407
Taking Northern Iraq

1104
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
And I mean

1105
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
They're breathtaking

1106
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
They really are and when

1107
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
The Bolsheviks release the secret treaties and the ottoman government reads the secret treaties to their own

1108
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
In a group of

1109
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,839
Knoebels is the wrong word but governmental ministers

1110
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
Eugene Rogan says in his book

1111
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,727
That there's this audible gasp as they here

1112
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,055
The plans that France and Britain and Russia have

1113
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
You know for the future of the Ottoman

1114
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,175
It's not going to be a slap-on-the-wrist it's going to be dismemberment

1115
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,831
And the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire is what creates the modern Middle Eastern world

1116
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
It is still such a part of our lives today

1117
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,487
I said earlier that the Bolshevik Revolution was probably the top

1118
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Your long lasting

1119
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,583
Aftershock in the first world war but maybe

1120
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,143
It's better to say that there's a list of three or four

1121
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
Possible

1122
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,495
Lehman's to the throne if you will and maybe another one is

1123
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
The changes that

1124
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,663
Are created in the Middle East because the Ottoman Empire is broken up

1125
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
Let's remember this is a 6

1126
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Hundred

1127
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Year old

1128
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Hard to

1129
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
Overstate how long

1130
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Structures

1131
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
And the type of rule by the ottoman impacted that area

1132
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,023
First of all it was a large area that was under

1133
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
Muslim control with a caliphate on paper at least and the leader of the religion at least the soon

1134
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,471
Any branch of it in Turkey

1135
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,823
The Turks ruled that region with an iron fist

1136
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
And yet at the same time

1137
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
It was

1138
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:42,015
In the process of having huge debates over modernization and keeping up with the rest of the world

1139
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:48,415
And they were just a few years from finding out that they sat atop some of the Worlds

1140
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,231
Greatest deposits of oil on the planet

1141
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
Which some more

1142
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
Conspiratorial historians

1143
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,703
Will will weave into the story and point out that it wasn't an accident that the French and the British for example word aside

1144
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,775
Adding that it was worth tearing up the Ottoman Empire at this point

1145
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
But if they hadn't

1146
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
And somehow the Ottoman Empire existed another 10 or 20 years

1147
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
Think about

1148
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
The Inheritance it was about to come into

1149
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,063
As a giant

1150
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
Multi-ethnic

1151
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
Islamic State

1152
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
With oil wealth

1153
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,327
Coming into the tummy it's fascinating to ponder how different the world might be

1154
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:34,239
But if you remember of the government of Ottoman turkey when you hear the news about how you're going to be dismembered

1155
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
As part of the secret agreements to become public

1156
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
You're getting that information

1157
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,919
About a week maybe even a little less

1158
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Then a week

1159
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,831
On the heels of some other information that sort of should have warned you that this was coming because everybody

1160
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Awoke

1161
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,695
To a declaration that was published on November 2nd 1917

1162
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
It appears in the bunch of newspapers and kind of went viral like

1163
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
You can say by the standards of the early 20th century

1164
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
And the statement said this

1165
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Quote

1166
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:08,543
His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home

1167
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
For the Jewish people

1168
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,175
And will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object

1169
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,831
It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may Prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing now

1170
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,879
Non Jewish communities in Palestine

1171
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,719
For the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other countries

1172
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
And quote

1173
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
She gets out of November 2nd

1174
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
You got the news on the 8th of 9th

1175
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,215
You know about the sykes-picot agreement in the others that that don't just tear up

1176
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,591
Your Empire and give it to the Victorious Powers if they're going to be victorious that's still up in the air

1177
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
But also

1178
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,687
Gives it to people who are currently

1179
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,759
In your Empire now most notably

1180
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Arab people

1181
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,647
In a very similar move to what the Germans have done when they sent

1182
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
Vladimir Lenin

1183
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:02,303
To go into Russia and destabilize that country the British have been working with

1184
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
Subjects of the Ottoman Empire and encouraging them to Rebel

1185
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
There were a couple of important Arab tribal leaders

1186
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,127
They were already sort of thinking along those lines and may have had contact with the British even before war broke out

1187
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
Who buy 1950-1960 we're convinced

1188
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,759
To rebel against the ottoman Overlord

1189
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,295
They had a lot of British help

1190
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,879
They eventually went from a bunch of ragtag gorillas

1191
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,279
To a relatively nasty gorilla forest in the region although the impact that they had on the war has been hard

1192
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,815
Target about forever with historian

1193
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,863
It's a very colorful story involves

1194
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,263
This person is called Lawrence of Arabia they made a movie about him but there's a lot more to that including the most important

1195
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,567
People which released to tribal families

1196
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
The British were able to convince

1197
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
2

1198
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
Rebelled against the Ottomans

1199
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,991
Both of whom were important 1 control.

1200
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
The area around Mecca

1201
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,575
The other had a name that

1202
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:02,975
Now Graces the front of the country that occupies the Arabian Peninsula Saudi

1203
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
Any other family

1204
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,839
Put Kings on the Thrones of multiple

1205
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,167
Post World War 1 Middle Eastern Nations

1206
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
The kings of a rock came from this family

1207
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,103
The kings of places like Jordan the current king of Jordan is a descendant of this family

1208
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,151
And that power emanated

1209
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,247
From this first world war throwing their lot in

1210
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
With the allies

1211
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
And then

1212
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,415
You're reaping the reward now it should be pointed out

1213
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,207
That's the reward

1214
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,279
Was not with a plan in the British after the war

1215
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,351
Found themselves in a rather uncomfortable position

1216
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,423
When they realize that they had promised multiple things

1217
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
To multiple people

1218
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
And often times it was the same stuff

1219
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,127
This will lead to some embarrassing moments after the war

1220
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,735
Over questions about fine printed what was really said and meant

1221
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,295
Sir Henry Wilson who is the chief

1222
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,879
Of the Imperial general staff in 1919 will tell another

1223
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
British general

1224
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
Quote

1225
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,535
We've made so many promises to everybody in a contradictory sense

1226
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:14,655
That I cannot for the life of me see how we can get out of our present mess without breaking our word to somebody

1227
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
And quote

1228
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
And it's easy to see

1229
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,591
Why the Arabs have been promised things and what what it was hope that they would do the Rebellion

1230
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,943
What's been more argued about in his more interesting for his stories of trying to figure out

1231
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
You know what was

1232
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,039
What was to be achieved by the Balfour Declaration

1233
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Duration

1234
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:38,207
And there were so many different rationales that have been put forward that could be a study and interesting show in and of itself

1235
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,791
I didn't run the gamut to from people who are suggesting that

1236
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,095
The reason the British throw their weight behind

1237
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:49,471
You know what Jewish homeland in Palestine have to do a personal relationship with a Jewish guy who helped

1238
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,263
You know make it easier to create

1239
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
A weapon

1240
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:59,455
There's another theory that it was hope that they could have ate that the British wanted a friendly people to occupy this important area

1241
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,807
Just want to help guard Britain's Imperial possessions in places like India

1242
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,647
But my favorite of the many many theories out there for Wylie

1243
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,463
Balfour Declaration this important

1244
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
Benchmark moment in the history of modern Zionism happened

1245
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,095
My favorite is the anti-Semitic

1246
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,911
Reason that it might have happened if some people put forward

1247
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,775
Which is that there were both a combination of real anti-semites out there

1248
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,103
And people who were pretty educated in pretty sure

1249
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,895
It was just a Canard

1250
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,455
When people said that Jews ruled the world

1251
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
But just in case it wasn't

1252
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,575
Wouldn't it be worth it just to be on the safe side

1253
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,159
If we made sure that Jewish public interest the world over

1254
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
Was on our side

1255
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
In Factory

1256
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,279
British were even worried about rumors

1257
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:51,679
That the Germans were going to offer the Jews a Homeland if Jews sort of signed on with the German cause

1258
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:56,287
And so in an effort to make sure that if the Jews control the world they were on our side

1259
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
That we were going to have

1260
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
A statement made that said we supported

1261
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
A return

1262
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,735
To Palestine for Jewish folks I love that without. Just

1263
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,551
That's the most perverse of all the excuses but none the less

1264
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
What is did

1265
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
What's a c

1266
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,231
That later on we all understand will grow into

1267
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,791
In the modern Middle East that we have today

1268
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
There's also that one other

1269
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Little

1270
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Element

1271
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Of course

1272
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
Frasier role in this

1273
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Story week

1274
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
Mentioned it a little bit ago

1275
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,591
The turns this region from

1276
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,383
You know what you easily could have

1277
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:38,271
Suggested might be a Backwater in the middle of nowhere after the war was over with some

1278
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
Important religious

1279
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
Sacred sites and whatnot but not much going on the way resources were value or anything where the great powers on the world

1280
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,743
Old Stage with care much for this area

1281
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
And instead trance

1282
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Forms this region

1283
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Into perhaps

1284
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,703
The most strategically valuable spot on the

1285
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
It's because all of a sudden

1286
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,079
The world realizes

1287
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
The importance that

1288
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Oil

1289
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Petroleum

1290
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,967
Who's going to play in the 20th century world

1291
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
And everybody sort of realize it at the

1292
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
The same time

1293
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
It's one of my favorite parts of the

1294
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,671
More storage so hard to figure out

1295
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
What people knew when

1296
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
There had been vision

1297
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,815
Is all throughout the development

1298
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,655
Of the twentieth century realization that oil was going to be

1299
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Be huge

1300
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
When they start pumping this stuff

1301
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,311
In the 1840s and 1850s 1860s and a bunch of different places

1302
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:38,687
And refining it in the main reason it's important in the 1800 remember the 1800

1303
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,575
Is part of the Industrial Revolution the Industrial Revolution was a revolution that functioned

1304
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
Mostly with cold

1305
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
Is the energy source although steam was also use

1306
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
The people that are

1307
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:57,119
Making the decisions in the first world war going to be men in age groups who grew up

1308
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
In the world

1309
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Powered by

1310
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
Coal and steam

1311
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:05,311
Oil was becoming quite valuable but for different reasons than

1312
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Energy

1313
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:11,967
Well I guess you could still say was energy was it was in the illumination Source in a lot of places that used it

1314
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
4 light

1315
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,575
They also used it for lubrication and oil

1316
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,903
But people did not foresee

1317
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
What maybe youku

1318
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Tikal

1319
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,511
The vehicular Revolution

1320
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,583
That the first world war was so plainly

1321
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,167
So to put on steroids it was coming anyway but you know how Wharton

1322
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Technological

1323
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
The progress

1324
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
Because

1325
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
Well it's life or death

1326
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:41,919
One of the famous stories of the first World War Z the famous battle of the Marne the story of the taxi cabs

1327
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Paris

1328
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
Lining up to

1329
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,527
Ferry troops to the very hot

1330
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:51,135
Spot on the Battlefront that was in near danger of breaking this is all a romantic story that

1331
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Helps illustrate

1332
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,743
One of the really early Trans in the first world war the use of

1333
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Vehicle

1334
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,839
How to change the situation on the battlefield

1335
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:05,215
We're all human history men have either been walking themselves or utilizing

1336
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,263
Are natural animal power

1337
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,871
In this battle they were starting to use things that were powered by gasoline

1338
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
And you would go from

1339
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
Cars in taxi cab

1340
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Two trucks

1341
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Two tanks

1342
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
You have aircraft

1343
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:24,927
Try to imagine and I'm sure Leonardo DaVinci could do a great sketch of it in the Renaissance

1344
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,463
Try to imagine

1345
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
Aircraft

1346
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
That work

1347
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Cole

1348
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,303
Or steam power

1349
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
You kind of needed this

1350
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
Dance

1351
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,495
Portable energy source that became part of internal combustion engines

1352
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
And all this stuff sort of happened

1353
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
During the war

1354
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
The Visionaries

1355
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,455
I've been people like Churchill who it said

1356
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,991
Convert the British Fleet

1357
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
2 oil burning instead of coal

1358
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
He was ahead of his time

1359
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,671
In like 1908 the British government was making deals with

1360
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:03,071
Oil Company in Iran for the anglo-persian oil company was very powerful and very important for a long time but once again

1361
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
Indian shows

1362
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,887
That some people were on top of this

1363
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Or

1364
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
Play some historians who suggested

1365
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,591
They may have just been doing this for the lubrication and illumination value they may not have foreseen the vehicular Revolution either

1366
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Once it

1367
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Strikes

1368
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,479
You know even people who are doll that Visionary can see oh my gosh

1369
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,319
Peanut oil is the coal of the 20th century

1370
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
And I often think to myself you know

1371
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:32,255
If you found the oil of the 21st century some clean-burning

1372
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
Immensely wonderful replacement to oil they could do all these fantastic things but it only appeared

1373
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:43,007
In a few separate isolated regions around the globe

1374
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
What do you think

1375
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:48,127
The governments of the world would do today about that

1376
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
I mean here I've been critical of the great powers

1377
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
For some of the horse Trading

1378
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
That was apparent in all their War

1379
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,391
I have probably overemphasized

1380
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,951
Not to agree considering how much geopolitics

1381
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Did play a role in

1382
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
Economics did play Roll

1383
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:10,399
The first world war had a lot of reasons and the reasons that countries got into it had a lot of different causes a nuances as well

1384
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
What is the horse

1385
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
Trading nature of territories

1386
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
It seems to stand out

1387
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
So much to Modern sensibilities

1388
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
It does make me think however

1389
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,479
But if that 21st century version of oil

1390
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
We're found tomorrow

1391
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
But in limited

1392
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,343
Amounting in limited areas

1393
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,927
I do wonder whether our governments would act any

1394
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,791
Differently in terms of the way they would approach it then that first world war leadership

1395
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
If anything

1396
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,703
I would imagine that what they learn from the first world war is not what to do or what

1397
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,727
What not to do

1398
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,055
But perhaps have a better sense of how you justify

1399
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Why what you do

1400
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:56,223
In the first World War II our modern sensibilities into the changing sensibilities of the time

1401
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,783
It all seemed a little too naked sometime

1402
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
Once it was exposed to the light of day

1403
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,159
And yet it's hard to blame any of these

1404
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
Powers

1405
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,487
For doing whatever it took

1406
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,559
To see to it that you could get yourself

1407
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Some of this new

1408
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,143
20th century version of

1409
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Cole

1410
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,727
Because it could literally be a matter of

1411
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263
Life or death

1412
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,311
In terms of remaining a great power

1413
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,175
And as normally happens in the lottery for natural resources

1414
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
Some places were blessed with lots of this stuff

1415
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
And other places with almost nine

1416
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,135
The United States is one of the first places where

1417
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
The first great

1418
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,207
Minister Saudi Arabia

1419
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,279
The first great oil boom in the United States they fighted

1420
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
Pennsylvania initially

1421
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
And then in a ton of other

1422
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,191
The United States is one of the great oil-producing nations of all time

1423
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,287
And they really come into their own right when the oil really takes

1424
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,847
Very very late 1800 early 90

1425
01:06:56,127 --> 01:07:00,223
Russia also has some wonderful reserves that have been underdeveloped

1426
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,295
From very early on in Baku and places in what's now

1427
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Parts of Azerbaijan

1428
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,439
And the problem they were having a course of this Bolshevik Revolution a lot of these

1429
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,791
I'm out of the way places on the Russian periphery we're deciding maybe to go

1430
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
On their own

1431
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
And take the oil with them so

1432
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
Temporary problems

1433
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,495
Are the Russians in Baku but what that does is create

1434
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,335
A situation where there's a giant wonderful

1435
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,127
Supply of oil

1436
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,991
Sitting there with no big government controlling it temporarily cuz the Bolsheviks

1437
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:36,575
Allow their whole thing is in disorder and they're trying to get a handle on things in there

1438
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,391
Preaching self-determination people are taking them up on the offer

1439
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:44,255
Baku was all of a sudden you going to break away and become part of some maybe azerbaijani state

1440
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,303
That is just too much of a

1441
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:50,655
Temptation for a bunch of great powers that look at it and think

1442
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,215
I bet I could get there with an army

1443
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,031
If I tried hard enough and what if we could seize

1444
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,823
The oil fields of Baku

1445
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,127
The only other good source

1446
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
Anywhere around Europe was in Romania

1447
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:08,575
And about 1917 all the great Powers realize we got to get ourselves some oil

1448
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,975
And the British and the French and the Germans 3 of The Great powers on the world stage when the first World War started

1449
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,511
Some have good access to large

1450
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
Amount of oil

1451
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
It's hard

1452
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,911
To suggest that there is any

1453
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,751
Bigger National Security concern for those Nations at this point

1454
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
Then to secure themselves a supply

1455
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,359
Of this centuries

1456
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Great

1457
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,199
Energy source in the one that's needed to power

1458
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,295
The most cutting-edge weapons that you need to win any War

1459
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
Easy to be critical

1460
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
Are these people pursuing these kinds of policies

1461
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
Look at what the stakes are

1462
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,071
And from a purely realpolitik

1463
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
Down and dirty

1464
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,399
Standard

1465
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:59,263
The arguments for imperialism in this case make a certain kind of sense

1466
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,335
I mean what they're saying for example

1467
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,687
Amongst British politician some of whom do not want to go in

1468
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
And control these areas

1469
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,831
Is the prime minister before the current prime minister in 1917 Herbert Asquith

1470
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:19,487
And he didn't want anything to do with this region and all of his problems and factionalism I mean the Arab tribes that were fighting

1471
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
Fighting on Britain's side as part of the Arab revolt

1472
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:27,935
We're only part of the Arabs out there they were a lot of other air was it were very loyal to the ottoman government you had

1473
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Sunni and Shiite

1474
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,799
Issues to deal with a mean to to a square that looks like a hornet

1475
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,663
But he had a hard time fighting against the people on the other side of the argument

1476
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
Who are making the point

1477
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,759
That you were then going to Simply

1478
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Feed

1479
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:46,367
Whatever could be taken from the Ottomans once they were gone

1480
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,671
To your great power rivals

1481
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,255
When the French will go in there and take the oil perhaps and then

1482
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:57,119
They're strengthened while you are weakened and you don't have any access to the

1483
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,167
Cole of the 20th century

1484
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:06,079
As Asquith eventually said you know he said quote if we were to leave the other nations to scramble

1485
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
For turkey without taking anything ourselves

1486
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,431
We should not be doing our duty

1487
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
And quote

1488
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Well if

1489
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,599
Not having access to your own oil

1490
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,135
I meant that your country would

1491
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Ball

1492
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
To a second-class status

1493
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
I think there would have been a lot of

1494
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
People in Britain

1495
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,071
A democratic government

1496
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,655
Who would have said that it was their politicians Duty

1497
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
To see that that didn't happen

1498
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,543
Now the last time we checked in with the story

1499
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:43,199
In the Middle East and all that area concerning the Ottomans fighting against the British in the French and the British Dominion troops

1500
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,479
Places like India

1501
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
At South Africa and Australia and New Zealand and places like that

1502
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,879
Did the war hadn't been going particularly well

1503
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:57,535
The Turks were tough they put up a pretty darn good resistance for a country that was supposed to be basically done

1504
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:03,423
Having just bought a couple of Wars previously economics were in the disaster in everything

1505
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
And instead the Turks put up a pretty darn

1506
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,799
Spirit of resistance they've got the Germans in there helping them to

1507
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:15,199
You're modernize a little here and there and the British simply were not prepared and who could be for the logistic

1508
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,735
Nicole challenges

1509
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,039
The trying to maintain large armies

1510
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:23,135
Which the British did intend to maintain in the field anyway throughout their history

1511
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
In the middle of the desert

1512
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,743
The challenges were huge the church were tough

1513
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
The British

1514
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:34,143
Essentially had to retreat from Gallipoli that got trapped in a place called cook like we told you

1515
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,191
In an earlier episode and had to surrender

1516
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,775
It was not exactly their finest hour but in their defense

1517
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,615
Most of their effort is in the meat grinder area on the Western Front

1518
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
This is an area that

1519
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,735
Some people referred to as a sideshow

1520
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
And this gets back to the argument we

1521
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
Mentioned earlier

1522
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,135
Are between those in the Allied camp

1523
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,207
They called themselves were called westerners

1524
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
And the others who were called Easter

1525
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,911
People whose idea said that the Western Front the meat grinders is the focal point of the war it's going to be the side

1526
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
I did there

1527
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,519
So taking troops and sending them to any other part of the war

1528
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
Is

1529
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,639
To work against what you need to be doing which is breaking through at the key point

1530
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:23,551
The other group The easterners believed that throwing troops into the meat grinder where things were stalemated was

1531
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
Calais waste of lives

1532
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:31,487
When there were vulnerable points all on the rest of the map that could be exploited

1533
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,535
Easier places to go

1534
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:38,399
Winston Churchill in the second world war was always looking for the soft underbelly of Europe

1535
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,799
What's the weight of phrase was turned in the first world war there were easterners looking for the soft underbelly of Europe

1536
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
And

1537
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,151
Best argument I ever heard for who was right

1538
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,479
Because I was looking at Lloyd George's Memoir the other day end

1539
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:58,879
20 years after the war he still justifying and wagging a finger in the face of the western you're saying we were right

1540
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,183
And the westerners are saying that they were right

1541
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,487
The German general

1542
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
Ludendorff it pointed out that yes

1543
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,887
The west and the Western Front meat grinder was where the war would be decided

1544
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,167
But if there was a kid

1545
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,495
Astrophe on any of the other fronts in the war

1546
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:19,103
That that would impact German power on the Western Front leading to a loss there

1547
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,639
So that they were interconnected

1548
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,247
All these non Western Front battles are sideshows

1549
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,039
Unless those fronts

1550
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
And then it's a disaster

1551
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,695
In 1917 the British who have changed generals

1552
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:37,535
And who have now put a meticulous effort into

1553
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Just

1554
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:44,703
Slowly but surely building up the infrastructure that you need to maintain an Army in the field every just think of the

1555
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,751
Pipelines of water

1556
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:53,407
Did they build from miles upon miles of her miles to go out to where the troops are going to have to be in Trench

1557
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:59,551
Give me the amount of effort that's required the buildup of troops and everything else but by 1917

1558
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
They begin to push the Turks back every way

1559
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,719
Do your 1917 and especially the latter half of the year

1560
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,767
Cease multiple victories

1561
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,071
On the part of the British LED Allied Forces in

1562
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,119
Places like Mesopotamia and Palestine

1563
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
Lots of

1564
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Outflanking some wonderfully

1565
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
Clever

1566
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,287
Spy Maneuvers and some

1567
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Fantastic

1568
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,871
Bravery in audacity on the part of

1569
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,199
Some of these Dominion mounted infantry forces for example

1570
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,271
End up creating a situation where

1571
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,087
The British High command can see Jerusalem

1572
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,183
The holy city of holy cities right sacred to at least three major

1573
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
Religions Islam

1574
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,095
Christianity and Judaism thinking see Jerusalem within range and they know that they're going to take it if this

1575
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,887
Your momentum continues

1576
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,167
But after

1577
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
Dealing with passchendaele in the mud in the blood of the shock in the sense of never-ending War which just wraps up in me

1578
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Mid November

1579
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
Boy George ass

1580
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,175
British general Allenby

1581
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,991
If you can manage to capture the holy city by Christmas

1582
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
Says it will be a great Christmas present

1583
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
A little pick-me-up

1584
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
If you will

1585
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,159
After all of the horrible

1586
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
Lloyd George gets his wish granted

1587
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
On December 11th

1588
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,631
With the British and Allied Forces already in the city

1589
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:22,239
They receive a surrender notice from the Turkish representative

1590
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
Who writes quote

1591
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,687
Due to the severity of the siege of the city and the suffering that this peaceful country has endured from your heavy

1592
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,039
Guns and for fear that these deadly bombs will hit the holy places

1593
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,599
We are forced to hand over to you the city

1594
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,415
True saying Al hussaini the mayor of Jerusalem

1595
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,719
Hoping that you will protect Jerusalem

1596
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,791
The way we have protected it for more than 500 years

1597
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
And quote

1598
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,167
Doesn't that note

1599
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,727
Sort of Bring It All home in terms of

1600
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
The immense age of some of these

1601
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
Nation-states that we're dealing with here

1602
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,175
There's a ton of irony and symbolism

1603
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:05,247
When the Allied Forces captured Jerusalem

1604
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039
Start with the fact

1605
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,855
That Christians and captured Jerusalem before

1606
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,927
In 1099 during the First Crusade

1607
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,487
Was a very big deal at the time

1608
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Followed by a terrible Massacre but the Christians managed

1609
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
To hold the city for a couple hundred years

1610
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
Islamic General Saladin the Great

1611
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,959
Record by the way

1612
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,543
Will retake the city during the third crusade in the late 1200

1613
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:35,199
There will be a major crusade in the Middle Ages launched against these very ottomans

1614
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,991
You know when there are a lot

1615
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,783
Younger and more vigorous of an m

1616
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
And now Christian forces

1617
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,183
For once again moving into this city

1618
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Propaganda

1619
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Possibilities of an event like this are huge

1620
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,959
But it also has some real-world post-war implications you know that old line that

1621
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,775
Possession is 9/10 of the law

1622
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,847
Well that will certainly be the case after the war

1623
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,639
When the British are involved in

1624
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,967
Not always wonderfully nice negotiations with the French

1625
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:11,295
And people who are locals in that region over who gets what

1626
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,879
There have been some agreements during the war that

1627
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,695
Palestine and Jerusalem should be internationalized

1628
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,071
The British didn't like that idea as much after the war and since they were the ones governing

1629
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,887
There since December 1917

1630
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:31,519
Gave them a unique ability to decide how things were going to go so important in a real-world sense to

1631
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,079
The entire affair

1632
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,895
And its importance of the entry into this

1633
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:40,991
Holiest of cities was understood and Stage managed to degree

1634
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,039
The British government had some

1635
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,367
Ideas on the way we would say today the Optics

1636
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
With a visual should go

1637
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,999
In 1898 the German Emperor the Kaiser had visited

1638
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:57,119
Jerusalem again with lots of visuals and Optics and lots of photographs and lots of propaganda

1639
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
Benefits for doing so and he

1640
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
Kind of

1641
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:07,103
Offended some of the religious Folks by not really seeming humble enough in the face of evil such intense sacred

1642
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:07,871
Vesper

1643
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Yeah three of them

1644
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,175
Top religions on the planet

1645
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:15,551
It was even a story that the Turks had to destroy a part of the ancient old

1646
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,855
You know Israeli part of the walls

1647
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,719
To make room for the Kaiser's car so we so we can bring the car in whether or not that

1648
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,559
True it certainly made him look bad and before Allenby

1649
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,191
Becomes the first Christian conqueror in more than 500 years to walk into Jerusalem

1650
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
He gets a little advice from British general

1651
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Robertson

1652
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
Who tells him in a telegram quote

1653
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:45,759
In the event of Jerusalem being occupied it would be a considerable political importance if you want to

1654
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
Officially entering the city

1655
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
Dismount at The City Gate

1656
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,623
And enter on foot

1657
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:56,255
German Emperor Road in Ennis and went around a better man than he walked

1658
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,583
Advantage of contrasting conduct will be obvious

1659
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
And quote

1660
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,471
By December 1917

1661
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,847
It looks as though it won't take a whole lot for the British in the French and the Dominion forces

1662
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
To strike

1663
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
At the Turks and just sort of

1664
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,223
Push the entire house of cards over

1665
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
In some ways the Turks are.

1666
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,111
Doing themselves any good because when the Russians pull out of the war

1667
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,207
It leaves a ton of territories that have lots of Turks in it

1668
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,863
The open for Turkish conquest and the Turks are sending armies that might be better used against the British in the French

1669
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,727
Into this territory were places like Armenia and Azerbaijan and all those places are

1670
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,567
In order to get new territory while they're losing old territory

1671
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,151
Nonetheless whether or not the French and the British can just

1672
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,223
Pushover the house of cards now becomes a bit of a moot point

1673
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,783
Because very early in 2-19-18

1674
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,623
When the finishing touches on any idea to do that would have to be in play

1675
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
All of a sudden

1676
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Everything

1677
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Is

1678
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
Needed back on the Western Front

1679
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:07,167
Allen bees going to have his forces his best forces ripped from him and no reinforcements or extra forces added

1680
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,447
Because all of a sudden

1681
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,751
Just when everything look like

1682
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,080
The United States was going to come in and turn the tide of the war

1683
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,920
The Germans attempt to turn the tide of the war first

1684
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,248
And we mentioned before

1685
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,808
The real differences in sodas

1686
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,368
The feeling the ebb and the flow in the Rhythm

1687
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
Of the two World Wars

1688
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
The first and the second world

1689
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
In the Second World War

1690
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
There was a certain point where

1691
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,608
Where the outcome of the war was no longer in doubt

1692
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,144
But it was quite a ways

1693
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,448
Between that moment and the end of the war

1694
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
It's probably safe to say like

1695
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,800
Late 1943

1696
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,384
Everyone knows that the Germans in their side or not winning that

1697
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,944
No one knows how many people are going to have to dive

1698
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Before the outcome is finally settled

1699
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:56,064
But everyone knows what the outcome going to be you can concoct some

1700
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,464
Real real long shot scenarios where the Germans for example get Atomic weapons first or something like that and changed the course of history

1701
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
But by and large

1702
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
It was a moot point

1703
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,072
Past a certain age

1704
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Probably 843

1705
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:08,864
I said

1706
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,680
The first Wars Rhythm was completely unlike that

1707
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
There were

1708
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,752
Yeah if you wanted to say

1709
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:21,408
Who had the advantage most of the time it was the Allied on Time force if you don't continually putting their weight on the

1710
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
The other side wearing them down

1711
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:28,832
But the other side led by Germany would strike out and lash out at certain times with huge blows

1712
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,648
End of the easily could have knocked the other side

1713
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,232
The last of these Germany throws

1714
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:41,632
In early 1918 even the members of German easy to Upper military castricone

1715
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:42,912
The last

1716
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
Card

1717
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,520
Now I have to set a few things up before we understand about this lab

1718
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Card situation

1719
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,360
The first is understanding with the Warriors

1720
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,456
Germany's got some good stuff happening and some bad stuff

1721
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,504
We just mentioned one of the bad things

1722
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,856
The situation with their Turkish Ally in the Middle East is starting to turn for the worst

1723
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,672
Write the latter part of 1917 not so great

1724
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,000
But that is offset by good things would have been happy

1725
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,864
In that same time. We said is so important October November December 1917

1726
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:19,520
The German send actually not that much but it made a big difference some help to their austro-hungarian allies you been

1727
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Fighting Italians

1728
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
Forever

1729
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,384
In the region of the river is Sansa

1730
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,200
They have had 11 battle

1731
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,504
Girls of the isonzo to this point in the war

1732
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,064
So you can tell how much things are moving

1733
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
Right at the stalemate

1734
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,648
Is Alpine peach in their cutting

1735
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:40,256
Hideout into the ice it's this crazy Alpine War they're fighting

1736
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:45,888
Both sides are really tired in the Italian troops are really tired of of the guy who's been running the show for

1737
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,168
Dollar General in charge of

1738
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,472
Of their effort he's really sort of

1739
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,312
A stickler and they've had it with him and they've been they've been

1740
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,360
Like their austro-hungarian enemies

1741
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,152
Putting up with a lot for years

1742
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,968
There's a lot of Senseless death certificate has been terrible

1743
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
And then all of a sudden the German send

1744
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:06,624
You know seven or eight divisions there to act as sort of The Cutting Edge of another offencive

1745
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
The 12th

1746
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,184
I songs o

1747
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
But it gets

1748
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:16,352
Known by a different name because it stands out from the other eleven battles of the isonzo it's often called The Battle of corporate

1749
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,912
The reason that stands out from the other

1750
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,448
Battles of the isonzo

1751
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,008
Is because this time something decisive have

1752
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
The Italian

1753
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,848
Get smashed

1754
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,664
And who can blame them the Germans are

1755
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,760
Once again using an even more perfected version of new tact

1756
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
And new artillery methods

1757
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:42,464
And we said before what you're quickly watching occur in the four years of the first Warrior watching these armies transfer

1758
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,768
Form from something more like

1759
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:48,096
You know the franco-prussian war in the 1870s

1760
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
Just something more like

1761
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
The Second World War

1762
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
And you can see it

1763
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:59,616
As the tactics develop year after year from stupidly walking in the machine gun fire in order Rose of men to wear

1764
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:06,016
Infiltration tactics are taking over and you're beginning to see a lot of the same methods being employed by

1765
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,808
These armies for the very first time

1766
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,624
Did every army in the world still uses today involve

1767
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,672
Fire and movement the mutual support

1768
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,464
Bypassing strong point

1769
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,768
From the Germans do this

1770
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,304
To the poor Italians

1771
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
And the Italians get

1772
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,400
I mean 300 thousand people surrender

1773
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,680
That's how bad it is

1774
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
And yet

1775
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:30,080
The Italians are able to move like 60 miles back reform their lines

1776
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:35,200
Keep from falling apart totally and await helping the British in the French you have to take

1777
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,504
You know troops again from the Western Front

1778
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,576
To bolster the other area but what it means is

1779
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,624
By the end of 1917

1780
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,928
The Germans have not

1781
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,304
Out a bunch of their opponents in this war when you look at how they started the war with all these enemies against them

1782
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,328
Look at what they've done

1783
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,144
1959 knockout Serbia

1784
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,472
In 1916 they knockout Romania

1785
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:01,312
In 1917 they just knocked out Russia

1786
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
From the war

1787
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
And given

1788
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:07,712
Italy such a bloody lip that nothing is going to happen down there for

1789
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
While

1790
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,552
But now in early 1918

1791
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,856
For the first time in the war

1792
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904
The Germans face

1793
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,696
The British and the French

1794
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
Without

1795
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
A whole lot of distractions

1796
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
They don't have the Russians on the other side

1797
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
And

1798
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
They have

1799
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,960
A small window of opportunity

1800
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,264
Before millions of Americans

1801
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Start arriving in Europe

1802
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
The swamp

1803
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,664
This is the way Winston Churchill

1804
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
Describes

1805
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
The situation

1806
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Set up

1807
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,856
Will say and then I'm going to contrast that with the way out of Hitler

1808
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:50,720
And remember that both of these people are writing to specific audio

1809
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,792
Churchill's writing two people

1810
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
Who are

1811
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,144
In the especially British and American audiences in and really

1812
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,216
Super patriotic romantic sort of an approach

1813
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Hitler is writing

1814
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
This material for a bunch of

1815
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,848
Bitter War veterans

1816
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
Who

1817
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,920
Still ache over what they

1818
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,736
Experienced an endless feeling of betrayal

1819
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
And end the bitterness

1820
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:17,600
Since the war ended so they have different audiences their writing for

1821
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:21,440
What contrasting their Styles in the way they set this up is intrigued

1822
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
Churchill describes

1823
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
The situation in the number and remember

1824
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,608
The end of 1917 the British were still in shock

1825
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,424
From the battle that they still call passchendaele

1826
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,472
Churchill says quote

1827
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:39,360
As the passchendaele struggled died away in the storms in mud of winter

1828
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,456
The military rulers of Germany address themselves to a new situation

1829
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:48,064
The collapse of Russia had enabled them to transport a million men

1830
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,648
And 3000 guns from the Eastern to the Western Front

1831
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,464
For the first time therefore since the invasion

1832
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:59,072
They found themselves possessed of a definite superiority over the Allies in France

1833
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,376
But this superiority was fleeting

1834
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,472
The United States declared war and was Army but have not yet arrived

1835
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:09,824
Once the great masses of American manhood could be trained and equipped

1836
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:16,224
Transported have brought into the line of battle all the numerical Advantage Germany had gained from the destruction of

1837
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,528
Russia would be more than counterbalanced

1838
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:24,672
At the same time the German Main Headquarters new the grave losses the British army had suffered at passchendaele

1839
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:30,304
And felt themselves entitled to count Upon A Marked Decline and its strength and fighting quality

1840
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,192
Lastly the amazing character of the German Austrian victory over the Italians at corporate

1841
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,728
Glitter temptingly

1842
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:39,776
And quote

1843
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,824
He then goes on to say

1844
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,664
It would have been a great time for the Germans to open negotiations with us

1845
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
Instead they chose to attack

1846
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:52,832
Before we get to Hitler's view of the situation it's worth asking

1847
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,880
You know what were the Germans fighting

1848
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
4

1849
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,672
What did they hope

1850
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:02,048
To achieve what was the best case scenario in any sort of ends of the war

1851
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,864
And this is another difference between the first and the Second World War

1852
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,704
In the second world war as soon as the Americans had said that

1853
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
Unconditional surrender

1854
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,288
You know what's supposed to be the

1855
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,824
Victory conditions

1856
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,688
It made the war one of those conflicts where you're going to get with call the carthaginian

1857
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,784
In a reminiscent of how the Romans in the third

1858
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,368
Punic Wars treated the city of Carthage total Destruction

1859
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
Right total occupation

1860
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,208
Total submission in Domination

1861
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,256
Unconditional surrender are the

1862
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:37,632
In the first world war like so much of the stuff that went on during this time.

1863
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
The surrender was going to

1864
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,800
Everyone presumed could it be some sort of a negotiated a fair going to be a bargaining session

1865
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:49,664
And both sides are fighting to be the superior person at the bargaining table

1866
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,944
Write the one who can in

1867
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
Cyst

1868
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
On better terms

1869
01:28:54,272 --> 01:29:00,416
As general ludendorff the German military leader points out what they're fighting for and why they have to keep attack

1870
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,440
He says quote

1871
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:06,048
Germany could only make the enemy incline to Peace by fighting

1872
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,888
It was first of all necessary to shake the position of Lloyd George

1873
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,704
And clemenceau by a military victory

1874
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,264
Before that was done peace was not to be thought

1875
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
And quote

1876
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,384
Now let's remember what ludendorff means

1877
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,456
Is it he needs US military Victory to get the kind of

1878
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,480
If he wants

1879
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,296
Write a piece that for example give Germany

1880
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:31,392
Either director de facto control of places like Belgian for exam

1881
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:35,744
That's his bargaining position in any sort of agreement that ended the war

1882
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,304
That's what they're fighting for and the other side is too

1883
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,448
Although more and more one of the conditions that the Americans and the British and the French were insisting on is it the German

1884
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
Form of government has to change

1885
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,544
They can't be a monarchy anymore

1886
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,568
Well

1887
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:55,968
That may leave Germany still alive but it means if you are the Emperor of Germany or any of these high-ranking people that are

1888
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,760
Part of the German monarchy

1889
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,832
It might as well be total war against you

1890
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
Germany may live on but you're not going

1891
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,696
Adolf Hitler

1892
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
Is a

1893
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
Soldier

1894
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,280
In the first world war as we had mentioned earlier

1895
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,608
His book Mein Kampf which is written for this

1896
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,144
German veterinarian

1897
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
House were rotting so we mentioned a little earlier

1898
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
He talks about the

1899
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,056
Sculptures in the shirkers and all these people

1900
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,592
That are beginning to sort of

1901
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:29,504
The German Army in the back from the homefront that's the way it's portrayed and when you read ludendorff

1902
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,576
I'll Memoirs to written during a similar time.

1903
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,624
He has the same thing going where

1904
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,720
You know that the reason that the German troops are in danger is not because

1905
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:45,120
The enemy will hurt them because they're sort of this Victorious entity on the battlefield it's because the homefront will let them down

1906
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
Before

1907
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:52,544
You know Hitler sums up the situation that we're facing right here at the beginning of 1918 he goes off

1908
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
On

1909
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:57,408
Some strikes that are taking place during this time. In Germany

1910
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:02,528
There's a Naval Strike that happens in 1917 that that's disconcerting

1911
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,440
And then several hundred thousand Munitions workers go on strike right at the beginning of the new year in 1918

1912
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:16,352
And then again when the German government punishes the ringleaders of the strike they send them to the front as punishment but that

1913
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,912
It means that they're infiltrating Audi's military units

1914
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,448
And they're infiltrating them

1915
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,520
With these ideas with ludendorff and Hitler

1916
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,312
Thai right to Bolsheviks

1917
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,616
Hitler ties bolshevism by the way the Jews

1918
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,968
So right there you even begin to see the origins

1919
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Of the stab-in-the-back

1920
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
And here's the way Hitler

1921
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
In his in his

1922
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:40,928
Well what are you going to say best-selling book mine comp

1923
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:44,000
Describe the situation the Germans found themselves in

1924
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:49,888
After they giving the Italians a bloody nose a corporative after they've knocked all these other people out of the war and after finding out

1925
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
You know that they're going to attack

1926
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
Quote

1927
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,800
Toward the end of 1917

1928
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:00,128
The low point of the Army's dejection seems to have passed

1929
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,480
The whole Army took fresh hope and fresh courage after the Russian collapse

1930
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:11,136
The conviction that the war would end with the Victory of Germany after all began to seize the troops more and more

1931
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,184
Again singing could be heard

1932
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,000
And the Calamity Janes became rarer

1933
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,816
Again people believed in the future of the father

1934
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
And quote

1935
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:25,216
The Calamity Janes are these sculptures in sherpas and people who say

1936
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,264
Anti-patriotic things were

1937
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
Or negative things about the war effort

1938
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
He says quote

1939
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:36,992
Especially the Italian collapse of autumn 1917 that had the most wonderful effect

1940
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:41,344
In this Victory we saw proof of the possibility of breaking through the front

1941
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,904
Even aside from the Russian theater of war

1942
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
A glorious Faith float again into the hearts of the millions enable them to await spring 1918

1943
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
With relief

1944
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,096
I'm confident

1945
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,400
The photo was visibly depressed

1946
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,472
In this winter he remained quieter than usual

1947
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,520
This was the lull before the storm

1948
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
And quote

1949
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,616
Did Hitler sums up

1950
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,176
His view of this moment

1951
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:10,784
And what the Allies were facing now with a sort of Germany Unleashed he says quote

1952
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:14,112
In the winter of 1917 to 1918

1953
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:18,464
Dark clouds appeared for the first time in the firmament of the Allied world

1954
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,608
For nearly four years they have been a sailing the German Warrior and had been unable to Encompass his downfall

1955
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:28,704
And all this while the German had only his shield arm free for defense

1956
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,264
Baba sword was obliged to strike

1957
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
Now we may eat

1958
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,312
Now in the south

1959
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,384
But now it last the Giants back was free

1960
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:41,248
Streams of blood flown before he administered final defeat to one of his foes

1961
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,272
Now in the West

1962
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:45,088
His shield was going to be joined by his sword

1963
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,416
Up till then the enemy had been unable to break his defense

1964
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,976
And now he himself was facing attack

1965
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,048
The enemy feared him and trembled for their Victor

1966
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,096
And quote

1967
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,472
Now in one sense this is a post first world war Hitler

1968
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:08,128
Putting a Rosy picture on this thing you know what here we were going to defeat them and then we got stabbed in the back by the

1969
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,408
Jews and Bolsheviks right

1970
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,456
But at the same time

1971
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,528
There's some truth to a couple of these things one

1972
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
The Bolsheviks were having any

1973
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
Influence on German

1974
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,160
And that attempt by

1975
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,440
Ludendorff

1976
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:28,096
To get rid of his next door neighbor in the apartment complex by burning his apartment down is big

1977
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:34,496
Beginning to change Germany little bit and ludendorff writes about this in his Memoirs in a way remember writing years

1978
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
Later so we can pretend to have hindsight

1979
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:42,688
He basically acts like he understood the risk was dangerous he thought they could contain your the Bolshevik

1980
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:46,528
Intellectual contagion but he knew that there was a chance it wouldn't work out that way

1981
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,856
And there's something to that in terms of

1982
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,928
Why the Germans were all of a sudden beginning to

1983
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,720
Start the show real

1984
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,024
Cracks in the facade of the home

1985
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:03,168
And some of these people should be pointed out that a guy like ludendorff or Hitler thinks are Bolsheviks

1986
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,704
Are probably more like

1987
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,984
Social Democrat

1988
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,776
Frappuccino mild socialists

1989
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:12,896
I like ludendorff anyone who's thinking that the war might have gone on too long

1990
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:18,784
Or that Germany instead of an emperor might do better with a representative democracy or a republic or something

1991
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,320
That to them is traitor

1992
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,344
Radicals

1993
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,136
You might as well be a Bolshevik

1994
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,952
None the less think about what these people

1995
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,792
We're going through four years of war all these countries in a sentence

1996
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,584
Sacrificing their future

1997
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,376
What each generation of youngsters

1998
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,680
That they call up and throw into the mall

1999
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,728
Inter sacrificing their path

2000
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,752
Two sticks

2001
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
Cannibalizing

2002
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,056
Their countries

2003
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,616
Historical in long-term asset

2004
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,480
Recorded the English wife of a German nobleman princess blue shirt

2005
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,528
Evelyn blue sure writing in her diary

2006
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,112
She told this story that is just heartbreaking about

2007
01:35:54,368 --> 01:36:00,256
You know the fact that the Germans don't have enough ammunition anymore and they're starting to go into the society and intake things

2008
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
To melt down

2009
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,400
One historian I read said that during this. More than 10,000 Church

2010
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
Or melted down

2011
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,984
Princess blue shirt tells a story

2012
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,776
She says quote

2013
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:17,920
There are other signs to pathetic in their way of the increasing scarcity of metal

2014
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:21,504
Breviary where the old church bells and even the organ pipes

2015
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,344
Are being dragged from the churches and turned into ammunition

2016
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,928
Whilst owing to the scarcity of oil the sanctuary lamp

2017
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:33,024
Such a dear familiar sight in Catholic churches May no longer shed

2018
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,560
Tender light before the Tabernacle

2019
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,864
In a small town near here

2020
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
A sad little ceremony took place the other day

2021
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:46,080
The ancient church bell which should run the people from The Cradle to the Grave for 300 years and more was

2022
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,128
Requisitioned by the military Authority

2023
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,688
The grief felt by the inhabitants

2024
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:55,040
Was so great that they determined to do their ancient friend all the honor they could

2025
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:58,880
And after having performed the regular funeral service for the dead over it

2026
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,416
A procession was for

2027
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,952
Headed by the priest

2028
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,000
In his vestments headed acolyte

2029
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Swinging their incense

2030
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
Any inhabitant

2031
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,584
Following the Bell

2032
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,984
Which was covered with wreaths and flowers and hand it over to the military authorities under tears and protestations

2033
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,264
And quote

2034
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,104
I look at that story is kind of symbolic

2035
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:22,176
The greatness of Old Europe at the height

2036
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,224
And the high-water marks of its wealth in

2037
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,248
And civilization

2038
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,296
And you hundreds of years

2039
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,624
Glorious path behind those with a

2040
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,696
Girding the whole society

2041
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,792
Being ripped apart and thrown into the mall on the furnace

2042
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,352
To provide the implements that are needed

2043
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,888
To fight the war

2044
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,424
It is destroying

2045
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
It's high place on the world stage

2046
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:48,800
This is a sort of tragic irony

2047
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:55,968
But isn't confined to Germany by the way this is how Britain and France and Russia and all these old line Powers kind of feel they're trapped in this car

2048
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
Sounds like now

2049
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,784
It is chewing up their wealth

2050
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:03,136
Destabilizing the structures of their society in once again

2051
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,952
Taking the next class of draftees who reached

2052
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,000
18 years old

2053
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
And throwing them into the meat grinder to

2054
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
Think of the

2055
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,168
On these people who are commanding all these armies on

2056
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,192
On both sides

2057
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,288
And ludendorff you can't help but think about this guy cuz he's the one who gets

2058
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
Decide

2059
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,360
How you play Germany's last car

2060
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,968
Central Powers last card think of the people that are counting on him

2061
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,272
I'm a completely human except

2062
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
Paramed imagine

2063
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:38,208
The stress and responsibility that falls on this one guy shoulders more than anyone else on that side obviously

2064
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,488
Help and staffs

2065
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:45,120
In other people to consult and what-have-you but basically the number one person's responsibility is

2066
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:45,888
His

2067
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,960
He's got to plan

2068
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,776
The biggest battle in world history

2069
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,824
And the stakes

2070
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,592
AR

2071
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
Everything

2072
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
Wow

2073
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,784
This is the biggest encounter between

2074
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,856
The cutting-edge militaries of the world that has ever happen

2075
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,136
And that's what ludendorff

2076
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Is planning

2077
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,952
And it's an immensely complicated

2078
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
Affair with

2079
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,512
Detail beyond belief

2080
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,072
Ludendorff

2081
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
We'll start moving

2082
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,192
Troops from the Eastern Front have been fighting the Russians

2083
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:24,288
On trains all the way over to the West before the Russians even sign a peace treaty

2084
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:29,920
By the spring of 1918 he's moved a million German soldiers who had been fighting the Russians

2085
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:33,248
Over to the west where they can now be used against the French and the British

2086
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,576
The German Army in the west numbers over 3 million

2087
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
Soldiers

2088
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,648
By Spring 1918

2089
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,464
And ludendorff has a plan that he's going to

2090
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,768
And put into place that that involves

2091
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:47,072
Throwing multiple punches

2092
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,400
At the French and the British like a 5 punch combination

2093
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,728
Annie's going to use about a million soldiers

2094
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,008
Perform V

2095
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,360
Michael named after Saint Michael is the first of these

2096
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,432
Punches but the entire Affair will sometimes be called

2097
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
The 1918 spring offensive

2098
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,040
The German soldiers referred to as

2099
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:11,136
Sometimes it just a great battle in France that shows you how big it's going to be

2100
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,464
One part of it is sometimes referred to as the peace offencive

2101
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,024
And sometimes the entire Affair is called

2102
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,560
The kaiserschlacht

2103
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:19,840
The emperor

2104
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,680
Historians have been fascinated by

2105
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,704
ID series about

2106
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,264
Ever since we're a couple of Major Reese

2107
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,824
What is the scope

2108
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
And the other other state

2109
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,432
This is the largest

2110
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,200
Battle the world

2111
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:38,016
Never seen the complexity is unbelievable

2112
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,600
It's very hard battle to follow or explain or talk about

2113
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,952
It in the front will be miles long it will involve millions of men

2114
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
The complexity

2115
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,120
In terms of trying to plan and arrange and get ready

2116
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:58,240
For one of these big offensives in five or six months which is your planning window

2117
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,288
Is perhaps the most

2118
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,312
Complex

2119
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,640
Task human beings have ever attempted to

2120
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,248
I think you could say that there are bigger things like Friday

2121
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:13,088
Creating a global society which were in the process of doing right now that's a very high

2122
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:20,000
But you can do that overtime and build on the achievements of previous generations and sort of involved towards a solution

2123
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Complex problems

2124
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,840
These people have a Time window and it short

2125
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:30,240
Get the kaiserschlacht done within 5 months booms got to be ready on the 21st of March get it done I mean

2126
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,544
Just the attempts to

2127
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:36,128
Cheap the Allies in the dark about where it's coming

2128
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
How can plexus help

2129
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,224
Neither will move troops and equipment at night

2130
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,344
They will cover up the artillery gun Wheels with cloth so you can't hear the

2131
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,976
Staples roust out the civilian population in all the towns in March around all directions to confuse

2132
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,512
You know Allied Observers

2133
01:41:54,304 --> 01:42:00,448
They will scramble and use false radio messages and just because you know this is sort of a transition. In history

2134
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,032
Just to cover all their bases they will also pull out the carrier pigeon

2135
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,336
Including carrier pigeons

2136
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,640
Captured from the other side

2137
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:11,456
Put false notes in the little compartment

2138
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,760
You know in their leg and send them off

2139
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,832
Call covering all your bases isn't it

2140
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,928
But think of the plan again complexity in all the work that goes on

2141
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:22,976
The other

2142
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,792
Fascinating aspect historians are the stakes

2143
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
When do you have

2144
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,376
Takes like this

2145
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,424
Biggest war in human history

2146
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,496
And is one historian put it ludendorff and the Germans have six

2147
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Months

2148
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,312
To change the course of the war here

2149
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,848
After that the

2150
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,688
Numerical Advantage the Americans will provide will be overwhelming

2151
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,992
Do you have this window of opportunity

2152
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,784
And it's an all-or-nothing thing

2153
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,344
Some historians have argued that the Germans should have just

2154
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,904
Going on the defensive here Duggan

2155
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,048
And made the Allied Forces fight until 1920 or 1921

2156
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
Before the

2157
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:06,240
The mounting losses would force them into some sort of a favorable peace but that kind of ignores how bad things are on the home front

2158
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,776
The German Army can withstand

2159
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:11,872
These Allied attacks are going to lose the people back in what homework

2160
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:14,432
A year past the infamous turnip winter

2161
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,504
What happens when the turnip winter is the good old days right

2162
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:21,088
Diluting open the Germans don't just put this attack together

2163
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,624
They're excited about it

2164
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,416
The German troops are almost

2165
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:28,000
Ecstatic the morale is sky-high they want a chance to win the war

2166
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,584
This is why this first punch operation Michael is so important

2167
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,912
Because this is the punch where all the optimism is employ

2168
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,704
Place right everybody's drinking the Kool-Aid

2169
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,776
Ludendorff decides to

2170
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,800
You know up his

2171
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:45,408
Gamble Auntie little bit more not only see gambling with this attack but he's going to

2172
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,224
You know essentially pull out the rocket fuel

2173
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:49,504
From

2174
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:55,904
The great mass of troops he goes through and calms his army for the best man write the healthiest the strongest

2175
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:00,512
That one's of the highest morale the veterans who weren't cynical yet all these people

2176
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,304
For better than the rest of the herd

2177
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,328
Bird and pull them out

2178
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:08,704
Put them in the special units and give them the best weapons again pulled away from the great mass of people

2179
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
And the special training

2180
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,568
What they called special training in the first world war today we would call

2181
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
Standard

2182
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,688
They called them Stormtrooper tactics we called them

2183
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,016
Fire and move tactics and every army in the world uses

2184
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Now

2185
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:26,880
Nonetheless what ludendorff is done here has created initial

2186
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,416
Advantage

2187
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,440
Jennifer himself

2188
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:34,816
Because his best troops are going to go up against the great mass of French and British troops that they run into

2189
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,424
They will give out the Lion's Share of casualty

2190
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,472
Did the French and the British in the allies

2191
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,776
But they will also take the Lion's Share

2192
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,592
This is a gamble because

2193
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:53,504
When ludendorff uses these best troop she's going to use them up and if they haven't won by that point

2194
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,784
He's going to be left

2195
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,064
With the not best

2196
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
Troops

2197
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
The leftover

2198
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:05,024
People who had their best weapon stripped from them and given to the other guys people who haven't been trained in the latest tactics

2199
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,096
People who it's expected are going to Simply move up

2200
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,656
And occupy the trenches that have already been conquered

2201
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
It's a Campbell

2202
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,496
And on March 21st

2203
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,800
It's not a gamble lutador us to worry about

2204
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
Because he's got

2205
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,128
I'll be Stormtrooper and assault unit

2206
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,944
Waiting for

2207
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
The moment

2208
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
To jump off

2209
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:29,088
Synchronizing their watches and waiting for what will be the largest

2210
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,392
Cannonade in history

2211
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
To kick-off

2212
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,976
March 21st

2213
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
Operation Michael

2214
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:38,816
The first punch of the German multi punch combination

2215
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,400
Aim primarily at the British

2216
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,240
Some 10000 artillery piece

2217
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
Uses will open fire

2218
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,104
At about Dawn somewhere in the four

2219
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,872
Shower

2220
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,224
They will only fire only

2221
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,784
Forever if you're under Fire the lonely fire 4 about

2222
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,552
4 hours

2223
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,344
It's what's called a hurricane bombard

2224
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,672
Very different than what the Allies were doing through most of the war

2225
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:07,744
Where they will bombard for weeks on end some

2226
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
It's right at the song

2227
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:15,936
In 1916 the big artillery battle vellfire 1.7 million shells in the first week and it's famous

2228
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,728
Oh my gosh

2229
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:23,104
But every first world war major offensives out does the earlier ones in this one

2230
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,128
They fire

2231
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,408
Becomes a contest

2232
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,432
Like a statistic in the

2233
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:30,528
Guinness Book of World Records but they fire 1.1 million shells in 4

2234
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,624
And it's conducted like a symphony

2235
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,392
Death

2236
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
The Germans have brought in

2237
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,232
All of their big

2238
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,560
I guess you could call the military stars to this battle

2239
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:45,376
One of them is this artillery conductor

2240
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,168
Georg

2241
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
Brooklyn

2242
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,240
His name is but his nickname is

2243
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,520
Breakthrough Muller

2244
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:56,128
We have a whole Theory ended even perfecting how to use these artillery barrage

2245
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,432
And part of his theory involves

2246
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,992
The idea that you don't need to destroyed

2247
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:05,088
The enemy positions which is what's always been done all you need to do is neutralize

2248
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,672
All you need to do with that Machine Gun Nest to stop them from shooting long enough

2249
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:13,536
So that the Infantry doesn't get killed on the way to taking out the Machine Gun Nest themselves

2250
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,840
So use it a lot more gas

2251
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,608
First of all

2252
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
And

2253
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,912
He has a hole

2254
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,984
Order that all this come to the meat first he shoots the gas

2255
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:27,872
That doesn't kill you but it's like tear gas that makes you gag and vomit and it makes you rip off your gas

2256
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:33,248
But then he hit you with the phosgene gas but if you're not wearing your gas mask kills you

2257
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,320
Can also use mustard gas which is

2258
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,600
A long life

2259
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,880
So it's like spraying that

2260
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:43,232
The ant spray that will still kill the ants a week later even though it's dried up

2261
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:49,120
The mustard gas is shot of all these important Crossroads in areas and Heights and observation post

2262
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
Either

2263
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
You get out

2264
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:57,312
We are so covered up in gas masks and everything you can hardly function and the Germans just want you to be impeded

2265
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:00,384
Right you just have to be not functioning long enough

2266
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,968
For the waves of German soldiers to be free and clear

2267
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,760
To overrun your position

2268
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,600
It also has the added benefit of not making

2269
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,648
The terrain in front of your dancing

2270
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
Look like

2271
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,208
The cratered surface

2272
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
The Moon

2273
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,792
Large shell craters and

2274
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:18,816
Become a barrier all

2275
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,352
What's owning previous battles

2276
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,680
In this one the German archery was going to minimize that

2277
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,216
Keep the way open for

2278
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,264
Quicken shocking advance

2279
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:30,592
The artillery opens fire on March

2280
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:31,360
21st

2281
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:39,296
You know it's strange to say that they're surprised cuz everyone knew this was coming but the surprise is in the intensity in the locations and what

2282
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
The Kaiser

2283
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:47,232
The Emperor of Germany and the face of the German military Hindenburg are reportedly at the battle

2284
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:52,096
The Kaiser was known to have this wooden tower that sort of like a ranger station at wreck

2285
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,376
We could try to see

2286
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
A battle

2287
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
What you something

2288
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
In the night

2289
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
Strange people came out

2290
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,264
With picnic basket

2291
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,800
First major battle

2292
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,848
US Civil War to watch

2293
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,408
Anna Kaiser and Hindenburg

2294
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,480
We're supposedly at this battle to watch it unfold

2295
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:12,064
Winston Churchill was also there when the cannonade opened up

2296
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,600
And you get this feeling

2297
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:18,208
These are jelly like figure that you just not going to miss any big historical event if he can

2298
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,792
Avoid that and he was at this battle too and he gives one of the

2299
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:27,424
Original and much quoted account of what it was like you said you know just walking around the room was waiting for something to happen

2300
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:32,032
He woke up from his sleep somewhere in the 4-Hour and is relatively silent

2301
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
And then

2302
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,872
Quote

2303
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:39,200
Suddenly after what seemed about a half an hour

2304
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:45,088
The silence was broken by six or seven very loud and very heavy explosion several miles away

2305
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:47,136
I thought they were our 12-inch guns

2306
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,672
But they were probably mine

2307
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:54,304
And then exactly is a Pianist runs his hand across the keyboard from treble to Bass

2308
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,352
There Rose in less than one minute

2309
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:58,912
The most tremendous cannonade I shall ever hear

2310
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,448
And quote

2311
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,752
You said that quote

2312
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:06,080
The weight and intensity of the bombardment surpassed anything

2313
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,872
Which anyone had ever known before

2314
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
And quote

2315
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,992
Ernst Junger the German Soldier we talked about

2316
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,064
Sometimes in the story is also at this battle

2317
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:21,696
He's on the opposite side of the shelling rights and not even the side that's being shelled and he says

2318
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:26,048
Tell made every other event he been to in this war look like a tea party

2319
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:28,352
And he was at many of the big battles

2320
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,120
Right

2321
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
Petit Park

2322
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,448
He said that the shelling

2323
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,008
Sing to suspend the laws of nature

2324
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,640
Couldn't light a match or anything because the shockwaves even as far away as

2325
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,176
The German troops were

2326
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:48,576
Would love it right out he says that if you looked over the Enemy Lines all you saw is rolling clouds of flame

2327
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:55,488
And it looked like the way the desert looks when you look in the distance and the heat is shimmering and makes you almost see mirages

2328
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,512
She said that that's what it looks

2329
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,328
On the side of the people being shallow

2330
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
The effect

2331
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,912
On the British troops

2332
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,984
Is almost like being Punch-Drunk

2333
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:10,080
A private in the 1st West Yorkshire regiment

2334
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,360
Who was there

2335
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,896
I explained it this way quote

2336
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:19,040
Nobody could stand more than three hours of sustained shelling before they started feeling sleepy and numb

2337
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,320
You're hammered after

2338
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,088
3 hours

2339
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,392
And you're there for the picking when he comes over

2340
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,696
It's a bit like being under an anesthetic

2341
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:28,000
You can't put a lot of resistance up

2342
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:34,656
On the other front side been on there been so much of our resistance that whenever Jerry opened up our artillery open

2343
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
Quieted him down

2344
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,240
But there was no retaliation this time

2345
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,776
He had a free do with us

2346
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
And quote

2347
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:45,920
I should point out that the Germans called the British Tommy

2348
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,480
And the British called the Germans Jerry

2349
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
Offensive that's how that have

2350
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,600
Historian Alexander Watson quotes

2351
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,904
A German battalion.

2352
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:56,672
Ernst

2353
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,696
Determine

2354
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,768
Who recorded that men reacted to shelling quote

2355
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:04,096
For the most part with the feeling of enormous sleepiness

2356
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:08,960
And then said that you get both emotional and physical change

2357
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,264
In men who are being shell

2358
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,568
Also think about the people on the receiving end

2359
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,616
I was about to be in ground attack

2360
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,432
After they've experienced something that does this to

2361
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,968
Wiedermann says quote

2362
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:22,528
The eyes pop out of their socket

2363
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,600
The expression becomes fixed in glass

2364
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:28,672
The facial skin loses all of its red color

2365
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,464
The skin becomes yellow

2366
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,256
The cheek bones protrude

2367
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:37,120
The lips are shut tight and sticky spittle tax up the tongue to the roof of the mouth

2368
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,936
The heart Works in short convulsive Beats

2369
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,728
Breathing becomes slower

2370
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:45,568
From time to time a cold shudder runs through the body in the teeth chatter

2371
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,360
Every spoken word

2372
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,384
Spelt is agony

2373
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:49,920
And quote

2374
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,480
Watson goes to point out that

2375
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,504
Surveys have shown that

2376
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,296
The troops were particularly scared

2377
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,600
An unsettled

2378
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,160
He writes quote

2379
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:05,792
Not only did artillery cause more casualties than any other weapon on the Western Front

2380
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:08,864
But those injuries that it didn't inflict wear off in Grievous

2381
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:13,728
Contemporary psychiatrist agreed that men's primary fear was not death

2382
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
Mutilation

2383
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,104
Wounds to the stomach jaw and eyes were particularly dreaded

2384
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:24,224
It is not significant that artillery fire was more likely than any other weapon to cause head wounds

2385
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,248
Moreover

2386
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:31,648
Shells were terrifying because it Lieutenant Saint leg or somewhat coyly observed they could quote make such

2387
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,672
A mess of 1

2388
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,440
And quote

2389
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
Watching continue

2390
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,768
Quote the weapon eviscerate

2391
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,304
Maimed and disfigured

2392
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,632
Body part could be scattered over wide distances

2393
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:45,216
And legs and arms blown into trees by the force of explosion

2394
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:48,288
Such sites were obviously extremely disturbing

2395
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,848
Especially when the victims were friends or comrade

2396
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,152
As Lieutenant yoxall remark quote

2397
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:58,784
When you seen the she'll fall into the midst of six men and packed three of them away in a sandbag

2398
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,832
One wonders whether anything matters

2399
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,112
And quote

2400
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,208
This is when you realize though

2401
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,256
These people are veterans

2402
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,560
What's in this combat in that this makes a huge difference

2403
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,632
These people have been hardened

2404
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,912
To their current

2405
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,704
State by degrees

2406
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:21,312
I seen many horrible things in the path and living through

2407
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:25,920
Situations that while they might not be as Extreme as what they're about to go through

2408
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:26,944
AR

2409
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,736
Smaller versions on the way there

2410
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:34,112
It's like lifting a smaller amount of weight on your way up to lifting a greater amount of weight not like taking

2411
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:38,464
A week civilian Like Yours Truly and throwing him into the kaiserschlacht

2412
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,488
Tomorrow

2413
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:42,816
And then expecting him to endure under shellfire

2414
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,376
And while there are certainly people

2415
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:49,984
That fell apart under shellfire broke and ran under shellfire lost their minds

2416
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:55,872
In at the Shell Shocked me a lot of those kinds of things The Amazing Story here and I think this is what happened made people

2417
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,920
Throughout history since it happened

2418
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:01,504
Is it the bat bat vast majority people stayed there

2419
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,528
In those

2420
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,552
Positions

2421
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,136
Having a logical

2422
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,416
Part of their brain

2423
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:13,024
And self-control somehow overriding their animal instincts that must have been

2424
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,072
Screaming at them to Simply flee

2425
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,632
But as I said these

2426
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,400
People

2427
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
I've been hard

2428
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,728
I wish they'd seen before

2429
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:28,384
The very day before March 21st before this artillery barrage happens

2430
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,664
Ernst Junger

2431
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
Is in

2432
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
A shell hole

2433
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:33,760
In

2434
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:36,320
A relatively safe part of the line

2435
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:42,720
Henan officer are in one and a whole bunch of men are in the Big Shell hole next to his it's like an Amphitheater he

2436
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,488
He says

2437
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:47,072
And they're sort of having a meeting everybody stack their weapons and if comp

2438
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:51,936
And there she'll fire going on and all of a sudden so if a random stray shell falls into that

2439
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,496
Big crater that's built like an Amphitheater

2440
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,032
It had a hundred men in it

2441
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:01,152
It's maybe the most gruesome upsetting part

2442
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:04,480
Of youngers gruesome and upsetting story and he says

2443
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:10,624
After the explosion it's so freaked him out and this is Ernst Junger we don't want to take one of the veterans veterans

2444
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:17,024
Eagles tearing off running in a sort of a panic before eventually he'll stop himself and realizes he should go back and try to help someone

2445
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,864
But then that same Ernst Junger

2446
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:26,240
You know that next morning whatever it is 12:15 hours afterwards is going to be sitting

2447
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,776
Annies jumping off point

2448
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:33,408
Synchronizing his watch watching this artillery drop on the British and getting ready to go over the top and attack

2449
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,992
What's amazing is when he does so

2450
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,528
He does so

2451
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,064
In an almost

2452
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,112
Getty fashion

2453
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:45,696
Hard to describe that the mood that these soldiers going over the top

2454
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:51,584
You're not suggesting this battle I mean there's not necessarily representative but he says everybody else we're sort of

2455
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,400
Kind of on the edge of Sanity almost

2456
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:56,704
Berserk but at the same time

2457
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:03,104
He said that they would talk to each other and it would only come out in little fragments or sentences and he said anybody who was observing us would think we were

2458
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,384
Incredibly happy

2459
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:12,320
At the same time he's talking about this rage that's coming over him and he squeezes his eyes and the tears are coming out and he's

2460
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,600
Ready to hurt somebody

2461
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,904
What's funny when you read it

2462
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,440
Is

2463
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:22,048
It kind of reminds you something that maybe in the back of your head you knew already

2464
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
I think

2465
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:27,424
When you look at these modern soldiers coming from nice backgrounds like ourselves

2466
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:30,752
In a well trained and educated in all these kinds of things

2467
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:36,640
We somehow assumed that the very tendencies that we will freely admit that ancient be

2468
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:41,248
Peoples had and Vikings had and all these kinds of people that could get up into a berserk rage

2469
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
You know when kill a victim and stand up and celebrating it and enjoy being a warrior that somehow because we have

2470
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:52,000
The aircraft in artillery and machine guns and a nice that it's all gone

2471
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,328
And in some people it is

2472
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:57,120
It's putting some people it's not

2473
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:00,448
An astronaut goes looking for someone to kill

2474
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,240
When he jumps out of these

2475
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:07,360
Jumping off point after the artillery barrage lifts in the German Army attacks on March 21st

2476
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,408
The big sweep

2477
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,944
An operation Mike

2478
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:12,992
It's foggy

2479
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:13,760
By the way

2480
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:18,880
This will be one of the things that ludendorff will get lucky with a couple of times in his multi-punch combination

2481
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:23,232
Fog is not great for the German attackers it makes it difficult but it's in the night

2482
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,512
Mayor for the Defenders

2483
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,120
The Germans are using water sometimes called infiltration tactics and if it's foggy

2484
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,424
Infiltration tactics are a lot more

2485
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
Affect

2486
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:34,496
Pretty sure set up all these Defense Zone

2487
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,056
With Crossing machine gun firing all these things were all these

2488
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:39,872
All these different defense readouts can help each other

2489
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,920
But because of the fog they can't see anything

2490
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,248
And then all of a sudden

2491
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,528
The

2492
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:50,880
Germans are jumping into the trenches where the British soldiers are

2493
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
Catching them totally off guard

2494
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,488
Historian Peter Hart

2495
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:01,120
Quote Captain Charles Miller who was on the line at the Germans approach for their initial attack you know

2496
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,960
Before 9 a.m. in the morning of the 21st through the fog and says quote

2497
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:08,800
The first attackers were into the trench long before the Mist lifted

2498
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,872
I was so occupied with the flanks that I barely saw them

2499
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,456
Before they appeared out of the Mist and lip down into the trench

2500
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:18,528
In a moment we were all mixed up in hand-to-hand fighting

2501
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,832
I had two men coming at me with your bayonet

2502
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:27,488
One of them I think I shot with my revolver while I Sergeant standing just behind me. The other at Point Blank

2503
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,048
Range with his rifle barrel over my shoulder

2504
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:35,424
Almost at the same second a German stick bomb came whistling into the trench from the parapet

2505
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Right into the bunch of us

2506
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:39,520
And killed or wounded practically the whole lot of us

2507
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:41,056
English and German alike

2508
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:46,432
Weather was actually this bomb or a band that stabbed that gave me the wound in my neck I don't know

2509
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,456
It might have been either

2510
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,504
For a moment we were clear

2511
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,808
But there was a nasty little shambles around us

2512
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,624
Sergeant Adcock would just saved my life

2513
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,160
Having his head blown off

2514
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:00,768
I felt awfully we can discover the river of blood was flowing from my neck

2515
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,584
I tried to bandage it but the bandage wouldn't hold

2516
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,656
Before they attacked us again they brought up some trench mortar

2517
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:08,704
And knock Seven Bells out of us

2518
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,752
Then swarmed into the trench

2519
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,568
By that time there were only a handful of us left on our feet

2520
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,360
And all I suppose wounded

2521
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:19,200
I got another wound from a stick bomb would you put a bit of metal into MiFi

2522
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,480
Before I Collapse

2523
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:25,856
I tried to give the surrender signal and hoped I succeeded they're buying saving a few lies

2524
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,136
We've done our best

2525
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:33,280
What are the things that happens with these modern battles

2526
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:36,096
Is that they really turn into

2527
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:42,496
Hundreds of smaller encounter that when you add them up together equal this big thing going on over 40 miles

2528
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,312
But when you read the accounts of these battles they all sound like

2529
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,080
You know

2530
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:52,480
Me and 10 guys took that Machine Gun Nest a hundred yards away and it took us three hours we lost two men and we can

2531
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:54,784
Killed everybody Machine Gun Nest and then we continue to move on

2532
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,344
That's an encounter in this war right

2533
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,184
So every time you read what it sounds like an isolated little incident in fact

2534
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:06,816
Younger when he comes upon the first enemy soldier he sees on March 21st

2535
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,096
If the

2536
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,424
Private encounter this moment where Yonkers

2537
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
In this

2538
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:17,568
Almost berserk mood that he just talked about giddy they've been drinking alcohol their Punch-Drunk from

2539
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:20,640
All the artillery images of sensory overload

2540
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,176
Macy's the Santa me

2541
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:22,944
Annie sez

2542
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
Quote

2543
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,040
Then I saw my first enemy

2544
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:30,368
A figurine Brown uniform wounded apparent

2545
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,952
Crouch 20 Paces away in the middle of the battered path

2546
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,744
With his hands propped on the ground

2547
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:38,560
I turned the corner and we caught sight of each other

2548
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:42,656
I saw him jump as I approached and stare at me with gaping eyes

2549
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:47,264
Walleye with my face behind my pistol stocked up to him slowly and coldly

2550
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,592
A bloody scene with no Witnesses was about to happen

2551
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:55,456
It was a relief to me finally to have the photo in front of me within reach

2552
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:58,272
I set the mouth of the pistol at the man's Temple

2553
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,808
He was too frightened to move

2554
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,624
What my other fish grabbed hold of his tunic

2555
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,416
Feeling medals and badges of rank

2556
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,696
An officer

2557
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,256
He must have held some Command Post in these Trench

2558
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,584
With a plaintive sound he reached into his pocket

2559
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,864
Not to pull out a weapon

2560
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,144
What a photograph

2561
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,168
Which she held up to me

2562
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,704
I saw him on it

2563
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:18,752
Surrounded by numerous family

2564
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,288
What you all standing on a Terrace

2565
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:22,848
It was a plea from another world

2566
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:27,200
Later I thought it was blind chance that I let him go and plunged on Word

2567
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,272
That one man of all often appeared in my dream

2568
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:32,832
I hope that meant he got to see his homeland

2569
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,624
And quote

2570
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,184
So even

2571
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:39,488
In the blind rage

2572
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:43,840
Of the berserk moment that younger had described earlier

2573
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,704
He was able to pull himself from the brink and answer that plea from another world

2574
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,496
I let that Soldier live

2575
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:54,336
Mercy could be a dangerous commodity on the battlefield

2576
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
Like this

2577
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,920
Very normal for soldiers

2578
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,944
Going past

2579
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,784
Something like a bunker that might have enemy troops in it to just simply throw grenades

2580
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:04,832
Down the stairs into the bunker

2581
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,136
Not worried about it just keep on moving

2582
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
They were also

2583
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
Killings

2584
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,744
In hot blood a lot of

2585
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:19,424
It was normal for example of troops kept firing at you all the way up till you were almost on top of them and then tried to

2586
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,960
Surrender good luck with that

2587
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:24,032
It was killing In Cold Blood to on all sides

2588
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,336
Buying large when they could

2589
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,896
Both sides like to take prisoners

2590
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,248
None of these Army surrendered in large numbers that was quite unusual

2591
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,296
But a mark of what

2592
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,832
A great first day out

2593
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,112
Operation Michael has

2594
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,904
Is that it sees

2595
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,208
A huge amount of British troops surrender

2596
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,744
Numbers that you never see

2597
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,024
21000

2598
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
First day

2599
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,400
17000 of these people have been casualties

2600
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,960
Do do that for our initial bombardment

2601
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,776
So you can see how their nerves

2602
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,800
Shopkin some

2603
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,152
But they're infected by all those physical

2604
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920
Symptoms

2605
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
Earlier

2606
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:06,272
And they're just stunned

2607
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,624
Historian John Keegan tells a story of a British

2608
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:16,768
Machine gunner who must have been pretty representative of this day it was mowing down German soldiers like

2609
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:19,328
As the approaches machine gun position

2610
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,864
And Keegan

2611
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,144
Coach the soldier

2612
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
A saying

2613
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:23,936
Quote

2614
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:25,728
I thought we'd stop them

2615
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,520
When I felt a bump in the back

2616
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:31,872
I turned around and it was a German officer with a revolver in my back

2617
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:34,432
Come along Tommy you've done enough

2618
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,480
I turned around and then said

2619
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:38,016
Thank you very much sir

2620
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:43,648
I know what I would have done if I'd been held up by a machine gunner and had that revolver in my hand

2621
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
I have finished them off

2622
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
He must have been a real gentleman

2623
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,512
It was 20 past 10

2624
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:51,072
I know the minute because I looked at my watch

2625
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,352
And quote

2626
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,704
And if you actually had to surrender to Germans

2627
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,752
You know why this event it was going on

2628
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,800
It could be a very near run thing

2629
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,664
British private Alfred Roshes captured on the 22nd

2630
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,200
So the next day

2631
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:12,576
With a boy as he describes him but a soldier none-the-less whose badly hit in the head

2632
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
Eyes bleeding

2633
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,392
Andros rights

2634
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,160
Quote

2635
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:20,000
The area we cross is swept by rifle and machine-gun Fire

2636
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:21,536
We crawl and escaping

2637
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,584
The boy is in pain and crying

2638
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:25,376
Presently he jumps up

2639
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,912
Do they come he cries

2640
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,216
I pulled him down who I asked

2641
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,496
Jerry he said

2642
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
I look cautiously up

2643
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:34,848
Theory is right enough the first wave almost on top

2644
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,128
And quote

2645
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,920
Groceries account continue

2646
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,200
Quote

2647
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:42,528
Leave it to me boy we're done we're prisoners now

2648
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,808
Do whatever I tell you

2649
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,112
I wait a second and then

2650
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:46,880
I say

2651
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,160
And take your helmet off

2652
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,184
We do so

2653
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,976
The German in front of me says

2654
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,792
Raises his rifle and take same

2655
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:57,120
I mutter to myself I hope to God he won't pull that trigger

2656
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:59,424
For 10 seconds we remain so

2657
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,960
When he lowers his rifle

2658
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,520
And says what I take to be wounded

2659
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,824
I nod and say yes yes

2660
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,360
He beckons when we approach

2661
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:11,456
We still have our equipment on and the Germans other shouts pointing to it

2662
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:14,016
Flip it off bike ride of the boy doing it myself

2663
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,808
The German has spared us

2664
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:18,368
When we have spared him under the circumstances

2665
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,392
God knows

2666
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,416
Perhaps not

2667
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
And quote

2668
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:25,792
But that same sort of gallantry you see on the German side

2669
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:28,352
In cases like this is present on the French side

2670
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:32,192
And the British side and the Russian side I mean this is this is a human

2671
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:35,264
Element coming forth in the midst of all this evil and of course

2672
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,592
Just as something to juxtaposition the whole thing

2673
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,360
You see the

2674
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,896
Killing of prisoners

2675
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:42,688
By all sides as well

2676
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:46,784
Ian passingham calls March 21st

2677
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,552
The day

2678
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:53,184
The opening of the Michael offensive the first punch in the multi-punch combination right that the Germans in the throat

2679
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,232
One of the most dramatic days in the hole

2680
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:58,304
And he says

2681
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,072
Quote

2682
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,448
In the event that despite numerous Tales of heroic last stands and derring-do

2683
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:08,544
21st of March was a disastrous day for hague's bef

2684
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Mina British Force

2685
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,384
It was the bloodiest day of the first World War

2686
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:15,456
They were over 78000 casualties

2687
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:18,016
Almost 40000 on each side

2688
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:23,904
Though the storm troops and advanced in one or two places up to 10 miles by the end of the day in the south

2689
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:28,000
Overall 21st of March was a day of great sacrifice and confusion

2690
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
And quote

2691
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:33,632
78000 casualties in one day

2692
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,680
That your new world record

2693
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,448
You're right there

2694
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:41,312
The horrible Battle of Waterloo a hundred years previously

2695
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,104
Obscene maybe 60

2696
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,128
Mm casual

2697
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,664
On the first day

2698
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:49,248
But there was no second day at the Battle of Waterloo

2699
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,296
Operation Michael

2700
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:57,440
Play the 78,000 casualties on the first day of the first punch of a multi punch combination

2701
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,976
That would go on for months

2702
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:03,328
Randall gray who wrote a piece on the Kaiser slot said

2703
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:08,960
It was quote the greatest and most intense battle ever fought by the British army

2704
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:09,984
And quote

2705
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,776
He also said

2706
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:16,128
Quote it's certainly represented the most awful non-nuclear

2707
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,408
But chemical

2708
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:23,808
Fighting ordeal undergone by 20th century Soldiers with the possible exception of some 1940 119

2709
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,600
45 Eastern Front battles

2710
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,136
Any rain Iraq War

2711
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:27,904
And

2712
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,512
I always try to remind myself

2713
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:35,584
That what these soldiers went through

2714
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,352
True at these

2715
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,168
Scarred them forever

2716
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:45,312
You know there's a difference we should understand that there are a lot of people who go to war who never see any

2717
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,616
Who deal with paperwork

2718
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:50,176
ProLogistix are Supply in the wrong very important but the

2719
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,992
The people who come home after this war

2720
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,576
And change the psyche of the world

2721
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:57,344
The writers

2722
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,112
The thinkers

2723
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:03,232
It's just the everyday people whose attitudes have been shocked into a different paradigm

2724
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
At what age

2725
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,536
Experience in this combat

2726
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,072
Go through things

2727
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,984
I was particularly moved in one of these Kaiser slots battles at a German soldier

2728
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,776
Under artillery barrage

2729
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:17,824
Talked about what happened to him

2730
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:21,664
And when you think about him having to live with his memory the rest of his life

2731
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,200
And how would alter him on a personal

2732
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:25,760
And then imagine millions of people

2733
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:31,904
Who had seen equally scarring events in their lives who went on to help create this postwar world

2734
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,720
And you can see how this war dug deeply in

2735
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:35,488
Psyche

2736
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:39,584
20th century civilization gouged out a permanent

2737
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,912
The soldiers under French

2738
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,936
Artillery fire

2739
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:44,704
Aaron one of these bad

2740
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:45,728
He writes quote

2741
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:49,312
French shells began to hit to the right and left of us

2742
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:52,128
Leaving human forms writhing in agony

2743
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,176
Or Advanced came to a stop

2744
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:58,784
And after hesitating a few minutes we drew back while the artillery fire followed

2745
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,856
Ripping large gashes in our formation

2746
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,416
Soon the French Drum Fire engulfed us

2747
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:08,000
The air was filled with gas and flying pieces of Steel

2748
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:10,816
We automatically mounted the machine gun for action

2749
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:15,936
And then like animals we borrowed into the Earth as if trying to find protection deep in its bosom

2750
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:20,800
Something struck my back where I carry my gas mask but I did not pay attention to it

2751
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:23,872
A steel Splinter broke the handle of my spayed

2752
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:26,432
And another knock the remains out of my hand

2753
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:28,480
I kept digging with my bare hands

2754
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:31,296
Ducking my head everytime a shell exploded nearby

2755
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,856
A boy to my side was hit in the arm

2756
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:36,672
And tried out for help I crawled over to him

2757
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:41,536
Rip the sleeves of his coat and shirt open and started to bind the bleeding part

2758
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,864
The gas was now so sick that I can hardly discern what I was doing

2759
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:47,680
My eyes began to water and I felt as if I would choke

2760
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,472
I reach for my gas mask

2761
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,008
Pulling it out of its container

2762
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:55,872
And then notice to my horror that is Splinter had gone through it leaving a large hole

2763
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,432
I had seen death thousands of times

2764
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,968
Stared at in the face

2765
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,784
But never experienced the fear I felt then

2766
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,088
Immediately I reverted to the Primitive

2767
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:07,648
I felt like an animal cornered by hunters

2768
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:13,024
With the Instinct of self-preservation uppermost my eyes fell on the boy whose arm bandage

2769
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:17,632
Somehow he managed to put the gas mask on his face with his one good arm

2770
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:21,472
I left Adam in the next moment had ripped the gas mask from his face

2771
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:24,800
With a feeble gesture he tried to wrench it from my grass

2772
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:26,848
Then fell back exhausted

2773
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:30,176
The last thing I saw before putting on the mask with his pleading eyes

2774
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:31,456
And quote

2775
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:37,344
That's related in Peter Hearts Wonder the book The Great War he has such a way of finding

2776
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,160
Those incidents that when you read about them

2777
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:44,256
They they Boggle your mind and then you can go forget about them

2778
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:47,584
But imagine the guy who has to live without the rest of his life

2779
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,376
Those kinds of moments that

2780
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,264
The extremes of Human Experience where these moral choices are thrust in your face like that

2781
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,360
Ernst Junger do I shoot this guy before he shows me the picture of his family

2782
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:03,712
It's kind of what makes these wars fascinating is how do people behave

2783
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:04,992
When

2784
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,296
You know they are under this kind of

2785
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:10,368
Intense pressure and strange extreme circumstance

2786
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:13,184
This is what's happening at the ground level

2787
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,232
The Big Picture level

2788
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:19,072
This last card played by the Germans here

2789
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,864
Has been shockingly effective

2790
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:28,544
The British 5th Army which let's be honest was in no position to be taking on a German Force like this at the moment they

2791
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,152
I've been recovering from a previous battle they were holding two large apart of the front

2792
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:33,920
They had

2793
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:36,736
Infrastructure and defenses that needed some work

2794
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:38,016
And then they get hit

2795
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,832
With this force in this in this violence

2796
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,648
And it immediately shoves them back

2797
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:49,280
The Germans penetrate the first line of their defenses in an hour or two

2798
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:52,096
13 to the second line of their defenses by lunchtime

2799
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,144
This causes

2800
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:59,520
The first of several of what I call Soil your underpants moments

2801
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,056
Better part of

2802
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:02,336
The kaiserschlacht

2803
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,896
The multi-punch combination of luden

2804
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:09,504
By the second day of the battle

2805
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:11,808
Historian hold your hurting says

2806
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,648
Did the fighting is intent hand-to-hand it's closed

2807
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,464
Combat with grenade and it's brutal

2808
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,000
And he writes

2809
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,024
Quote

2810
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,560
After two days

2811
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:26,656
Ludendorff mobile and attack divisions had decimated Gulfs

2812
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:27,424
5th Army

2813
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:32,288
Had driven the British almost 40 miles behind the song and the crows at Canal

2814
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:35,360
Hey get lost 200000 killed and wounded

2815
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:39,200
90000 prisoners of war and 1300 guns

2816
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:45,088
Most importantly his defenses have been ruptured a 50-mile gap driven through his line

2817
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
Open field

2818
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,648
Lay ahead of the German

2819
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:48,672
And quote

2820
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,488
This initial advance

2821
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,840
Has morale skyrocketing amongst the Kaiser

2822
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:57,632
And some around him

2823
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:59,168
Hold your sails quote

2824
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:03,520
Wilhelm II rushed congratulations to the Troops

2825
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,568
And admonish them to push on

2826
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:07,104
This is the Kaiser talking now

2827
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,664
Quote much has been accomplished

2828
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,736
Much more Still Remains to be conquered and quote

2829
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,528
Kirby continue

2830
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:19,136
The Kaiser ordered schools closed in Germany to Mark the victory

2831
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:19,904
In quotes

2832
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,952
He presented Hindenburg

2833
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:24,512
With the iron cross with golden rays

2834
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:28,352
Last given to Prince blue shirt for reading Prussia of Napoleon

2835
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:32,960
And Wilhelm II inform his Entourage over champagne that quote

2836
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:36,032
If an English delegation came to sue for peace

2837
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,592
It must kneel before the German standard

2838
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:41,664
It was a question here of a victory of the monarchy

2839
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,944
Over democracy

2840
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:43,712
And quote

2841
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,552
Ludendorff for sure just Kaiser that the British army had been defeated

2842
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:48,832
And quote

2843
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:53,696
But many in the upper echelons of Germany's military

2844
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:56,768
We're much more sober about what was happening here

2845
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:00,352
And realized it at the pace they were getting chewed up

2846
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,888
He was going to be a problem

2847
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,680
The question is

2848
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,728
Who is going to break first

2849
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,008
This is like

2850
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:13,664
This boxing match we've compared this entire War II throughout this entire series we have too exhausted Fighters hero

2851
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,992
The German High command is kind of thinking you know we really don't have that much laugh

2852
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:20,064
I mean some of the German High command or countering with

2853
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,600
Yeah but neither do that

2854
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:25,184
V army will be forced

2855
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,208
To pull back

2856
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:32,096
When they pull back the Army next to them has to pull back the third Army otherwise they'll lose contact

2857
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:32,864
With each other

2858
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,448
The problem is is that both these armies are attached

2859
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,984
To a French army

2860
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:40,032
And this is the first

2861
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,568
Crisis that erupts

2862
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:42,848
There's

2863
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:48,224
A breach about to open up between the British and the French armies splitting those armies would be huge

2864
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:51,040
This brings us

2865
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,576
To what the heck

2866
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:56,160
Is ludendorff trying to do right what's his plan here in disguise

2867
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:57,696
Whelmed

2868
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:00,256
It's one of the big controversies of the war

2869
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,792
Theoretically

2870
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:05,376
He wants to punch a hole in the line surround the British

2871
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:10,496
Push the British up like a bunch of falling dominoes all the way back up to the English Channel

2872
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,824
There by changing the entire complexion of the war

2873
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,104
Buddy's flexible

2874
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:22,016
He has the saying that is often been quoted afterwards cuz this is one of the things ludendorff gets the most critiqued about

2875
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,552
Where he says

2876
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:27,904
In terms of the strategy and tactics for this big multi punch combination quote

2877
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,440
We will punch a hole

2878
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,720
And then we will see

2879
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,256
We did it that way in Russia

2880
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,536
And quote

2881
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:40,704
And he and Hindenburg didn't do that when they were commanding Eastern Front they go in there they punch a hold and roll up a Russian army

2882
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:45,056
Brazilian casualties do that long enough and eventually a rickety

2883
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:48,128
Russian State falls apart but this is France and Britain

2884
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:50,176
Are you really

2885
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:53,760
Gambling that you're going to open up this hole and they're just going to fall apart

2886
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:56,320
Well ludendorff attitude is

2887
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,392
That I'm not going to fall for the mistakes of my predecessors

2888
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,672
Those people who

2889
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:07,072
You don't have this one place they want to attack and they run into a brick wall and they just keep throwing more troops into the meat grinder in front of that brick wall we're not go

2890
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:10,656
Going to do that when we break through somewhere we going to reinforce success

2891
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:12,192
This is supposed to be

2892
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,984
The part of the latest German ideas about the

2893
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:17,056
What happens if the Breakthrough comes at a spot

2894
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:20,896
When there's not that much of War winning quality

2895
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,456
Unum goals anywhere nearby

2896
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,760
Because the Bulge

2897
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:30,112
Some even call it a breakthrough that the Germans have against the British 5th Army

2898
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:35,488
Happens in a place where there's not anything close by that's going to win you the war

2899
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:40,864
All those places have been you know extra specially defended by the best troops in the best defenses

2900
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,680
The reason that the Germans break through here is because

2901
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,728
It wasn't some very important

2902
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,752
Object nearby

2903
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,312
But the Germans are moving so far

2904
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,848
It eventually they run into one

2905
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:55,712
The place where the roads and Railways all come together a French city name I mean yeah

2906
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:02,112
And it's at this point that something that's been an issue for the entire War

2907
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,392
Comes to a

2908
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,440
And almost fatal head

2909
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:07,744
And that is the fact

2910
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:09,280
That there is no

2911
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,584
Coordinated Allied leadership at all

2912
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,144
Because at this point

2913
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:20,544
Douglas Haig the British military commander on the scene would like help from the French in this crisis situation please send me true

2914
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:26,176
Epson historians have argued about whether or not they did some historians nowadays said they not only did they did it

2915
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:28,992
Before they were even asked and they did it in larger numbers

2916
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,552
How they were British historians Adam always said

2917
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:33,856
Stingy with extra troops in

2918
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:39,232
Put Hagen a situation where the worst possible thing could happen I mean a soil your underpants moment

2919
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,000
Indeed

2920
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,816
But he was asking for

2921
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:48,704
Troops from a guy named pathan who had his own worry he was worried he got an intelligence that the Germans had another fist

2922
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:49,984
It was poised

2923
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:54,336
To attack near Paris and as far as potassium was concerned that was his number one concern

2924
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,152
There's a meeting on March 26th

2925
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,712
And some historians have described

2926
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:01,760
Haig's mood at this point

2927
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:03,296
As near panda

2928
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:10,208
As he runs up against this brick wall where he's not getting the kind of help he feels like he needs and he's in a crisis situation

2929
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,256
Eric Thorn bro says

2930
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,024
Quote

2931
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:17,376
Gaps also opened between the British and the French across the Lewis River

2932
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:19,424
Sending Hagen to near panic

2933
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:22,496
As he ordered trenches dug to protect the channel ports

2934
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:26,848
Shifted six divisions from his northern Army including three from the Frontline

2935
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:29,920
Unemployed pattan to rush 20 division

2936
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:35,296
Always quoting the head of the general staff the British general staff Sir Henry Wilson quote

2937
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:37,344
Ted Wilson on March 25th

2938
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,672
Quote he said that unless the whole of the French army came up

2939
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:41,696
We were beaten

2940
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:44,512
And it would be better to make peace on any terms we could

2941
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:45,536
And quote

2942
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,120
The seriousness of the situation

2943
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:52,448
Finally leads the Allied on Tom Powers

2944
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,728
2

2945
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:57,568
Disregard questions of sovereignty and jealous guarding of

2946
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,896
I'm rights and privileges at all that and finally decide to

2947
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:05,248
Nominate and finally approve somebody whose job is going to be

2948
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:08,576
Not so much to be the boss but to be the guy that Courtney

2949
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:12,672
This honor goes to the French military leader Ferdinand sauce

2950
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:14,208
We had talked about him

2951
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,488
In an earlier

2952
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:17,280
Very aggressive

2953
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:19,072
Energetic

2954
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,352
Brave

2955
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,656
The first thing she'll do

2956
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,704
Is issue an order that says

2957
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,264
That there will be no retreat from this

2958
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,800
Important French

2959
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,080
City that ludendorff

2960
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,104
I'm going to go after now

2961
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:32,384
I mean

2962
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:35,968
The people have to die where they stand basically not one step back

2963
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:43,392
And he will Dole out the reinforcements as he sees fit but he's going to be very stingy in the desert

2964
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,416
Generals like Haig

2965
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:46,208
Will think that he's stingy

2966
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,792
Lloyd George the British prime minister writes in his Memoirs of the

2967
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:55,424
If Josh was being a gambler and that's what generals often has to be how often it we said that ludendorff the gambler

2968
02:20:55,936 --> 02:21:02,080
Is gambling on is it he can be stingy with these reserves and that these generals can me

2969
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:04,896
Manage without them or manage without what they really want

2970
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:10,528
Heads up said he can't get 20 divisions 20 divisions is a huge Force

2971
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,856
No wonder you can't get 20 division boss just trying to

2972
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,880
Safeguard

2973
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
And stock

2974
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,416
Pile

2975
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:19,232
A reserve force people that can just stay back

2976
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:22,304
Stay in good health ready-to-go chomping at the bit

2977
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:28,704
And then unleash a Counterattack when the German offensive is like the way that washes up on the beach and lose

2978
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,752
Loses its momentum right before it

2979
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:35,872
You'll sink back into the surf that's when you want to launch a counteroffensive with fresh troops in the enemy's exhaust

2980
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:38,176
What's Foxy's

2981
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:40,224
In this multi-punch

2982
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:43,808
Combination of ludendorff is an opportunity to win the war

2983
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:46,624
Let the German punch themselves out here

2984
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,440
And then take it to him with a fresh horse once they're exhausted

2985
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:55,840
But the first person only be built by being stingy with reserved when people like hey you're worried that he's about to be pushed into the sea

2986
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:58,912
In the French and the British were about to lose contact in the

2987
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:01,216
In the middle of middle part of this front

2988
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,776
There is desperate

2989
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:10,432
You know I mean heroic when you talk about some of the fighting of this battle if it's the kind of thing where you know you have the last four guys

2990
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:13,504
Guys with the gun over run fighting to the last man to

2991
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:18,112
And I'll give the rest of the army you another hour safety while they we move back to

2992
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:23,744
Reserve positions I mean it's really frantic heroic stuff in the Germans are striving they know this is

2993
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:28,864
The war winning or losing moment and they are giving it their all in the casualties

2994
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,400
Are outrageous

2995
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:32,960
I want to people talk about this time.

2996
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:39,616
As the end of trench warfare in the beginning of open Warfare again which hasn't existed on the Western Front since the war started at me

2997
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,896
He had like six months of it

2998
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:47,296
And the casualties were terrible and then everything went down underground into the trenches cuz it was the only way to

2999
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,576
Stay alive with all that

3000
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:50,624
LED flying up above

3001
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:52,160
In a ground level

3002
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:56,000
And now it had reverted to open Warfare again in the troupe seemed

3003
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,536
Happy to be moving

3004
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:03,680
But this is also much more dangerous cuz those trenches were there for a reason they protected you from the kind of casualties

3005
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:06,240
That you're starting to see right here at Kaiserslautern

3006
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:08,544
With the resumption of open Warfare again

3007
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,080
Comes a kind of casualties

3008
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:11,872
And we haven't seen for a while

3009
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:15,712
Something happens on March 23rd

3010
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:19,552
That it is hard to put it in a proper context

3011
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:20,832
What happens is

3012
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,368
People in Paris

3013
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,184
Start seeing and hearing explosion

3014
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,208
I don't know why

3015
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,512
Decent sized explosion

3016
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:29,280
2

3017
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,608
And in an interesting sort of twist

3018
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:37,984
The explosion comes with no sound of any shell or anything there's just nothing and then boom

3019
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,776
You know something goes up in smoke

3020
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,080
And it's puzzling

3021
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:48,480
For a while the people in Paris can't figure out what's going on and they were there books that talk about this where people will be in cafes speculating

3022
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,016
What's causing the explosions in

3023
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:54,112
An aircraft is what everybody was thinking but that the skies were clear and there were no air

3024
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:56,672
And then one of the theories floated

3025
02:23:57,184 --> 02:24:01,792
Buy some of these people in cafes that were quoted was that the Germans had somehow smuggled in artillery

3026
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:05,888
You secretly hiding it in some force or something within range of

3027
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:08,704
Cuz he was so obviously artillery piece or a bomb

3028
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:10,240
Finally

3029
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:12,032
What the french will figure out

3030
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,336
Is that they are being shell

3031
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:16,640
From Cannon

3032
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:19,712
Firing from the German side of the line

3033
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,760
But the German side of the line is

3034
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
Way farther

3035
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,856
Then the range of any other gun that anyone's ever heard of

3036
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,160
Turns out

3037
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,976
The Paris is not being shot by one gun

3038
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:34,560
I probably multiple gun but they're called the Paris gun

3039
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:36,608
And they're being shelled

3040
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,168
From a distance of 75 MI

3041
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:43,008
The gun can reportedly shoot 81 MI

3042
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,824
And to give you an idea how long that is

3043
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:51,968
One of the longer-range guns you will ever run into are the 16-inch guns on the American

3044
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:53,248
Iowa-class battleship

3045
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:55,808
Making shoot if I

3046
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,576
Recall career

3047
02:24:56,832 --> 02:24:59,136
Directly between 25 and 30 mile

3048
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:02,208
So you're talking about a gun that shoots

3049
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,488
Twice as far

3050
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:04,256
Easily

3051
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:07,840
It's got a barrel that is 100 ft

3052
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:08,864
Long

3053
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:11,680
They have to have a special crane like device

3054
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:17,056
Sits over the gun and holds the barrel up and keeps it from drooping

3055
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,640
The shell that it shoots

3056
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,176
I am told

3057
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:23,456
Is the first

3058
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:27,552
Thing that humans ever launched into the stratosphere

3059
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:34,976
And the distances were so long that the Gunners had to reportedly account for the rotation of the Earth

3060
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,256
First in their calculations

3061
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,584
But their calculations couldn't be that

3062
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:42,912
Targeted I mean these people could only shoot its cities

3063
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,728
Turn that accounts for why the shells would have landed

3064
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:46,496
Randomly

3065
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,080
The worst occasion is a much-talked-about

3066
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:50,848
Still

3067
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:57,248
Incident during a holiday when people were in church in one of these shells Came Crashing through the roof exploded in the

3068
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,016
The church and killed

3069
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:58,784
Like 80 or 9

3070
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,808
90 people it was awful

3071
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,368
But over the course

3072
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,160
The conflict

3073
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:10,048
It would only dish out a little more than 800 casualties and less than 300 gas which you know isn't wonderful

3074
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,400
But if you have a giant artillery piece shelling your city I think you

3075
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,424
Would assume were

3076
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,448
After a while

3077
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:20,032
But some historians say this is all part of a concerted effort

3078
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:22,080
What the what the Germans are trying to do

3079
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:24,384
With their armies shocked the allies

3080
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:28,224
Into a pro-german piece and shelling Paris is away

3081
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,248
Of of

3082
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,784
I'm working the other

3083
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:31,808
Flank sort of on

3084
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:39,744
I'm pushing you British armies back I'm shelling Paris and and believe me it certainly makes clear to the French the stakes involved

3085
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:42,304
The Germans are close enough to be shelling Paris

3086
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:46,656
The key to this battle is going to be

3087
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:52,288
How the generals utilize the reserves that they have not to get too technical but

3088
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:57,408
But in this level of Warfare when troops are fighting each other in Modern Combat they're wearing each other down

3089
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:59,200
And whittling away their strength

3090
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:03,808
And so generals have at their disposal troops that they're holding back

3091
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:10,464
And where they decide to commit those troops as part of the art of generalship it's part of it wins or loses battle

3092
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:13,280
And it's part of what the generals are so concerned about

3093
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,560
When they launched these offenses

3094
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:18,400
At least happy offences have to punch is ludendorff will throw

3095
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:19,680
In Kaiserslautern

3096
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:20,960
Are nothing but

3097
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:22,496
Efforts to divert

3098
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:25,568
Reserves from where he really wants to punch

3099
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:29,664
What was decided to do is to throw

3100
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,968
You know some of these vital and The Limited

3101
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:34,784
Reserves which are all these wonderful Stormtroopers

3102
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:35,808
These

3103
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:42,464
Ernst Junger says they're all kind of young long-haired sort of wild man is opposed to this with a buzz-cut German

3104
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:46,304
It's interesting to talk about Stormtrooper culture I had understood them to be

3105
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,144
Members of the of the best and brightest simply pulled out but

3106
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,936
Younger makes him sound like some sort of

3107
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:57,312
Ultra-cool set of long-haired German Viking youngsters or something

3108
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:59,872
Unless you don't have a ton of them

3109
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:06,272
So where you going to use them ludendorff decides to throw them into where the British army V army in the third Army where they're bulging back like

3110
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:07,296
40 miles

3111
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:10,112
And see if you can smash through to this important Railway junk

3112
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:13,952
But he runs into the same problems

3113
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:16,768
That the British and the French could have warned him about

3114
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:19,840
Duffy's first world war armies run into

3115
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:24,192
When they try to launch offensives and continue them day after day after day

3116
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,728
Assembly breakdown

3117
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:27,520
Any breakdown on multiple love

3118
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:32,128
First of all the logistical and Supply problems are immense

3119
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:34,688
And it remains for the armies that still have

3120
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:38,784
A lot of good stuff like the British and the French to the Germans were down to like

3121
02:28:39,296 --> 02:28:44,160
You know horses that are underfed and not even enough of them to try to move Supply up

3122
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:46,208
These battles are

3123
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,232
Huge chine

3124
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:51,072
At one point some of these really important German armies

3125
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:53,120
Instead of ironic end up

3126
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:57,216
Conquering and pushing into the territory that they had deliberately

3127
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:02,592
Destroyed in a scorched-earth policy to hamper their opponents

3128
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:04,640
And now they had to try to operate in it

3129
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:11,040
The German Army right next door to the army that moved through the scorched-earth territory ended up going through the old Somme Battlefield with all the

3130
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:13,088
Craters and barbed wire and

3131
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:15,904
You know the graveyards of the dead and all this I mean

3132
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:20,512
So both these armies were kind of been bad to rain now they're attacking and more and more

3133
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:23,840
The Allies are resisting heroically

3134
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:25,376
And the supply is

3135
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,144
Huge

3136
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:28,704
The German Army is starving

3137
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,472
In some case

3138
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:37,664
And you know when you read like The Memoirs of ludendorff he'll say something like well Supply didn't keep up or some little comment like that

3139
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:44,320
As a reason why you know these battles bog down but when you actually read accounts of what these troops were desperately

3140
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:45,856
We trying to get the

3141
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:52,256
The guns and the bullets but more importantly even the food to these people who are at buffets called the tip

3142
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:54,304
Tip of the spear or the head of the snake

3143
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,352
The combat troops are actually fighting

3144
02:29:56,864 --> 02:30:01,472
They're being shelled and shot at while they they try to overcome

3145
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:03,264
Supply difficulties

3146
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:07,872
That once you hear the music there and go white it's a miracle they got as far as they did

3147
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,408
Historian

3148
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:10,944
Alexander Watson

3149
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:13,248
As a reminiscence by

3150
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,808
One of these German Supply troops

3151
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:22,464
Realizes that winning or losing the war requires that they get their stuff up to the front but listen to what they have to

3152
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,232
Contend with

3153
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:25,536
And then magnify this

3154
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:27,584
Crossing entire

3155
02:30:28,096 --> 02:30:32,704
40 or 50 mile front as they try to move forward and continue to keep this momentum

3156
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:35,776
As the supply lines get stretched longer

3157
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,568
And the

3158
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,104
German says quote

3159
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:43,456
I have the feeling that we've been marching in the wrong direction

3160
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:49,088
We asked on several occasions but don't receive any useful information and in the meantime Tommy

3161
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:49,856
Dear pet name

3162
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:50,624
For the British work

3163
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:53,696
Begins to shoot and not at all badly

3164
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:58,816
I just ride on ahead and come upon to recently shot up carts into dead horses

3165
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:01,632
Through a miracle the driver remains unhurt

3166
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:04,192
They warned us that we should not drive past

3167
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:05,728
Greenfront is hell

3168
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:07,008
What can you do

3169
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,032
Therefore

3170
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:09,056
Four words

3171
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,616
Now however the way begins to get bad

3172
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:14,432
Thick mud makes forward progress difficult

3173
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:17,760
Assume we have a supply column stuck fast in front of us

3174
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:21,344
A Saxon mobile bridging unit cannot go any further

3175
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,136
It approaches us and gets stuck

3176
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:25,440
We therefore harness the horses

3177
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:26,976
Porsche make room

3178
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:32,864
Unload the bridging unit Stuff Etc all in the deepest darkness and with the least possible noise

3179
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:35,424
In addition the shells crash around

3180
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,728
That one no longer worries about that

3181
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,056
After much effort the wagons are got back on the road and we think

3182
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:43,360
Now the comrade in his column

3183
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:46,432
Who missed their way can go on but no

3184
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:50,528
Just then a Narrow Gauge train comes rushing along

3185
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:53,856
You responsible chaps afro Munitions on the rails

3186
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:56,416
One jolt in the train has derailed

3187
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:59,488
On exactly that street along which we have to pass

3188
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
What to do

3189
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,560
With unspeakable effort

3190
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:05,376
The Munitions Witcher jammed the front door removed

3191
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:08,448
The derailed carriages lifted by means of a winch

3192
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:09,984
And then the route is free

3193
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:13,056
Now the vehicles can get through when they start up again

3194
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:15,616
We then come to the worst part of the road

3195
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:18,944
Bickley allows us to go forward only gradually

3196
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:19,968
And every moment

3197
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:22,272
A wagon and its driver gets stuck

3198
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:24,576
Reserved teams are sent forward

3199
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:29,440
Bridges over streams are especially difficult across and on top of that we're under heavy fire

3200
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:30,720
And quote

3201
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,048
But the fact that

3202
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:35,840
Troops aren't getting supplies

3203
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:40,192
Becomes part of the reason why they can't continue to push on at the pace that

3204
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:45,056
The German High command wants them to push on the pace that they're going to have to push on that they want to achieve these

3205
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,080
Objectives

3206
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,152
Princess Evelyn blue sheer the

3207
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:51,456
English wife of the German nobleman Hulu

3208
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:52,992
Hold a few times before

3209
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:55,040
As a story

3210
02:32:55,296 --> 02:33:00,160
About letters that their family was receiving from family members who were in these battle

3211
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:02,720
And when you read them

3212
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:05,792
You hear about an army that is literally

3213
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:06,816
Starving

3214
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,608
And exhaust

3215
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:10,912
She writes quote

3216
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:16,544
They say that no words can describe the horrors of what they've been through

3217
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:19,360
They write that they're almost dying of starvation

3218
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:25,760
They say they Advanced so rapidly that no Provisions could reach them and their division was 5 days and nights fighting

3219
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:27,296
Incessantly without food

3220
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,832
Or even sleep at all

3221
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:33,184
And those of their companies who were not killed her wounded died of exhaustion

3222
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:37,024
And it is only by a miracle that they themselves are left to tell the tale

3223
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:40,096
Their letter ends with the significant words quote

3224
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:43,424
Send us some food somehow as quickly as you can

3225
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,216
For we also shall die

3226
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:46,752
And quote

3227
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:48,544
Heathen

3228
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:49,568
Comments about

3229
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:52,128
The situation in this little village where she lives quote

3230
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:58,784
The Peasants and Village People received the news that sometimes one sometimes even two of their sons have been killed

3231
02:33:59,040 --> 02:33:59,808
On the same day

3232
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:01,856
It has been wholesale Slaughter of late

3233
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:03,136
And quote

3234
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,952
Given that situation

3235
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:08,768
It's not hard to understand

3236
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:11,584
Once these troops

3237
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,376
Began to push forward

3238
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:16,704
Into Allied controlled area

3239
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:19,520
And see the supply dumps

3240
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,312
Anta stores

3241
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:26,944
And all these things that the Allied troops have it's funny if you read their account they think they were suffering

3242
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:30,272
Right I mean I remember reading one where the guy said that

3243
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:33,600
British soldiers were eating dog biscuits were practically starving

3244
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:36,416
But these Germans come across with these British

3245
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,696
Forces have

3246
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:40,512
And they just stopped in some cases

3247
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:44,352
GJ Meyer quotes of famous piece

3248
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,912
About a soldier

3249
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:51,008
Investigating why the advance wasn't moving forward

3250
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:52,544
A German

3251
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,312
Captain

3252
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,872
Writing about events on March 26th

3253
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:56,896
Quote

3254
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:59,712
Today the advance of our infantry stop near Albury

3255
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:01,760
Nobody could understand why

3256
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:05,344
Our Airmen had reported no enemy between a bear and I mean

3257
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,440
The enemy's guns were only firing now and again on the very edge of Affairs

3258
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:15,840
Our way seemed entirely clear I jumped into a car with orders to find out what was causing the stoppage of the front

3259
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:19,680
As soon as I got near the town I began to see curious sight

3260
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:23,264
Strange figures who look very little like soldiers

3261
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,360
And certainly showed no signs of advancing we're making their way back

3262
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:30,688
There were men driving cows before the Mundelein

3263
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:35,552
Others who carried a hand under one arm and a box of notepaper under the other

3264
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:39,904
Man carrying a bottle of wine under their arm and another one open in their hand

3265
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:46,304
Men who have torn a silk drawing room curtain off its rod and we're dragging it to the rear is a useful piece of

3266
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:50,144
Men with writing paper and color notebooks evidently

3267
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:53,216
They'd found it desirable to osaka station or shop

3268
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:55,776
Men dressed up in comic disguise

3269
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:57,824
Men with top hats on their head

3270
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,360
Men's staggering

3271
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:00,896
Men who could hardly walk

3272
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:04,224
When I got into the town the streets were running with wine

3273
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:07,552
I have a seller, Lieutenant of the 2nd Marine Division

3274
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:09,088
Helpless and in despair

3275
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:10,112
I asked him

3276
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,392
What is going to happen

3277
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:13,952
It was essential for them to get forward immediately

3278
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:16,512
He replied solemnly and emphatically

3279
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:19,584
I cannot get my men out of the cellar without bloodshed

3280
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:20,864
And quote

3281
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:29,312
But in addition to the logistical and Supply exhaustion is another kind of exhausting it plays into all these World War 1 offenses

3282
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,176
It's the part where human beings

3283
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,456
Simply come

3284
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:36,736
To the end of their limit

3285
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:41,088
You know when you can fight a battle the way you want to you rotate people out

3286
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:44,416
So after a unit is so tired they are not useful anymore

3287
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:49,280
Replacing by fresh troops but in these battles and especially on the German side

3288
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,816
It was very difficult to do

3289
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:52,608
And I didn't

3290
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:57,728
The same troops are fighting for days and they're dropping with a stand mean

3291
02:36:57,984 --> 02:37:00,032
If you believe the princess blue shirt letter they're dying

3292
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:01,056
Exhaustion

3293
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:04,128
But if you think about how

3294
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:06,176
Being this tired effects

3295
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:08,480
Your ability to resist and your willingness to

3296
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,760
Continue onward

3297
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:11,552
I mean we're

3298
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:13,088
Sitting in the comfort of our

3299
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,880
Recording studio here

3300
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:18,720
Overwhelmed by these people's ability to put up with the

3301
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:19,744
Yelling

3302
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:22,816
And the conditions in the dead bodies and all that stuff

3303
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:28,192
But that's when you think of them having a full belly and a good night's

3304
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,472
Sleep imagine it

3305
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:33,056
When you haven't slept in days and you're starving to death

3306
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:40,736
In the second world war some of these armies will sometimes you do things like amphetamines to prolong the amount of time

3307
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:41,504
People could

3308
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:44,320
Endure before they hit the exhaustion point

3309
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:48,928
I've seen it blamed by some historians for some of the more Infamous massacres

3310
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:52,512
Your troops that have been up for 12 days straight using speed

3311
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:54,816
They might not be as rational

3312
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:56,096
Or as

3313
02:37:57,376 --> 02:38:00,704
Collected as they might have been 12 days previously

3314
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:06,080
I'm part of why these exhausted soldiers

3315
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:10,176
Are they able to force anything to a conclusion if they're they're moving forward

3316
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:12,224
They've been successful they've been reinforced

3317
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:14,272
But they don't have any Mobility

3318
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:18,368
Throughout all of human history Cavalry it's would have played the role

3319
02:38:18,624 --> 02:38:20,416
Of what they needed now someone that could

3320
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:23,232
Rush forward in Attack retreating or

3321
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:25,536
Troops were at least pulling back really so

3322
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:28,608
He knows all sorts of Chaos in the enemy rear

3323
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:30,400
The Germans need tanks

3324
02:38:30,656 --> 02:38:32,448
I need armored personnel carriers

3325
02:38:32,704 --> 02:38:34,752
They won't have it for another world war

3326
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:37,824
Their opponents do have these things

3327
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:41,664
The unveiled the tank a year before this time.

3328
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:46,272
And they become better and are getting continually better at figuring out how to use it

3329
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,576
Initially the German High command hits

3330
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:52,416
Stopped at this whole tank idea but they're taking it more seriously as time

3331
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:53,184
Time goes on

3332
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:57,280
They wish they had some tanks now I bet because he's exhausted soldiers

3333
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:59,072
Only able to march forward

3334
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,192
Strange on Serene considers this to have been almost Criminal

3335
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,728
But the German High command

3336
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:08,544
Launch is these offensives to win the war

3337
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,848
But don't give the troops any way to exploit them

3338
02:39:11,104 --> 02:39:11,872
3 he said quote

3339
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:18,784
As the year would show the days of Cavalry is an arm of exploitation on a modern Battlefield were over

3340
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:23,904
Yet people as it was the Cavalry was the only exploiting arm that existed

3341
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,000
For the Germans to launch an offensive intended to win the war with none at all

3342
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:29,536
Was not just foolish

3343
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:30,560
It was Criminal

3344
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,096
And quote

3345
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:36,192
And it would allow the enemy to move

3346
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:39,008
Reserves and help in the French of Unleashed

3347
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:43,104
Divisions of troops that come to the A2 and the resistance

3348
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:48,480
Of the Allies will stiffen heroically you know in front of this important Railway juncture

3349
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:51,808
And the Germans would run out of gas essentially

3350
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:53,344
It would be like that wave

3351
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,904
Lost the momentum at the end of the beach

3352
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,464
And ludendorff

3353
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:05,120
Years later writing his memoirs about what he knows is this important moment in his history German

3354
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:07,168
Chinese history world history in that he's been

3355
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:08,960
Criticized for a ton

3356
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:10,496
And here's the way he puts

3357
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:12,032
In his memoir

3358
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:12,800
Forest quote

3359
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:16,128
The enemy's line was now becoming denser

3360
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:18,688
Any places they were even attacking themselves

3361
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:22,528
While our armies were no longer strong enough to overcome them unaided

3362
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,576
The ammunition was not sufficient

3363
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:26,368
Penn Supply became difficult

3364
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:30,720
The repair of roads and Railways was taking too long in spite of all of our preparation

3365
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,024
He then goes on to say

3366
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:37,632
It was an established fact that the enemy's resistance was beyond our star

3367
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:39,680
And quote

3368
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,008
On April 5th

3369
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,288
Ludendorff

3370
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:45,056
Calls off

3371
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:46,336
Operation Mike

3372
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:52,736
He's inflicted 178000 casualties on the British band

3373
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:54,528
In 15 days

3374
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,856
77000 on the French

3375
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:04,256
Are you suffered between 230 and 250 thousand casualties himself

3376
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:08,096
For a man who launched this whole attack

3377
02:41:08,608 --> 02:41:13,984
Out of a fear that American reinforcements were going to come and swamp the Germans through sheer numbers

3378
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,544
You can't trade lives at this rate in survive

3379
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,104
Ludendorff knows that

3380
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,688
But he's going to continue to punch because that's his plan

3381
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:26,272
He's hoping to land a clean shot somewhere

3382
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:30,624
The problem is is that there was so much invested

3383
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:35,232
These offenses that have been planned for months always do the best

3384
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:37,536
Troops morale was always at its highest

3385
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:41,120
The failure was disheartened

3386
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:45,984
And the dad on the German side come disproportionately

3387
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:48,544
From the very best hand-picked troops

3388
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:51,616
Can you decide to

3389
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:57,504
You know use most of the rocket fuel in the very first punch you don't have a ton left for subsequent punch

3390
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:00,064
And at this point

3391
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:06,208
Ludendorff starts getting really pointed not-so-nice questions from subordinates about what's he thinking here

3392
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:07,744
What we going to do

3393
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:09,536
Some of

3394
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,864
Ludendorff staff is turning against him

3395
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:17,984
They're openly questioning his decision making in these situations

3396
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:22,080
At least one of ludendorff responses to his

3397
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:27,968
Rebellious staff members made it into the history books he supposed to have said and one historian described it

3398
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,504
Acidly

3399
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:30,784
Quote

3400
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:33,600
What is the purpose of your croaking

3401
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:35,392
What do you want from me

3402
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,952
Am I now to conclude peace at any price

3403
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,232
And quote

3404
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,304
Wilhelm Von leeb

3405
02:42:43,072 --> 02:42:47,424
Who will be a field Marshal in the next World War is openly critical of lewd

3406
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,192
Indoor

3407
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,984
And then says

3408
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:54,336
That on March 31st he quote totally lost his nerve

3409
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:55,104
And quote

3410
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:58,176
This is sort of the way they described

3411
02:42:58,688 --> 02:42:59,968
A nervous breakdown

3412
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:03,552
And if ludendorff it had one

3413
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:04,320
Here

3414
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:05,856
He may have had

3415
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:12,768
Another one or he may have had the first one later there is going to be an increasingly stressful. Had flu

3416
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:16,096
And he's already showing signs of cracking if he'd had one

3417
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:17,120
Then that would just

3418
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:18,912
Put him as the second

3419
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:21,216
German military leader in this war

3420
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:27,872
To have a nervous breakdown the original architect you had to carry out the plan to win the war the brace started the war Von moltke

3421
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,408
Also

3422
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:30,944
Lost his nerves

3423
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:33,760
How do you say yourself who cares

3424
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:35,296
Why does it matter

3425
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:41,952
But if ludendorff is still basically the guy making all these decisions on what to do with all these punches and how to re

3426
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:46,048
React when opportunities or crises erupt his State of Mind is

3427
02:43:46,304 --> 02:43:47,840
And if it doesn't clear

3428
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:50,144
Houses decision making going to be

3429
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:57,568
He gets questioned increasingly as we continue one or the second punch arrives on April 9th

3430
02:43:58,336 --> 02:44:00,384
So right after Michael is called off

3431
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,664
They launched Georgette

3432
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:08,064
Each of these punches arrested has its own name George it was supposed to be George but now it's been scaled back hands

3433
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:08,832
Georgette

3434
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:10,880
Because of the huge losses

3435
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:12,160
The first punch

3436
02:44:12,928 --> 02:44:13,440
Cost of germ

3437
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:16,512
Georgette is launched in the North in Flanders

3438
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:17,280
Against

3439
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:20,864
In a really strong defenses where they've been fighting for years

3440
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:25,472
These defenses have been weakened somewhat though because when the Germans were busy throwing their first punch

3441
02:44:25,728 --> 02:44:31,872
Hagen the British were rushing every unit that they could spare down to where the fighting was in a bunch of those units have been up here in flight

3442
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:35,200
A lot of what ludendorff is going to do with these punches

3443
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:36,480
As we said

3444
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:38,272
Is the creator version

3445
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:44,672
Video equipment in a boxing match of throwing a punch at someone's body to get them to pull their hands down opening up their head

3446
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,208
Another punch

3447
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:49,792
This is where ludendorff really wants to win the war though

3448
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:50,560
Because up

3449
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:52,864
In the north here in Flanders his goal

3450
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:54,144
Are the channel

3451
02:44:54,912 --> 02:45:01,056
These ports right on the other side of the English Channel from Great Britain that are supplying everything the entire British Army and info

3452
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:03,104
Back all of the stuff that they're bringing in

3453
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:05,408
You know to share with the French and everything else

3454
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:07,712
It's a key area everybody knows it

3455
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:09,248
And when Georgette strikes

3456
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:12,320
Once again ludendorff got foggy weather helping him out

3457
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:15,136
And once again he somehow strikes units that are just

3458
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:16,416
Shouldn't be in the line

3459
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:17,696
They were actually moved

3460
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:20,256
What was thought was a quiet part of the line

3461
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:23,328
And then boom you have another German hurricane bombardment you have

3462
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:26,912
Still some Stormtroopers left we're pursuing through this fog

3463
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:29,216
A poor Portuguese division

3464
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:31,264
This is truly becoming a World War now

3465
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:33,056
It was supposed to be leaving

3466
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:35,616
The front that day gets just

3467
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,640
Disintegrate

3468
02:45:37,664 --> 02:45:42,784
Artillery fire a British unit pulls back and you have a very similar situation to exactly how Michael started

3469
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:46,880
Does German penetration another soil your underpants moments

3470
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:49,696
When Hague once again pleads for

3471
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:52,512
You help from the French and he gets some

3472
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:53,792
But its source

3473
02:45:54,048 --> 02:45:54,560
Stingy

3474
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:56,608
In his mind how much you got to remember

3475
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:02,240
Bashas squirreling away troops for this Counterattack he wants to launch when the Germans are totally punched out

3476
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:04,287
What do you have to gamble

3477
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:08,127
That he can be stingy with troops and not have hate fold up

3478
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:12,991
No one knows whether or not that can happen Hague issues one of his

3479
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:13,759
Most

3480
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:14,527
Famous

3481
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:18,623
Speeches or proclamations I guess you would say it's called The Backs to the wall

3482
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:23,999
Proclamation images literally one of those stand or die orders to the Troops

3483
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:25,535
Very famous very

3484
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:29,631
Stirring rousing when the situation is grim quote

3485
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:32,191
Many amongst us are now tired

3486
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:36,799
To those I would say the victory will belong to the side which holds out the longest

3487
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:40,895
The French army is moving rapidly and in great force to our support

3488
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:43,967
There is no other course open to watch but to fight it out

3489
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:46,783
Every position must be held to the last man

3490
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:48,575
There must be no retire

3491
02:46:49,087 --> 02:46:54,719
With our backs to the wall and believing in the Justice of our cause each one of us must fight on to the end

3492
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:59,839
The safety of our homes and the freedom of mankind of light depend upon the conduct

3493
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:01,887
Of each one of us at this critical moment

3494
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:03,679
And quote

3495
02:47:05,215 --> 02:47:05,727
Nonetheless

3496
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:12,383
Again do do roaches resistant I mean you have to think of both sides is absolutely straining to the max

3497
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:16,991
The British and the French are able to hold once again

3498
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:22,623
The logistical supplies in the human exhaustion and the casualty levels

3499
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:26,207
You don't destroy the momentum of the German attack again it's it's

3500
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:27,231
A mirror image

3501
02:47:29,791 --> 02:47:35,935
It's the same thing that the Allies it had to face the last couple years when they tried to launch a fences and then continue to maintain them all

3502
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:36,703
Madam

3503
02:47:38,495 --> 02:47:41,055
Georgette gets to within 5 miles

3504
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:42,079
Chucky

3505
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:43,871
You know jective

3506
02:47:45,407 --> 02:47:47,199
And both sides by the way oh yeah

3507
02:47:47,455 --> 02:47:51,551
It's going to be mine I'm in Suffern another hundred and ten thousand casualties each

3508
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:54,879
It's hard to get your mind around the numbers I always think

3509
02:47:55,135 --> 02:47:59,487
Can you figure 50 to 60 thousand people fill up your average Sports Stadium

3510
02:47:59,743 --> 02:48:01,791
So you're a hundred and ten thousand number is

3511
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:05,631
In a couple of sports stadiums in Georgia by the way is small

3512
02:48:05,887 --> 02:48:06,911
That's why it's named George

3513
02:48:07,423 --> 02:48:07,935
The big

3514
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,727
Encounters are giving you

3515
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:11,775
In a multi hundreds of thousands of

3516
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,543
The people

3517
02:48:13,567 --> 02:48:14,847
On May 27th

3518
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:16,383
Almost a month later

3519
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,687
Ludendorff Row the Third punch

3520
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:21,503
I'm at the month later because it took that long to

3521
02:48:21,759 --> 02:48:22,783
Is a refit

3522
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:24,575
And reorganize

3523
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:30,207
And send Replacements and have people in the hospital that didn't have major wounds get sent back to the front

3524
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:34,559
Meet the exhaustion with such that it took a month to recover so that they could launch another

3525
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:37,887
One of these punches and it's called operation blue shirt

3526
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:40,191
And within a couple of days

3527
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:42,751
The French are discussing abandoned in Paris

3528
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:45,823
Moving the government to Bordeaux

3529
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:47,871
The British

3530
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:49,151
Arpanet

3531
02:48:49,663 --> 02:48:52,479
But if the French fold up here and it's a real

3532
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:54,783
Possibility that they will

3533
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:56,831
That the British army will be trapped

3534
02:48:57,343 --> 02:49:01,439
On the continent on French soil they will be hostages

3535
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:02,719
In the mines

3536
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:04,255
Are some of these people that were

3537
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:07,327
Discussing coming up with a plan to get the troops

3538
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:08,607
In out of France

3539
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:09,887
Hostages

3540
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:14,239
2A an arm twisting German Pisa green

3541
02:49:14,495 --> 02:49:15,775
Right before the Americans

3542
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:16,799
Can cumming

3543
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:19,871
Saviour up with their massive numbers of people

3544
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:21,663
The British would have had to

3545
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:24,735
Knuckle under after the French were defeated in their army

3546
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,783
It's hundreds of thousands

3547
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:28,319
For low Millions

3548
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:30,111
Be held by the Germans

3549
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:31,135
For leverage

3550
02:49:33,951 --> 02:49:40,095
Wishing happen here is a replay of what we saw in both Michael and Georgette where the Germans again have an initial breakthrough

3551
02:49:40,607 --> 02:49:41,631
The shocking

3552
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:43,423
And unlike

3553
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:50,079
Operation Michael were the Germans broke through and there really wasn't any super fantastic goal that they could strike

3554
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:52,127
This time when they break through

3555
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:53,151
It's near Paris

3556
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:54,687
The French cap

3557
02:49:56,735 --> 02:49:59,039
Ludendorff decides to reinforce this attack

3558
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:02,111
Cavium pathakam labels him and I think it's a pretty good label

3559
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:04,927
For him he says he's ever the opportunist

3560
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:06,719
Never the strategist

3561
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:10,303
But that can be taken kind of is a compliment

3562
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,327
Tattoo ludendorff

3563
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:12,863
Thanks for the idea of

3564
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:14,911
Hitting yourself down one

3565
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:17,727
Standard recipe or set of rules or objective

3566
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:24,127
In a decreases flexibility he makes a move toward Paris and we have this crisis again another story of your underpants moment

3567
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:32,319
Ferdinand Forest provides as many troops as he can without totally destroying his opportunity to have a counter attack in the near future

3568
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:33,087
Future

3569
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:36,671
The Americans unready untrained

3570
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:40,255
Get thrown into the mix because of the desperation of the times

3571
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:46,143
The fighter a small encounter at chateau-thierry it's called and then they'll fight

3572
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:50,239
A famous battle in American military history called Beetle wood

3573
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:53,311
The Americans when they get into combat

3574
02:50:53,567 --> 02:50:54,079
The first time

3575
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:57,407
They fight like the Europeans fought in 1914

3576
02:50:58,687 --> 02:51:00,735
No they're not particularly enamored with with

3577
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:04,575
European Warfare of what they've seen and what they've been a friendship tried to train them and stuff

3578
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:09,695
Stater Brothers storm up San Juan Hill in and simply take these things why are we being so

3579
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:10,463
You know

3580
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:16,863
Conniving about it and why are we here just come up and a little Dash a little American aggressiveness and you'll clear out these

3581
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:19,167
Strangers in the Germans would be on the Run

3582
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:20,959
Because of this

3583
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:22,751
The Americans are taking

3584
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:25,567
1914 level casualty

3585
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:29,407
Minnesota 10000 casualties at belleau wood boom

3586
02:51:29,663 --> 02:51:30,687
Welcome to the war

3587
02:51:31,967 --> 02:51:36,319
Initial German Reports say that the Americans are almost suicidally Brave

3588
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:39,391
Very good Marksman but clumsily lead

3589
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:41,695
Pan American artillery

3590
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:46,047
Which is mostly stuff they borrowed from the French they don't have any of their own heavy artillery

3591
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:52,447
Doesn't know how to do basic things that the European armies do all the time that like a creeping barrage that sort of level of cooperate

3592
02:51:52,703 --> 02:51:53,215
Duration

3593
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:55,519
And I'm sophistication isn't yet

3594
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:57,823
Part of the American Arsenal

3595
02:51:58,079 --> 02:51:59,871
But it makes it hard to conduct battles

3596
02:52:00,127 --> 02:52:01,663
The way the Europeans do

3597
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:05,503
At this point ludendorff says his biggest fear

3598
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:07,039
About the Americans

3599
02:52:07,295 --> 02:52:09,855
Is that they can go and take over

3600
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:15,999
Quiet parts of the line from the French and British soldiers that are currently they're allowing those soldiers to be moved

3601
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:18,303
Linda positions where they can fight the Germans

3602
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:22,911
But there are 10000 Americans a day

3603
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:24,191
Arriving

3604
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:24,959
In France

3605
02:52:25,727 --> 02:52:29,311
There are almost 300 thousand by this time in the story

3606
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:31,359
And there will be

3607
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:34,175
250000 every month

3608
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:35,967
For the foreseeable future

3609
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:40,063
Is the Emperor in great military leader Napoleon said about troops

3610
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:42,111
Quantity has a quality

3611
02:52:42,367 --> 02:52:42,879
All its own

3612
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:45,695
And what ludendorff is going to find out

3613
02:52:46,207 --> 02:52:48,255
Is it the Americans make damn good soldier

3614
02:52:50,047 --> 02:52:51,071
The Canadians

3615
02:52:51,583 --> 02:52:56,959
And the Australians do to and several historians John Keegan among them

3616
02:52:57,215 --> 02:52:59,519
Have started saying that by this point in the war

3617
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:02,847
The Canadian and Australian divisions are the shock Army

3618
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:04,127
Of the British army

3619
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:06,687
The British had lost a ton of their own unit

3620
02:53:07,199 --> 02:53:09,503
In 1916 at the Somme at at this point

3621
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:13,855
The Canadians and the Australians are healthier bigger

3622
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:16,671
Stronger you're still getting sort of The Pick of the litter

3623
02:53:16,927 --> 02:53:18,207
Whereas these British

3624
02:53:18,463 --> 02:53:20,767
Formations involve a lot more people that

3625
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:22,815
If you had your druthers

3626
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:25,887
Should be back in civilian life yunnan with kids or

3627
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:28,703
Still finishing up school or whatever it might be

3628
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:35,871
On the Canadians and Australians are so important at this point in the war that the German intelligence pays attention to where they are

3629
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:37,663
And

3630
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:42,271
I read somewhere that said that if the German intelligence saw that the Canadians in the Australian

3631
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:46,879
A division for right by each other they knew that some offensive was going to happen right there

3632
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:48,927
1 German Soldier quoted

3633
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:51,487
After being captured by the Canadians

3634
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:55,071
Head had been shocked because he said we thought you were up north

3635
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:57,887
You know they think they've monitored where they were

3636
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:01,215
When the Germans captured the Americans

3637
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:05,055
What had so impress them was a combination of how

3638
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:08,895
You're strong and healthy the Americans were compared to

3639
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,919
You know the way

3640
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:15,551
The soldiers that they were either encountering or living with work and also that the equipment was so

3641
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:16,319
Nice

3642
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:20,415
And Christine and they marveled at the quality of the leather

3643
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:24,767
And the belt buckles and all those things I mean to the German army stuff at this point is

3644
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:26,559
Will trash there kit

3645
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:31,167
Call them is tracked and guns and whatnot are still good but in terms of clothing and what not

3646
02:54:31,679 --> 02:54:33,471
The German Army is looking pretty ragged

3647
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:40,895
It'll be two incidents that are celebrated in American history that show the attitude of the Americans as we vote we celebrate

3648
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:42,431
One comes

3649
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:48,831
During a one of these really battle that involve Americans we're going into action with the French in the end there's a moment in time where the French decide to

3650
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:50,367
To call a tactical retreat

3651
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:53,439
Cuz sometimes that's the right move to make you know from the from the Playbook

3652
02:54:53,695 --> 02:54:57,279
And they advised the American captain the Marine Captain I believe that

3653
02:54:57,535 --> 02:54:59,839
He can do the same thing and he famously says

3654
02:55:00,095 --> 02:55:00,607
Retreat

3655
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:02,399
How we only just got here

3656
02:55:03,679 --> 02:55:05,215
And then there's another famous incident

3657
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:07,775
Has gone down into American military law

3658
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:14,431
From these early battles where the Americans do to their impetuosity and and suicidal bravery is

3659
02:55:14,687 --> 02:55:15,199
The German

3660
02:55:15,455 --> 02:55:16,223
Commander might say

3661
02:55:16,735 --> 02:55:22,367
I'll get themselves in trouble Under Fire and Tallgrass the machine gun painting them down and mowing people down

3662
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:28,767
And at a certain point one of their officers an old Marine who had been at all the classic preview first world war marine and count

3663
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:29,791
Recently have

3664
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:35,679
Open from the Spanish-American War to the Philippines to Central America and all that kind of stuff supposed to have stood up

3665
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:41,567
Started walking forward firing his weapon from the hip and yelling at all the soldiers that were on their stomachs in the tall grass

3666
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:44,383
Come on you sons of b****** do you want to live forever

3667
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:46,175
Once again

3668
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:48,991
The ending is a mirror image of the other part

3669
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:49,759
Conscious

3670
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:50,783
Physical

3671
02:55:51,039 --> 02:55:55,647
Human exhaustion combined with logistical and Supply nightmares combined with

3672
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:56,671
Heroic

3673
02:55:56,927 --> 02:55:59,487
Resistance again I can't emphasize enough

3674
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:03,071
These battles on both sides are fought with the ultimate

3675
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:04,351
In a sort of

3676
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:07,679
Frenzied striving I can't describe it any other way

3677
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:10,239
The Germans are starting to get

3678
02:56:11,519 --> 02:56:13,055
As we said they burned their Rock

3679
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:16,127
They're down to people that they had

3680
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:17,407
Planned

3681
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:22,015
To be the troops that you put in the trenches that the better troops had already conquered

3682
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:28,159
To serve in the rear and just kind of be the last line of defense and had a lot of their best weapons were taken and given to the other troops

3683
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:31,999
They never been trained in the new Fire and movement the stormtroop tactics

3684
02:56:32,255 --> 02:56:35,583
And these are the people now who have to make the last few of these punches work

3685
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:37,375
When the batter troops

3686
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:39,679
At a higher state of morale

3687
02:56:39,935 --> 02:56:41,983
At a better time couldn't make it happen

3688
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:45,055
The 4th punches thrown June 9th

3689
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:46,335
Called gneisenau

3690
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:48,383
And this time

3691
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:50,687
You don't see that initial.

3692
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:52,735
Where the Germans are able to

3693
02:56:52,991 --> 02:56:54,271
You don't make great progress

3694
02:56:54,527 --> 02:56:56,063
For their stop here they're just stop

3695
02:56:58,111 --> 02:57:03,999
By this time the kaiserschlacht has cost the German Army between half-a-million and 750000 casual

3696
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:06,303
Remember

3697
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:08,095
This punch of theirs

3698
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:09,887
But they were going to throw

3699
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:14,751
Was about a million 2300000 man fist

3700
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:16,287
And now

3701
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:18,591
It's condition is a little like what

3702
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:20,639
The condition of your fists would be

3703
02:57:20,895 --> 02:57:23,711
If you would been throwing it multiple times into a heart

3704
02:57:24,735 --> 02:57:25,759
First it gets nicked

3705
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:27,551
Let me get sliced up in

3706
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:28,831
It starts to bleed

3707
02:57:29,343 --> 02:57:30,367
And then it starts to

3708
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:32,671
And if

3709
02:57:33,183 --> 02:57:37,535
That wasn't enough there are two other things impacting the ability of the German army

3710
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:38,815
To continue to fight

3711
02:57:39,839 --> 02:57:41,375
One is perhaps

3712
02:57:41,631 --> 02:57:46,495
The worst disease in human history certainly top 5 on anyone's list in terms of

3713
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:48,031
Nasty epidemics

3714
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:51,103
The history of the Spanish Flu

3715
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:52,639
And it

3716
02:57:52,895 --> 02:57:53,663
Probably

3717
02:57:53,919 --> 02:57:54,687
Chilled

3718
02:57:55,199 --> 02:57:56,735
Between 50

3719
02:57:56,991 --> 02:57:58,015
+ 100 million

3720
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:02,367
At a time when the population was less than 2 billion

3721
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:06,975
Some 500 million people will come down with

3722
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:10,303
China in June and July right at the

3723
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:14,399
The time and all these encounters are taking place a half million German soldiers have

3724
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:17,471
In addition to

3725
02:58:17,983 --> 02:58:19,775
An actual Contagion

3726
02:58:20,031 --> 02:58:22,591
They're dealing in the German Army Now with an intellectual

3727
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:28,991
The fire that ludendorff it started in his next door neighbor's apartment

3728
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:30,527
Is now

3729
02:58:31,039 --> 02:58:32,063
Coming home to roost

3730
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:35,647
And as we said it is so hard to figure out from the memoirs

3731
02:58:35,903 --> 02:58:38,719
How much of these people are actually Bolsheviks

3732
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:45,375
How much is a mar much more moderate socialists and how much of it are just people that have decided that the war should be over

3733
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:48,703
Guys like ludendorff and Hitler they put them all in the same category

3734
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:52,543
Dubai 1918 is The Replacements

3735
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:56,127
Are coming to these German units when they need reinforcements from home

3736
02:58:56,895 --> 02:58:57,919
They are people

3737
02:58:58,431 --> 02:58:59,455
That have been

3738
02:59:00,223 --> 02:59:01,759
Touched shall we say

3739
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:04,575
By the intellectual Contagion

3740
02:59:05,087 --> 02:59:11,231
Let loose in Russia by the German High command to undermine their willingness to continue the war

3741
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:13,279
And now they're part

3742
02:59:13,535 --> 02:59:14,559

The German High command found danger in another Court

3752
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:42,207
The impact of the Russian Revolution was beginning to Ripple through the German army

On the side of the Railway cars

Taking them West

3775

And in half-a-dozen German cities underground Network

And instructions on the best spots to slip across the border into neutral holla

And quote

3783

Laughter

3785
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:05,151
The fourth German punch gneisenau is halted quickly

3786
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:06,687
Ludendorff

3787
03:01:07,455 --> 03:01:08,223
Carlos V

3788
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:11,039
And by the way he's planning on 1/6

3789
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:12,575
Pawn shop in Flanders again

3790
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:15,391
Where Georgette JustFab

03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:20,767
The first is V punch maybe to draw reserves away from Flanders

3792
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:24,095
And to who knows you know punch a hole and see what happens

3793
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:27,935
It's known to history as the Second Battle of the Marne

3794
03:01:29,471 --> 03:01:31,519
The reason why people remember this name

3795
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:33,311
So well is because

3796
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:37,151
Instead of the Germans breaking through and having this early success

3797
03:01:37,919 --> 03:01:39,711
At the Second Battle of the Marne

3798
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:41,503
They get hammered back

3799
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:45,087
They launch a pincer movement at a head

3800
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:48,671
A couple of French cities and one side of the pincer is immediately stop the other side

3801
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:53,023
You know goes on for a couple of days slow grinding advance and then it stopped

3802
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:54,047
And then

3803
03:01:55,071 --> 03:02:00,447
The French military leader the generalissimo now the Allied on tan forces Ferdinand phone

3804
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:01,983
Launches

3805
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:03,775
The counter

3806
03:02:04,287 --> 03:02:10,431
Now historians disagree over whether or not this Counterattack counts as the beginning of b-big counter-attack

3807
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:13,247
Bosch has been saving up for some say it does

3808
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:14,783
How do you say

3809
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:18,111
The Discounters attack is more something designed to stop

3810
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:19,391
This battle

3811
03:02:19,647 --> 03:02:21,183
Nginx counter-attack is the beginning of

3812
03:02:21,695 --> 03:02:22,207
Porsche

3813
03:02:22,719 --> 03:02:23,487
Nonetheless

3814
03:02:23,999 --> 03:02:25,023
Within two days

3815
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:28,095
Of the Second Battle of the Marne being launched by ludendorff

3816
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:29,887
The Allies are counter

3817
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:33,215
And they're doing it using

3818
03:02:33,471 --> 03:02:35,263
Essentially Second World War

3819
03:02:38,335 --> 03:02:40,127
They hit the Germans in the fly

3820
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:43,199
They hit a part of the Salient that

3821
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:47,295
A rear area essentially in the Germans are there trying to cut down some weed

3822
03:02:47,551 --> 03:02:49,087
That they've just Advanced into

3823
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:50,367
Cuz they're starving

3824
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:53,439
And then with no warning at all

3825
03:02:54,463 --> 03:02:56,511
An artillery barrage just

3826
03:02:56,767 --> 03:02:57,791
Starts

3827
03:02:58,303 --> 03:02:59,327
And instead of it

3828
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:01,887
You know hitting various positions all over the place

3829
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:04,191
The shells instantly

3830
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:05,983
Come together to form

3831
03:03:06,239 --> 03:03:07,007
One of those

3832
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:10,079
Creeping barrage is those walls of explosions

3833
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:13,919
And then the creeping barrage instantly starts moving forward

3834
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:15,711
Like a giant

3835
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:17,759
Moving hurricane

3836
03:03:18,271 --> 03:03:19,551
Heading towards German troops

3837
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:25,951
Behind this hurricane of shells this wall of explosions

3838
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:27,743
Is a giant smoke screen

3839
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:32,607
And charging out of a forest where they've been hiding

3840
03:03:33,119 --> 03:03:34,911
Are hundreds of light tanks

3841
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:37,471
Followed by infants

3842
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:40,543
And with aircraft swooping down

3843
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:43,871
Conducting what we call now ground attack missions

3844
03:03:44,383 --> 03:03:47,199
Which is something that did not even exist three years preview

3845
03:03:48,735 --> 03:03:50,015
These tanks didn't either

3846
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:54,367
Not only are these tanks and in hundreds of them in one place is very uncommon

3847
03:03:54,623 --> 03:03:56,671
These are a new kind of tank a light tank

3848
03:03:56,927 --> 03:04:00,255
But even ludendorff has to acknowledge in his memoirs

3849
03:04:00,511 --> 03:04:01,535
Made a big difference

3850
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:03,071
Because they're fast

3851
03:04:04,607 --> 03:04:05,119
Well

3852
03:04:05,631 --> 03:04:11,775
They can move at the speed of a jogging man where the heavy tanks which are the size of a school bus and have 15 to 20 people

3853
03:04:12,031 --> 03:04:12,543
On the move

3854
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:14,847
Atmore the speed of a walking man

3855
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:18,175
Hundreds of the tanks at once make a huge difference as well

3856
03:04:18,431 --> 03:04:19,967
And what their job is

3857
03:04:20,223 --> 03:04:22,015
Is the goat take out the things

3858
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:24,063
That are so damaging to the Infantry

3859
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:28,927
Thereby making it safe for the Infantry to advance remember what the first world war did

3860
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:32,511
Was combined a bunch of new weapon systems together the changed everything

3861
03:04:33,535 --> 03:04:35,071
Two of the most important of them were

3862
03:04:35,583 --> 03:04:37,119
Machine guns and barbed wire

3863
03:04:38,143 --> 03:04:43,007
The first thing to do is crushed the barbed wire and go after the machine guns machine guns can't hurt

3864
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:48,383
And what they basically do they often don't even use their guns they often just drive right over

3865
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:52,479
The Machine Gun Nest in either crush the people inside or force them to flee

3866
03:04:52,735 --> 03:04:53,759
But this opens up

3867
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:57,087
The battlefield for the Infantry who are following close behind

3868
03:04:58,623 --> 03:05:00,927
Ludendorff also mentions in his memoirs

3869
03:05:01,183 --> 03:05:01,951
30

3870
03:05:02,207 --> 03:05:04,255
French are using he calls them tanks

3871
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:06,047
That hold Infantry

3872
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:09,119
He said this infantry drives up in the tank

3873
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:10,399
Onto the battlefield

3874
03:05:10,655 --> 03:05:14,751
Dismount setup a Machine Gun Nest and the tank goes back to pick up more Infantry

3875
03:05:15,007 --> 03:05:17,311
He's basically describing armored personnel carrier

3876
03:05:18,591 --> 03:05:20,895
These generals throughout this war

3877
03:05:21,151 --> 03:05:24,991
Have been accused of being unimaginative butchers

3878
03:05:25,503 --> 03:05:28,063
Are figuring out how to overcome

3879
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:30,879
Challenges of early 20th century Warfare

3880
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:38,559
The Germans on their side have some very forward-thinking generals were good at this the Allies due to one of them is a Canadian guy another

3881
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:39,839
Australian General

3882
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:41,631
Korean Monash

3883
03:05:42,399 --> 03:05:43,935
And they're coming up with a new tactic

3884
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:47,263
The French General who are coming up with a new tactic in together

3885
03:05:47,519 --> 03:05:52,383
They are overcoming the traditional things that slow down an offense

3886
03:05:53,919 --> 03:05:56,223
You might call it a form of Proto Blitzkrieg

3887
03:05:58,271 --> 03:05:59,295
American Soldier

3888
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:01,343
Elton e Mackin was at

3889
03:06:01,855 --> 03:06:05,695
This Counterattack and I've been told that there wouldn't be a preliminary Barrage at this

3890
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:06,975
Wall of

3891
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:13,375
Feel this Moving Wall of Steel would just appear instantly and in the Infantry would Russian afterwards and he just

3892
03:06:13,631 --> 03:06:15,167
Describe the situation like this

3893
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:16,191
Quote

3894
03:06:16,447 --> 03:06:17,983
One instant there was silence

3895
03:06:18,495 --> 03:06:22,079
And then the world went mad and a smashing burst of sound

3896
03:06:22,591 --> 03:06:25,151
Men caught off-balance were hurled to the Earth

3897
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:26,943
Which joke against the guns

3898
03:06:27,199 --> 03:06:31,807
Mainz Stupify refused all function for a moment and reel

3899
03:06:32,319 --> 03:06:36,415
Everything within a hundred yards was nodding bitter touring bikes

3900
03:06:36,927 --> 03:06:38,719
Men in trees and wire

3901
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:43,583
The stately Forest melted beneath the raging storm of fire and steel

3902
03:06:44,095 --> 03:06:49,727
Heavy branches and tree trunks crush the life out for men who coward among the routes for shelter

3903
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:52,799
One heard of furious awful screaming

3904
03:06:53,055 --> 03:06:54,847
At the Shell fire rolled away

3905
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:59,199
Then mad waves of charging infantry came after it mopping up

3906
03:06:59,967 --> 03:07:00,479
And quote

3907
03:07:02,527 --> 03:07:04,319
This Allied counteroffensive

3908
03:07:04,831 --> 03:07:05,343
Put it in

3909
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:07,135
To all those punches

3910
03:07:07,647 --> 03:07:09,183
The German Army have been throwing

3911
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:12,511
Ludendorff will very quickly cancel

3912
03:07:12,767 --> 03:07:14,047
That Punchy was thinking about

3913
03:07:14,303 --> 03:07:15,839
Throwing up in Flanders again

3914
03:07:16,351 --> 03:07:18,399
And you put the German Army on the defensive

3915
03:07:19,167 --> 03:07:21,983
And the German Army has now reached a point in this war

3916
03:07:22,495 --> 03:07:23,007
That is

3917
03:07:23,263 --> 03:07:26,847
You you seen a lot of Wars actually what it's that it's that point when

3918
03:07:27,103 --> 03:07:28,127
You're not defeated

3919
03:07:28,895 --> 03:07:30,175
But you can no longer win

3920
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:33,759
How you play that

3921
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:35,807
Card when you're dealt it is very in

3922
03:07:39,135 --> 03:07:40,159
And once again

3923
03:07:40,671 --> 03:07:41,951
Makes us wonder about

3924
03:07:42,975 --> 03:07:44,511
You know how sound

3925
03:07:45,023 --> 03:07:45,791
The mind

3926
03:07:46,303 --> 03:07:48,095
Of the man who's going to play this

3927
03:07:48,351 --> 03:07:48,863
Card is

3928
03:07:50,143 --> 03:07:51,935
During this time period Ludendorff

3929
03:07:52,447 --> 03:07:53,983
Spotted by subordinates cry

3930
03:07:56,799 --> 03:07:58,079
At one point they will

3931
03:07:58,335 --> 03:07:59,103
Carefully

3932
03:07:59,615 --> 03:08:01,663
Convince him to go see a psychiatrist

3933
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:07,039
Any exchanges actually almost a little comical I mean you know these are human beings

3934
03:08:07,551 --> 03:08:09,599
And we could have some sympathy but at the same time that

3935
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:12,415
The psychiatrist is saying things like you never get out

3936
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:15,487
You never smell the air when was the last time you had some good food you know

3937
03:08:15,743 --> 03:08:19,071
It's just whatever you never think about yourself and ludendorff is going yes yes

3938
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:20,607
Altru

3939
03:08:21,119 --> 03:08:21,887
What can I do

3940
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:23,167
And then later says

3941
03:08:23,679 --> 03:08:24,959
But the war has taken

3942
03:08:25,215 --> 03:08:25,727
Everything

3943
03:08:27,519 --> 03:08:28,287
In one sense

3944
03:08:29,567 --> 03:08:30,335
Exaggerate

3945
03:08:31,615 --> 03:08:32,895
Soon after the German

3946
03:08:33,919 --> 03:08:34,431
Michael Oher

3947
03:08:34,687 --> 03:08:36,223
Offensive starts ludendorff

3948
03:08:36,479 --> 03:08:39,551
Motors into territory that has been recently conquered

3949
03:08:39,807 --> 03:08:40,319
By the Germans

3950
03:08:41,087 --> 03:08:43,135
Some of this ground contained Gray

3951
03:08:44,415 --> 03:08:46,975
And ludendorff pulls up in the car The Story Goes

3952
03:08:47,487 --> 03:08:50,303
Have them dig up the remains in one of the graves

3953
03:08:50,815 --> 03:08:53,119
And he identifies his son

3954
03:08:54,655 --> 03:08:55,423
Also named

3955
03:08:55,679 --> 03:08:56,191
Eric luden

3956
03:08:57,727 --> 03:08:59,775
Now this is a stepson actually

3957
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:01,055
But supposedly he was

3958
03:09:01,311 --> 03:09:01,823
Close to them

3959
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:02,591
Biologic

3960
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:04,639
This was the Second Son

3961
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:05,919
But he'd lost

3962
03:09:06,431 --> 03:09:07,199
In this war

3963
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:09,247
Also the second pilot

3964
03:09:10,783 --> 03:09:13,087
And you know what you eating disorder compare and contrast

3965
03:09:13,599 --> 03:09:16,415
This is the last war where you see a lot

3966
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:20,255
A famous powerful important people lose their children

3967
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:21,023
In the war

3968
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:25,631
I can't think of another time. After this week's been anything quite like this

3969
03:09:25,887 --> 03:09:27,679
I mean not only did ludendorff lose

3970
03:09:27,935 --> 03:09:30,239
Two step sons but just off the top of my head

3971
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:32,543
The Prime Minister who Britain

3972
03:09:32,799 --> 03:09:36,383
You know went through the first two or so years of the war with Herbert Asquith he lots of sun

3973
03:09:37,151 --> 03:09:40,479
Ferdinand Fox the generalissimo of the Allies he lost a son

3974
03:09:40,735 --> 03:09:46,879
And famously when he have been told the news he was busy in the middle of an offensive and doing stuff he was told the news he gave himself

3975
03:09:47,135 --> 03:09:47,903
Half hour

3976
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:49,183
To grieve

3977
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:50,975
Compose himself and got back to work

3978
03:09:51,487 --> 03:09:54,047
Theodore Roosevelt's famous Adventure Junkie

3979
03:09:54,303 --> 03:09:56,351
Encourages kids to get involved and then lost

3980
03:09:58,399 --> 03:09:59,167
Pilot also

3981
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:02,495
It's hard to know how much

3982
03:10:03,007 --> 03:10:06,335
Losing his second son in this war affected ludendorff

3983
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:08,127
Attempted to feel like

3984
03:10:08,383 --> 03:10:09,919
It's just one more straw

3985
03:10:10,175 --> 03:10:11,711
Weighing down the camel's back

3986
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:15,807
And he's in one of these positions you know I'm always fascinated by the

3987
03:10:16,063 --> 03:10:16,831
Stream

3988
03:10:17,087 --> 03:10:18,367
Human situations

3989
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:25,023
Ludendorff in one of those positions now in history there's a lot of people have been in the more they're under this extreme crushing Strasser

3990
03:10:27,327 --> 03:10:29,631
And is there a limit that everyone has her could you plug

3991
03:10:29,887 --> 03:10:35,263
Some other person with some other personality type in the situation ludendorff saying and have them do better

3992
03:10:36,031 --> 03:10:41,151
Me looking at off Hitler in the last 4 months of the second world war he's under this crushing

3993
03:10:41,407 --> 03:10:43,711
The Sword of Damocles pressure

3994
03:10:43,967 --> 03:10:44,479
Annie's this

3995
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:45,503
Halsey dress

3996
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:50,623
Can you put someone else in that role and have them do much better I don't know where the limits of

3997
03:10:51,135 --> 03:10:52,159
Human endurance are

3998
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:54,463
Juno

3999
03:10:54,719 --> 03:10:55,743
It's a question

4000
03:10:55,999 --> 03:11:01,375
It's valid across-the-board you don't just want to ask about the people at the top of the food chain like the ludendorff

4001
03:11:02,143 --> 03:11:03,167
You also want to ask

4002
03:11:03,935 --> 03:11:07,519
About the soldiers collectively in the fight how long can they endure

4003
03:11:08,287 --> 03:11:09,055
And also about the Pea

4004
03:11:09,311 --> 03:11:10,591
People back home remember

4005
03:11:10,847 --> 03:11:13,407
One of the things that this war really inaugurate

4006
03:11:13,663 --> 03:11:14,943
The idea of Total War

4007
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:16,735
Although you can go back

4008
03:11:16,991 --> 03:11:17,759
Other times in history

4009
03:11:18,015 --> 03:11:19,551
When you see it but in the modern era

4010
03:11:19,807 --> 03:11:23,135
Total War means the involvement of the West called the home phone

4011
03:11:23,391 --> 03:11:24,671
All the people are needed

4012
03:11:24,927 --> 03:11:27,487
In this endeavor because they produce if nothing else

4013
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:31,327
You know all the Munitions and everything the troops at the front need to keep fighting

4014
03:11:31,583 --> 03:11:32,095
What hap

4015
03:11:32,351 --> 03:11:33,887
It is when they reach the limits of daring

4016
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:38,751
How to slide part of the war

4017
03:11:40,031 --> 03:11:42,591
In the last couple of months will be known as the hundred days

4018
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:48,479
Is one of those it's not a heavily study part of the war because it's not

4019
03:11:48,991 --> 03:11:49,503
Like the

4020
03:11:49,759 --> 03:11:51,551
Trench warfare part of the first World War

4021
03:11:52,575 --> 03:11:55,647
But it's one of those occurrences that that when you read it

4022
03:11:56,671 --> 03:11:58,207
It brings strange emotions

4023
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,231
The four

4024
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:01,791
Because what you watching

4025
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:04,863
Is a sort of a doomed effort

4026
03:12:06,143 --> 03:12:07,935
And the cost of the doomed

4027
03:12:08,191 --> 03:12:08,703
Effort

4028
03:12:08,959 --> 03:12:09,983
Beyond belief

4029
03:12:11,007 --> 03:12:15,103
So as you watch it you don't know what to think because there's something

4030
03:12:15,615 --> 03:12:16,895
Unbelievably

4031
03:12:17,151 --> 03:12:17,919
Admirable

4032
03:12:18,687 --> 03:12:23,039
About the people in the stories willingness to sacrifice all

4033
03:12:24,063 --> 03:12:25,599
For whatever we

4034
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:34,815
The part of you just screams out at what appears to a person not in that situation and let's be honest

4035
03:12:35,071 --> 03:12:37,375
Raised on much more cynical modern values

4036
03:12:37,887 --> 03:12:39,167
What appears to be

4037
03:12:39,423 --> 03:12:41,215
Frankly not that smart

4038
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:48,895
Why did you think that the war is over and you were looking at it from the early 21st century as we

4039
03:12:49,151 --> 03:12:49,663
We are

4040
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:52,991
And you watch these people go through unbelievable things

4041
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:54,015
To prolong it

4042
03:12:54,527 --> 03:12:57,855
In a one second longer or something you can't help but feel

4043
03:12:58,111 --> 03:13:01,695
Like you want to scream out against the collective waste of it all right

4044
03:13:02,463 --> 03:13:06,303
You know if you know that this is done why let this continue

4045
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:08,863
And it's a strange emotion as I said

4046
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:10,143
There's something

4047
03:13:10,655 --> 03:13:11,423
Heroic

4048
03:13:12,191 --> 03:13:14,495
About the last several months of the war

4049
03:13:15,519 --> 03:13:17,311
And one side of the heroism

4050
03:13:17,567 --> 03:13:20,639
And is it again for people in the 21st century it's it's

4051
03:13:20,895 --> 03:13:26,783
It's a little strange because we have the second world war intervening in the way we think about things in the second world war really had a good and evil

4052
03:13:27,039 --> 03:13:27,551
Fealty

4053
03:13:28,063 --> 03:13:34,207
The first World War was sold as a good and evil war in the people at the time. Kind of treated it that way but a hundred years

4054
03:13:34,463 --> 03:13:37,023
Later as we are now you can look back on it and see

4055
03:13:37,279 --> 03:13:38,559
It's really not a good evil War

4056
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:39,839
It's really more of a

4057
03:13:40,095 --> 03:13:43,935
Old lining of power politics international relations

4058
03:13:44,191 --> 03:13:45,983
It's pretty representative

4059
03:13:46,495 --> 03:13:49,567
In a much larger scale the kind of Wars people of always

4060
03:13:53,151 --> 03:13:54,175
And once you do that

4061
03:13:54,687 --> 03:13:55,455
Begin to see

4062
03:13:55,711 --> 03:13:58,527
Everyone sacrifice in a certain light and that I said

4063
03:13:59,551 --> 03:14:00,831
In a strange way the light

4064
03:14:01,087 --> 03:14:02,367
These people sacrifice

4065
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:05,951
Really takes on in the last several months of the war is is

4066
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:06,719
Heroism

4067
03:14:08,255 --> 03:14:09,279
The very old

4068
03:14:09,791 --> 03:14:10,559
Grand Spencer

4069
03:14:10,815 --> 03:14:13,119
The term and maybe a sort of a doomed Herald

4070
03:14:16,447 --> 03:14:18,239
As we said before you know there's a very

4071
03:14:18,495 --> 03:14:19,263
Tolkien-esque

4072
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:20,031
Feeling

4073
03:14:20,287 --> 03:14:25,919
Did the first world war and many people will say that that's not an accident token as we mentioned in an earlier episode

4074
03:14:26,431 --> 03:14:27,967
Was in this war as a soldier

4075
03:14:28,223 --> 03:14:31,807
Started writings the stuff that would become things like the Lord of the Rings

4076
03:14:32,063 --> 03:14:38,207
You know in this conflict base certain scenes of The Lord of the Rings on things he'd seen in this war

4077
03:14:39,743 --> 03:14:40,511
And the way

4078
03:14:40,767 --> 03:14:42,303
The tokens would have under

4079
03:14:42,559 --> 03:14:43,839
Kansas hold Lord of the Rings

4080
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:44,607
Story

4081
03:14:44,863 --> 03:14:46,911
Is a last Alliance

4082
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:50,751
Of the grand old peoples that used to be so powerful

4083
03:14:51,007 --> 03:14:53,823
To take down the dark power

4084
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:55,103
And then

4085
03:14:55,359 --> 03:15:00,735
In a one or two things can happen either they can lose to the dark power and everything will be covered in darkness

4086
03:15:00,991 --> 03:15:04,063
Or they can beat the dark power but in so doing

4087
03:15:04,575 --> 03:15:07,391
Will so damage themselves that their

4088
03:15:07,647 --> 03:15:11,999
You know high water mark on the world stage will also be over it's a doomed

4089
03:15:12,255 --> 03:15:13,791
Victory and that's kind of

4090
03:15:14,303 --> 03:15:15,839
What we're watching in these last

4091
03:15:16,351 --> 03:15:17,631
Couple of months of the war

4092
03:15:18,655 --> 03:15:19,167
Where are you

4093
03:15:19,423 --> 03:15:23,007
Rightfully high amount of damage is being done to all sides

4094
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:27,359
In this effort to bring what's now a foregone conclusion to an end

4095
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:29,151
These people are dying

4096
03:15:29,663 --> 03:15:30,687
Overtime

4097
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:31,455
Maybe

4098
03:15:31,967 --> 03:15:38,111
You know can we kill enough of the enemy to make them give us a little more leeway on this point in a p

4099
03:15:39,391 --> 03:15:40,415
That's what these people are really

4100
03:15:41,439 --> 03:15:43,487
But they're dying in such large numbers

4101
03:15:43,743 --> 03:15:45,023
But these will be

4102
03:15:45,791 --> 03:15:51,935
Mortal wounds really to the British and the French Empires any from not mortal wounds in terms of replaceability cuz Adventure

4103
03:15:52,191 --> 03:15:55,007
You can replace those people may be mortal wounds

4104
03:15:55,519 --> 03:15:56,799
On an imperial site

4105
03:15:57,823 --> 03:16:00,127
Whose cost was now appearing to be

4106
03:16:01,151 --> 03:16:01,919
Unsustainable

4107
03:16:04,223 --> 03:16:04,991
On August 8th

4108
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:06,527
The Allied

4109
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:07,295
Powers law

4110
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:08,575
The long-awaited

4111
03:16:09,855 --> 03:16:10,367
The punch

4112
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:13,695
Against the exhausted German for

4113
03:16:14,719 --> 03:16:15,231
In the hopes

4114
03:16:15,743 --> 03:16:16,511
That you can

4115
03:16:16,767 --> 03:16:19,583
Snap back like a rubber band everything that they had

4116
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:21,119
Taken in the past couple of my

4117
03:16:21,887 --> 03:16:26,239
They have washed up to the top of the beach as we said the tide that had run out of momentum

4118
03:16:26,751 --> 03:16:28,287
And on August 8th

4119
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:29,567
They were hit

4120
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:30,847
With such

4121
03:16:31,103 --> 03:16:32,127
Extreme violence

4122
03:16:32,383 --> 03:16:33,919
In in several places

4123
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:36,735
That ludendorff will call it

4124
03:16:36,991 --> 03:16:39,039
The black day of the German army

4125
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:40,063
History of this

4126
03:16:41,855 --> 03:16:42,879
Can you call it that

4127
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:45,183
Not so much because the Germans

4128
03:16:45,951 --> 03:16:48,767
Were smashed and pushed backward but they were

4129
03:16:49,535 --> 03:16:51,583
But because it seemed to be

4130
03:16:52,095 --> 03:16:54,143
The first real confirmation

4131
03:16:54,911 --> 03:16:56,191
That the morale limit

4132
03:16:56,447 --> 03:16:56,959
Had been reached

4133
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:58,751
At least for some of these Souls

4134
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:02,591
There were a ton of surrenders for

4135
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:04,127
Which is what has happened

4136
03:17:04,383 --> 03:17:10,527
A couple weeks before when the French at launch that battle with all those light tanks a lot of German surrender now they did again here at

4137
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:11,551
Are they didn't surrender

4138
03:17:11,807 --> 03:17:13,599
In ones or twos

4139
03:17:13,855 --> 03:17:16,159
You guys that have been cornered in Shell holes

4140
03:17:16,671 --> 03:17:17,951
They came in groups

4141
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:22,303
Heavily armed man led by Junior officers

4142
03:17:22,559 --> 03:17:25,631
I would surrender to the first Allied officer they ran into

4143
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:29,471
3050 75 men at a time

4144
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:32,799
It was it was a sign of something different cuz the Germans didn't do this

4145
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:34,079
It was a sign

4146
03:17:34,335 --> 03:17:37,407
That we were reaching the limits of endurance at least for some of these

4147
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:38,943
The Army had become brittle

4148
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:43,807
And on August 8th you see that because some elements of the army held firm

4149
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:46,367
We are trying to keep a solid line

4150
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:52,767
If it gives away anywhere the enemy streams through that and then surrounds all the other position turning them into little Ila

4151
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:54,047
Amongst the enemy

4152
03:17:54,815 --> 03:17:57,119
And one of my favorite stories from August 8th

4153
03:17:57,631 --> 03:18:00,959
Because it really brings forward the sense of confusion

4154
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:07,359
Is of an officer in the second line of defense was in a bunker on a telephone trying to get news

4155
03:18:07,615 --> 03:18:09,407
What the heck's going on here stop

4156
03:18:10,687 --> 03:18:13,503
It's foggy that day which is kind of like mother nature

4157
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:20,159
I decided to equal the yard cuz it has been foggy through so many of the punches the Germans and recently thrown in

4158
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:22,975
Their 1918 spring offensive it seems only fair

4159
03:18:23,231 --> 03:18:24,255
It would be foggy

4160
03:18:24,767 --> 03:18:29,887
Another day the allies counter-attack and it is in that bunker Commander says you can't even see ten feet out there

4161
03:18:30,655 --> 03:18:34,239
And then as he's on the phone trying to figure out what's going on in Eid coming down the stairs and

4162
03:18:34,495 --> 03:18:36,543
And says that the lines are broken in the enemy is

4163
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:38,591
Has has Pez bypass this

4164
03:18:38,847 --> 03:18:40,639
Read out as if is behind them

4165
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:43,967
And he says that before the person speaking even get the whole message out

4166
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:46,783
The grenades are rolling down his

4167
03:18:47,039 --> 03:18:48,319
Staircase into his bunker

4168
03:18:49,599 --> 03:18:50,879
The enemies are already

4169
03:18:51,135 --> 03:18:51,903
Throwing grenades

4170
03:18:52,671 --> 03:18:53,951
So is sums up how

4171
03:18:54,207 --> 03:18:57,791
August 8th looked in the Allies in the north of it I mean yeah

4172
03:18:58,047 --> 03:19:02,143
The British were using the Canadian to Australian Cypress episode of shock armies

4173
03:19:02,655 --> 03:19:05,471
Used 500 + 10

4174
03:19:05,983 --> 03:19:07,519
And most of them are the big heavy ones that

4175
03:19:07,775 --> 03:19:08,799
They're like school buses

4176
03:19:09,823 --> 03:19:12,639
And have the aircraft come in and do the ground attack missions

4177
03:19:12,895 --> 03:19:14,687
I am the Infantry come out that use the

4178
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:18,527
The wall of shells but no preliminary bombardment

4179
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:21,343
And German units just break in front of

4180
03:19:23,135 --> 03:19:24,415
The French have success

4181
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:27,231
You know when there's that they launched a couple hours later

4182
03:19:28,255 --> 03:19:32,351
And the Allies are pushing through German lines and making what

4183
03:19:32,607 --> 03:19:34,655
Buy first world war standards

4184
03:19:34,911 --> 03:19:37,983
Is great progress here's how historian Nick Floyd described

4185
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:39,519
The Day quote

4186
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:43,103
8 dog is would be one of the most remarkable days of the war

4187
03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:45,919
Although the position of all units was not known

4188
03:19:46,175 --> 03:19:50,527
The Allied assault and driven between 6 and 8 mi into German line

4189
03:19:50,783 --> 03:19:54,879
Shattering the second Army and unhinging the flank of the 18th Army on its left

4190
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:57,183
German casualties have been staggering

4191
03:19:57,695 --> 03:20:01,791
The official history estimated that they were as high as 48000 men

4192
03:20:02,047 --> 03:20:04,863
Including 33000 missing or taken prisoner

4193
03:20:05,375 --> 03:20:07,167
400 guns have been lost

4194
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:09,727
As well as hundreds of machine guns and trench mortar

4195
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:12,031
4 the battalions in the Frontline

4196
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:14,847
Often only small groups of survivors remain

4197
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:16,127
He then continued

4198
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:16,895
Misquote

4199
03:20:17,151 --> 03:20:20,735
Numerous Frontline battalions have been reduced to the size of companies

4200
03:20:20,991 --> 03:20:23,807
All that remained were clusters of shell-shocked men

4201
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:25,855
There will utterly broken

4202
03:20:26,111 --> 03:20:28,671
Their faces grimy their eyes glasses

4203
03:20:28,927 --> 03:20:29,951
Staring straight ahead

4204
03:20:30,207 --> 03:20:31,999
Their stories were always the same

4205
03:20:32,511 --> 03:20:35,839
Horrifying accounts of iron monsters clanking out of The Mists

4206
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:36,607
Towards them

4207
03:20:36,863 --> 03:20:38,399
Of mass infantry attack

4208
03:20:38,655 --> 03:20:40,447
A being cut off and surrounded

4209
03:20:40,703 --> 03:20:43,007
Waiting for counter-attacks that never came

4210
03:20:43,519 --> 03:20:45,823
Some did not or perhaps could not

4211
03:20:46,079 --> 03:20:47,103
Say anything at all

4212
03:20:47,615 --> 03:20:49,663
Ludendorff worst nightmare was

4213
03:20:49,919 --> 03:20:50,687
It seemed

4214
03:20:50,943 --> 03:20:51,711
Coming through

4215
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:52,991
And quote

4216
03:20:55,295 --> 03:20:59,135
In his Memoirs his very suspect and take it with a grain of salt memoirs

4217
03:20:59,647 --> 03:21:04,767
Ludendorff claims to have sent an observer to go and check out the scene

4218
03:21:05,023 --> 03:21:05,791
What are these

4219
03:21:06,303 --> 03:21:07,583
Units were breaking

4220
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:10,143
He says the Observer came back and said

4221
03:21:10,399 --> 03:21:12,447
That the troops at the front line

4222
03:21:12,703 --> 03:21:16,543
Were yelling at the reserves they came up to take their place

4223
03:21:17,055 --> 03:21:18,079
Black legs

4224
03:21:18,591 --> 03:21:20,127
Strikebreakers

4225
03:21:20,383 --> 03:21:22,175
You're prolonging the war

4226
03:21:23,199 --> 03:21:24,223
And ludendorff

4227
03:21:24,735 --> 03:21:25,247
Pointed out

4228
03:21:25,503 --> 03:21:26,783
That there was no way to hide now

4229
03:21:27,807 --> 03:21:31,647
You know the changes in the fighting efficiency is he called it of the troops

4230
03:21:31,903 --> 03:21:34,207
They become brittle you couldn't depend on some of them

4231
03:21:35,487 --> 03:21:39,839
Ludendorff said of course that I warned you about this all the time it's the motion isn't taking hold he wanted to

4232
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:42,143
Shoot more of them maybe is a

4233
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:43,679
Way to stiffen the defense

4234
03:21:44,703 --> 03:21:45,471
But then he says

4235
03:21:45,983 --> 03:21:47,519
The dis convinced him that the war

4236
03:21:47,775 --> 03:21:48,287
Had to be in

4237
03:21:49,823 --> 03:21:51,103
And then some history say

4238
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:57,247
Did the Kaiser a day or two later comes to the conclusion after talking with them that the war had to be ended in than other histories

4239
03:21:57,759 --> 03:21:58,527
Say other things

4240
03:21:58,783 --> 03:22:04,159
I don't even know how to describe all of the uncertainties as people try to figure out what really happened

4241
03:22:04,415 --> 03:22:06,463
And is opposed to what ended up in the history book

4242
03:22:07,999 --> 03:22:10,815
There's a lot of evidence that suggested ludendorff was more of a

4243
03:22:11,327 --> 03:22:13,631
Hardliner and held out until much later

4244
03:22:13,887 --> 03:22:15,167
But when you see how

4245
03:22:15,423 --> 03:22:21,567
Again the sacrifice that's going to be made because he maybe drags his feet on peace.

4246
03:22:21,823 --> 03:22:22,847
Negotiations for example

4247
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:29,503
That's a hard thing to justify after the war if a decision like that cost an extra hundred or two hundred thousand casualties

4248
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:33,599
How do you look your countrymen in the eye 20-30 years later right

4249
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:40,255
I think if I were in ludendorff shoes I might try after the war to shade things in the best light to

4250
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:43,839
One of the tragedies during this. They'll be a

4251
03:22:44,351 --> 03:22:45,375
German general who is

4252
03:22:45,631 --> 03:22:48,959
Looking at the incoming list of 18 year olds in entire

4253
03:22:49,471 --> 03:22:51,775
Age group now being called up again to be

4254
03:22:52,031 --> 03:22:53,055
Thrown into the mall

4255
03:22:53,311 --> 03:22:55,359
Love this war when it's already decided and

4256
03:22:55,615 --> 03:22:56,127
Jose

4257
03:22:56,639 --> 03:22:57,919
Too bad about the Young Blood

4258
03:22:59,967 --> 03:23:00,735
If one of those

4259
03:23:00,991 --> 03:23:02,527
Members of that new crop

4260
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:06,111
Youngbloodz was your son and you lost him in that war

4261
03:23:06,623 --> 03:23:09,183
Afterwards reading ludendorff Memoirs you might not be

4262
03:23:09,695 --> 03:23:10,207
You pleased either

4263
03:23:11,743 --> 03:23:12,511
Nonetheless

4264
03:23:13,023 --> 03:23:15,583
After the black day of the German Army on August 8th

4265
03:23:16,351 --> 03:23:20,191
The Allies will launch a series of regular Hammer blow

4266
03:23:20,703 --> 03:23:25,055
The Germans and they're all pretty darn awful in between them there's tons of

4267
03:23:25,311 --> 03:23:31,455
Fighting going on you the taking of this Machine Gun Nest e moving into this Valley it's pretty much constant somewhere up a

4268
03:23:31,711 --> 03:23:33,759
Turn down the line pressure on the German army

4269
03:23:34,271 --> 03:23:40,415
In the casualties because now we've reverted back to open Warfare again people are not hiding in trenches which let's be on

4270
03:23:41,439 --> 03:23:45,791
Are safer than being up above the trenches which is why you had trenches to begin with

4271
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:48,351
And the casualties just go through the roof again

4272
03:23:48,607 --> 03:23:50,143
At a point in the war

4273
03:23:50,655 --> 03:23:51,935
We're really

4274
03:23:52,447 --> 03:23:53,727
They're fighting for

4275
03:23:53,983 --> 03:23:54,751
Improved

4276
03:23:55,263 --> 03:23:56,543
Terms of an armistice

4277
03:23:57,055 --> 03:24:03,199
Right and ludendorff not exactly moving all that fast supposedly the Kaiser want to open up negotiations with the Netherlands

4278
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:03,967
But it's not

4279
03:24:04,223 --> 03:24:05,759
We taking off so fast and you're thinking

4280
03:24:06,015 --> 03:24:09,087
In your head is you look back on this tragedy everyday

4281
03:24:09,343 --> 03:24:14,207
In all these people dying just want them to hurry rush there's a time limit here right everyday

4282
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:16,255
You get a little closer to Armageddon

4283
03:24:17,535 --> 03:24:18,303
Armageddon

4284
03:24:18,559 --> 03:24:20,095
Exactly what historian Peter Hart

4285
03:24:20,351 --> 03:24:21,119
Call Des.

4286
03:24:21,375 --> 03:24:21,887
Did the war

4287
03:24:22,911 --> 03:24:23,423
The. Aft

4288
03:24:23,935 --> 03:24:30,079
Black day of the German Army August 8th when multiple punches keep knocking the Germans backward eventually knocking them back

4289
03:24:30,335 --> 03:24:31,871
I can do those prepare defenses

4290
03:24:32,383 --> 03:24:32,895
That they had

4291
03:24:33,407 --> 03:24:38,271
And I move forward from months ago and everybody takes up their positions again in the Allies smash through that

4292
03:24:39,551 --> 03:24:40,319
Heart says quote

4293
03:24:41,087 --> 03:24:42,367
The Allied armies

4294
03:24:42,623 --> 03:24:47,743
British French American and Belgian moved forward along most of the Western Front

4295
03:24:48,255 --> 03:24:49,535
They were winning all right

4296
03:24:49,791 --> 03:24:51,583
The casualties were still high

4297
03:24:51,839 --> 03:24:54,399
This was a truly murderous form of warfare

4298
03:24:54,655 --> 03:25:00,287
It's a sobering statistic that of the 1.2 million men serving in the British expeditionary Force

4299
03:25:00,543 --> 03:25:03,103
Between August and November 1918

4300
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:06,431
Some 360000 of them became casual

4301
03:25:07,199 --> 03:25:08,223
This was unsustainable

4302
03:25:08,735 --> 03:25:10,527
The bef was being consumed

4303
03:25:10,783 --> 03:25:13,855
The French and Americans were also suffering this was Armageddon

4304
03:25:14,623 --> 03:25:15,135
And quote

4305
03:25:17,183 --> 03:25:19,231
Again it remind you of an almost tolkien-esque

4306
03:25:19,487 --> 03:25:20,255
Situation

4307
03:25:21,023 --> 03:25:25,631
We're the good guys even if they win are going to be a shadow of their former selves

4308
03:25:27,167 --> 03:25:29,727
But if it was bad for the allies with least knew that they were

4309
03:25:29,983 --> 03:25:31,519
Going to win the situation

4310
03:25:32,031 --> 03:25:32,799
Think about what it was like

4311
03:25:33,055 --> 03:25:34,079
The people who are enduring

4312
03:25:34,591 --> 03:25:37,663
With the knowledge that whatever they were fighting for

4313
03:25:38,175 --> 03:25:39,199
Is already a mood

4314
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:41,247
In passing

4315
03:25:41,759 --> 03:25:42,271
Quote

4316
03:25:42,783 --> 03:25:47,647
Most of the Kaiser's men wear now utterly resigned to the prospect of defeat and despair

4317
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:54,303
But they fought on in places with such tenacity and in such good order never ceases to impress animes many that either

4318
03:25:54,559 --> 03:25:56,607
Witnessed it then or consider it today

4319
03:25:57,119 --> 03:25:59,423
But it was also a truly awful experience

4320
03:25:59,935 --> 03:26:01,471
Soldiers bemoaned their plate

4321
03:26:02,239 --> 03:26:03,263
He quotes a German soldier

4322
03:26:03,775 --> 03:26:04,287
During these

4323
03:26:04,543 --> 03:26:05,567
Last hundred days of the war

4324
03:26:05,823 --> 03:26:06,335
Quote

4325
03:26:06,591 --> 03:26:08,383
Our artillery is fired out

4326
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:09,919
We have too few horses

4327
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:14,527
Are fresh troops are anaemic Boys in need of rest who cannot carry a pack

4328
03:26:15,039 --> 03:26:16,319
But merely know how to die

4329
03:26:16,831 --> 03:26:17,599
5000

4330
03:26:18,111 --> 03:26:22,719
They understand nothing about Warfare they simply go and let themselves be shot down

4331
03:26:23,231 --> 03:26:27,071
The summer of 1918 has been the most bloody and the most terrible

4332
03:26:27,327 --> 03:26:29,631
Every man here knows we are losing the war

4333
03:26:29,887 --> 03:26:31,423
Still the campaign goes on

4334
03:26:31,935 --> 03:26:32,959
The dying goes on

4335
03:26:36,287 --> 03:26:37,567
Again that's another guy

4336
03:26:37,823 --> 03:26:41,663
You might not want to read ludendorff Memoirs after the war

4337
03:26:41,919 --> 03:26:48,063
After the war the great German historian militaries during Hans Dale Brook will be a scathing critique of ludendorff

4338
03:26:48,575 --> 03:26:52,159
And with the same kind of Rage that anyone might have from that generation

4339
03:26:52,415 --> 03:26:55,487
And even that side of the war when you realize that maybe

4340
03:26:55,743 --> 03:26:59,071
Several hundred thousand casualties were unnecessary

4341
03:27:00,607 --> 03:27:01,887
As we said the weird

4342
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:04,703
Human emotion that comes into play though

4343
03:27:05,215 --> 03:27:08,799
Is that when you look at the sacrifices in the endurance of these people

4344
03:27:09,055 --> 03:27:12,383
You can't help but notice the heroism in it right

4345
03:27:12,895 --> 03:27:14,175
It's a strange thing

4346
03:27:16,223 --> 03:27:19,551
Lloyd George knows it though the British prime minister in his Memoirs in a

4347
03:27:20,063 --> 03:27:21,599
Art that you can't release pin

4348
03:27:22,367 --> 03:27:25,183
Goes out of his way to just talk about how amazing

4349
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:27,743
The whole thing was he says quote

4350
03:27:29,023 --> 03:27:35,167
The ceaseless body blows delivered with increasing Power by the Allied Forces left the German army

4351
03:27:35,423 --> 03:27:36,703
Breathless and helpless

4352
03:27:37,215 --> 03:27:38,751
But it is fair to acknowledge

4353
03:27:39,007 --> 03:27:43,359
That they retreated fighting for every kilometer that they ultimately had to concede

4354
03:27:43,871 --> 03:27:44,895
He was not a Chase

4355
03:27:45,151 --> 03:27:46,431
And hardly a Pursuit

4356
03:27:46,687 --> 03:27:47,455
Starved

4357
03:27:47,711 --> 03:27:51,551
Decimated despairing the German soldiers fought on

4358
03:27:51,807 --> 03:27:55,135
Making us pay a heavy price for every mile we wrestled from them

4359
03:27:55,647 --> 03:28:01,791
Throughout the whole War the Germans had shown themselves Dowdy Fighters but there was nothing finer in their record then

4360
03:28:02,047 --> 03:28:05,631
The pluck with which they continue to withstand Us in the hour of their defeat

4361
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:10,239
They could not but know that they were beaten at home their families were starving

4362
03:28:10,495 --> 03:28:16,639
Yet in the month of October the last whole month of the War the British forces in France suffered over a hundred and

4363
03:28:16,895 --> 03:28:18,431
20000 battle casualties

4364
03:28:18,687 --> 03:28:20,991
As evidence of the resistance they encountered

4365
03:28:21,247 --> 03:28:27,391
Between July 1st and the conclusion of hostilities the British battle casualties in fighting a beat info

4366
03:28:27,647 --> 03:28:30,719
Nfo that knew he was beating on every front

4367
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:35,071
Total 430000 in killed wounded prisoners and missing

4368
03:28:35,327 --> 03:28:39,935
Doing practically the same. The French lost 530 1000 men

4369
03:28:40,191 --> 03:28:42,239
How many Americans over 200000

4370
03:28:42,495 --> 03:28:47,615
Let us do honor to a brave people with whom we've had but one deadly Coral

4371
03:28:47,871 --> 03:28:50,175
They fought to the end with desperate Valor

4372
03:28:50,687 --> 03:28:51,199
End call

4373
03:28:53,247 --> 03:28:55,295
American historian Scott Stevenson

4374
03:28:55,807 --> 03:28:56,319
Rote

4375
03:28:56,831 --> 03:28:57,343
Quote

4376
03:28:57,855 --> 03:29:03,999
To be a German defender in the path of a major Allied attack laid in the war was to experience the whole

4377
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:05,535
Tours of Dante's Inferno

4378
03:29:07,327 --> 03:29:07,839
And quote

4379
03:29:09,119 --> 03:29:11,167
And truthfully when you read the stories

4380
03:29:11,679 --> 03:29:13,727
They sound like they could come from any part of

4381
03:29:13,983 --> 03:29:14,495
This nightmare

4382
03:29:15,519 --> 03:29:17,567
The worst tragedy here is

4383
03:29:17,823 --> 03:29:18,591
Did you get the feeling like

4384
03:29:18,847 --> 03:29:19,871
Like all of this is

4385
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:24,223
They're coming after the time when this conflict should be ended already

4386
03:29:24,991 --> 03:29:27,295
If the whole thing is already tragic this is the

4387
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:33,439
Historian Nick Lloyd talks about a German Gunner name Ernst

4388
03:29:33,695 --> 03:29:34,207
Killmeyer's

4389
03:29:35,231 --> 03:29:38,559
Who recorded in his diary about the fighting going on in Layton

4390
03:29:38,815 --> 03:29:39,839
September early October

4391
03:29:40,607 --> 03:29:44,191
He writes about his experience of coming under sustained British artillery

4392
03:29:44,447 --> 03:29:46,239
Bombardment including a direct

4393
03:29:47,519 --> 03:29:50,079
He talks about three men and says that they were quote

4394
03:29:50,335 --> 03:29:52,383
Torn apart beyond recognition

4395
03:29:53,407 --> 03:29:55,967
May said oh Lord what a Monday morning

4396
03:29:56,223 --> 03:29:56,735
And said quote

4397
03:29:56,991 --> 03:29:59,807
I'm firing on gun number for all day

4398
03:30:00,063 --> 03:30:04,159
In between we picked up the pieces of bone and flesh and put them in a box

4399
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:07,999
I marked them with a red pencil my companion at all times

4400
03:30:08,255 --> 03:30:10,303
So that the cemetery official will know

4401
03:30:10,559 --> 03:30:13,631
Has there metal plates with names and ranks could not be found

4402
03:30:13,887 --> 03:30:15,679
Try to pick up three heads

4403
03:30:15,935 --> 03:30:19,519
Six arms and feet and whatever else there is left from your friends

4404
03:30:20,543 --> 03:30:22,335
And then the historian Nick Lloyd Wright's

4405
03:30:22,847 --> 03:30:23,359
Quote

4406
03:30:23,871 --> 03:30:27,967
Killmonger was understandably traumatized by his experiences

4407
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:33,599
Quote if that's how three of us died he wrote I hope their families will never find out

4408
03:30:34,367 --> 03:30:34,879
And quote

4409
03:30:36,927 --> 03:30:38,719
And it came as we done earlier in this

4410
03:30:39,231 --> 03:30:40,511
Peace I want to emphasize

4411
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:43,071
These are the survivors

4412
03:30:43,839 --> 03:30:47,679
To go home and make the post first world war world

4413
03:30:48,447 --> 03:30:50,239
These are water in their memory bank

4414
03:30:50,751 --> 03:30:54,079
These are what they carry with them these are what influence their politics

4415
03:30:54,591 --> 03:30:55,615
Their standards

4416
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:57,407
Their expectations

4417
03:30:57,663 --> 03:30:59,455
And influences what they want

4418
03:31:00,223 --> 03:31:01,247
The bitterness

4419
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:03,295
That is part of what

4420
03:31:03,551 --> 03:31:07,903
Adolf Hitler is trying to touch in his audience reading his book mine comp

4421
03:31:08,159 --> 03:31:09,183
Is the sort of bitterness

4422
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:11,743
That experiences like this General

4423
03:31:12,255 --> 03:31:14,559
And I do so in an entire generation

4424
03:31:15,839 --> 03:31:16,863
The British and the French

4425
03:31:17,119 --> 03:31:17,631
Also have the

4426
03:31:17,887 --> 03:31:19,167
They're poets and their writers

4427
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:21,215
And if thinkers and their politics

4428
03:31:21,727 --> 03:31:23,519
And when one wonders why they

4429
03:31:24,031 --> 03:31:27,359
Seems so willing to do whatever it took before the second World War

4430
03:31:27,615 --> 03:31:28,383
Even if

4431
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:30,687
It involved will be call today appeasement

4432
03:31:30,943 --> 03:31:34,015
Look at what were in those people's memory banks

4433
03:31:34,527 --> 03:31:36,319
Doing all those negotiations

4434
03:31:36,831 --> 03:31:42,719
The vast majority of the people that will be in decision-making positions militarily and politically

4435
03:31:43,231 --> 03:31:44,255
Were people who were in the fur

4436
03:31:44,767 --> 03:31:45,279
World War

4437
03:31:46,559 --> 03:31:47,327
Look at what they went

4438
03:31:48,863 --> 03:31:49,887
And think of how it changed

4439
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:54,751
As Autumn was beginning to turn to November in 1980

4440
03:31:55,007 --> 03:31:59,103
18th Optimist were beginning to think that this war could be won in 1919

4441
03:31:59,871 --> 03:32:03,199
Paschima still pointed out maybe 1920 was more realistic

4442
03:32:03,455 --> 03:32:08,063
If the Germans began a step-by-step dog and defense they could hold out for a long time

4443
03:32:09,599 --> 03:32:12,159
It's worth pointing out to cuz it's kind of important of the Germans

4444
03:32:12,415 --> 03:32:16,255
Art on German soil get their retreating but they're still on conquered territory

4445
03:32:16,767 --> 03:32:19,327
Something that they would continually tell themselves was

4446
03:32:20,095 --> 03:32:22,655
In a sign that they were never defeated

4447
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:29,311
And something politicians after the war will play up to write the never defeated German Army always on conquer territory but there be

4448
03:32:29,567 --> 03:32:30,335
Being battered pillared

4449
03:32:30,591 --> 03:32:31,103
The post

4450
03:32:31,359 --> 03:32:33,151
During this last hundred days offensive

4451
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:35,967
They will retreat at one point

4452
03:32:36,223 --> 03:32:42,367
To the old Hindenburg line these great defenses they going to make a stand will never break the Hindenburg line and then American and French

4453
03:32:42,623 --> 03:32:44,159
Forces break through the Hindenburg line

4454
03:32:47,999 --> 03:32:51,071
Ironically though considering all of the debate the Allied

4455
03:32:51,327 --> 03:32:57,471
Commanders and politicians have been having for years the eastern or western or debate where you put the troops where do you win the war Western Front

4456
03:32:57,727 --> 03:33:01,055
Country someplace else it's someplace else that collapses first

4457
03:33:02,847 --> 03:33:03,615
In this case

4458
03:33:03,871 --> 03:33:05,151
It's What's called the Balkan

4459
03:33:05,919 --> 03:33:12,063
And for years the Allies have been slowly but surely building up forces in a place called Salonika in Greece and doing nothing with

4460
03:33:12,319 --> 03:33:13,087
The mainly

4461
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:16,927
The British especially joked that they were the gardeners

4462
03:33:17,183 --> 03:33:17,951
Salonika

4463
03:33:18,207 --> 03:33:19,487
Cuz they were just sitting around

4464
03:33:19,999 --> 03:33:26,143
Agregar me eventually joins the French and British Army that's their the army of Serbia remember Serbia has been conquered

4465
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:30,495
Taking over out of the worn-out for a couple of years but their army fled with the king at the head

4466
03:33:30,751 --> 03:33:33,311
And they've been reconstituted here at Salonika

4467
03:33:33,567 --> 03:33:39,711
But more people are dying from malaria there than any military fighting and then all of a sudden September 1918

4468
03:33:39,967 --> 03:33:43,039
The Allies strike there against a bunch of bulgarians

4469
03:33:43,295 --> 03:33:49,439
Who are poorly supplied poorly motivated and certainly not ready to be hit by what is now more than

4470
03:33:49,695 --> 03:33:50,719
100000

4471
03:33:50,975 --> 03:33:51,743
Allied troops

4472
03:33:52,255 --> 03:33:52,767
And they collapse

4473
03:33:54,303 --> 03:33:55,071
Dissing perils ever

4474
03:33:55,839 --> 03:34:00,959
And it's funny because if you read the Western history is written by the British and the French in the Americans

4475
03:34:01,215 --> 03:34:05,311
It's clear that to them this is a sideshow thing it could barely get to mention sometime

4476
03:34:05,823 --> 03:34:07,103
But if you read German

4477
03:34:07,359 --> 03:34:07,871
Accounts

4478
03:34:08,127 --> 03:34:09,151
This is a catastrophe

4479
03:34:10,175 --> 03:34:11,199
They get their oil

4480
03:34:11,455 --> 03:34:13,247
A lot of their food from this area

4481
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:14,783
This will certainly

4482
03:34:15,039 --> 03:34:18,879
It'll be the last card for the austro-hungarians were teetering anyway

4483
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:20,671
Cuz this is right by them

4484
03:34:21,439 --> 03:34:26,815
The Ottoman Empire you know was one second away from collapsing to this is sort of a final straw

4485
03:34:28,095 --> 03:34:31,167
Between Bulgaria dropped out of the war in September 29th

4486
03:34:31,679 --> 03:34:33,471
That ludendorff finally breaks down

4487
03:34:34,751 --> 03:34:36,031
No ifs ands or buts about it

4488
03:34:37,823 --> 03:34:38,847
He goes to the Kaiser

4489
03:34:39,103 --> 03:34:45,247
And says that the war must be ended right away we need an Armistice right now if I can't guarantee that the Army will be able to stand another

4490
03:34:45,503 --> 03:34:46,271
24 hours

4491
03:34:47,295 --> 03:34:53,439
The German Government contact Woodrow Wilson hoping that they can get a nice deal from the Americans were at the British and the French are not feeling.

4492
03:34:53,695 --> 03:34:54,207
Charitable

4493
03:34:54,719 --> 03:34:55,487
Wilson still has house

4494
03:34:55,743 --> 03:35:01,887
Is idealistic 14 points out there and maybe the Germans can get that deal now looks a lot better to them while they're retreating

4495
03:35:02,143 --> 03:35:03,423
Going to do while they were dancing

4496
03:35:06,495 --> 03:35:09,567
Andaz German military historian Hans delbruck

4497
03:35:10,335 --> 03:35:11,359
Writing this is

4498
03:35:11,615 --> 03:35:12,383
The most

4499
03:35:12,639 --> 03:35:13,407
Painful

4500
03:35:13,663 --> 03:35:15,199
Event he's ever lived

4501
03:35:16,223 --> 03:35:18,015
And he writes this at the time

4502
03:35:18,271 --> 03:35:20,575
To the German public and is the

4503
03:35:20,831 --> 03:35:24,927
Editor of the book points out this is something that would have been censored 3 weeks before he wrote

4504
03:35:25,183 --> 03:35:31,327
Right it was so anti-war or defeatist or whatever you want to say but now at this point in the war

4505
03:35:31,583 --> 03:35:34,143
He's allowed to openly say something like

4506
03:35:34,655 --> 03:35:35,167
This

4507
03:35:35,423 --> 03:35:35,935
Quote

4508
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:39,519
The same day I completed the previous volume

4509
03:35:39,775 --> 03:35:42,335
The most terrible fate we feared overcame us

4510
03:35:42,847 --> 03:35:45,663
Are Southeast front in the Balkans broke completely open

4511
03:35:46,175 --> 03:35:52,319
The bulgarians were defeated their King abdicated and the army of the untalented so long defended Solana

4512
03:35:52,575 --> 03:35:54,623
What's on the march to the Danube River

4513
03:35:55,135 --> 03:35:59,743
Is Siri of the English not only fought but destroyed the Turkish Army and took Damascus

4514
03:36:00,255 --> 03:36:04,607
In Constantinople the German Allied Turkish government of Everett Talent is gone

4515
03:36:05,119 --> 03:36:08,703
It will not be long before the English fleet has free access to the Black Sea

4516
03:36:09,215 --> 03:36:11,775
Austria-Hungary is also in full dissolution

4517
03:36:12,031 --> 03:36:17,919
On the Western Front our hope that the enemy offensive would not pass through our Siegfried line is unfulfilled

4518
03:36:18,175 --> 03:36:23,295
Under heavy losses of prisoners and material are army Retreats from one place to another

4519
03:36:23,551 --> 03:36:26,879
The superiority of our combined enemies not only in men

4520
03:36:27,135 --> 03:36:32,511
But also in material airplanes tanks and Munitions far exceed expectations and calculations

4521
03:36:33,023 --> 03:36:39,167
When we remember how strong we looked at the world this past spring and our Battlefield successes from the 21st

4522
03:36:39,423 --> 03:36:40,447
First of March through June

4523
03:36:40,703 --> 03:36:42,495
Are sudden reverse is hard to believe

4524
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:43,775
And quote

4525
03:36:45,567 --> 03:36:47,359
On October 30th the ottoman

4526
03:36:48,127 --> 03:36:48,639
Drop out of the war

4527
03:36:51,711 --> 03:36:52,991
On November 3rd

4528
03:36:53,503 --> 03:36:54,015
The ostrich

4529
03:36:56,831 --> 03:37:01,439
While all this is going on you have this very weird almost month long period

4530
03:37:01,951 --> 03:37:08,095
Where negotiations are opening and going on behind-the-scenes and everybody begins to get the impression that things are happy

4531
03:37:08,351 --> 03:37:10,143
I mean the mood is quickening the Warriors

4532
03:37:10,399 --> 03:37:14,495
He's winding to some sort of a conclusion but people are still dying in Mass numbers

4533
03:37:16,287 --> 03:37:18,847
Summon the higher-ups of the German Navy

4534
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:21,663
Decide that if the wars going to end like this

4535
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:23,711
The German Navy is going to go out

4536
03:37:23,967 --> 03:37:24,479
Heroic

4537
03:37:25,759 --> 03:37:26,527
And they

4538
03:37:27,039 --> 03:37:30,367
Come up with an idea for an Imperial Navy death

4539
03:37:31,903 --> 03:37:35,487
Sally out with everything you have take on the British Fleet

4540
03:37:35,743 --> 03:37:40,351
You know when a giant head-to-head battle and go down fighting and take as many of them with you as you can

4541
03:37:41,887 --> 03:37:42,655
Which towns

4542
03:37:42,911 --> 03:37:49,055
Heroic and wonderful if you're some Admiral somewhere when news that this is what's going on reaches the same

4543
03:37:49,311 --> 03:37:50,591
Sailors in the fleet though

4544
03:37:50,847 --> 03:37:55,967
Who can also see that the war is winding down everybody's going to get to go home it's terrible but it's over

4545
03:37:56,223 --> 03:38:00,319
And then they find out they get to be part of some death ride to save some honor for a fleet

4546
03:38:00,831 --> 03:38:02,623
That isn't going to be around

4547
03:38:02,879 --> 03:38:03,391
Weather

4548
03:38:03,647 --> 03:38:05,695
Death ride happens or not

4549
03:38:05,951 --> 03:38:06,975
In a month's time

4550
03:38:07,231 --> 03:38:08,255
They say no

4551
03:38:09,791 --> 03:38:10,559
Annie begin

4552
03:38:11,071 --> 03:38:11,583
2

4553
03:38:12,351 --> 03:38:12,863
Rebelle

4554
03:38:13,375 --> 03:38:15,935
Riot is not too strong of a word first

4555
03:38:16,447 --> 03:38:19,007
They have mutineers mutineers a captured

4556
03:38:19,263 --> 03:38:20,543
Then the rest of the fleet

4557
03:38:20,799 --> 03:38:22,591
Sailors get upset about the mutineers and

4558
03:38:22,847 --> 03:38:24,127
Long story short they end up

4559
03:38:24,383 --> 03:38:27,967
In a running through the streets taking over the naval city of Kiel

4560
03:38:28,735 --> 03:38:30,527
And then they send out runners

4561
03:38:30,783 --> 03:38:33,343
Two other nearby cities and they begin to spread

4562
03:38:33,855 --> 03:38:38,207
An idea not that dissimilar from ideas that were being spread in Russia

4563
03:38:38,719 --> 03:38:39,487
The year before

4564
03:38:41,023 --> 03:38:41,791
Here is

4565
03:38:42,047 --> 03:38:43,071
The fire

4566
03:38:43,327 --> 03:38:47,423
From ludendorff Neighbors apartment finally taking flame in German

4567
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:53,311
And there's been a lot of analysis as to how Bolshevik oriented some of this is

4568
03:38:53,567 --> 03:38:55,103
And the truth is most of it isn't

4569
03:38:55,871 --> 03:39:02,015
The left in Germany runs the gamut from mild social Democrats all the way to hardcore what are Cults partisan

4570
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:04,831
And everything in between

4571
03:39:05,087 --> 03:39:11,231
And part of what'll happen over the next six months in Germany will happen because there's no agreement on the left at all

4572
03:39:11,487 --> 03:39:12,511
As to watch it happen

4573
03:39:12,767 --> 03:39:15,071
Except that they're pretty darn unified about one thing

4574
03:39:15,583 --> 03:39:17,375
The war shouldn't happen anymore

4575
03:39:18,143 --> 03:39:18,911
Anesthesia

4576
03:39:19,423 --> 03:39:22,239
People spread to other locations city after City

4577
03:39:22,495 --> 03:39:23,775
Ghost revolutionary

4578
03:39:25,311 --> 03:39:28,895
The great journalist Philip Gibbs was with the Allied on Tommy's as they

4579
03:39:29,151 --> 03:39:31,967
As they battled the Germans back towards Germany

4580
03:39:32,479 --> 03:39:35,807
And thinks of everything they've been through these years of war he writes quote

4581
03:39:36,575 --> 03:39:38,879
The thought of all the losses on the way

4582
03:39:39,135 --> 03:39:41,183
And of all the futility of this strife

4583
03:39:41,695 --> 03:39:42,975
Molded ones heart

4584
03:39:43,487 --> 03:39:45,279
What fools the Germans have been

4585
03:39:45,535 --> 03:39:46,815
What tragic fools

4586
03:39:47,327 --> 03:39:53,471
What a madvillainy there had been among rival dynasties and powers and politicians and people to lead to this

4587
03:39:53,727 --> 03:39:54,239
This massacre

4588
03:39:55,007 --> 03:39:56,543
41 gained out of it all

4589
03:39:56,799 --> 03:39:58,079
Nothing except ruin

4590
03:39:58,591 --> 03:40:01,919
Nothing except great death and poverty and remorse and Revolt

4591
03:40:02,431 --> 03:40:02,943
And quote

4592
03:40:03,711 --> 03:40:05,503
I'm at the German armies are collapsing

4593
03:40:05,759 --> 03:40:07,551
Gibbs points out that it's not a moment

4594
03:40:07,807 --> 03:40:08,319
Too soon

4595
03:40:08,575 --> 03:40:09,087
Your rights quote

4596
03:40:10,111 --> 03:40:13,695
The British army could not have gone much farther after November 11th

4597
03:40:13,951 --> 03:40:15,743
When the Armistice brought us to a halt

4598
03:40:15,999 --> 03:40:18,559
For three months our troops had fought incessantly

4599
03:40:19,071 --> 03:40:22,143
Storming many villages strongly garrisoned with machine gunners

4600
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:24,447
Crossing mini canals under heavy fire

4601
03:40:24,703 --> 03:40:27,007
Losing many comrades all along the way

4602
03:40:27,263 --> 03:40:29,055
The pace could not have been kept up

4603
03:40:29,311 --> 03:40:33,407
There was a limit even to the Valor of British troops and for a time we had reached that limit

4604
03:40:34,175 --> 03:40:37,503
There were not many divisions who could have staggered onto new attacks

4605
03:40:37,759 --> 03:40:39,039
Without rest and relief

4606
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:42,879
The French and the Americans

4607
03:40:43,135 --> 03:40:43,903
And then says quote

4608
03:40:44,415 --> 03:40:46,719
Before them the German troops were in Revolt

4609
03:40:46,975 --> 03:40:47,487
At last

4610
03:40:47,743 --> 03:40:49,023
Against the bloody

4611
03:40:49,279 --> 03:40:52,095
Futile sacrifices of their manhood in people

4612
03:40:52,351 --> 03:40:58,495
A blinding light had come to them revealing the criminality of their Warlords in this great Swindle again

4613
03:40:58,751 --> 03:40:59,263
Their race

4614
03:40:59,519 --> 03:41:05,663
It was defeat and Agony which enlightened them as most people even ourselves or enlightened only by suffer

4615
03:41:05,919 --> 03:41:06,943
Disillusionment

4616
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:08,479
I never by successes

4617
03:41:09,503 --> 03:41:10,015
And quote

4618
03:41:11,551 --> 03:41:12,831
If you read mine comp

4619
03:41:13,855 --> 03:41:15,903
This moment in the war

4620
03:41:16,415 --> 03:41:18,719
Is The Crucible of Hitler's life

4621
03:41:19,743 --> 03:41:21,791
And he says basically what Gibson

4622
03:41:22,815 --> 03:41:23,839
You know when he finds out

4623
03:41:24,351 --> 03:41:27,423
About what's going on he is recovering from a gas attack

4624
03:41:27,935 --> 03:41:28,703
In the hospital

4625
03:41:29,215 --> 03:41:30,495
Annie finds out that

4626
03:41:30,751 --> 03:41:36,895
This war is essentially winding down to an Armistice in the German government and the allies and especially Woodrow Wilson on it

4627
03:41:37,151 --> 03:41:40,479
Getting back and forth as people died and Hitler freaks out

4628
03:41:41,759 --> 03:41:44,063
And then he writes about it in mine comp

4629
03:41:44,319 --> 03:41:45,343
In a way

4630
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:46,111
That is

4631
03:41:46,367 --> 03:41:47,647
Tactically brilliant

4632
03:41:47,903 --> 03:41:50,463
I mean Hitler is a demagogue of the highest order

4633
03:41:50,975 --> 03:41:54,815
And knows exactly you know what buttons to push in his body

4634
03:41:55,327 --> 03:41:57,119
And he knows that this audience

4635
03:41:57,375 --> 03:41:58,143
10 years

4636
03:41:58,399 --> 03:42:01,471
15 years after the war not even that long in some cases

4637
03:42:01,727 --> 03:42:02,239
AR

4638
03:42:03,007 --> 03:42:04,031
Still in shock

4639
03:42:04,287 --> 03:42:08,383
In denial and disbelief and in the bitterness that they are drowning in thinking of

4640
03:42:08,639 --> 03:42:14,015
What was lost and who they knew who is lost and in the limbs that they had lost in the lives that they changed

4641
03:42:14,271 --> 03:42:15,039
He knew

4642
03:42:15,295 --> 03:42:16,831
Hit those buttons were right

4643
03:42:17,087 --> 03:42:18,367
For exploiting

4644
03:42:19,135 --> 03:42:20,927
And yet at the same time demagogue

4645
03:42:21,183 --> 03:42:25,023
A manipulator though he was Hitler understood those buttons really well

4646
03:42:25,535 --> 03:42:28,351
Because those were actually the same buttons that he was so effect

4647
03:42:28,607 --> 03:42:30,655
Feisty wrote this in mine comp

4648
03:42:30,911 --> 03:42:32,447
Remember imagine reading this

4649
03:42:32,959 --> 03:42:33,471
Has one of those

4650
03:42:33,727 --> 03:42:35,263
People sitting there without an alarm

4651
03:42:35,519 --> 03:42:37,311
15 years after the war

4652
03:42:38,079 --> 03:42:38,847
Tortured by

4653
03:42:39,103 --> 03:42:40,639
That experience still

4654
03:42:41,407 --> 03:42:41,919
Hitler says

4655
03:42:42,175 --> 03:42:42,687
Quote

4656
03:42:43,455 --> 03:42:44,991
And so it all been in vain

4657
03:42:45,503 --> 03:42:48,319
In vain all the sacrifices and privations

4658
03:42:48,575 --> 03:42:50,879
In vain the hunger and thirst of months

4659
03:42:51,135 --> 03:42:52,415
Which were often endless

4660
03:42:52,927 --> 03:42:58,303
In Vein the hours in which with Mortal fear clutching our hearts we nevertheless did our duty

4661
03:42:58,559 --> 03:43:01,119
And in vain the deaths of two millions who died

4662
03:43:01,631 --> 03:43:07,775
Would not the graves of all the hundreds of thousands open the graves of those with faith in the Fatherland

4663
03:43:08,031 --> 03:43:09,823
Add March 4th never to return

4664
03:43:10,079 --> 03:43:16,223
Would they not open and send the silent mud and blood covered Heroes back as spirits of Vengeance to the

4665
03:43:16,479 --> 03:43:16,991
Homeland

4666
03:43:17,247 --> 03:43:20,319
Muchachitas done with such mockery of the highest sacrifices

4667
03:43:20,575 --> 03:43:22,623
Which a man can make to his people in this world

4668
03:43:22,879 --> 03:43:24,159
Are they died for this

4669
03:43:24,671 --> 03:43:27,487
The soldiers of August and September 1914

4670
03:43:27,743 --> 03:43:28,767
Was it for this

4671
03:43:29,023 --> 03:43:33,887
In the Autumn of the same year that the volunteer regiments marched out after their old comrades

4672
03:43:34,143 --> 03:43:38,239
Was it for this that the boys of 17 sank into the Earth of Flanders

4673
03:43:38,495 --> 03:43:41,567
Was this the meaning of the sacrifice which the German mother

4674
03:43:41,823 --> 03:43:46,687
Mage of the Fatherland with sore heart as she let her best-loved boys March off

4675
03:43:46,943 --> 03:43:48,479
Never to see them again

4676
03:43:48,735 --> 03:43:49,759
Did all this happen

4677
03:43:50,015 --> 03:43:53,855
Only show the gang of wretched criminals could lay hands on the Fatherland

4678
03:43:54,879 --> 03:43:55,391
And quote

4679
03:43:56,927 --> 03:43:58,463
This bitterness was not just

4680
03:43:58,975 --> 03:44:01,791
On the side of the Central Powers who lost this war though

4681
03:44:02,303 --> 03:44:04,351
Corporal louis barthas in the French army

4682
03:44:04,863 --> 03:44:05,375
Is

4683
03:44:05,887 --> 03:44:06,655
If nothing else

4684
03:44:06,911 --> 03:44:07,423
Almost

4685
03:44:07,935 --> 03:44:08,959
In sympathy

4686
03:44:09,471 --> 03:44:10,239
With the German vet

4687
03:44:11,519 --> 03:44:14,335
Many of these people felt cheated by the whole thing

4688
03:44:14,591 --> 03:44:17,151
Disillusion by the whole thing exploited Eva

4689
03:44:18,687 --> 03:44:23,551
Barta sounds like he feels more sympathy for his German enemy

4690
03:44:23,807 --> 03:44:25,343
Then he does for the people

4691
03:44:25,599 --> 03:44:29,183
You know that in his mind anyway Bartos is a socialist and believes that the

4692
03:44:29,439 --> 03:44:30,463
The people running the world

4693
03:44:32,255 --> 03:44:33,023
He writes quote

4694
03:44:33,535 --> 03:44:36,863
Meanwhile the great drama was reaching its conclusion

4695
03:44:37,119 --> 03:44:41,727
Alone against 20 Nations being after her in a fantastic clamor

4696
03:44:41,983 --> 03:44:42,495
Germany

4697
03:44:42,751 --> 03:44:46,847
So proud in 1914 now on its knees ask for mercy

4698
03:44:47,103 --> 03:44:48,383
Ask for armistice

4699
03:44:48,895 --> 03:44:52,479
But this way of fleeing the war didn't appeal to the striped sleeves

4700
03:44:52,735 --> 03:44:54,527
Who didn't have their fill of crosses

4701
03:44:54,783 --> 03:44:57,855
Metal Stars Stripes ribbons honors and Glory

4702
03:44:58,367 --> 03:44:59,135
For these folks

4703
03:44:59,391 --> 03:45:02,463
Warhead the end with total disaster for the German army

4704
03:45:02,719 --> 03:45:03,231
Against which

4705
03:45:03,487 --> 03:45:06,815
Jenna Waterloo and Saddam would be mere skirmishes

4706
03:45:07,071 --> 03:45:08,863
Thousands of captured Cannon

4707
03:45:09,119 --> 03:45:11,423
Hundreds of thousands of captured Bashas

4708
03:45:11,679 --> 03:45:14,751
Shattered enemy forces streaming back across the Rhine Bridges

4709
03:45:15,007 --> 03:45:17,567
Pursued with bayonets at their backs by our soldiers

4710
03:45:18,079 --> 03:45:20,639
Our regiments entering the great cities beyond the Rhine

4711
03:45:20,895 --> 03:45:27,039
Flags fluttering bands playing here was the apothecus dreamed of not only by our great warriors

4712
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:27,807
By the government

4713
03:45:28,063 --> 03:45:29,087
Almost all the Press

4714
03:45:29,343 --> 03:45:33,695
Almost all the embassies and back in the rear all those who had nothing more to lose

4715
03:45:33,951 --> 03:45:37,791
For who had more to gain by continuing the war what did a hundred thousand

4716
03:45:38,047 --> 03:45:43,167
200000 more cadavers matter a few more months of unimaginable suffering to bear

4717
03:45:44,191 --> 03:45:47,263
Did that matter for those who were far from the slugfest

4718
03:45:48,287 --> 03:45:54,431
Assassin to accomplish this monster history in the so-called Allied government sought to delay for as long as possible

4719
03:45:54,687 --> 03:45:56,479
The hour of the last Cannon shot

4720
03:45:56,735 --> 03:46:00,575
By requiring Germany to repeat its demands for Armistice several times

4721
03:46:00,831 --> 03:46:03,135
Four simple questions of form and formula

4722
03:46:03,903 --> 03:46:05,439
He says during that time

4723
03:46:05,695 --> 03:46:09,535
In an orgy of murder bloodletting and burning the whole front was in flames

4724
03:46:09,791 --> 03:46:14,911
From Egypt to bail for without exception all the regiments were thrown into the assault on the German machine guns

4725
03:46:16,959 --> 03:46:21,567
He says the German Army's been back on all the point of contact without letting their line be broken

4726
03:46:21,823 --> 03:46:23,615
And their Retreat didn't turn into a route

4727
03:46:24,383 --> 03:46:24,895
And quote

4728
03:46:26,687 --> 03:46:28,735
What you hear there is admiration

4729
03:46:29,503 --> 03:46:31,295
From a soldier to a soldier

4730
03:46:31,807 --> 03:46:34,111
And sort of a shared understanding

4731
03:46:34,623 --> 03:46:36,159
It when it came right down to it

4732
03:46:36,671 --> 03:46:37,183
You know

4733
03:46:37,439 --> 03:46:42,815
Truces could be called and they could go in the middle of no-man's-land and share tobacco and chocolate with each other

4734
03:46:43,327 --> 03:46:44,351
But the people that

4735
03:46:44,607 --> 03:46:46,911
As Bartow said said earlier in the work

4736
03:46:47,423 --> 03:46:48,703
Force them to fight

4737
03:46:48,959 --> 03:46:50,495
Each other against their will

4738
03:46:51,007 --> 03:46:54,335
We continue the conflict until things were just the way they wanted

4739
03:46:54,847 --> 03:46:56,127
And people will die

4740
03:46:56,639 --> 03:46:59,455
Until the absolute last minute

4741
03:47:00,479 --> 03:47:03,039
On this conflict in fact they will die for decades after

4742
03:47:05,087 --> 03:47:06,879
The Germans will finally work out a deal

4743
03:47:07,391 --> 03:47:11,743
Was Woodrow Wilson and the Allies in the aunt aunt they have to get rid of their form of government

4744
03:47:12,255 --> 03:47:13,791
And transition to a republic

4745
03:47:14,303 --> 03:47:15,071
Ludendorff

4746
03:47:15,583 --> 03:47:16,863
Officers resignation

4747
03:47:17,631 --> 03:47:19,679
You know what the last couple of days of October it's

4748
03:47:19,935 --> 03:47:20,447
Accepted

4749
03:47:20,703 --> 03:47:22,751
Dons a disguise and flees the country

4750
03:47:24,031 --> 03:47:25,567
The Kaiser is told

4751
03:47:25,823 --> 03:47:26,847
He has to abdicate

4752
03:47:27,871 --> 03:47:30,687
And save lives in the end the war and he tries not to

4753
03:47:31,199 --> 03:47:34,271
But it's kind of pizza stabbed in the back too and kind of forced to in

4754
03:47:34,527 --> 03:47:39,903
And he flees to the Netherlands and now this new German government which has been sort of Left Behind

4755
03:47:40,159 --> 03:47:46,303
As a landmine by guys like ludendorff ludendorff famously said again blaming the Socialists and the people

4756
03:47:46,559 --> 03:47:52,703
Go back home if you know that they did this stab-in-the-back so let them pick up the pieces and let them get blamed by signing

4757
03:47:52,959 --> 03:47:55,007
Call the surrender an Armistice papers and

4758
03:47:55,519 --> 03:47:59,359
That's kind of the way ludendorff started spinning this whole thing from minute one

4759
03:47:59,615 --> 03:48:00,895
Hitler picked up on that

4760
03:48:01,151 --> 03:48:05,503
An entire German political movement will playoff this idea

4761
03:48:06,015 --> 03:48:09,087
That these people who signed the peace agreement the traitors

4762
03:48:09,343 --> 03:48:10,367
Hours of November

4763
03:48:10,879 --> 03:48:12,927
We're the ones who lost the war

4764
03:48:13,183 --> 03:48:14,463
And it was never lost it

4765
03:48:14,719 --> 03:48:15,487
The front by the soldier

4766
03:48:16,255 --> 03:48:17,535
This will set the stage

4767
03:48:18,047 --> 03:48:18,559
For the next

4768
03:48:18,815 --> 03:48:19,327
Conflict

4769
03:48:19,839 --> 03:48:21,375
And when the actual

4770
03:48:21,887 --> 03:48:23,935
Peace agreement is signed sealed and delivered

4771
03:48:24,447 --> 03:48:26,751
Which won't happen for quite a while to be long negotiate

4772
03:48:27,007 --> 03:48:28,287
Patient into 1919

4773
03:48:29,055 --> 03:48:31,359
The results are so punitive

4774
03:48:32,639 --> 03:48:36,991
The people will realize forward thinkers will realize I must say at the time

4775
03:48:38,271 --> 03:48:40,319
This does nothing but delay

4776
03:48:40,831 --> 03:48:41,343
The decision

4777
03:48:41,599 --> 03:48:47,743
And that they will be so many embittered elements after this treaty assign the one that will actually end the first World War

4778
03:48:47,999 --> 03:48:48,511
Will be a series of

4779
03:48:48,767 --> 03:48:49,535
Trees actually

4780
03:48:50,047 --> 03:48:53,375
But you're guaranteeing another world war in the near future

4781
03:48:54,911 --> 03:48:56,447
Yet one can't help

4782
03:48:56,703 --> 03:48:59,007
But think of all the men in uniform

4783
03:48:59,263 --> 03:49:00,031
Especially those in

4784
03:49:00,287 --> 03:49:00,799
Combat you

4785
03:49:02,591 --> 03:49:03,359
Gorgeous

4786
03:49:03,615 --> 03:49:04,127
Glad

4787
03:49:04,639 --> 03:49:05,919
That they were going to have

4788
03:49:08,223 --> 03:49:09,503
And at the eleventh hour

4789
03:49:10,015 --> 03:49:11,295
The 11th day

4790
03:49:12,319 --> 03:49:12,831
11th month

4791
03:49:14,367 --> 03:49:16,671
11 a.m. November 11th 19

4792
03:49:19,231 --> 03:49:21,023
On many different fronts

4793
03:49:22,303 --> 03:49:22,815
Soldiers

4794
03:49:24,095 --> 03:49:29,727
Greeted this moment this agreed moment it's a little strange When The War would end in advance

4795
03:49:31,519 --> 03:49:32,543
Astorian Soldier

4796
03:49:32,799 --> 03:49:33,567
Politician John buck

4797
03:49:34,591 --> 03:49:35,103
One part of the

4798
03:49:35,871 --> 03:49:36,639
Infinity War end

4799
03:49:37,919 --> 03:49:38,431
Here's what he wrote

4800
03:49:39,711 --> 03:49:40,223
Quote

4801
03:49:41,247 --> 03:49:47,391
Got 2 minutes to 11 opposite the South African Brigade at the easternmost Point reached by the British army

4802
03:49:47,903 --> 03:49:49,439
A German machine gunner

4803
03:49:49,695 --> 03:49:52,255
After firing off a belt without a pause

4804
03:49:52,511 --> 03:49:53,791
What Sheen to stand up

4805
03:49:54,047 --> 03:49:55,327
Take off his helmet

4806
03:49:55,583 --> 03:49:56,095
Bow

4807
03:49:56,351 --> 03:49:58,143
And then walk slowly to the rear

4808
03:49:58,655 --> 03:50:00,703
There came a second of expectant silo

4809
03:50:01,215 --> 03:50:03,263
And then a curious Rippling sound

4810
03:50:03,519 --> 03:50:05,567
Which observers far behind the front

4811
03:50:05,823 --> 03:50:07,871
Lichens to the noise of a light wind

4812
03:50:08,639 --> 03:50:09,663
It was the sound of man

4813
03:50:10,431 --> 03:50:10,943
Cheering

4814
03:50:11,711 --> 03:50:12,991
From the village to the Sea

4815
03:50:14,271 --> 03:50:14,783
And quote

4816
03:50:16,319 --> 03:50:17,087
The future may have been

4817
03:50:17,599 --> 03:50:18,111
Poison

4818
03:50:19,135 --> 03:50:19,647
But at least

4819
03:50:20,159 --> 03:50:20,671
These people would

4820
03:50:21,183 --> 03:50:21,695
Where to see it

4821
03:50:22,975 --> 03:50:23,999
November 11th

4822
03:50:24,511 --> 03:50:25,535
Will be celebrated

4823
03:50:26,815 --> 03:50:27,327
Is Armistice Day

4824
03:50:28,351 --> 03:50:30,143
And will be celebrated with a wide

4825
03:50:31,679 --> 03:50:32,447
Find range of a motor

4826
03:50:35,007 --> 03:50:36,031
The war however

4827
03:50:36,799 --> 03:50:38,335
Had taken the geopolitical

4828
03:50:38,591 --> 03:50:41,407
Colchester map of the world that have been basically in place

4829
03:50:41,919 --> 03:50:42,687
Since Napoleon's

4830
03:50:42,943 --> 03:50:43,711
Defeat a hundred years

4831
03:50:43,967 --> 03:50:44,479
Before

4832
03:50:44,991 --> 03:50:46,015
Throw it up in the air

4833
03:50:48,063 --> 03:50:48,575
Andaz

4834
03:50:48,831 --> 03:50:50,879
The pieces fell back down to earth in

4835
03:50:51,391 --> 03:50:52,927
People try to reconstruct

4836
03:50:53,951 --> 03:50:57,791
A new world religious countries have been totally removed from the map

4837
03:50:58,815 --> 03:50:59,839
A lot of people were going

4838
03:51:00,095 --> 03:51:00,607
Suffer

4839
03:51:01,887 --> 03:51:02,911
Part of the reason that the

4840
03:51:03,167 --> 03:51:04,191
The first World War

4841
03:51:04,703 --> 03:51:06,751
It's so important to our modern time

4842
03:51:07,519 --> 03:51:08,031
Is that

4843
03:51:08,543 --> 03:51:09,823
It's a little like a giant

4844
03:51:10,079 --> 03:51:10,847
Bundle of Fire

4845
03:51:11,615 --> 03:51:12,639
That when you light It Off

4846
03:51:12,895 --> 03:51:16,479
Nice big chunks of firecrackers blow off in the distance and continue to work

4847
03:51:16,735 --> 03:51:19,039
Explode sometimes with more violence than the original

4848
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:20,063
That's what II

4849
03:51:21,087 --> 03:51:21,599
Direct

4850
03:51:22,111 --> 03:51:22,879
Successor

4851
03:51:24,159 --> 03:51:26,207
Bolshevism in Russia tweets to the Cold War

4852
03:51:26,975 --> 03:51:28,767
The situation in the Middle East in the

4853
03:51:29,279 --> 03:51:30,303
Oil and the

4854
03:51:30,815 --> 03:51:31,839
Colonial Empire

4855
03:51:33,631 --> 03:51:35,935
Sing about the first world war is that it wasn't

4856
03:51:36,191 --> 03:51:37,727
Quite Armageddon yet

4857
03:51:38,751 --> 03:51:41,567
The very things that probably were needed to create

4858
03:51:42,079 --> 03:51:42,847
An absolute

4859
03:51:43,359 --> 03:51:44,639
Global Holocaust

4860
03:51:45,151 --> 03:51:45,663
And yet

4861
03:51:45,919 --> 03:51:48,735
Entered into the picture things like nuclear weapons for example

4862
03:51:49,759 --> 03:51:51,551
I think you can safely say looking at it

4863
03:51:52,319 --> 03:51:53,855
What's the first world war was

4864
03:51:54,367 --> 03:51:54,879
What's a blueprint

4865
03:51:55,391 --> 03:51:55,903
Armageddon

4866
03:52:04,607 --> 03:52:05,631
If This Were A book this one

4867
03:52:05,887 --> 03:52:06,655
So to be the post

4868
03:52:06,911 --> 03:52:08,191
Script section I guess

4869
03:52:09,471 --> 03:52:11,007
But one of the most interesting a

4870
03:52:11,263 --> 03:52:12,543
Aspects of the first World War

4871
03:52:13,055 --> 03:52:13,823
Is what

4872
03:52:14,079 --> 03:52:16,639
Right afterwards so divisive results

4873
03:52:16,895 --> 03:52:18,175
Change so much

4874
03:52:18,431 --> 03:52:22,783
So the Catalyst for change itself is interesting but the change in Usher's In this passage

4875
03:52:24,831 --> 03:52:25,599
Start with the fact

4876
03:52:26,111 --> 03:52:27,135
That all of a sudden

4877
03:52:27,391 --> 03:52:33,279
The map of Europe the great geopolitical chessboard that had existed forever was thrown up in the air

4878
03:52:33,535 --> 03:52:37,119
Totally scattering all of a sudden pieces fell down that hadn't existed

4879
03:52:37,887 --> 03:52:39,935
In a long time all of a sudden Poland

4880
03:52:40,447 --> 03:52:41,215
Napoleon

4881
03:52:41,471 --> 03:52:42,239
Looking for quite some time

4882
03:52:42,495 --> 03:52:46,335
All the sudden there was going to be in a like a Czechoslovakia I mean these are

4883
03:52:46,847 --> 03:52:51,455
Places that used to be part of larger Empires but those Empires were smashed by this war

4884
03:52:51,967 --> 03:52:55,039
Austria-Hungary alone when you break that if you get a bunch of Nuka

4885
03:52:57,599 --> 03:53:00,927
You break the Ottoman Empire up you get the modern Middle East

4886
03:53:02,975 --> 03:53:04,255
Hebraic Germany up

4887
03:53:04,767 --> 03:53:05,791
And you get them

4888
03:53:06,303 --> 03:53:07,071
Arguments

4889
03:53:07,583 --> 03:53:11,935
For the second world war right to get Danzig and you get the sudetenland

4890
03:53:12,447 --> 03:53:12,959
What's

4891
03:53:13,471 --> 03:53:16,031
Also Apparent at the end of the first World War

4892
03:53:16,543 --> 03:53:17,311
Did you get this

4893
03:53:17,567 --> 03:53:18,079
.

4894
03:53:19,359 --> 03:53:22,687
People who are trying to play the game the way it's always been played and maybe

4895
03:53:22,943 --> 03:53:24,223
You can make an argument always will be

4896
03:53:24,991 --> 03:53:27,039
And people who are trying to

4897
03:53:27,807 --> 03:53:30,879
Utilize the flip side of bitterness I guess you could say to

4898
03:53:31,135 --> 03:53:31,903
Create a better world

4899
03:53:32,671 --> 03:53:34,207
We talked earlier about Woodrow Wilson

4900
03:53:34,975 --> 03:53:35,999
Idealism or

4901
03:53:36,255 --> 03:53:36,767
Fake IDs

4902
03:53:37,023 --> 03:53:37,535
Realism depends on

4903
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:38,559
Woodrow Wilson

4904
03:53:39,839 --> 03:53:40,607
But nonetheless

4905
03:53:40,863 --> 03:53:45,471
When you sell a war on the idea that is a war to end all wars

4906
03:53:45,983 --> 03:53:51,871
Sometimes that becomes powerful hype that you have to at least make a good argument around if you want to play things

4907
03:53:52,127 --> 03:53:53,151
The old-fashioned way

4908
03:53:54,175 --> 03:53:55,711
The British and the french fries and Apple

4909
03:53:56,991 --> 03:53:58,271
Make out like

4910
03:53:59,551 --> 03:54:00,063
Winners

4911
03:54:00,319 --> 03:54:00,831
In the war

4912
03:54:01,343 --> 03:54:01,855
It comes to

4913
03:54:02,111 --> 03:54:05,439
The territory that they acquired when when the Ottoman Empire broke up

4914
03:54:05,695 --> 03:54:10,047
All those new countries didn't really get full Independence most of them

4915
03:54:10,303 --> 03:54:13,119
How to sort of a compromise sovereignty is that a good way to put it

4916
03:54:13,631 --> 03:54:15,167
With the French or the British Empire

4917
03:54:15,423 --> 03:54:15,935
Ensure

4918
03:54:17,727 --> 03:54:19,007
The 20th century version

4919
03:54:19,263 --> 03:54:20,799
Kool thing oil

4920
03:54:21,055 --> 03:54:22,079
The British will

4921
03:54:22,335 --> 03:54:23,615
Miraculously end

4922
03:54:26,431 --> 03:54:27,711
The Americans another's

4923
03:54:27,967 --> 03:54:28,735
Pushed ideas like

4924
03:54:28,991 --> 03:54:34,879
Self-determination in the British and soda mouth at 2 and they kind of believed it to a minute it's one of those things where is the

4925
03:54:35,647 --> 03:54:37,439
Prime minister had said he kind of would have been

4926
03:54:37,695 --> 03:54:42,559
Remiss if you didn't grab some of that area just like the French have it none the less they all kind of realized

4927
03:54:42,815 --> 03:54:43,583
It didn't look that great

4928
03:54:43,839 --> 03:54:44,607
With the new set of values

4929
03:54:44,863 --> 03:54:48,191
Play what's self-determination became this weird thing to

4930
03:54:49,215 --> 03:54:51,007
You know who deserve their own place and

4931
03:54:51,263 --> 03:54:57,407
And how can you use self determination as a weapon Hitler would use it against one of those territories that was created out of hole

4932
03:54:57,663 --> 03:54:58,175
Old cloth

4933
03:54:58,687 --> 03:54:59,967
Buy the World War 1 peace of green

4934
03:55:00,223 --> 03:55:00,991
A place called check

4935
03:55:01,247 --> 03:55:01,759
Slovakia

4936
03:55:02,271 --> 03:55:05,599
We didn't that place was a territory that had a majority of German

4937
03:55:06,623 --> 03:55:07,391
Havasu dating

4938
03:55:08,415 --> 03:55:10,463
And Hitler would turn the arguments of

4939
03:55:10,975 --> 03:55:16,095
Idealism and self-determination on their head when you said hey of self-determination what you really believe in

4940
03:55:16,351 --> 03:55:18,143
Those Germans in the sudetenland

4941
03:55:18,399 --> 03:55:18,911
Be allowed

4942
03:55:19,167 --> 03:55:21,471
To come back to Germany and bring their land with them

4943
03:55:23,007 --> 03:55:25,055
This would turn out to be a big problem in what are called

4944
03:55:25,311 --> 03:55:26,335
The interwar years

4945
03:55:26,591 --> 03:55:28,127
It would hamstring

4946
03:55:28,639 --> 03:55:32,735
An entity that was truly idealistic like the League of Nations

4947
03:55:32,991 --> 03:55:34,783
Set up after the first World War

4948
03:55:35,039 --> 03:55:41,183
By the people who were as I said on the flipside sort of the global bipolar mood instead of being bitter

4949
03:55:41,439 --> 03:55:44,511
Their attitude about the first world war was a sort of a never again

4950
03:55:45,023 --> 03:55:45,535
Attitude

4951
03:55:46,815 --> 03:55:49,631
Things like the League of Nations and collective security

4952
03:55:49,887 --> 03:55:53,727
We're going to ensure that the world never had a tragedy like that happen again

4953
03:55:55,007 --> 03:55:56,287
We emphasize the bittern

4954
03:55:56,799 --> 03:56:00,127
At the end of the lot program because the bitterness helps play into the next War

4955
03:56:00,383 --> 03:56:02,175
But there were a lot of people that weren't bitter

4956
03:56:02,687 --> 03:56:05,247
And it's only fair to point that out first of all you had people

4957
03:56:05,503 --> 03:56:07,807
A lot of times these were officers to its

4958
03:56:08,063 --> 03:56:08,831
Interesting to note

4959
03:56:09,087 --> 03:56:11,391
Who are so proud of their War service and what happened

4960
03:56:11,647 --> 03:56:14,207
And justifiably so look what these people endure

4961
03:56:15,231 --> 03:56:16,767
Wouldn't take anything away from any

4962
03:56:17,535 --> 03:56:18,559
Some people straight up

4963
03:56:18,815 --> 03:56:19,839
Enjoy the expiry

4964
03:56:20,607 --> 03:56:22,399
Ernst Junger has a piece in his book

4965
03:56:22,655 --> 03:56:23,679
Read us something

4966
03:56:24,191 --> 03:56:30,335
That I think many people throughout history of dumb when they're at Giant historical event when you're the great battle and you know

4967
03:56:30,847 --> 03:56:33,151
You're watching history unfold

4968
03:56:33,407 --> 03:56:35,199
Sometimes there's a powerful feeling

4969
03:56:35,967 --> 03:56:38,527
In that and especially when you think you're playing a part in it

4970
03:56:39,551 --> 03:56:40,319
On the

4971
03:56:40,575 --> 03:56:42,111
50th anniversary of the Normandy Landing

4972
03:56:42,367 --> 03:56:43,391
I remember there was a

4973
03:56:43,903 --> 03:56:46,207
Newspaper article published by an army

4974
03:56:46,719 --> 03:56:47,487
Psychiatrist

4975
03:56:47,999 --> 03:56:49,535
Who was talking about

4976
03:56:49,791 --> 03:56:52,607
These kinds of moments in soldiers lives and said

4977
03:56:53,119 --> 03:56:54,143
For many of the men

4978
03:56:54,399 --> 03:56:55,423
You know who were at

4979
03:56:56,191 --> 03:56:57,983
D-Day in the Second World War

4980
03:56:58,239 --> 03:57:01,567
The greatest experience of their lives the greatest event they would take

4981
03:57:01,823 --> 03:57:02,335
Harden

4982
03:57:04,127 --> 03:57:05,919
History Niall Ferguson in his book

4983
03:57:06,431 --> 03:57:07,199
Pity of War

4984
03:57:07,711 --> 03:57:08,479
Describes

4985
03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:11,039
The remembrances of a couple of soldiers

4986
03:57:11,295 --> 03:57:14,367
For probably representative of a whole lot of these Souls

4987
03:57:15,135 --> 03:57:17,183
Windsor Canadian private talking about

4988
03:57:17,695 --> 03:57:18,975
And what the first World War

4989
03:57:19,231 --> 03:57:22,559
Stanley said it was quote The Greatest Adventure of my life

4990
03:57:23,071 --> 03:57:28,447
The memories of which will remain with me for the remainder of my days and I would not have missed it for anything

4991
03:57:28,959 --> 03:57:29,471
And quote

4992
03:57:30,751 --> 03:57:31,519
It also had

4993
03:57:32,031 --> 03:57:36,383
This sort of momentous feeling it was sometimes tough to

4994
03:57:36,895 --> 03:57:37,663
Andre captured

4995
03:57:37,919 --> 03:57:38,431
Private life

4996
03:57:38,943 --> 03:57:39,967
Ferguson also quoted

4997
03:57:40,479 --> 03:57:41,759
Another soldier that said

4998
03:57:42,015 --> 03:57:42,527
Quote

4999
03:57:43,039 --> 03:57:45,599
Everything that happened after the war was an anti-climax

5000
03:57:47,135 --> 03:57:47,647
And quote

5001
03:57:48,927 --> 03:57:50,463
In some ways the war was in

5002
03:57:53,279 --> 03:57:54,303
So many people went

5003
03:57:54,559 --> 03:57:55,071
To fight

5004
03:57:55,327 --> 03:57:56,607
Based on ideas like

5005
03:57:56,863 --> 03:57:58,143
The war to end all wars

5006
03:57:59,167 --> 03:58:02,751
And yet people who were rather farsighted but there were plenty

5007
03:58:04,287 --> 03:58:05,823
Before the Smoke Head even

5008
03:58:06,079 --> 03:58:06,591
Cleared

5009
03:58:06,847 --> 03:58:09,663
We're predicting the Second World War I mean the generalissimo

5010
03:58:09,919 --> 03:58:12,479
Of the Allied Anton forces Ferdinand Foster

5011
03:58:12,735 --> 03:58:14,271
And said when he saw

5012
03:58:14,527 --> 03:58:15,807
The Versailles Peace Treaty

5013
03:58:16,063 --> 03:58:17,087
This is not peace

5014
03:58:17,599 --> 03:58:18,879
This is a 20-year armistice

5015
03:58:19,647 --> 03:58:21,695
By the way was almost 20 years exactly

5016
03:58:21,951 --> 03:58:22,463
Play 21

5017
03:58:25,023 --> 03:58:29,887
It look to the British and the French like they made out well with territories that they were able to take over

5018
03:58:30,399 --> 03:58:31,679
But they were both

5019
03:58:32,447 --> 03:58:34,239
In terms of their great

5020
03:58:34,495 --> 03:58:35,519
Power status

5021
03:58:36,031 --> 03:58:37,055
Mortally wounded

5022
03:58:38,079 --> 03:58:44,223
The eventual cost of this war especially falls on Brittain shoulders more than any other they were sort of the banker

5023
03:58:44,479 --> 03:58:45,247
LTI lightside

5024
03:58:45,759 --> 03:58:46,271
And

5025
03:58:46,527 --> 03:58:51,647
They are still are or were recently I don't know if they're still outstanding loans but it was only in the last few months

5026
03:58:52,159 --> 03:58:54,975
That they paid off one of the outstanding first world war deaths

5027
03:58:55,231 --> 03:58:55,999
We're still out there

5028
03:58:57,279 --> 03:58:58,559
We had said in the show the

5029
03:58:59,327 --> 03:59:01,119
Center of World Trade and banking

5030
03:59:01,887 --> 03:59:03,935
Transferred from London to New York

5031
03:59:04,191 --> 03:59:07,519
During this conflict and as a result of the financial

5032
03:59:07,775 --> 03:59:11,615
Transfer of wealth from the old world to the new world that this conflict required

5033
03:59:13,919 --> 03:59:15,711
As we had said about Tolkien this is

5034
03:59:16,223 --> 03:59:17,247
This is the

5035
03:59:17,759 --> 03:59:20,319
You know people's of me the free peoples of Middle-earth

5036
03:59:20,831 --> 03:59:24,671
Destroying themselves to take down the darklord right he's gone

5037
03:59:24,927 --> 03:59:27,743
Imperial German he's no threat to anyone anymore

5038
03:59:28,255 --> 03:59:29,279
But France and Britain

5039
03:59:29,535 --> 03:59:35,679
To name just two countries I mean not even to go into Russia's backyard and mentioned them France and Britain will never

5040
03:59:36,191 --> 03:59:36,703
Be what they

5041
03:59:39,007 --> 03:59:40,543
The Russians needless to say

5042
03:59:41,311 --> 03:59:44,127
Aren't going to be what they are they're going to be living under

5043
03:59:44,639 --> 03:59:45,151
Communist

5044
03:59:45,407 --> 03:59:46,175
Regime

5045
03:59:46,431 --> 03:59:47,455
For decades

5046
03:59:47,967 --> 03:59:52,063
The Czar and his family in the middle of 1918

5047
03:59:52,575 --> 03:59:56,927
Will be executed by the Bolsheviks every last one of them and the cook

5048
03:59:58,207 --> 03:59:58,719
United

5049
03:59:58,975 --> 03:59:59,487
States

5050
03:59:59,743 --> 04:00:01,535
Comes out of the war well

5051
04:00:02,047 --> 04:00:02,815
Actually they're there

5052
04:00:03,583 --> 04:00:05,887
On the receiving end of all that old world wealth

5053
04:00:06,399 --> 04:00:06,911
Sample

5054
04:00:07,679 --> 04:00:09,727
But for Americans it was quite a change

5055
04:00:09,983 --> 04:00:11,519
How to change the head really started

5056
04:00:11,775 --> 04:00:13,567
With the Spanish-American War

5057
04:00:13,823 --> 04:00:18,431
In 20 or so years before the first world war when the United States started going abroad

5058
04:00:18,687 --> 04:00:24,831
And involving themselves more overseas the first world war solidified that Trend and even though after the war

5059
04:00:25,087 --> 04:00:26,111
Or they would be the smooth

5060
04:00:26,367 --> 04:00:29,439
We're not doing that again you could tell that it's

5061
04:00:29,951 --> 04:00:31,487
It was sort of like virginity

5062
04:00:31,743 --> 04:00:33,535
AAA barrier have been Frost

5063
04:00:33,791 --> 04:00:34,815
And you really just

5064
04:00:35,071 --> 04:00:36,863
Couldn't go back to the way things were weave

5065
04:00:37,119 --> 04:00:37,887
Find that out as a mirror

5066
04:00:38,143 --> 04:00:38,911
Africans in the Second World War

5067
04:00:41,727 --> 04:00:43,775
Americans also got to experience other

5068
04:00:44,031 --> 04:00:46,335
Things that would not be uncommon in Europe things like

5069
04:00:47,103 --> 04:00:49,151
Sedition and Espionage Act

5070
04:00:49,663 --> 04:00:53,503
Imposed by the Wilson Administration things to prevent criticism of the war

5071
04:00:53,759 --> 04:00:55,807
Anti-war activities criminalized

5072
04:00:56,063 --> 04:00:59,135
Laws that are still on the books and still used

5073
04:00:59,391 --> 04:01:00,159
Today

5074
04:01:00,415 --> 04:01:02,463
That most people look back on and still think

5075
04:01:02,719 --> 04:01:03,231
But those words

5076
04:01:03,487 --> 04:01:05,023
Extreme overreaches a presidential

5077
04:01:05,279 --> 04:01:05,791
Authority

5078
04:01:06,559 --> 04:01:07,071
Nonetheless

5079
04:01:07,839 --> 04:01:08,351
You know it was

5080
04:01:08,607 --> 04:01:09,375
The first World War

5081
04:01:09,631 --> 04:01:10,143
The threat was there

5082
04:01:12,703 --> 04:01:13,727
Japan

5083
04:01:13,983 --> 04:01:18,079
As I said it would be the United States or Japan that I would nominate for the big pictures in these wars

5084
04:01:18,335 --> 04:01:22,943
Japan had a relatively easy run if it took over anything that was over in their territory that was German

5085
04:01:23,199 --> 04:01:25,759
And then started moving in more to the Asian mainland

5086
04:01:26,527 --> 04:01:27,295
Already in charge

5087
04:01:27,807 --> 04:01:29,343
Have a lot of Korean folk they started

5088
04:01:29,599 --> 04:01:35,743
Taking over territory that would eventually morph into what some historians now considered to be the really early

5089
04:01:35,999 --> 04:01:37,791
Early stages of the second World War

5090
04:01:38,303 --> 04:01:39,583
Because by the time

5091
04:01:39,839 --> 04:01:45,471
The second world war breaks out the Japanese have been involved in fighting with the Chinese for years and

5092
04:01:45,727 --> 04:01:46,751
Some fighting with the Russians to

5093
04:01:48,031 --> 04:01:50,591
Turkey will continue to have problems with violence

5094
04:01:50,847 --> 04:01:52,383
And ethnic conflict and

5095
04:01:52,639 --> 04:01:53,663
Modernism

5096
04:01:54,687 --> 04:01:55,711
The fighting will never release

5097
04:01:55,967 --> 04:01:57,759
Stop overing in Anatolia

5098
04:01:59,551 --> 04:02:02,367
And that country will continue to strive towards a more

5099
04:02:03,135 --> 04:02:05,439
National statehood they'll go through.

5100
04:02:06,207 --> 04:02:08,767
Under Kemal Ataturk Mustafa Kemal

5101
04:02:09,023 --> 04:02:10,559
But that's important in their history

5102
04:02:11,071 --> 04:02:13,119
They'll also have to begin to

5103
04:02:13,887 --> 04:02:20,031
Live down some of the things that were done during the first world war and famously to Armenia

5104
04:02:20,287 --> 04:02:21,311
But also to people

5105
04:02:21,823 --> 04:02:23,359
Assyrian Christians

5106
04:02:23,615 --> 04:02:24,127
Greeks

5107
04:02:24,639 --> 04:02:26,687
The Turks had an ethnic problem

5108
04:02:27,199 --> 04:02:30,783
That they dealt with sometimes in a very heavy-handed manner

5109
04:02:31,807 --> 04:02:33,855
The austro-hungarians also had

5110
04:02:34,111 --> 04:02:35,391
An ethnic problem

5111
04:02:35,903 --> 04:02:41,791
They along with the Habsburg rulers that have been in power for centuries were wiped away as a result of the

5112
04:02:42,047 --> 04:02:42,559
This war

5113
04:02:44,095 --> 04:02:45,119
And the idea

5114
04:02:45,375 --> 04:02:48,191
Of self-determination that Hitler would be able to use

5115
04:02:48,447 --> 04:02:51,519
About the sudetenland and whatnot would begin to raise

5116
04:02:51,775 --> 04:02:53,823
Ugly sort of questions

5117
04:02:54,079 --> 04:02:55,615
In places like India

5118
04:02:55,871 --> 04:02:57,151
Controlled by the British

5119
04:02:57,407 --> 04:02:59,711
But not necessarily because the Indian

5120
04:03:04,831 --> 04:03:05,343
Trying to

5121
04:03:05,599 --> 04:03:06,879
To clean up after the war

5122
04:03:07,647 --> 04:03:08,415
Is one of the Great

5123
04:03:09,183 --> 04:03:10,719
Efforts of modern times

5124
04:03:11,999 --> 04:03:12,767
First you have

5125
04:03:13,279 --> 04:03:14,559
The bodies to deal with

5126
04:03:14,815 --> 04:03:15,583
Then you have

5127
04:03:15,839 --> 04:03:19,167
The damage to the battlefield and then you have the cleanup

5128
04:03:19,423 --> 04:03:20,447
It happens

5129
04:03:20,959 --> 04:03:22,751
You know in in the collective

5130
04:03:23,519 --> 04:03:24,799
Populations of all the

5131
04:03:25,055 --> 04:03:26,591
These countries the emotional clean up

5132
04:03:27,103 --> 04:03:28,127
Bewilder getting past

5133
04:03:29,919 --> 04:03:30,943
All of these societies

5134
04:03:31,455 --> 04:03:35,551
That were heavily involved in the first world war will have a lot of disabled veterans around

5135
04:03:36,063 --> 04:03:38,367
It will be a very visible reminder

5136
04:03:38,623 --> 04:03:39,391
Nobody gets

5137
04:03:39,903 --> 04:03:40,415
Put this

5138
04:03:40,671 --> 04:03:41,951
Behind them

5139
04:03:42,207 --> 04:03:43,487
And walk away unscathed

5140
04:03:45,535 --> 04:03:46,303
There's a story

5141
04:03:46,815 --> 04:03:47,327
Adam Hawk

5142
04:03:47,583 --> 04:03:48,863
Child in his book relates

5143
04:03:49,887 --> 04:03:52,703
The dates from the time of these last German offensive

5144
04:03:52,959 --> 04:03:53,727
Big Lots

5145
04:03:53,983 --> 04:03:55,007
Card being played

5146
04:03:55,519 --> 04:03:59,103
That is a perfect example of what was going on

5147
04:04:00,383 --> 04:04:04,991
Hundreds of thousands of homes when there's no question it was that many I'm just playing that number safe

5148
04:04:06,527 --> 04:04:08,063
Hauschild talks about these

5149
04:04:08,319 --> 04:04:09,343
Cards that the

5150
04:04:09,599 --> 04:04:12,159
Officers would send to family members

5151
04:04:12,671 --> 04:04:13,695
Informing them

5152
04:04:13,951 --> 04:04:14,463
That they are

5153
04:04:14,719 --> 04:04:15,231
Child

5154
04:04:15,487 --> 04:04:17,279
Orlov one was dead or missing

5155
04:04:18,047 --> 04:04:18,815
And he says quote

5156
04:04:19,583 --> 04:04:22,143
The cards float out in the ceaseless stream

5157
04:04:22,911 --> 04:04:26,751
But when it came to Stephen hubhaus his younger brother his parents

5158
04:04:27,007 --> 04:04:28,031
Like so many others

5159
04:04:28,287 --> 04:04:31,103
Simply received word that in the new German offensive

5160
04:04:31,359 --> 04:04:33,663
The 23-year old Paul was quote

5161
04:04:33,919 --> 04:04:35,455
Missing presumed killed

5162
04:04:35,711 --> 04:04:36,479
And quote

5163
04:04:37,247 --> 04:04:38,271
You've been seen fighting

5164
04:04:38,527 --> 04:04:39,295
Then falling

5165
04:04:39,551 --> 04:04:41,343
When is units position was overrun

5166
04:04:41,855 --> 04:04:47,487
Several months later the family's hopes were raised when a fellow officer passed on a rumor that Paul was wounded

5167
04:04:47,743 --> 04:04:49,023
And a prisoner in Germany

5168
04:04:49,279 --> 04:04:52,095
With male going through contacts in neutral countries

5169
04:04:52,351 --> 04:04:54,911
Steven got in touch with a pacifist Committee in Berlin

5170
04:04:55,167 --> 04:04:55,679
Quote

5171
04:04:55,935 --> 04:04:59,007
I was very glad to be able to set on foot by this means

5172
04:04:59,263 --> 04:05:00,799
Inserts for my brother Paul

5173
04:05:01,055 --> 04:05:01,567
Alas

5174
04:05:01,823 --> 04:05:03,103
No trace of him could be found

5175
04:05:03,615 --> 04:05:05,663
My poor mother for over 6 months

5176
04:05:05,919 --> 04:05:08,991
Persisted in the van to believe that Paul would return

5177
04:05:09,503 --> 04:05:10,015
And quote

5178
04:05:10,271 --> 04:05:11,551
Hochschild continue

5179
04:05:12,063 --> 04:05:15,903
During that time Margaret hobhouse never cease to write letters to her son

5180
04:05:16,415 --> 04:05:18,207
Although they eventually came back Mark

5181
04:05:18,719 --> 04:05:19,487
Undeliverable

5182
04:05:19,999 --> 04:05:21,023
Return to Sender

5183
04:05:21,791 --> 04:05:23,071
Paul's body was never found

5184
04:05:24,863 --> 04:05:25,375
And quote

5185
04:05:27,679 --> 04:05:28,703
Lots and lots of other

5186
04:05:30,495 --> 04:05:31,263
I'm still being

5187
04:05:33,311 --> 04:05:34,591
You know you don't know

5188
04:05:34,847 --> 04:05:35,615
How much

5189
04:05:36,895 --> 04:05:38,175
Are the really nasty stuff

5190
04:05:38,431 --> 04:05:39,967
How to get into on a program like this

5191
04:05:40,479 --> 04:05:42,271
Because you don't want to be gratuitous

5192
04:05:42,527 --> 04:05:44,319
What you do want to be able to do

5193
04:05:44,831 --> 04:05:46,367
Is in your mind's eye

5194
04:05:46,879 --> 04:05:48,415
See what these people are seeing

5195
04:05:48,671 --> 04:05:51,231
Right as we always so you can experience or understand what

5196
04:05:51,487 --> 04:05:52,767
They're going through but you can try

5197
04:05:53,279 --> 04:05:54,815
To have the tiniest little bit of

5198
04:05:55,071 --> 04:05:56,351
Emotional sympathy

5199
04:05:56,607 --> 04:06:00,447
But you kind of have to see things through their eyes and what they're seeing is

5200
04:06:00,959 --> 04:06:02,239
Permanently scarring

5201
04:06:02,495 --> 04:06:05,311
The people who have to clean up after this war

5202
04:06:06,079 --> 04:06:08,639
Or sometimes is traumatized the people that have to fight it

5203
04:06:09,663 --> 04:06:11,711
After these last big German offensive

5204
04:06:12,479 --> 04:06:12,991
That that

5205
04:06:13,247 --> 04:06:14,527
Last Story dealt with

5206
04:06:15,295 --> 04:06:17,087
The boy missing and presumed killed

5207
04:06:17,599 --> 04:06:20,927
The people who were killed had to be picked up by somebody

5208
04:06:21,951 --> 04:06:23,743
An American soldier named Robert Hoffman

5209
04:06:24,511 --> 04:06:27,839
In August 1918 was one of those somebody is one day

5210
04:06:29,119 --> 04:06:29,887
He writes quote

5211
04:06:30,655 --> 04:06:32,447
Did you ever smell a dead mouse

5212
04:06:32,959 --> 04:06:37,567
That will give you about as much idea of what a group of long-dead soldiers smells like

5213
04:06:37,823 --> 04:06:42,175
As will one grain of sand give you an idea of Atlantic City's beaches

5214
04:06:42,687 --> 04:06:46,271
A group of men were sent to Hill 204 to make a reconnaissance

5215
04:06:46,527 --> 04:06:48,063
To report on conditions there

5216
04:06:48,319 --> 04:06:49,855
As well as to bury the dead

5217
04:06:50,111 --> 04:06:51,647
The story was a very pathetic

5218
04:06:51,903 --> 04:06:52,415
He says

5219
04:06:52,671 --> 04:06:56,511
The men were still lying there nearly two weeks later just as they'd Fallen

5220
04:06:56,767 --> 04:06:58,559
I knew all of these man intimately

5221
04:06:58,815 --> 04:07:01,375
And it was indeed painful to learn of their condition

5222
04:07:01,887 --> 04:07:03,935
Some had apparently lived for some time

5223
04:07:04,191 --> 04:07:08,799
I tried to dress their own wounds or their comrade to dress them but later they died there

5224
04:07:09,311 --> 04:07:15,455
I was especially pleased that the capture of the German soldiers that made it possible to bring back all the wounded in our sector

5225
04:07:15,711 --> 04:07:18,271
Many of the men have been pumped full of machine gun bullets

5226
04:07:18,527 --> 04:07:20,319
Shot almost beyond recognition

5227
04:07:20,575 --> 04:07:21,855
A hundred or so bullets

5228
04:07:22,111 --> 04:07:24,671
Even in a dead man's body is not a pretty sight

5229
04:07:24,927 --> 04:07:27,487
One of our men was lying with a German bayonet through it

5230
04:07:27,999 --> 04:07:30,047
Not unlike a pin through a large beetle

5231
04:07:30,559 --> 04:07:33,887
Bayonets are hard to remove when once they've been caught between the ribs

5232
04:07:34,143 --> 04:07:37,215
Especially the Sawtooth bayonets many of the Germans carried

5233
04:07:37,471 --> 04:07:41,567
To dislodge them it's usually necessary to shoot once or more to loosen the bayonet

5234
04:07:41,823 --> 04:07:44,895
This German had not waited but left his gun and passed on

5235
04:07:45,407 --> 04:07:51,039
The little Italian boy was lying on the barbed wire his eyes open and his helmet hanging back on his head

5236
04:07:51,551 --> 04:07:54,879
There been so much shrapnel in some of the bodies were torn beyond recognition

5237
04:07:55,903 --> 04:07:59,743
This was the first experience of handling in burying the dead for many of our men

5238
04:08:00,255 --> 04:08:03,839
It was a trying experience as I was to personally find somewhere later

5239
04:08:05,375 --> 04:08:06,399
He then goes on to say

5240
04:08:07,167 --> 04:08:09,727
There's nothing more pitiful than a battlefield after a bat

5241
04:08:12,031 --> 04:08:13,055
My pitiful yes

5242
04:08:14,847 --> 04:08:15,615
Dangerous

5243
04:08:15,871 --> 04:08:17,919
Is another term we might use because

5244
04:08:18,175 --> 04:08:20,223
This cleanup is ongoing even now

5245
04:08:21,247 --> 04:08:23,551
There's a good side in the downside

5246
04:08:23,807 --> 04:08:26,879
For the cleanup process with having a war that doesn't move

5247
04:08:27,391 --> 04:08:31,231
The great mass of Europe and places elsewhere were spared

5248
04:08:31,743 --> 04:08:36,095
The total sort of ruin this war that the second world war brought to so many areas

5249
04:08:36,351 --> 04:08:42,495
But the place is where the war was actually fought we're devastated and not just devastated permanently scarred maybe Park

5250
04:08:42,751 --> 04:08:43,263
Permanently ruin

5251
04:08:44,031 --> 04:08:44,799
Certainly for

5252
04:08:45,311 --> 04:08:46,591
Several foreseeable life

5253
04:08:47,359 --> 04:08:49,151
Author Donovan Webster wrote a whole book

5254
04:08:49,407 --> 04:08:54,783
On the state of those battlefields in earlier Wars today and the most

5255
04:08:55,039 --> 04:08:55,551
Polluted

5256
04:08:56,063 --> 04:08:56,575
Most

5257
04:08:56,831 --> 04:09:02,975
Dangerous most impossible to imagine them ever cleaning up her all these ones that the first world war fought on the western

5258
04:09:03,231 --> 04:09:03,743
Turn front

5259
04:09:04,255 --> 04:09:06,303
In these places where things didn't move for years

5260
04:09:06,815 --> 04:09:07,839
Because the shells

5261
04:09:08,095 --> 04:09:09,631
Bury themselves in the ground

5262
04:09:10,399 --> 04:09:13,983
I don't remember what the exact percentage that they that they estimated

5263
04:09:14,239 --> 04:09:17,311
The number of Duds British versus the number of good shells were

5264
04:09:17,823 --> 04:09:19,871
But since 1946

5265
04:09:20,639 --> 04:09:21,151
French

5266
04:09:21,663 --> 04:09:22,175
Specialist

5267
04:09:22,431 --> 04:09:23,455
Remove

5268
04:09:23,967 --> 04:09:25,503
18 million

5269
04:09:26,015 --> 04:09:26,527
Shells

5270
04:09:27,295 --> 04:09:30,111
And they estimate that there's another 12 million

5271
04:09:30,367 --> 04:09:32,159
Just around Verdun

5272
04:09:33,695 --> 04:09:38,047
The biggest shells like those Paris gun shells the Duds from those

5273
04:09:38,303 --> 04:09:42,655
Are so deep in the earth they won't even make their way to the surface for 60 year

5274
04:09:45,471 --> 04:09:50,335
Hundreds and hundreds of these people who go and try to clean up these areas die

5275
04:09:50,591 --> 04:09:56,735
They're been Farmers killed her like 35 killed in one year when their tractors were hitting shells and some of these shells as you

5276
04:09:56,991 --> 04:09:57,759
You might imagine

5277
04:09:58,271 --> 04:09:59,295
Are chemical weapons

5278
04:10:00,319 --> 04:10:06,463
The problems that these people have trying to reclaim the areas are so bad that they just have cordoned off the area since the war

5279
04:10:06,975 --> 04:10:11,839
And millions upon millions of Acres of France and part of Belgium are just shut down

5280
04:10:12,095 --> 04:10:12,863
Too dangerous

5281
04:10:13,375 --> 04:10:15,679
Don't like the world's biggest garbage dump

5282
04:10:16,191 --> 04:10:18,495
Which human beings all ground up through it

5283
04:10:18,751 --> 04:10:21,823
And then it's littered with booby-trapped explosives and chemical weapons

5284
04:10:22,335 --> 04:10:24,383
Good luck cleaning that moonscapes

5285
04:10:26,431 --> 04:10:27,711
The Germans have thought

5286
04:10:27,967 --> 04:10:29,247
That they were signing

5287
04:10:29,759 --> 04:10:33,087
Something more like an Armistice more like a secession of hostilities

5288
04:10:33,343 --> 04:10:38,719
More like somebody along the lines of what they thought Woodrow Wilson was talking about in the 14 points

5289
04:10:39,487 --> 04:10:41,535
What they ended up with was more like a Saran

5290
04:10:43,071 --> 04:10:48,191
And truly given their military condition that's probably what they should have been doing

5291
04:10:48,703 --> 04:10:49,983
But even

5292
04:10:50,239 --> 04:10:55,103
As the war was winding down ludendorff changed his mind at the last minute

5293
04:10:55,359 --> 04:10:59,455
I wanted to restart the conflict right before the Armistice actually took effect

5294
04:10:59,967 --> 04:11:02,015
Would not have been a interesting what if scenario

5295
04:11:02,783 --> 04:11:05,599
Nonetheless his army was ready to go home and in a lot of cases

5296
04:11:06,111 --> 04:11:10,719
Was going home by the end of the gym at least a million people that they stopped thought were shirking

5297
04:11:10,975 --> 04:11:14,047
Or not listening to orders or simply refusing to fight anymore

5298
04:11:15,583 --> 04:11:17,119
The deal at the end of the war

5299
04:11:17,375 --> 04:11:21,727
And the difference that the Germans thought they were getting versus what they actually got was one of the seeds

5300
04:11:21,983 --> 04:11:23,519
Fatso's the future bitterness

5301
04:11:24,287 --> 04:11:28,383
The German Navy manages to sort of give the middle finger

5302
04:11:28,895 --> 04:11:29,407
2

5303
04:11:29,663 --> 04:11:33,759
The Allies you know the year after the war's over when they're transferring their Fleet

5304
04:11:34,015 --> 04:11:34,783
To Britain as

5305
04:11:35,039 --> 04:11:37,855
Part of the mandated things that they had to do

5306
04:11:38,111 --> 04:11:39,647
You know with the peace treaty

5307
04:11:39,903 --> 04:11:42,207
And they intentionally sink a bunch of the ship

5308
04:11:44,255 --> 04:11:47,839
So they may have rioted against their own officers at the end of the war

5309
04:11:48,095 --> 04:11:50,399
But that didn't mean they wanted the former enemy

5310
04:11:50,655 --> 04:11:52,447
To end up in possession of their

5311
04:11:53,215 --> 04:11:53,727
Vessels

5312
04:11:55,775 --> 04:11:57,311
I also like to quickly mention

5313
04:11:58,079 --> 04:12:01,151
Something that I think you're aware of this been throughout this whole program.

5314
04:12:01,407 --> 04:12:02,175
The ripples

5315
04:12:03,967 --> 04:12:07,807
The these wars and all these debts and meanings and sufferings caused

5316
04:12:08,319 --> 04:12:09,599
The number of people

5317
04:12:09,855 --> 04:12:13,695
In a relating to the soldier or civilian who experienced the horribleness

5318
04:12:13,951 --> 04:12:15,999
And how that just radiates across Society

5319
04:12:17,791 --> 04:12:19,071
You can go read the

5320
04:12:19,327 --> 04:12:19,839
The artist

5321
04:12:20,095 --> 04:12:21,887
So this post-war generation

5322
04:12:22,399 --> 04:12:26,751
And and sometimes it's just so incredibly haunting I mean you'll still talk about for example.

5323
04:12:27,007 --> 04:12:29,055
Are all these women who sweethearts

5324
04:12:29,311 --> 04:12:30,847
Or betrothal people that

5325
04:12:31,103 --> 04:12:36,223
You know they maybe would have married somewhere down the road didn't exist cuz they died in the war so they ended up spinsters

5326
04:12:36,479 --> 04:12:38,015
Me just decades

5327
04:12:38,271 --> 04:12:39,295
Of pain

5328
04:12:40,063 --> 04:12:41,343
In a Rippling through

5329
04:12:41,599 --> 04:12:42,367
The society

5330
04:12:43,391 --> 04:12:44,159
A sense of loss

5331
04:12:45,951 --> 04:12:47,487
And often times in some of these

5332
04:12:47,999 --> 04:12:50,303
Nationstates plagued by chaos

5333
04:12:50,815 --> 04:12:54,399
You know what they tried to find there and their New Path I mean Germany's are perfect

5334
04:12:54,655 --> 04:12:56,447
Example Rush has an even better one

5335
04:12:56,959 --> 04:12:58,239
People were often confused

5336
04:12:58,495 --> 04:12:59,007
And

5337
04:12:59,519 --> 04:13:00,031
Sometimes

5338
04:13:00,287 --> 04:13:01,567
Caught up in the wheels

5339
04:13:01,823 --> 04:13:02,591
Of things

5340
04:13:03,103 --> 04:13:04,383
That they had no control

5341
04:13:05,151 --> 04:13:08,991
How'd you like to be some civilian living in a country that went fascist

5342
04:13:10,015 --> 04:13:10,783
Or Bolshevik

5343
04:13:12,575 --> 04:13:13,087
Fell apart

5344
04:13:15,135 --> 04:13:15,903
I'd like to point out

5345
04:13:16,927 --> 04:13:17,439
That

5346
04:13:17,951 --> 04:13:19,487
The problem with the story

5347
04:13:20,255 --> 04:13:23,839
That we did here is the same problem you often run into it

5348
04:13:24,095 --> 04:13:26,911
If you read or speak in the English language

5349
04:13:27,167 --> 04:13:27,679
Which one you want to

5350
04:13:28,191 --> 04:13:30,751
Get a hold of something about the first World War

5351
04:13:31,007 --> 04:13:33,311
I've often said that doing these programs

5352
04:13:33,567 --> 04:13:34,335
Has given me

5353
04:13:34,847 --> 04:13:35,615
The most

5354
04:13:36,127 --> 04:13:39,455
Sympathy for the people who actually write these books

5355
04:13:39,711 --> 04:13:44,063
And create the materials that we use this as sources for this program for example

5356
04:13:44,575 --> 04:13:50,719
Because once you try to do even a pale imitation of what they're trying to do you instantly

5357
04:13:50,975 --> 04:13:55,071
All your questions answered right away why didn't they do this and then you start to

5358
04:13:55,327 --> 04:13:59,679
Do this, show yourself and you go oh my God how am I ever going to include this without

5359
04:13:59,935 --> 04:14:00,703
Screwing something up

5360
04:14:00,959 --> 04:14:01,471
I mean

5361
04:14:02,239 --> 04:14:06,335
If there's anybody who got really shafted in this story I mean I can think of numerous

5362
04:14:07,103 --> 04:14:08,639
Who deserve to ton more time

5363
04:14:08,895 --> 04:14:15,039
But I think we alluded to it earlier the french-owned enormous part of the story I didn't even get to clemenceau that's inexcusable right

5364
04:14:15,551 --> 04:14:17,343
How do you even get away with that Carlin

5365
04:14:18,111 --> 04:14:19,135
All I can say is

5366
04:14:19,391 --> 04:14:21,439
Look how long this series is now

5367
04:14:22,207 --> 04:14:22,975
I mean

5368
04:14:23,231 --> 04:14:29,375
I left out tons of stuff to get it down to this enormous like this isn't that terrible what about the people in the Balkan

5369
04:14:29,631 --> 04:14:31,423
This is where the whole war begins

5370
04:14:31,679 --> 04:14:34,751
Those are the people who had an amazing history right before

5371
04:14:35,007 --> 04:14:41,151
The first world war are finding themselves in their national identity and Consciousness is all coming together and then it's a fantastic

5372
04:14:41,407 --> 04:14:41,919
Caustically

5373
04:14:42,175 --> 04:14:45,503
Both traumatic and dramatic time of change I mean it

5374
04:14:45,759 --> 04:14:47,295
It's colorful it's interesting

5375
04:14:48,575 --> 04:14:50,623
The situation in the Middle East with the Ottomans and

5376
04:14:50,879 --> 04:14:53,439
An end in the modern Middle East beginning to form

5377
04:14:53,951 --> 04:14:56,767
Africa got totally shafted in the story

5378
04:14:57,023 --> 04:15:00,351
Could have been a whole podcast series on the first world war in Africa

5379
04:15:00,863 --> 04:15:05,215
And the Far East is busy setting the stage for the Pacific War in the Second World War

5380
04:15:05,471 --> 04:15:07,007
And we dealt with it minimal

5381
04:15:08,799 --> 04:15:11,871
As a point of explanation though I might point out

5382
04:15:12,127 --> 04:15:12,895
The Lac

5383
04:15:13,151 --> 04:15:13,919
Good

5384
04:15:14,175 --> 04:15:14,943
English

5385
04:15:15,455 --> 04:15:15,967
Work

5386
04:15:16,223 --> 04:15:16,991
On this subject

5387
04:15:18,271 --> 04:15:24,415
We have a lot of quotes from Germans a lot of quotes from British folks and their dominions a lot of cool to the United States

5388
04:15:24,927 --> 04:15:27,231
There are not a ton of good books even on the French

5389
04:15:27,487 --> 04:15:30,303
Will you get a lot of first-hand accounts from soldiers or their experience

5390
04:15:31,071 --> 04:15:35,679
I found one really good one I'm with used in the show but that guy wasn't at the Battle you're talking about

5391
04:15:35,935 --> 04:15:37,727
All of a sudden the sources are hard to come by

5392
04:15:39,007 --> 04:15:40,799
Love to have more from the Russian side

5393
04:15:41,311 --> 04:15:42,847
The Balkans the Ottomans

5394
04:15:44,383 --> 04:15:45,663
Africa would be great to

5395
04:15:46,687 --> 04:15:47,199
Finally

5396
04:15:47,455 --> 04:15:51,295
There were some subjects we could have gone into more deeply that I know a lot of you want

5397
04:15:51,807 --> 04:15:52,831
I mean some of you people

5398
04:15:53,087 --> 04:15:55,647
Geek out about the military side of History's I do

5399
04:15:56,159 --> 04:16:01,279
We did do some discussions on airplanes that didn't make it into the show we did some deeper stuff

5400
04:16:01,791 --> 04:16:02,303
Honda

5401
04:16:02,559 --> 04:16:03,071
Warships

5402
04:16:03,327 --> 04:16:06,655
It didn't make it into another show those are all be rolled together with

5403
04:16:07,167 --> 04:16:08,191
Some other potpourri I put

5404
04:16:08,447 --> 04:16:12,799
Put together any extra show whenever we get that out and I'm not promising when that happens I got another one

5405
04:16:13,311 --> 04:16:13,823
The real

5406
04:16:14,079 --> 04:16:18,175
A regular history shows to start working on right away cuz you folks have been patient with me

5407
04:16:18,431 --> 04:16:21,759
This one took longer than any we've ever had in the past and will I get

5408
04:16:22,783 --> 04:16:23,807
Cy go look at the reading

5409
04:16:24,575 --> 04:16:27,647
Be nice to do a subject that is not as well documented

5410
04:16:27,903 --> 04:16:28,671
Next time

5411
04:16:28,927 --> 04:16:29,951
Thank you for everything

5412
04:16:32,255 --> 04:16:34,303
If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar

5413
04:16:34,559 --> 04:16:36,095
Dan and Ben would love to have it

5414
04:16:36,607 --> 04:16:38,399
Abacus show it's all we ask
