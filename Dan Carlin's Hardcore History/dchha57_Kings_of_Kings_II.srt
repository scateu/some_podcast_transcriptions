1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,072
What you're about to hear is part 2 of a multi-party

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,632
Series on the achaemenid Persian

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,936
Empire and especially its dealings with the

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:15,872
I suggest getting part 1 and listening to that first before you dive into this but listen I'm not here to tell you how to live

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Live your life you do anything

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
I would like to point out that

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,552
This is the Dan Carlin version of this story which is always what you get

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
With me

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
Which may or may not correspond

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
To the traditional way these things are told

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
So please

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
Please listen at your own risk

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
And if it Sparks a an interest in the subject

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
I'll be very happy

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,728
Nonetheless without further Ado and with proper warnings in play

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
This is

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Kings of Kings

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
Part 2

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
December 7th 1941

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
A date which will live in infamy

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Call Nick time and place I take pride in the words ich bin ein

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Belina

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,104
Weather now

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
Remember that we are not descended from fearful men

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
Hardcore history

26
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
How many people out of 100

27
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,352
That you could name either people that you knew or people that you heard of or read about

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,936
How many people out of a hundred do you think could handle

29
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Absolute power

30
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
Without totally losing their mind

31
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
And

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,224
If you could handle it initially if you could find that well-balanced person to the deal with it initially

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
What about dealing with it for the Long Haul

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Because history shows that there are a lot of people

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
Another Power gets to you over time it eats at you slowly I mean if you could have lots of power and

36
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Initially could you handle it for 10 years

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Or 20 years or 30 years

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Those of us in

39
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,800
Democratic systems tend to assume because it's kind of built into the thinking of our political systems

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
But nobody can handle absolute power

41
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:01,504
Or did it certainly an unbelievably small number right absolute power corrupts absolutely

42
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
How long we all heard that term end

43
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
We assume it's a truism I know I do

44
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
And yet I can prove myself wrong pretty easily

45
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
By looking back at the past and realizing that

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
By that sort of rationale shouldn't every

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,448
Emperor and King throughout history that had either close to or

48
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,312
De facto absolute power should they all be crazy and they all lose their minds

49
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
And while you can certainly say most of them probably lost perspective

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
For example what life was like for normal people

51
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,136
The vast majority of them didn't go crazy which might be more interesting

52
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
And assuming the opposite

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,512
Although we all know of the high-profile examples don't we

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
I mean all use the classic ones when I go right to Godwin Plumbing look at Hitler

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
You could say maybe it was

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
Form of Parkinson's disease or maybe the doctor feel good drugs he was being shot up with

57
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
At the same time by the end of his rule he is exhibiting

58
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
The classic

59
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
Symptoms of megalomania and paranoia

60
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
They come with the absolute power

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Some stereotype

62
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,095
Look at a guy like Alexander the Great, he's almost another kind of Godwin's law in the especially with this program

63
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
By his early thirties he's a paranoid

64
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Andaz megalomaniacal is Hitler

65
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
And again maybe some of that connected to what a lot of historians be called rampant

66
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:35,199
And terminal maybe at the point he was at alcoholism who knows it's difficult to separate

67
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,063
Alexander seem to be able to handle power initially and then somewhere along the line he couldn't

68
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
And the sources at the time by the way right about this growing

69
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Megalomania and paranoia

70
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
Not very fair sources maybe to Let's acknowledge that

71
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Wendy

72
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,703
Near legendary an enormous historical figures Cyrus the Great

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
We talked about in the first part of the story

74
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
When he died

75
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,871
Was killed in 5:30 or 5:29 BCE

76
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
He bequeathed to his son

77
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,015
The most dangerous inheritance I can imagine

78
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
He leaves in the Empire

79
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
But yeah just one

80
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
And by doing so

81
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
He both

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
Create an immense challenge for his son to overcome

83
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,911
Absolute power or something very close to it and what that can do to him

84
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
But also we hands his son something that is

85
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
So valuable

86
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Immediately

87
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,359
Other entities are going to be tempted by it

88
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
It's like leaving him

89
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
You know

90
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
Ineffective really did leave him

91
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,367
And then sending them out at 2 in the morning to walk down the most crime-ridden Street in town

92
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
You're always going to be looking over your shoulder

93
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
And there may be other people very tempted by what you have

94
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Cyrus the Great oldest son what name can be

95
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Officially it's Campisi's the SEC

96
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,543
That's part of what made Cyrus such a Visionary ruler

97
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,175
He paid a lot of attention before his death to making sure that there would be a smooth transition of power from him

98
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
To his

99
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
Designated successor

100
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
This is an era in human history

101
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,671
Where this was a very precarious Affair a lot of the time I mean we take for granted

102
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
In our Democratic systems today

103
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
The transfer of power will be relatively smooth

104
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
And we consider it a really big deal in a constitutional crisis if

105
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
And we can't name the winner at the end of the day

106
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
You don't want an election day and it has to go to a cord and if there's challenges to

107
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
In a ballot in the state of that say that's a huge deal

108
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
In the ancient near East and West Asia and the fury were talking about here

109
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,111
All kinds of nightmares happened at any king or ruler would have known about them

110
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
It would be Revolutions in Coos and assassinations and Sons would would kill their parents and go to war with each other

111
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
My favorite story about

112
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
These kinds of Affairs and it's a classic case I guess you could say that

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,751
Rule proving classic case is the Assyrian King sennacherib

114
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Who famously destroyed Babylon

115
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,151
And then lost his life supposedly while praying

116
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
At the hands of at least one and maybe two of his sons

117
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,623
And then one tradition by the way killed with a statue that represented Babylon so you get that wonderful

118
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
You know ancient history tie-in that the authors from ancient times all like

119
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
Where are you now there's a certain karmic Justice here you destroyed Babylon in the Madonna Babylon get back at you and then his sons

120
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,959
Go to war with each other the tail tell them at 3rd son maybe comes in

121
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Defeat both of them

122
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
And then takes over

123
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
The throne

124
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
Jump reverse but not that unusual in a guy like Cyrus the Great would have understood

125
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
You know the pitfalls

126
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Right is going to be a ton of entities out there

127
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,391
Want the power that you just created remember Cyrus is a guy who in the space of a single rain

128
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Admittedly long rain

129
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,023
Took his people from a geographical Backwater on the world stage

130
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
And made them the masters of the greatest Empire the world has ever seen

131
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,215
A guy whose initial title when he came to the throne with king of on Sean

132
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
Whose titles when he died where things like

133
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
King of the world King of the four corners of the earth king of the universe

134
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
As we said in the first part of the show

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
That's a heck of a promotion in one lifetime

136
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
While it's hard enough for the self-made individual that makes that progress in the space of a lifetime

137
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
How much harder might it be for people

138
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Who simply have that handed

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
2nd generation or the 3rd Generation begins to live a lifestyle

140
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
That's different than expect these sorts of things

141
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
You can see Cyrus training his son

142
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
4 years before his demise

143
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
To make him

144
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
Essentially on-the-job-training he's going to hand over the family business

145
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
His son gets to be the Viceroy Babylon for a while to hang out with the Army for a while do this do that he's learning how to be

146
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
The king of kings

147
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
I wonder if that somehow

148
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,583
Increases your chances that you can do so without losing your mind and your perspective

149
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Cyrus also

150
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
Brokers an important deal because he has more than one son

151
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
And if you look back at even recent history a guy like Cyrus would have been able to notice how much of a problem you have when you have

152
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Have more than one possible inherited the throne

153
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Cyrus

154
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
In addition to his oldest son came by sea has another one

155
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Known by multiple names

156
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,927
The most common probably be mispronounced by yours truly is bardia

157
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Is the younger son

158
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
And according to the ancient sources take this for what it's worth

159
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,191
When Cyrus is crafting essentially his will his inheritance the deal

160
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
It makes Campisi's the next king of kings but he gives out of a consolation prize to the younger bro

161
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Right you lose out on the

162
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
On the fruits of Empire but here is your runner-up

163
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Gift

164
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
He gives him a large territory

165
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
In Central Asia to govern

166
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,415
And apparently says that unlike all the other territories that are being governed

167
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
In the Name of the King you can keep the taxes in the tribute

168
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
You know from your places

169
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
You still are beholding to your older brother but

170
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,447
You have a nice little in a place to call your own sort of and keep the money

171
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
Initially this thing to work rather welcome Cyrus dies

172
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
Transition to his chosen successor

173
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Seems to be relatively scene

174
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
And then

175
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Things begin to get

176
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Corrupted

177
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
So corrupted in fact

178
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
But you actually have to look

179
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
At the end

180
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Afghan by Caesar's rain

181
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
And then work backward

182
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
To the beginning

183
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Because what happens at the end

184
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Changes kurupts and altars

185
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
All that we know about the rain

186
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
And by she's the second rain is going to be like a

187
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Game of Clue

188
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Did you ever play that game where

189
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,783
And yet to figure out the murder mystery in the weapon and what room it happened and it was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Trying to figure out

191
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
The reign of Campisi's and who this guy was

192
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
Is a little like trying to figure out the who done it

193
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
The game of Clue

194
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Because something happens to Camp by sea

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
And it might be

196
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
The he goes insane

197
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
Because he can't handle the amount of absolute power he has that's what the ancient sources

198
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,335
Indicate writes erotic just basically says

199
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
He's lost his mind

200
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
A lot of modern historians don't buy that at all

201
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
AC cover

202
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Conspiracy

203
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Something that

204
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Would not be

205
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Unfamiliar to people who read

206
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
You know things about the John F Kennedy assassination conspiracy tales about that because

207
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
If something about the demise of

208
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:52,447
Can Pisces that looks a lot like one of those John F Kennedy assassination conspiracy books or several of them

209
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
More

210
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
The people that may have

211
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Gotten

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,895
The King of Kings the founder of the Persian Empire son out of the way

213
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,991
May have been the ones who got it then decide how the history about him

214
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Was written

215
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
And that has

216
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Colored everything we know about

217
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Second ruler

218
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
The achaemenid Persian Empire

219
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
A guy who had the very

220
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,351
Unenviable task of trying to follow a legend

221
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Who could follow Alexander the Great

222
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Well nobody they ripped his Empire apart

223
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
And started fighting over it rather quickly

224
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
Who could follow Adolf Hitler if his dreams of a

225
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
Thousand-Year Reich even partially came true

226
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,063
Imagine it can you Hitler's personality and DNA

227
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Was

228
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,231
Entwined all throughout the idea of the Third Reich you can't even imagine anyone succeeding him in any of the realistic way

229
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
My ride is opposed

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,351
Admiral Donuts who succeeds in for a couple days to sign the peace agreement

231
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Who could

232
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
60

233
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Napoleon

234
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
Can buy she's the second is in the

235
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
Unenviable position

236
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
But if modern historians are to be believed and I shouldn't see why they shouldn't be

237
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
He did a pretty good job

238
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
For the time he had available to him

239
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Was he insane

240
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
That's much harder ones

241
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Figure out

242
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Depends on who you believe

243
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
But if he was

244
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Sure wouldn't be

245
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,655
Hard to imagine why how many people that you know out of a hundred could handle app

246
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Absolute power

247
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
The idea that can be seized was insane

248
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
And that he did all these crazy things

249
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
Was one that took hold way back in ancient time

250
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,575
I persisted up until really like the 1960s or 1970s

251
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,207
Will Durant in 1935 a great historian writing an outdated history

252
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,791
Did a wonderful job and by the way taking it at face value

253
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
Giving you the traditional cambece story

254
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,007
And it's a Litany of Horrors but it's fascinating as heck I mean if your Herodotus and we describe the ancient Greek

255
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,591
Historian as an ancient screenwriter or scriptrunner

256
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
If your product is

257
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
Don't you want a nice half-mad Persian king to play around with because

258
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,807
Think about the possibilities inherent in that right

259
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
Here's the way will Durant describes this in 1935 again taking the entire story at face value but essentially giving

260
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
You the story as it was understood and believed to have happened

261
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
For thousands of years he writes

262
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,983
Starting to talk about Cyrus can buy sees his father and contrasting and comparing the pieces quote

263
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
1 great defect had sullied is character

264
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Meeting Cyrus's Carey

265
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Occasional and incalculable cruelty

266
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,319
It was inherited on mixed with Cyrus's generosity by his half-mad son

267
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
Can Pisces Begin by putting to death his brother

268
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
And rifle

269
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
It means bardia he says smartest

270
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
I told you the guy that a lot of names

271
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
By putting to death his brother and Rivals Meredith

272
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
Then lured by the accumulated wealth of Egypt he set forth to extend the Persian Empire to the

273
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
He succeeded

274
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
But apparently at the cost of the sanity

275
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Memphis was captured easily

276
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,503
But an army of 50,000 Persians sent to Annex the Oasis of Amun perished in the desert

277
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
Any expedition to Carthage failed because the Phoenician Cruise of the Persian Fleet refuse to attack of Phoenicia

278
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
10 colonies

279
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Can Pisces lost his head

280
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
And abandon the why is clemency intolerance of his father

281
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
He publicly scoffed at the Egyptian religion and plunge this dagger derisively into the bull revered by the

282
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,983
Egyptians as the god apus

283
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,847
Exhumed mummies and pride in the Royal tombs regardless of ancient curses

284
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
The profaned the temples and ordered their Idol to be burnt

285
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
He thought in this way to cure the Egyptians of superstition

286
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,855
But when he was stricken with an illness apparently epileptic convulsions

287
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,487
The Egyptians were certain that their gods have punished him and that the theology was now confirmed Beyond dispute

288
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,351
As if again to illustrate the inconveniences of monarchy Durant rights

289
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,935
Can Pisces with the Napoleonic kick in the stomach

290
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Kill his sister and wife Roxana

291
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
Slew his son for Zaxby's with an arrow

292
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,615
Barry 12 Noble Persians alive

293
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Freezes to death

294
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Repented Rejoice to learn that the sentence had not been carried out

295
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
And then punish the officers who delayed in executing it

296
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Tony's way back to Persia he learned that the usurper had seized the throne and was being supported by widespread Revolution

297
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
From that moment he disappears from history

298
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Tradition has it that he killed himself

299
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
And quote

300
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,727
If you're the ancient screenwriter that is Herodotus

301
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
You love this guy is a story of

302
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
But is it true

303
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Trying to investigate

304
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
You know what happened to your like

305
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
Going into a crime scene and being an investigator

306
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
I've often thought that history is like a crime scene

307
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,511
I'm not a historian I meant admirer from afar but I love those moments where historians are put into the

308
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
So the Joe Friday the sergeant Joe Friday weather

309
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,935
As I said Colombo mode and go into the game of Clue and start investigating what happened

310
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
And the guys from Durant Sarah an earlier they're sort of like old-timer investigator that go out there the interview the witnesses

311
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
Try to figure out what happened they give you the stories they understand it

312
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
But they don't have modern-day techniques right it's like

313
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Investigating the Kennedy assassination

314
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
In a with techniques from the early 1960s or being able to have it happen today and investigated

315
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,351
With DNA evidence in modern-day ballistics in an audio sample in cameras

316
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
I mean the difference is

317
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Astonishing and when modern-day historians go back and examine this case they break it down to the same sorts of things you would if you were start

318
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Joe Friday going into the scene

319
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,431
It start looking at the physical evidence right the blood spatter

320
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
And the fingerprints that's the archaeological stuff

321
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Can you start comparing that

322
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
Do the stories you got from the witnesses and the different people around

323
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,951
You know the neighborhood there are the

324
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
In a written source is in the stuff that's come down to us

325
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
You start compiling sort of a

326
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
It'll come positive what the person the victim was like

327
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,031
Maybe you send investigators down to the city hall and you start looking at the paper trail see if there's any

328
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
In a records on this person arrest records real estate transactions anything like that

329
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Those are the

330
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,735
Ancient sources like the Babylonian tablets that they found

331
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
Can you try to compile some sort of a

332
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Semblance of what happened based on

333
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
You know the total view of the evidence

334
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
The story that can be seized is insane comes from some of the

335
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,607
In a Witnesses at the crime scene

336
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
And they may have been giving you the information secondhand

337
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
And it may have come from biosources

338
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
If you're investigating

339
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Crime scene you'll start with

340
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Just the facts

341
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Sergeant Joe Friday might have said

342
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
The facts of cambyses II rain that you can say

343
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
With certainty

344
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Is that he

345
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
The rules for about eight years from about 5:30 BC each about 5:22 BCE

346
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
He was the king

347
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
That first really gave the Persian Empire a naval capability and it may not sound like a big deal

348
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,199
Really made them the first of the powers that were based in Mesopotamia in that area of the world

349
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
Have any sort of significant Naval capability ever

350
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
People like the Assyrians might have had the tribute on the

351
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
The nominal allegiance of some of these coastal cities on the Mediterranean may have even been able to operate some Coastal forces

352
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Forces in freshwater areas

353
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
But the Persians become the first of these people to have a fleet which is significant on the Mediterranean Naval worldstage

354
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
And it should be

355
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
They take over the one that was probably the best in the Mediterranean

356
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Up until that time

357
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,223
They start absorbing Phoenician cities with the fabulous Phoenician navies

358
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
And the way the Persians govern days and create their own Navy or they didn't take the Phoenicians in and make them as a base to start their own

359
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,767
They simply went in there as soda subcontracted inside will listen what you have to offer the Empire militarily speaking is

360
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,119
New York have a fleet so when we need to Fleet your Fleet is our Fleet and you'll run it and

361
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
You know what you're doing and they'll be a bonus in it for you if you do well

362
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
Assyrians would have said something like you perform well or else

363
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
The Persians probably said something like a knight perform well in

364
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
We little something extra at the end of the year

365
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Pisces is the guy that does that

366
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
And that makes a huge difference in the story that's about to happen

367
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
Because if the Persians don't have any Naval power

368
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
Well a lot of things

369
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
It'll occur in the rest of their history cat

370
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Example

371
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,303
The other thing came by ceases absolutely known for in this a physical fact and that's the

372
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
He's the king of kings

373
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Takes over Egypt

374
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,751
Something that requires by the way this Navy in order to do

375
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
And a complete the conquest of his father

376
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Remember his father

377
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
You know we first started off conquering things they were for kind of superpowers in the world at that time or their version

378
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Another world

379
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Cyrus conquered conquered the

380
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
Remaining one

381
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
An Egypt was a great state pretty much always

382
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
They were no pushover

383
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
Although not a lot is known about

384
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
You know the fighting in the battles and all that sort of stuff

385
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
There were some decent stories

386
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,312
One of the more perverse that one of the ancient sources wrote

387
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
You know probably totally false but

388
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Said that

389
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,992
Persians took advantage of the ancient Egyptians reverence for cats

390
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
Strapped cats to their Shields

391
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
So that the Egyptian archers would be

392
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
You are unsure of how to react to that

393
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
That would be exactly the kind of

394
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,608
An image that Herodotus type character would love to share with an audience at the colorful anecdote isn't it

395
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,216
But Herodotus himself says he actually saw

396
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Bonfield

397
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
In Egypt from some of these battles

398
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
And that would have been

399
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
In a 75 years

400
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
After the fact or something so

401
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:16,832
Will be very interesting it's not like Herodotus to lie about what he actually sees or what he actually talks to somebody about seeing

402
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
Herodotus tells a story from the fighting

403
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:26,560
It says that the Persians at one point and it should be very like them by the way cuz then we talked about in the last program that they essentially did this

404
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Is with the Greeks

405
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,728
And with other people's they sent an invoice to the Egyptian Defenders at one point probably try to offer them a typical Persian

406
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,848
You give up this fight will all benefit probably be great to know

407
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
And it must have been

408
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,992
A sizable delegation because Herodotus says that the Egyptians

409
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,576
These the delegation and tore them limb from limb

410
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,952
Pretty much any time in history just about anywhere you go

411
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
And boys and and ambassadors and whatnot are

412
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Untouchable

413
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Are there are usually very strong

414
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Reasons to not

415
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Abused the envoy's of another country in the

416
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,384
Persians are no example in his we said the last of the persons are very lenient Empire sort of graded on a curve

417
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,224
But they could be just as nasty as their predecessors in the region

418
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,784
It when they decided they wanted to send a message

419
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,624
And the Persians were very good at knowing who to send it to

420
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Herodotus tells a story who knows if it's true or not

421
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,744
About what the Egyptian punishment was

422
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,328
When they lost the war and someone had to pay for

423
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
The treatment of those invoices were so horribly abused

424
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Herodotus has

425
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
Can Pisces right after he captures Egypt

426
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,128
Summoning the Egyptian Elite to the capital of Memphis

427
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
To watch a demonstration of what happens to

428
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
People

429
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
To break the law

430
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,136
And I keep trying to imagine what a saying like this is like it must have been

431
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,744
Intense enough with an oral historian like Herodotus

432
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,792
Talking about it to an audience

433
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
I can imagine what the

434
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
Extreme modern day

435
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Blockbuster movie would be like

436
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
But here's what Herodotus says when you try to imagine

437
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
And what the sound

438
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,944
2000 parents watching the children being executed

439
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Is like

440
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Product assist quote

441
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
9 days after Campisi's at taking control over Memphis

442
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Deseeded

443
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Centos

444
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
King of Egypt

445
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Would Rain 6 months

446
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
Egyptians in front of the entrance to the town as an insult

447
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,960
How do you tested the spirit of 70 toast in this way

448
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,056
He had the daughter of the former King dress like a slave

449
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
Instant out carrying a jug to get water

450
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Along with other girls

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
Selected Daughters of the most eminent men

452
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,552
All dressed in the same way as the daughter of 70 toes

453
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:59,392
As the girls walk past their fathers they cried out and wept

454
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,280
And all the other fathers seeing their children so degraded answered their cries and wept with their own

455
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,168
Vignetos after seeing and recognizing his daughter only bent down and silence to the ground

456
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Herodotus continues

457
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Quote

458
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
After the girls are gone by with their water

459
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,712
Can I see sent out the Son of Sam anitos with 2,000 other Egyptians the same age

460
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,784
Bound with ropes around their necks and bits in their mouth

461
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:33,440
They were being let in this matter in order to pay the penalties for the Egyptians destruction of the middle Indians

462
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
Memphis M4 the decision of the royal judges

463
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
Was that for each member of the ship's crew

464
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,888
Eminent Egyptian should be put to death in return

465
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
San Benito saw them passing by

466
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
And realize that his son was being led to his death

467
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:53,152
But while the other Egyptian seated around him were crying and openly expressing their anguish he behaved just as he had in

468
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
In the case of his daughter

469
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
And quote

470
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
I try to imagine that scene

471
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
The parents watching

472
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Their children put to death into slavery thing

473
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
Might not hit home until you think about it

474
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
These girls were probably dressed extremely scantalides or formerly the noblewomen you know of the realm

475
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
And they're dressed

476
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
In a way that would be provocative to

477
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,616
Let's just say the male population looking for slaves for more than just menial labor

478
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,200
We tend to forget that element of slavery over time

479
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:32,320
But it's undoubtable that sex was an integral part of the attraction of having someone

480
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,208
That you owned available at any time and if you're the parent watching your daughter in that situation

481
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,376
The anguish and then did watch your son being executed in front of you and then seeing you know the other people in your situations were right now

482
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,168
Text You In This Crowd I mean

483
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
What's that sound like

484
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
What is this allegation true

485
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,128
Are you begin to ask questions

486
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
That are part of investigating

487
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
Crime scene

488
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
True

489
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
It's not hard to imagine

490
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:12,256
The Campisi's might have made a few enemies in Egyptian society and might not have the greatest reputation in Egypt which is where you

491
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
You can start the investigative process

492
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
Herodotus is very open about where he was giving

493
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,216
Is information about these events which happened

494
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
About seventy-five years before

495
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
And he's writing

496
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
He says he got information from Persians and Egyptians

497
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
Will the Egyptians might not have been too happy

498
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
With can buy cease to begin with

499
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,600
And by the time Herodotus is talking to them

500
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,696
They're having problems with Persian they're not very happy and they had some revolts and

501
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,280
Is every reason to believe that this Egyptian sources that he use

502
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,632
What particularly anti Persian but secretly anti-cant Pisces

503
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,752
The first and sources were too which is a much harder question to answer

504
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
And why

505
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
Is the son of Cyrus

506
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Not more highly thought of almost his own people

507
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,272
It's a lot of allegations against cam Pices

508
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,440
Use the legal terms right alleged as though the lawyers piling up the historical charges against

509
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Alleged to have

510
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,912
You killed the children of those prominent Egyptians he's alleged to have lost an entire 40 or 50

511
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
1000 man army in the desert

512
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
On the way to conquer an oasis

513
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,896
And supposedly a sandstorm blows up berries the whole Army and they're still there

514
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,064
Protist organism articles I've read do not believe they're still there but it's an intriguing enough thing to

515
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,928
Capture the hearts of archaeologists about every 10 or so years who set out

516
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
For expeditions or start talking about the

517
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,816
In all likelihood of finding the lost Army of cambyses

518
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Then supposedly

519
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Is range and paste

520
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
He supposed to have

521
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
Attacked the people to the south of Egypt

522
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,640
The vile Kush the Egyptians called them once upon a time

523
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
The black African Egyptians

524
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
If you will

525
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
When people think of

526
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
The dark sub-Saharan African pharaohs

527
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,928
The thinking of the cushites in the cushites dominated Egypt

528
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,048
Cancel timeshare example around the Assyrian time. You literally had Black Pharaohs

529
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,912
And the culture of this area down south of Egypt with Egyptian also

530
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
Pisces didn't prepare for this and general told him you had to have him supplies he didn't care in the army star

531
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Starving in the field

532
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,712
And they draw Lots the ancient sources

533
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
And you pick a lot in the guy who gets the short end of the straw one out of 10 of the Persian soldiers has to sacrifice themselves for the

534
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Into the pot they go

535
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
I'm bringing his

536
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Cannibalistic

537
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,912
Decimated Army back up to Egypt get there and see the Egyptian celebrating

538
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,240
Assumes that the celebration is

539
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,080
A celebration of his Misfortune and he starts getting crazy and

540
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
Killing priests in interrogating them

541
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,224
And then he does the thing that is the most sacrilegious in the

542
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,760
Tradition that he

543
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
Picked up a daiquiri stabbed the apis bull

544
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
If that's true there's very little

545
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,464
It would have upset the Egyptians more than that

546
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,584
The apis bull is a sacred Egyptian symbol

547
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
They are venerated

548
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
Treated with a huge amount of care and respect

549
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
It's overcame Pisces to deliberately injure or hurt it

550
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Would have been

551
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,384
A huge religious transgression and shocking to the people

552
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Love Egypt

553
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
Once Upon a Time the early investigators of this historical crime scene accepted

554
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:53,696
Can buy seeds kill the apis bull in a lot of other things falling from that not hard to see

555
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,280
But he's got bad press and is portrayed as insane

556
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
Prodigious

557
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:05,216
The killing of the apis bull is one of the best pieces of evidence to prove it

558
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,080
But the modern-day investigator the Colombo the Joe Fridays

559
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Have more

560
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,272
Tools at their disposal in more information at hand than the early investigators did they might have had to rely on

561
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,880
Eyewitness testimony back in the day of will Durant in 1935

562
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,696
The Bible the 1960's and 1970's

563
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
The records were becoming available in modern-day historians could look at the equivalent of fingerprints in the blood spatter evidence and they found

564
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Out

565
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Through

566
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Egyptian records

567
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
The therapist bull didn't die

568
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Because it was chilled

569
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
Not only did it die a normal death

570
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,712
And was interred with the other apus Bulls from previous times

571
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
But the Persian king of kings can't Pisces

572
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
High Sparrow

573
00:31:54,112 --> 00:32:00,256
Conducted all the normal sorts of religious rights in sacrament you would have expected in native-born pharaoh

574
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
To do

575
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
He behaved

576
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,168
Exactly as you would have expected him to if he was keeping

577
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
A continuous policy

578
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
You know the sort his father used to employee of Tolerance

579
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
And having the Persian king

580
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:19,968
Assume the legitimate mantle of the religious beliefs in the Garment of all these countries

581
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
This is part of what began

582
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:27,136
To make modern-day historians suspicious of the official story

583
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
So who was propagating the official story

584
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
Is this all based on

585
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
You know Greek writers like Herodotus

586
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,960
Who are all sorts of undercurrents of other things he was writing about including

587
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
You know the idea of the growth of Persian decadence and house from the greatness of Cyrus they were already beginning to

588
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:53,760
Downhill from there

589
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,184
2 themes of Oriental weakness and decadence an Indulgence to have continued up until the present day

590
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Daddy

591
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,024
So you take everything he says with a grain of salt

592
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
But there is an influential Persian

593
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,168
It sort of takes a swipe at Campisi's

594
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,496
And adds fuel to the conspiracy fire

595
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
He says he's killed his brother

596
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
Kept it a secret

597
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
Quote

598
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Campisi's had a brother

599
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
Bardia by name

600
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,112
Of the same mother in the same father is Camp by Seas

601
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
Afterwards Campisi's killed bardia

602
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,304
When can babies have killed bardia it did not become known to the people that party I've been killed

603
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
And quote

604
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,704
Those ancient allegations are more than 2500 years old

605
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,312
They were carved into the Rock

606
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
Face of a sacred Mountain Side

607
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,968
Along which the old heavily-traveled Royal Road used to run

608
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
I've always thought of it as

609
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Kind of one of the most

610
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Successful example

611
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Roadside billboard ad ever

612
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Although I don't think it was very easy

613
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,816
They put a garden around it and stop maybe more like a rest stop and it contained a carving showing this

614
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
Being involving human figures

615
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,424
And then in three different languages and their raishan

616
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,984
The narration is the story

617
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,104
Of how one of the greatest kings in the achaemenid Persian Empire probably number two

618
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
On most people

619
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
Top 10 list behind Cyrus the Great

620
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
It's hard to

621
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Not the founder of the

622
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Empire

623
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Off the top job usually

624
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
But this other guy named Reyes

625
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,208
Or Darius the great I use both pronunciations interchangeably and for that I apologize

626
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Hopeless sometimes

627
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,376
Unless this is the story of how he gets the job of King of Kings

628
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
As Told

629
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,776
By Darius the great himself it's an autobiography of sorts

630
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
That reason it's a little self-serving

631
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
This is the guy who by the way

632
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
Seem to have every quality you want

633
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
Interperspective

634
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Great

635
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
Can you change except for one thing

636
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Legitimacy

637
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,512
And a story that he tells on the Mountainside amongst other places

638
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,608
Seems to be a quest to explain to you the reader

639
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,728
And why he should have and deserve the top job including the normal

640
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Soca qualifications that the God wants him to have it

641
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Furama Mazda

642
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Stop being the god in this

643
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:33,760
Set up a change in emphasis in religion of the Persian Empire much too complicated for me to understand

644
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Ahura Mazda

645
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,464
Find them and give them all these great gifts and make some The King and I

646
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Marching down the job

647
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,608
Goes into his lineage and all the blue blood that's in his veins these are standard

648
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Justifications anyone

649
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
But then his story views

650
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
Into the weird

651
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,128
Weird and wonderful and conspiratorial in fantastic

652
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,456
What's funny about this is this is the official story

653
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
And the official story is Twisted

654
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
Thrice the great is an interesting person to get this information

655
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
Because Jiraiya's the great in our historical crime scene

656
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
Is like Colonel Mustard in the game Clue

657
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Is a potential suspect

658
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
Because somehow

659
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,824
This guy who is not directly connected to the Royal Line will end up in the top job how does that happen What

660
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
What's an interesting story

661
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,456
And the rice the Great Cars along side of mountain to explain it to you when it starts off

662
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
With Cam by she's killing his brother and keeping it a secret

663
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
And the reason this is important

664
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
It's because apparently can't buy she's had no heirs

665
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
So what happens if the

666
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,512
Son of Cyrus the King of Kings were to die

667
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Who's the only other person

668
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Logically that you give that job to

669
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
All the other son of Cyrus right bharti

670
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,240
The son who got the consolation prize of Empire

671
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
You've heard that

672
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Line services

673
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
Sons were the air Campisi's

674
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
And the spare

675
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
RTI something happens to Camp by seat return to the spare don't you

676
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,600
So how did Urias have the job why didn't the spare get the job will funny you should ask

677
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Can braces kill the spare

678
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
And then he didn't tell anybody about it

679
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,768
And then he led the Army to conquer Egypt and Darius the Great

680
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Serving as his Lance Bearer

681
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,120
Or spear-bearer which is a

682
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
An official position think Ibaka

683
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,520
Personal the general staff for something like 28 years old

684
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Part of that increasing

685
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
Nasty veteran Persian army that conquered Egypt

686
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
And according to the rise while they're away

687
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,296
Or while they're on their way home one of the other

688
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
They get the word

689
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
That the throne has been seized by a usurper

690
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
A usurper claiming to be body

691
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,632
But according to Jiraiya's body it was dead

692
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,032
Problem of course is by not telling anyone as he says Campisi's didn't

693
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
The people didn't know the party wasn't alive anymore

694
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,248
Jiraiya says that the name of the Imposter on the throne

695
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
Was galmada

696
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
Origami

697
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
Annie identifies him as a majus

698
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
One of the Magi

699
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
Our modern word magician

700
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Is related to that

701
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,888
And I didn't realize this until Tom Holland the historian pointed it out in this book Persian fire

702
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,752
But there may be a connection to the fact that this is a really sort of hard to believe story

703
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
But now it has someone who could

704
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,920
Be considered to have potential Supernatural powers

705
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,064
Involve which explains away all kinds of story holes doesn't it when you have a problem you just say listen the guy that matches

706
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
You don't know what those people can do on yeah that explains it

707
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
But after this

708
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
Dalmata seizes the throne

709
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
The Empire starts to come over to him

710
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,912
It's on his rock carving that

711
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,240
The people began to go over to this false party

712
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
You seem to be popular by the way to

713
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
I compare it to the line that's well-known among football fans that the backup quarterback is the most popular player on the team

714
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,832
Because you know you can invest all your hopes in that you don't know how that person would play

715
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:25,440
But you know you're not so happy with the starting quarterback and Pisces is the starting quarterback

716
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
And there were a lot of

717
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Historians thinking that there were policies that Campisi's was apart of

718
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,656
For example in Egyptian priesthood

719
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
You know eliminating or reducing the power of Clan leaders in local Noble so that they could consolidated

720
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,872
In the central government all these sorts of pink tax policy

721
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:48,480
He may not have been too popular with a lot of people wear at this party a guy well

722
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,320
Who's the backup quarterback I think he played better if you just gave him the job

723
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,672
Sundry says he was getting a lot of support about becoming a big problem

724
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,232
And he's with Campisi's at the time

725
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,120
Erotic just tells this wonderful story again another movie scene

726
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,984
Where he has the representative from the new king showing up

727
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
You know in front of the army

728
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
And can't buy seeds while they're out in the field

729
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,736
And proclaiming in front of the army that there's a new King on the throne and that they should no longer you know he'd the orders of the very King

730
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
King who's with them

731
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Visible

732
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Those are great stories

733
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,232
And then somehow in this story in 522 BCE

734
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Can Pisces die

735
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,912
And a bunch of historians will set you know suspiciously it's suspicious that we don't know

736
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
What happened to Kim Pisces

737
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,056
According to De Reyes on his rock carving he says he died his own death

738
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,968
For a while that was also translated his by his own hand which made us all think of suicide a while back but

739
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Modern historians have pointed out

740
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,416
But that's probably not the right translation and that even if you use the way the Greek writer say he died

741
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
You could interpret that as by his own hand and not have it be a suicide question for example Herodotus

742
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,120
Says can buy Seas will die

743
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
After he jumps on his horse

744
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,264
And stabs himself with his sword because the tip of the Scabbard to come off

745
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Entity

746
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Leg wound will get infected

747
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,504
And he will die several days later and by the way because Herodotus has to tie the story up in a wonderful bow he says he's

748
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
Stabbed himself right at the spot on his thigh where he stabbed the apis bull in Egypt see once again

749
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:37,792
Karma this is a big, guy loud the ancient writers are they just don't call it that but you get your Just Desserts

750
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
It's right

751
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
In another Greek authors

752
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
Kale which is you know strangely similar in its own way he says Campisi's was wiggling a piece of wood with his sword

753
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:52,640
And he slipped and he cut himself on the thigh and same thing infected dies a few days later

754
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
So he died by his own hand but that's not suicidal

755
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
Don't let no one knows how he died

756
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,879
And there's a decent number maybe I took 20% of the historians you read

757
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,695
You think that the guy probably was a victim

758
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,535
Of assassination by his underlings one of them was

759
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,375
Darius the great and suspiciously the one who becomes the next

760
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
In a big chain

761
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:22,847
If you're at the Historical crime scene mr. Ryan the great guy is the one is going to get all the stuff of the murder victim

762
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Please Colonel Mustard

763
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
He's a potential suspect here

764
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,783
So this whole story has to be taken with a grain of salt

765
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,831
Because of what happens next

766
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,927
According to the riots after 10 Pisces dies

767
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
He organizes what maybe you could call

768
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
The hit team

769
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,351
Earnest assassination Squad an oligarchy

770
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
18

771
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
But he will set out

772
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
To chill

773
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,103
This person who is impersonating the Dead Brother of cambyses

774
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,687
Right cuz if you believe the riots is official story

775
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
When he in his six

776
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,319
Assassination cohorts go out to do this deed

777
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
Both of the sons of Cyrus or dead

778
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Tell the story as told by

779
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:16,095
Psoriasis on the Mountainside at be his phone or bisitun that's what the inscriptions called

780
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
Is in its own way dramatic enough although it's pretty bare-bones once Herodotus the screenwriter / historian gets hit

781
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
His hands on it

782
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
If it comes this wonderful Tale

783
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,479
Fully modern and probably the precursor to several repetitive Movie themes we've all seen a hundred times

784
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,807
But if that's the case Herodotus is the guy who started this

785
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
In his hands this assassination

786
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,743
Movies like a force 10 from Navarone type movie

787
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,583
And we have the Assassins the Commandos

788
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Other working for the good guys

789
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
And can I go to this heavily-armed

790
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
Nazi Island

791
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:58,847
Take out the head of the Gestapo or something for all these guard with lots of explosions and all these things

792
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
That's a little like what the story sounded like

793
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
Herodotus says that the riot and his compatriots

794
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Go to a fortress where they false King

795
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
The mattress is

796
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:15,999
Stang and that they get past the guards because of their lofty status in the regime right these

797
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,839
Pillars of the regime the aristocracy this is the oligarchy walking in

798
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,655
Surely there's nothing to stop at the gates and fear

799
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Herodotus portrays the story

800
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,799
Force 10 from Navarone group get past the first level of Defense

801
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
And Herodotus has them

802
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Encountering

803
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,503
Royal eunuchs in the courtyard these Royal Messengers he says

804
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,087
The Persians like a lot of the regimes in that area had a lot of eunuchs

805
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
And have a lot of debate over whether or not

806
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:48,511
They were sort of really castrated males taken is as young boys to provide

807
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,095
A governmental class for the Persians or weather

808
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:56,703
Castration had actually sold become symbolic by that point and it was more of a

809
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,591
Title it's hard to know probably the former though I tend to believe the weirdness when I can

810
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Annie's eunuchs

811
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Recognize that these

812
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
7 aristocratic

813
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
Knoebels are there for no good and challenge them and then a knife fighting shoes making a lot of noise in the

814
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,439
The courtyard and again when you're reading Herodotus at A Moment Like This try to remember

815
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
The one in history is think he was performing this live for Nadia's and if that's the case this isn't her rotten actions

816
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
It's all that's missing really are the explosions

817
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
Andaluca sound of the big score in the popcorn

818
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
And you can hear the courtyard sound effects of there's a lot of noise and Herodotus basically says that the Magi

819
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,271
Giant he's got two of them because why I only have one super villain in the story when you can double up

820
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
So instead of just having the Joker

821
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,647
In this movie he's got into the Riddler to

822
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Two of the Magi

823
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,535
And they look down in the courtyard they can hear the commotion so they arm themselves

824
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,119
And then after the force 10 from Navarone Commandos get rid of the eunuchs

825
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,007
Are the running towards the stairs and you can imagine the music right right

826
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
They run up there and there's a swashbuckling fight with the two Magi and the force 10 from Navarone Commando guys

827
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:16,063
Fungi gets stabbed people directly and then again in a million times

828
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,695
The one principle matches the one who is the false party of the one has been sitting on the throne dressed of the king

829
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
Takes off out of the room

830
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,559
To be followed by a guy named Gabriel

831
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,679
And the soon-to-be down the road king of kings to write they take off you know after the one guy

832
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Down the hallway through the door

833
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,311
Into the darkened room imagine the music

834
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Go for your popcorn here right

835
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,711
And then the brightest and the false king of wrestling in the darkroom

836
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
And ariya sitting there was a sore but he's afraid to stab because he's afraid of hitting his friend and your Brian says to him parotid says

837
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,207
Why are you hesitating because I don't want to hit you when he's established both are you crazy

838
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Runs in through

839
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
It only gets the bad guy

840
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,447
Has in his rock carving is a little bit more Bare Bones than Herodotus is about what happened

841
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
After pointing out

842
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
That the

843
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,615
The fake King had letter Reign of Terror

844
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:17,759
In Persia because he was wiping out anyone that could recognize that he was a faker

845
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
Do anybody know what the real body look like

846
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,927
He was getting rid of so he could consolidate his position and not be called out a fraud

847
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,511
So after explaining that the reign of terror was going on to Raya says

848
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
On his Mountain Side quote

849
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:36,191
No one dared say anything about dalmata the mattress until I came

850
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,311
Afterwards I pray to ahura-mazda ahura-mazda brought me Aid

851
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
In the month of Baguio dish 10 days have passed and then I with a few man slew Kalamata the

852
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,783
The magic and the men who were his four most followers

853
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
A fortress

854
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:58,719
Chick Alla Bosch by name and a district necio by name and Madea there I slew him

855
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,511
I took the kingship from him

856
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,583
By the favor of ahura-mazda I became king

857
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,655
Ahura-mazda bestowed the kingship upon me

858
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
And quote

859
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
As several historians have said

860
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,151
In this entire account it does look a little bit like the riots don't protest too much doesn't it

861
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,063
The story of how he goes from Simply being one of the Assassins to the one that actually gets the top job

862
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
Involves a horse and it's not very

863
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,743
Good to talk about it breakfast and it's a it's a weird story

864
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,095
And it makes no sense at all and there's no way anybody ever got picked to be a king that way

865
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:41,471
So it all becomes a little bit weird how the riot ends up with the throne

866
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
Here's the problem he faces

867
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
If you don't believe

868
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,895
The camp Isis killed his brother

869
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,271
Look at how this entire story changes if you the crime scene investigator when you approach it from that way

870
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,087
Willis historian Peter Breann says

871
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,159
The entire structure collapses like a house of cards

872
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:05,023
Because of Campisi's didn't kill his brother bardia what happened to Barty

873
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
This is where we get back to the game of Clue where you're examining possibilities scenarios motives

874
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
Things like that for example

875
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
Scenario number one

876
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
Is that maybe bardia

877
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
Letter Rebellion

878
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,855
The very thing that Cyrus the Great was so worried about when he divided his Empire worry so much about

879
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:35,999
Giving body the consolation prize to Empire and avoiding that terrible thing that happens so often in the ancient world will maybe it happened anyway

880
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
There are hints that the brothers may not have gotten along so well

881
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,399
Body isn't very popular at that

882
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
In a backup quarterback thing going for him

883
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,823
Maybe he led a rebellion in which case if cannabites he's did kill him

884
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
That wouldn't have been some slam on his historical reputation it would have been a pretty standard thing for a ruler to do

885
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Doing probably justifiable

886
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,647
I think by leaving out the specifics of a Campisi's is motive

887
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
Biosource Landers him for all eternity by letting your imagination or Herodotus is Imagination fill in the blanks

888
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,607
Why did Campisi's kill his brother

889
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Cuz he's insane

890
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
You know what I mean

891
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
Unless the idea that body and may have led a rebellion

892
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:25,151
With local Elites and people trying to preserve their power pushing it a different approach for the empire

893
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,503
Although that's very possible in which case bharatiya may have died as a usurper

894
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
In a kilobyte can buy CDs

895
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,183
Another possibility has to do with

896
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
No question of timing

897
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:45,887
When is bardia character took the throne right

898
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Still alive and well

899
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,495
Well then that's a usurpation right he's a rebel basic

900
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:57,151
But what if he takes it after Campisi's who died

901
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,223
We cut ourselves we died ten days later from gangrene

902
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
Who did The Empire go to

903
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,367
But can't buy she's really had no errors the way the ancient author said

904
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,671
The Empire should go to bharatiya shouldn't it

905
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,279
And things get really strange when you start asking the question about

906
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
You know if this was the real body because if

907
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,911
Body wasn't killed by Campisi's who is it

908
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,983
That dries and his hit team take out

909
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
When they go

910
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
You know we kill the majus

911
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
Another false party and y'all not

912
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
Well if it's not the false party

913
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
It's the real bar

914
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:40,159
When I think of the various scenarios out there I think of our historical crime scene investigator

915
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,487
The showing back up at headquarters and telling their

916
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,303
Superior officer you know the old grey-haired

917
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
Cynical

918
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
Veteran lieutenant

919
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:56,031
The official story that they got from the crime scene that this dries character tell them yes I stab this guy dressed as the king

920
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,079
Do you have a name tag on it said I am bar together

921
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,175
Son of Cyrus but he wasn't party and I stayed the nation by killing this imposter

922
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,271
And the lieutenant the grizzled veteran looking at them like they're out of their mind and going

923
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,599
You don't really believe that crap to you let me tell you what probably happened

924
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
This derives guy killed Campisi's his King and then went and killed his brother the guy who should have been the next

925
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
King Shannon took the throne for himself case closed

926
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
Now that might have happened to

927
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,775
Historians just can't know there's not enough information would tell you so much about what was going on to know the facts

928
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,615
But it's like the ultimate Cold Case file of all time isn't it

929
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,151
I like the way

930
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Historian

931
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,807
Marc Vandermeer kind of sums up the situation and gives you the the sense that

932
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:44,159
That it's suspicious but we don't know what happened and there's a lot of possibilities he writes quote

933
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,767
Our main source of information about events is the description by the final Victor

934
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,535
Urias

935
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
Who was not a legitimate successor to the throne

936
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,655
Is a count was carved in three languages

937
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
On a rock facade

938
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
Gaston

939
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,287
Minnesott Grouse Mountain Valley connecting babilonia and Aron

940
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,591
It was also spread throughout the empire

941
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
In Aramaic translation on papyrus

942
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,711
Impossibly Herodotus used one of these

943
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
As the basis for the story he told in his history

944
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,855
We have the say severely biased description

945
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
Buy a usurper

946
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Who justifies his actions in the text

947
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,255
And it is not easy to determine what really happened

948
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
And quote

949
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,911
But because it's so important all these historians who don't like the Stray very far from the data

950
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,983
But because they're so little data are forced to

951
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,775
He gives you his best guess here

952
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Quote

953
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,615
Can Pisces his prolonged stay in Egypt

954
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,199
Gauges brother bardia a chance to claim kingship at home

955
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:44,831
The latter abolished taxes in military levies for 3 years in order to gain popular support

956
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
Can Pisces return from Egypt

957
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
What was probably assassinated

958
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
Either by bardia or by Jiraiya

959
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,303
Ojai military commander who subsequently killed bardia

960
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
And quote

961
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,143
There are other theories

962
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
As well

963
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
Actrices zarghami in his book discovering Cyrus

964
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,151
Says we shouldn't be so quick to throw out the official story

965
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,807
He's not specifically lining up with it but he says listen if you look at a certain number of facts history has been weirder than this

966
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,135
Maybe there was a galmada trip maybe he was impersonating

967
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
The

968
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
Have your son of Cyrus and maybe came by she said killed

969
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:30,399
Equita final possibilities that it's probably true they can't buy seeds

970
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
Anybody about that

971
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
But eventually

972
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:38,335
The oligarchy is confronted with a king of kings who's not in his right mind

973
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
You can't exactly impeach one of those

974
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,759
So what's the logical alternative in the system

975
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,111
Going to do away with an absolute ruler at the absolute ruler has lost his mind

976
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Maybe in this case

977
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Psoriasis

978
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
Send

979
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,559
You know the rest of the aristocracy was simply doing

980
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,887
The Logical Common Sense thing in that situation who knows

981
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
To those historians who suggests that what we may have here when derailleurs comes to power some sort of an olive

982
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
Oligarchy coup

983
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
He writes

984
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
In the inscription on the side of the mountain

985
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Quote

986
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,807
Dries the Kings

987
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:26,207
These are the men who at that time were there when I slew galmada the magic who called himself

988
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Bardia

989
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,303
At that time these men cooperated as my followers

990
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
And he goes on to name

991
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Specifically

992
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:39,007
F-fix co-conspirators the other members of the assassination hit team one by one

993
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
And then he says

994
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Quote

995
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,639
You who shall be king hereafter

996
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
Protect well The Offspring of these men

997
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
And quote

998
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,551
How many descendants

999
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:56,927
Over a hundred years let's just say although the Persian Empire existed closer to 200

1000
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:03,839
How many people can be The Offspring of those six original conspiratorial Force 10 from Navarone

1001
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
Comrades

1002
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Descendants of

1003
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,287
The Assassins may have ended up being

1004
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:19,455
Like an oligarchy in the Persian Empire or maybe a better way to phrase it is like an oligarchy on top of

1005
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
Of the already-existing oligarchy

1006
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Creme Dela creme

1007
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,623
The descendants of the hit team

1008
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,535
In Greek literature they will usually be referred to as the 7

1009
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,863
One of the seven may have been the equivalent

1010
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Of having your

1011
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,215
Place in Persian Society literally

1012
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
He carved into stone

1013
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
That one of the greatest

1014
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
The Persian Empire ever produce

1015
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
I've always seen

1016
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,575
The 7in adario sin his six co-conspirators

1017
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,391
A little like the initial investors

1018
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
In a

1019
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,231
Fascination related startup company

1020
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,047
In this case a startup company devoted to

1021
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
Assassinating a ruler

1022
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
Taking the throne /

1023
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:14,495
If that's the case and it really did put those people into apartment a different class well

1024
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,335
That's a heck of a long-term dividend return

1025
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Paid off

1026
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
Until

1027
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
Basically the end of the Empire not a bad deal

1028
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
Historian Peter Briand

1029
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:32,415
Is one of some of the newer ones who question the entire idea behind the special class by the way

1030
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,743
Some of the newer historians suggest that these

1031
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:41,631
6 Persians that were the co-conspirators that that number might have been chosen for religious reasons

1032
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,703
But they may be one six or more than 6 or less than 6

1033
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:49,055
Also that it just so happens that these people may simply represent the powerful

1034
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,383
Noble clans of Persia anyway

1035
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,711
So the people that already were kind of the oligarchy in Persia

1036
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
Just get their status reaffirmed

1037
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
Doesn't matter which one of these

1038
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Scenarios now that explains

1039
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
This weird. Between the end of Campisi's is rain at the beginning of a rain of a guy who doesn't seem to have any connection to the Royal

1040
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Family Jiraiya

1041
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,471
Doesn't matter which one of those scenarios are true and by the way we only scratched the surface on the mini that are out there

1042
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,823
They're all pretty darn wild and wooly all of them would make a good film

1043
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
Personally I think the best one

1044
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:32,319
Is this Advanced version of like the Warren Commission report the official Narrative of the riot makes the best movie

1045
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,439
Get Herodotus to do the screenplay Oliver Stone to direct it

1046
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
Make sure there's some Lucas sound I mean in

1047
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
It's stuff like this that make this may be the best coup d'etat / assassination / regime-change conspiracy store

1048
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,823
Doesn't matter which one of them turns out to be true though

1049
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,943
By 521 BCE the end result of this guy dries is on the throne

1050
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,319
And he's got maybe you could say a legitimacy deficit

1051
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
Maybe the only thing he's like

1052
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:14,559
And it causes him problems right away he's very open about this in this autobiographical account

1053
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
You carved into the Mountainside

1054
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,959
A list of all the places that rebelled against his rule

1055
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,311
If ID says 19 battles

1056
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
Year-and-a-half to three years to quell

1057
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,663
All of the uprisings in

1058
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:33,247
These places in Persia that are rebelling are some of its most

1059
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,575
Important provinces large places right Egypt freeze at

1060
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
And they're not rebelling

1061
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:45,791
So that they can band together and support some sort of rival claimant to the throne because his story think there might have been a bunch of

1062
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,887
People in the Empire the thought they had as much of a connection to the throne is this the right guy

1063
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,751
It looks instead like they're all kind of going rogue at the same time

1064
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,799
Like they want their independence back

1065
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,151
They all seem to have kings that Sprout from nowhere

1066
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:06,783
Better claiming royal descent from the last independent line all these places had right

1067
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:13,695
And in the same way that the riots on the Mountainside inscription says that gal motto

1068
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,767
About being bharti remember the Persians have this thing about law

1069
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,095
Basically number one on their cultural naughty list

1070
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,119
List at this point

1071
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,679
It's a when he says they lied that's pretty bad

1072
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:30,079
But then he goes on to say that all of these Kings and all of these provinces that have rebelled that are claiming descent

1073
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,663
From the old royal family that used to exist there before the person showed up

1074
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
Caroline

1075
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,039
Historians refer to all these Kings at the liar King

1076
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:46,975
Jiraiya's would have to go from place to place to place biting battle after battle after battle he would send his generals to go fight some of these battles

1077
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
Had to conquer Babylon more than once

1078
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,863
You'll love this one of the liar kings that pops up

1079
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:59,519
Also claims to be bardiya so this would be the second bardia that shows up on the scene the zombie

1080
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,335
Now other son of Cyrus that cannot be killed

1081
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
I love the way

1082
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,295
By The Wager is on the Mountainside inscription gives the orders to his forces to go quail these Rebellion

1083
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,879
He says the same thing every time which probably means it

1084
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
It's ritualizing somewhat but

1085
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
But it's still wonderful

1086
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
You know old school ancient staff

1087
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Terminology

1088
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
Jesus quote

1089
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
Goforth

1090
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,703
And defeat the rebellious Army which will not call itself mine

1091
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
And quote

1092
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,311
And then is he captures these

1093
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,919
In a rebel leader the ones who tie themselves to the old

1094
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
In a royal family from long ago

1095
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:44,575
He treats them all pretty darn badly sometimes they only show up in pieces the elamites

1096
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
When they find out he's basically on the way they kill their own independent King themselves and send body parts to

1097
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Psoriasis

1098
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
That's like saying we're sorry

1099
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,119
But when he gets his hands on the hole

1100
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,167
Liar King one at a time

1101
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,727
He treats them like this this involves

1102
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,567
One that rebelled in the DNA manfre Ortiz which is a

1103
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,895
Greek version of a name that's famous

1104
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
In MIDI in history so

1105
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,759
Rooted in the old royal family and then

1106
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
Dries got his hands on

1107
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,391
He writes on the bisitun inscription on the Mountainside quote

1108
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:25,279
Dries the king says afterwards priorities fled with a few Horseman

1109
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,071
There is a district in Madea

1110
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,375
Rockabye name

1111
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,935
After that I sent an Army in Pursuit

1112
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,239
Freddy Ortiz was seized and led to me

1113
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,799
I cut off his nose ears and tongue

1114
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,591
And I put out one of his eyes

1115
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,151
At my gate he was kept bound

1116
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,687
And all the people looked at

1117
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,503
After that I impaled him at Fatima

1118
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,111
And in the Fortress attic patinar I hanged the man who were his four most followers

1119
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
I executed is Noble

1120
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,695
A total of 47

1121
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,279
I hung their heads inside it bad enough from the battlements of the 4th

1122
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
And quote

1123
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,447
He said the Persians were more tolerant

1124
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,007
Then a lot of the early rimfires in the region

1125
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
But that's graded on a curve

1126
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,383
This is still the ancient. Where the sorts of

1127
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
Treatments

1128
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:19,551
Prisoners and captives and people on the other side of justice for example

1129
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,695
More resembles the stuff that the very worst of the terrorist in our world today do

1130
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,791
That's often part of the legal codes of these early societies

1131
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,351
Yunnan fascinated by the

1132
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,143
Streams of The Human Experience

1133
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,727
When you go far back in time you see them everywhere

1134
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,055
I mean I was reading for example

1135
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:47,455
The process by which impalement as an execution is carried out in some places and sometimes

1136
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:52,831
I think in our heads we just think there's a sharpened stake sticking out of the ground you throw the victim up

1137
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,903
They land on the steak impalement. No muss no fuss well

1138
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Basically

1139
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,255
But instead I'm reading about

1140
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
You know a whole thing with a

1141
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:07,423
They use a razor blade in advance and some of these places they would then put something on to stop the bleeding

1142
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,239
Fix you up a little bit so it went the way they wanted

1143
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
Greasing the the

1144
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Steak and mean things that just you

1145
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,943
Doesn't make any sense to the modern mind you think about the people who did this

1146
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
And you think that they almost sound like a different species don't they

1147
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
But they're not

1148
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,183
The little newborn baby out of a modern hospital

1149
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
40 minute time machine

1150
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
Send them back to

1151
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,095
Ancient Persia hand them off to a childless couple there and

1152
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:41,727
Go back in 20 years to check on how the modern kids doing being raised in the world

1153
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:48,639
And it'd probably be able to explain to you the logical common-sense moral rationale behind impaling people

1154
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,223
They might even explain to you that they enjoy watching it

1155
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
Times change of course but

1156
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,367
We human beings are an interesting species aren't we

1157
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,487
None-the-less is horrifying as all that sounds

1158
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,071
When you grade the Persians on a curve

1159
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,447
They still come out as a rather lenient people by the standards of the place and time

1160
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,799
The way that dries handles

1161
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:23,711
The many revolts and uprisings in the need to placate whole areas and put in new structures

1162
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,271
Choosing to keep fires from breaking out again

1163
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,831
Is a foreshadowing of what's to come

1164
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
It comes to the ability

1165
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,951
I'm disfigured araya's who will eventually be

1166
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
Be called the Great

1167
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
Is gifts though

1168
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,839
Our little bit unusual

1169
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
4

1170
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,959
The kings of Kings heads-of-state especially

1171
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,823
If in the Persian tradition where they're always thought to be like Warriors like Cyrus the Great these

1172
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:54,431
Little leaders on Horseback continually pushing the Empire the head of their troops

1173
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,991
Dries is a little bit more

1174
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Like a

1175
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
A white-collar worker like a desk job.

1176
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,439
Herodotus says the Persians

1177
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
Had a saying

1178
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,303
And he said that Cyrus was the father

1179
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
Can Pisces the tire

1180
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Andreas

1181
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
The shop

1182
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,591
Which if you believe what people like Herodotus of written about

1183
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,175
The Persians and a lot of aristocratic people have felt this way over time

1184
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,223
They sort of disdain

1185
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Des

1186
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
Rather

1187
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
A lower class by their standards things like mercantilism getting your hands dirty with money business,

1188
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Of course

1189
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,791
In the modern United States in much of the world

1190
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
Well that's maybe the most

1191
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,935
It highly thought of profession and in a way shopkeeper

1192
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
Which sounds a little like a

1193
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
Master ayaz

1194
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:56,639
If you think about the size of the shop to riots was running he was running Walmart

1195
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,503
And we don't call those people shopkeepers we call them CEOs

1196
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,063
And when you look at the riot that's what he looks like

1197
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,599
A modern CEO

1198
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,647
Which does make you wonder

1199
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,999
Again about how we get the job because he seemed so suited to it

1200
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:18,399
You can't help but think he's some sort of process of natural selection in which part of his cast mean we were only choose

1201
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
Oozing from the aristocracy

1202
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
But that's a heck of a bigger talent pool than trying to choose from

1203
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,311
Two sons of Cyrus

1204
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
Isn't that always the problem with monarchy right

1205
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Such a small talent pool to pick from in some countries you have to pick the oldest son and then there's no chance at all that's just a roll of the dice

1206
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
The rise may have been the most capable amongst

1207
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
You know the

1208
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,951
Nobility of Persia because he seems

1209
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,767
Exactly what the Empire needs this time

1210
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,143
He is overly concerned with money is sort of The Stereotype he thinks about profit

1211
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,447
And loss and he's an administrator

1212
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:58,335
And a person who organizes today we would think of him as a consultant who comes in and streamlines operations

1213
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:04,479
I mean he's credited for example with starting the sad traps in the satrapi's which probably isn't true

1214
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Probably didn't start it

1215
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,295
Organized

1216
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,855
The Empire instead of a lasting way

1217
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
He would handle things

1218
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,535
Sometimes in a very cut-throat manner sometimes in a very Innovative manner

1219
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,631
And another way Jenna in a very Deft manner with his options

1220
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:27,007
Clever is what they would say about him in some of the histories I've read when they wanted to be nice

1221
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,895
But that could swing over into conniving you know what when the pendulum move too far

1222
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Different directions

1223
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
You think about a guy like Steve Jobs Maybe

1224
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,879
Or some of those CEOs not the ones you just go collect a paycheck of the ones who get paid 123 million in

1225
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
Cotton house since I've been here

1226
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,463
You think about the people who really

1227
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:51,583
You have something to them Hugo okay I mean I like this guy or I may love this guy

1228
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:56,447
But you can see that there's some genius there and sometimes the genius is in things

1229
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
The maybe some kind of Monday Monday you know I mean

1230
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Strait of 1

1231
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,967
But when they're working their wonder sometimes

1232
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,063
The benefits are incredible and when you look at Jiraiya's and how he

1233
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,927
Took the Persian Empire essential you could call it a startup company at the beginning

1234
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,047
This is when it goes public and arises when it gets its first really high-level CEO

1235
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,143
Who takes it to the next level there's a lot that have to be done to make that happen

1236
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,959
A lot of people in the Empire might not have liked it very much

1237
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Which is another reason you have

1238
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:35,103
19 battles you have to fight sometimes to Quail all the fires that are springing up

1239
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,175
But the difference between the empire

1240
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,967
When this guy takes over

1241
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
And how he leaves it is profound

1242
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:46,623
There's a reason a guy comes out of nowhere in terms of his Royal lineage

1243
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,183
Ends up probably number two

1244
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
On the greatest

1245
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,255
Achaemenid Persian kings of all time

1246
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,583
Is a highly energetic highly competent

1247
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,375
Long-ruling

1248
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Figure

1249
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
Who becomes important

1250
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:06,591
In the story as far as westerners have been concerned for more than 2000 years

1251
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,687
Because he is the one that starts mixing it up with the Greeks

1252
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:16,575
And supposedly when I was growing up Western Civilization considered the Greeks the home team

1253
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
This story is kind of a

1254
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
Chance to highlight things

1255
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:26,303
From the visiting team's point of view in the battle for Western Civilization

1256
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,375
Of course as we point out early

1257
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:35,007
That's pretty hard to do when you were working mostly with the equivalent of the home team's newspapers

1258
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,871
And the way we structured the story is to just do

1259
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,015
Every King in the achaemenid Empire one after another in order a sort of the structure of the show but

1260
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,831
So far we've been dealing with kings that are so important

1261
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,111
And the sources

1262
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,415
Especially the hometown newspapers

1263
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
Western Civilization are so

1264
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
You're full of

1265
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,631
Things involving them that we've been able to go into the mid loving detail there will be whole kings that we will almost fast forward

1266
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:08,287
And it isn't because they didn't do anything is because if they didn't do anything to wear with the Greeks we don't know a lot about them

1267
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:15,455
You do have is mostly with archaeological evidence can show you and things like that so they will be kings that might have done a bunch of things

1268
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,271
Interesting over off in India are up in modern-day Afghanistan

1269
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,367
Theory around southern Egypt today who knows

1270
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,951
If the Greek sources didn't write about it sometimes we don't know about it then which case

1271
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,511
Some of these things are going to get short shrift indeed

1272
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,887
Cyrus can buy cedar isvs are some of the heavyweights in the achaemenid

1273
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,191
Empire and like a lot of Empires

1274
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,495
Their leadership is soda front-loaded

1275
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,823
Which is why it does so well for a while if you can tie

1276
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
Competent

1277
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
Oar inspired

1278
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:50,527
Leadership to in the Good Fortune of an Empire well at this point the Persian Empires on the upswing

1279
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
And Leadership is a large part of it

1280
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
And the rice is

1281
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:58,207
Perhaps in terms of a total competency overall maybe The Best Day Ever Had

1282
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,791
He concerns himself with the boring

1283
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
Side of government

1284
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,887
Things like a monetary policy

1285
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,959
He's very famous for example for instituting

1286
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
Maybe the first

1287
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,055
Metal coinage in the region outside of

1288
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,127
Lydia which is famous for having started metal coinage

1289
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
Certainly in that region

1290
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,783
The gold coins will be called Derek's after him

1291
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,343
Shackles will be the silver coin

1292
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
And the Persian

1293
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,743
Gold and mm the wealth of the Empire will become an absolutely

1294
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Hallmark Elementary

1295
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
They're known for having a lot of money

1296
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,887
And they use it

1297
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,567
And of course there's nothing using bribes and money is a foreign policy tool and all that sort of stuff nothing

1298
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
That that goes back

1299
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
Time immemorial

1300
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:53,247
And during the. We're talking about here maybe only the Chinese though

1301
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,551
Are doing it on a comparable level

1302
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,135
To what the achaemenid Persian Empire is doing

1303
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,999
And some of this plays into this CEO style of dries two things

1304
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,303
Truly weight on a profit-and-loss

1305
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,839
Criteria and if

1306
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
In a weekend

1307
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,215
Solve this military problem without having to fight a war let's do it that way

1308
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:21,919
He's concerned for exam you can tell he's considering like all Persian kings with the status of the office and protecting the reputation

1309
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
And all those kinds of things

1310
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,295
But you know I mean if there's something that comes up where we can talk about some sort of

1311
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,903
I totally closed minded their Empires that have come around

1312
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,231
Have much more of a machismo to them where we don't know

1313
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:40,095
What do you mean deal do what I say or else where is the Persians are kind of perennial

1314
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,631
Open for business

1315
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
If you will

1316
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,751
I like and let's be honest there could be some ritual ization to this what I like

1317
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,823
What dries himself has card

1318
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
On his

1319
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:56,735
He's buried on Mountainside eventually he'll have a carving so they've been know what he decided he wanted on his tomb

1320
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,783
Any emphasize food of the

1321
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,343
The thinking man's approach to running an Empire

1322
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,647
Psoriasis says quote

1323
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,719
I am not hot-tempered

1324
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:11,583
What things develop in my anger I hold firmly under control by my thinking power

1325
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,399
I am firmly ruled over my own impulses

1326
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,191
I have a strong body

1327
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,751
As a soldier I'm a good soldier

1328
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,311
I see who will rebell and who will not

1329
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
First I will think

1330
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Then I will I

1331
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
And quote

1332
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,551
There's an ancient line that money is the sinew of War

1333
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:38,975
And the Persians were not dominant militarily at everything and in the areas where they lack something

1334
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,559
The ability to come up with a ton of cash as needed

1335
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,191
Could compensate for a lot of those shortcomings and believe me a guy like the Rye has understood that better than anyone

1336
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,799
Historian Pierre brillant runs down

1337
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,359
Psoriasis qualities a bit and then

1338
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,895
Point out how

1339
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:01,503
How much of a change to. It's getting nausea rates in Persian history is

1340
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:06,879
He says in a chapter subheading entitled a new foundation for the empire

1341
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
Quote

1342
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,999
The ways and means adario secession to power

1343
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,559
To the extent that we can reconstruct them

1344
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,631
Our Testimony to the new Kings energy indecisiveness

1345
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,959
Urias was undeniably an exceptional personality

1346
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,775
But he also proved to have organizational ability

1347
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,127
During the same time that he was reorganizing the entire tribute system

1348
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,943
Other projects were carried out in various regions

1349
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
Construction of new capital

1350
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
The conquest of Samos

1351
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,831
Expeditions from the Indus to the Nile

1352
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:43,231
In the year 518 he also commissioned the satrap ariani's to gather Egyptian sages tackle

1353
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,791
Like the quote and quote Egyptian laws

1354
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:49,631
Other measures affecting Jerusalem were affected at the same time

1355
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
What is striking he writes

1356
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,751
Is the care with which the king plan for the long-term

1357
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
And quote

1358
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,359
And discussing the era that he inaugurates

1359
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
Do do his

1360
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Energetic efforts to

1361
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,527
Create a support system long-term for something

1362
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
Brianna rights quote

1363
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,183
Without in the least deprecating the work accomplished by his predecessors

1364
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,327
We made us a certain that the Advent of dries marks the foundation of a new Diagnostic and Imperial order

1365
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,727
In this regard the first years of his Reign definitely represented decisive. In history

1366
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
And quote

1367
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
One of the revisions to the

1368
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,383
Structure of things that dries works out

1369
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Is the succession

1370
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,991
We tried to create the conditions so that

1371
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,575
The way he came to power will never happen again

1372
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,463
One of the first things he did this is a traditional thing by the way to do after a coup

1373
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,863
For toppling middle of regime in the Middle East you want to marry into the previous royal family cuz remember this is all about some genetic

1374
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Blue blood

1375
01:16:54,143 --> 01:17:00,287
Even if it came as a bad guy or the regime is is is over throwable and it would be a good thing doesn't mean you don't

1376
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,103
Don't want that blue blood in your lineage you can go back to like

1377
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,479
You know pulling the sword out of the stone Type legendary beginning you want to have that in your bloodline

1378
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:14,367
Tareas takes care to marry two daughters of Cyrus the Great and his granddaughter

1379
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,951
Some of these the previous wives of Camp by Seas by the way

1380
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:24,607
So anyway I think it's like the Ford Motor Corporation and Henry Ford the big founder maybe he's like Cyrus the Great

1381
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
And then

1382
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,191
You know Henry Ford's son takes over the company

1383
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:32,031
Heaven by hooker by crook Colonel Mustard May intervene who knows

1384
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:38,431
All of a sudden you have this guy who wasn't in the family tree not the direct one anyway maybe a second cousin or something and

1385
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,503
He's running the Ford company and then all the sudden he marries

1386
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,319
You know the daughters and granddaughter of Henry Ford

1387
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,671
Maybe one of these was married to Henry Ford son who knows but eventually

1388
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:53,791
You know some guy from outside the direct line of the Ford family is running Ford Motor Company

1389
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
Here's the thing though

1390
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,631
He may not be a member of the Ford family

1391
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,423
But his kids will be

1392
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,239
So that's how you tie yourself back in the

1393
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,567
Early Royal Line statues

1394
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,407
No hide your tracks a little bit too in your building project historians

1395
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
I'm starting to think that they seem more and more

1396
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:16,575
That the entire lineage of Darius connecting him to the great Cyrus of old

1397
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,927
May have been sort of forged in Reverse reverse legitimacy as we called it earlier

1398
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,743
Once again smart

1399
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
Jiraiya's becomes the king

1400
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,679
That expands Persian Authority more to the east of the Empire which is

1401
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,751
Which is territory that because the Greeks didn't know much about

1402
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,383
You don't hear much about you know that it happens though because soon you'll have set traps in the East that are

1403
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Indian

1404
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:47,807
Essentially what what's now modern-day Pakistan is the part of India that the Persians conquered one way or another

1405
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:54,719
And as far as the ancient Greeks were concerned that was like the end of the known world I didn't know about anything maybe that existed past that that could

1406
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,255
Baby dragons unicorns

1407
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:01,119
Or no hostile barbarians as far as the eye could see maybe the Persians do but they weren't

1408
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,655
Telling Herodotus

1409
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
Dries will do some more conquests

1410
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,543
You know in northeastern

1411
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
Africa Empire goes from these

1412
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,271
Amazingness

1413
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
You know healthy growth rate with the Empire's expanding nicely thank you very much but not so fast that we can incorporate everything nice

1414
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,255
And absorb everything

1415
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:34,399
Appears to be the inevitable long-term outcome of things if you're looking at a map of this region

1416
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:38,239
Yunnan 515-514-5513 BCE

1417
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,287
Because the Persian Empire looks like

1418
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,359
You know the 1950s horror movie blob

1419
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,407
Slowly

1420
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,551
You know advancing in all directions and spreading out and just you know naturally absorbing everything on the fringes

1421
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,927
And while there are certainly natural limitations and Empire could run into

1422
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,999
Might reach the limits of communication for example

1423
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
Or run into climate

1424
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:08,191
And environmental things you can't deal with I mean I'm sure the Persian army this. Can defeat the Indian army in the Interiors of

1425
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:12,543
India but can you deal with the jungles in these snakes in the weather and all that

1426
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,640
Ask Alexander in a couple of hundred years how much of an impediment going to be

1427
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,968
Can you deal with Transportation questions

1428
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,576
Of course revolts are always a threat especially the larger you get

1429
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,672
But who's going to act as any kind of a military counterforce

1430
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
To the great king

1431
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
And the Persians as things stand

1432
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,096
You know around 5:15 5:14 BCE

1433
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Look at the map who's there

1434
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,704
There's no one to have World War 3 with

1435
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,752
The Chinese

1436
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:48,128
Play me a fun fantasy matchup with their on the other side of the world in their own little civilizational bubble

1437
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:52,992
If at all aware of the Persians simply probably through

1438
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,320
You know some traders who actually make the long journey but who knows

1439
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,880
So those armies aren't fighting

1440
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:05,024
So who is going to stop the blob from taking over literally everything until they reach their natural limits

1441
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,840
Well that's what makes this story so compelling

1442
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
That's what sets it up

1443
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,216
For the movie The Rocket is going to give you

1444
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,520
When he explains to you how

1445
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,104
You know this David will beat this Goliath

1446
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,664
How someone will stop the blob

1447
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,968
And by the way there by save everyone

1448
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,808
Like so many other people

1449
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,112
Who been interested in the Persian army

1450
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
Open this.

1451
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,208
I became interested in them because I was interested in the Greeks

1452
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:41,120
And the Persians are the Uber adversary the arch-nemesis right of the Greeks from the in a class

1453
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
Classical era

1454
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
After while

1455
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,008
Can you become a little curious about these people that

1456
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,872
You know the classical authors mostly portray but you know you even get this up until the modern time

1457
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,432
As soon as zombies Orcs

1458
01:21:54,944 --> 01:22:01,088
The only are formidable because of their numbers but their numbers are so huge that they're massively formidable

1459
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Regions of them

1460
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,672
The drink Rivers dry there are so many of them

1461
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,488
Can you become

1462
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
Kind of curious about these people

1463
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,632
You know once you get past these numbers after a while and once you get into it

1464
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,704
The Persians become so fascinating

1465
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,776
Because they're the final installment

1466
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,848
Of the ancient military system of the near East

1467
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,640
The final development

1468
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,040
And it doesn't really mean the Apex of its development because it's possible that that happened during the Syrian times

1469
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,856
But the last of the armies fielded

1470
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,672
On principles that were developed in Sumeria

1471
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,280
And nurtured by people like the Assyrians the Babylonians

1472
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,048
Fordham

1473
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:46,400
Characters to a 2500 year-old military tradition

1474
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
What historian Nigel tala says

1475
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:57,152
And once you get rid of the very large numbers at the classical authors give you turning them into Orcs

1476
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,736
You realize how good they must have been at what they did

1477
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
I mean if there weren't millions of them

1478
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,368
Look how nasty the smaller numbers of the more

1479
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,952
Look what they did look what they conquered

1480
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,120
If you believe the ancient authors here thinking well of course they conquered all of them there were millions of them swarmed over the Defenders

1481
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,680
If they weren't millions of them if they were

1482
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,984
Roughly equal numbers

1483
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:27,872
Then all of a sudden the fighting quality of these Persian armies which it always assumed to be relatively low

1484
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
It's increased

1485
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:36,320
Buy a lot and in the quality begins to look like the kind of quality you would have to have to win an Empire like this

1486
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
And hold it

1487
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:42,976
I told you in the first part of the story when we were talking about Cyrus the Great

1488
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:48,864
He was doing all these Conquest with his army we kept talking about his army but we couldn't really discuss what that Army was like

1489
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
Is it a really no

1490
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:55,008
The shame to cos that's an army worth knowing about right look what that did

1491
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,360
The by the time of Urias the Greatsword of the Mist

1492
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,640
Heart a little bit

1493
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,248
And give you a look into the military organization and the equipment and whatnot

1494
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,904
Of the achaemenid Persian Empire and I don't know if you could say it's the height of military development but they're still fighting it

1495
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Very high level

1496
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,768
They are a veteran Army that fight a lot

1497
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,840
So they have a lot of actual practical real-world experience

1498
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,520
And the Army is relatively unbeaten they have set back here or there sometimes but by and large

1499
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,568
Are the places they want to conquer they come

1500
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:35,712
Good luck they'll getting any agreement among the modern-day historians concerning

1501
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,504
Exactly how they did this

1502
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
Because just because they've

1503
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:45,440
You know done away with those crazy numbers from the ancient source is the 2 million men type things

1504
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,536
Doesn't mean that they figured out any better ones automatically that everyone agrees upon

1505
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:57,728
The numbers that the Persian armies brought to the battlefield not the entire number available to the Empire thing

1506
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:02,592
Mustard everybody but these battles that are famous that involved the Persian army how many men were there

1507
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,944
Will you see that it ranges from a low

1508
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,272
I would like 12 to 15,000 men

1509
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:15,392
And a high of like 250 or 300 thousand men

1510
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,208
You begin to see what huge difference

1511
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,072
Any of these different peoples have on how this Army operated just to give you one example

1512
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,864
It's well-known

1513
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,680
The dacor you would call them maybe guard

1514
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,984
Today existed in this Army

1515
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
10 to 12 thousand men strong

1516
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,128
Corporate the extra super Royal Guards

1517
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:41,248
And at these troops were Superior in general to most of the other troops on the body

1518
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,576
They were what you would call today regular

1519
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,856
They may have Benadryl

1520
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,904
Write the best troops in the army

1521
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,976
If your army is three hundred thousand men

1522
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:54,048
And 10 to 12 thousand of them are these guys

1523
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,960
Well you might not even be able to call them the tip of the spear in an army that large they may just be the king

1524
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,848
If on the other hand these armies are closer to twenty-five or thirty thousand men strong in reality

1525
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,200
Well then a guard of 10 to 12,000 regular drilled troops

1526
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:16,576
Is 1/3 to 1/2 your entire Army that's a huge difference in a much better Army

1527
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,880
So right there that would impact

1528
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,208
You know the impression of how these armies did what they did

1529
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
I will say

1530
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,840
That is a fan of the Persian army it's been wonderful over the last

1531
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
20-25 years

1532
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,912
To really see

1533
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,240
A more modern view of how the Army fought in was organized

1534
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Crystallize

1535
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:40,640
Very exciting and this could change by the way down the road I mean this is just the

1536
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
Latest interpretation of the evidence

1537
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,528
It should also be pointed out that when I talk about the Persian army

1538
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:51,136
This is an Empire that stretched over 200 years the Army will change and evolve

1539
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,928
And and become different

1540
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,232
You know from the start of the Empire to the end of the empire

1541
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,840
We are freeze framing a moment in time here but it's a moment that according

1542
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:04,704
To the Greek source is pretty much determined whether or not Western Civilization would continue

1543
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
So what's worth focusing on

1544
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
It's also worth focusing on because

1545
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,152
The majority of historians for more than 2000 years

1546
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,992
Pinpoint the reason that history went the way it did

1547
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:20,320
Down to a question of Weapons Systems

1548
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,880
On the battlefield and how they interacted

1549
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
Estranged is that sound by Nova

1550
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,720
Because we normally think of

1551
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:31,072
The things that impact history is being either massive soda forces like

1552
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:37,472
Industrialization mixing with colonization mixing with a newly unified a very nationalistic

1553
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
I want to see if you got the Boom

1554
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,568
Your history changing right

1555
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,872
Maybe it's the

1556
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:48,992
Extraordinary individual comes along at just the right time and we going to catch a few breaks here there

1557
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,296
Lumia djingis Khan or Julius Caesar

1558
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Oliver Cromwell

1559
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Tecumseh

1560
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,512
And most of the time obviously it's a combination of things

1561
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:07,680
Extraordinary individual showing up just at the time the colonization you know is going away is going in Germany needs its Place in the Sun

1562
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,240
Write all those things working together booty of historical moment

1563
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
Put another one of those areas

1564
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,128
We're history can turn

1565
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,992
She's almost banal by comparison but he can come down to the simple question of

1566
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
Weapons system

1567
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
It's on the battlefield

1568
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,112
Remember in this era were talking about

1569
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,648
The battlefield is like

1570
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,000
In a 2500 yard long maybe just on average

1571
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:37,632
And the decision Point happens in a couple of hours or an afternoon

1572
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,472
And it can be determined by something

1573
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:48,128
You know if you go back to weld the majority of historians even now probably but certainly the way Herodotus ought to a question

1574
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Something like

1575
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,712
Whether or not you're armed with a spear

1576
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,992
Horrible

1577
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,088
Or whether or not your weapon system includes a lot of body armor

1578
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,368
Or doesn't

1579
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
And if you think that's a little kooky

1580
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,744
Well if you think about

1581
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
One side having

1582
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
Firearms

1583
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,096
And the other side not

1584
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:13,216
You can see what a difference a weapon system differential could make to an outcome of a battle

1585
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:17,312
I don't have to convince you do I let the way battles and Wars turn out

1586
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,664
You have a huge impact on the way history goes right imagine if you lost the Second World War

1587
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
Some great many historians

1588
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,392
For more than 2000 years have boiled down to why things happen the way they happened

1589
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,440
2 question of how armies

1590
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:39,840
Interacting with each other Greek armies in Persian army so you have to understand the Persian army that's going to go into these conflicts with the Greek.

1591
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,120
Understand what happened

1592
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,912
If those historians are right

1593
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,728
The first thing to understand is that the Persian army

1594
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,824
In a 2-2 we ancient history wargamers and I know you're out there

1595
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,664
To watch this is the Army you get when you like a lot of Beaufort

1596
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,712
I mean like machine gun level both

1597
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:04,160
Buddy of mine once said that you could just directly justify giving every single person in the army during this time. Of Bowie

1598
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928
If you want to

1599
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,024
But how many arrows does it take

1600
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,816
To blot out the Sun

1601
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
During his

1602
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,216
Story of The Last Stand of the 300 Spartan

1603
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,776
Remember those Clint Eastwood types in bronze

1604
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:24,640
Herodotus tells a story of a local person who goes up to one of the Spartans and says

1605
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:29,760
You know that the Persian archers are so numerous that when they shoot their arrows they hide the Sun

1606
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Famous One

1607
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,184
Liner to comes back another bravado from the shore to die Spartan was something to the effect of

1608
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,720
To be great be

1609
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,256
Because then we can fight in the shade

1610
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
But it's indicative of what this

1611
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,400
Persian army was known for archery

1612
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:53,568
I need it hyperbole to suggest that they could blot out the sun with it

1613
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,896
Don't you wish you had video

1614
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,712
I wanted these ancient battle to get some idea

1615
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,784
What we're talking about here in the capabilities

1616
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,624
I've said many times that if I ever get that time machine I want to be

1617
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,512
Transported into a hot air balloon floating about a hundred feet over one of these ancient Battlefield so I can see

1618
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:18,656
You know what's going on I'll answer 100 questions in about a minute-and-a-half as soon as I can just visualize there's no video

1619
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,472
It'd be very gory and awful if there were

1620
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,800
But I look at it just to try to get a picture of what we're talking about here

1621
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:28,640
We haven't done this in so long nobody knows what it was like

1622
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,456
The same thing when I was studying

1623
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,504
Western sword fighting type

1624
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:37,088
Nobody knows that either everybody trying to recreate

1625
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,696
How people did Medieval sword fighting with a long story based on still

1626
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,256
Two-dimensional images from books

1627
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:50,656
Because no one kept alive the artform say the way the Japanese did with their sword fighting techniques right that the

1628
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,424
Alive and well

1629
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,960
But nobody knows for sure

1630
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,520
Even with some pretty darn good Recreations out there

1631
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,848
A western sword fighting did you don't do something for a while

1632
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
You don't have video of it yet

1633
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,688
You lose the ability to understand it totally

1634
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,248
Same thing with these ancient battles right

1635
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,344
Often times these ancient authors that you would use as your

1636
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,696
Your best pieces of evidence to explain and color eyes would it all look like

1637
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:18,560
Leave out the most important parts of the story cuz to them it's just known stop right

1638
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:24,960
Explain the most basic stuff to you everybody understands what happens when for example two blocks of human being

1639
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:29,824
Thousand

1640
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:36,736
Oh no I don't know what happened there and either do historians and if I was in my hot air balloon a hundred feet over the battlefield I would finally be able

1641
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Answer the question

1642
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:41,344
Do those blocks are human beings actually run into each other

1643
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:47,232
And go face-to-face tooth to tooth toe-to-toe in a claustrophobic horrible scrum

1644
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:52,352
You know where people are so cramped together they can hardly use their weapons in the people in the front row

1645
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:58,240
Are being squished to death by the people in the back and then pushed to their adversaries is that how it goes

1646
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,080
Or is it more like other historians have theorized

1647
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,384
We're at the last second there's something

1648
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:10,784
Inherent in human beings were they want for themselves on the weapons of their enemies and they stopped with a 4 and 8

1649
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
Gap

1650
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,648
Between the two blocks of human beings are no man's land

1651
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
If you will

1652
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:21,536
Were there stabbing and throwing stuff across the Gap in Champions

1653
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:25,376
Running out from each side and challenging each other in the no-man's-land in

1654
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:31,520
Other brave people are running across to the other side and grabbing somebody out of the ranks and pulling them back to their side is that how it was

1655
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
There's other historians who split the difference

1656
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:40,992
And say that the units run into each other for a second and then you know over the first minute and a half or two minutes or whatever slowly pulled

1657
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,528
Back from each other creating

1658
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
Dead space in the middle

1659
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:49,440
But nobody knows nobody knows if Cavalry will charge infantry or under what conditions

1660
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
I mean it's just stuff

1661
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:54,048
It's still debated by the experts because how would we know

1662
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:58,400
You could do some mathematics though if you're not terrible at math and I'm

1663
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,704
Not that good but I was able to handle

1664
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,496
Round numbers like this

1665
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,056
To try to get an idea certain capability

1666
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
One of the wonderful things

1667
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:12,224
About Ancient Warfare is that even if you can't know what it was like

1668
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
You can understand

1669
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:20,160
That there are certain realities to a physical laws if you will let's call it the physics of the battlefield in

1670
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
Pre gunpowder times

1671
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,232
There are limited by

1672
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,048
In a certain Bedrock elements that don't change

1673
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,584
Human beings for example

1674
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,936
Horses other flesh-and-blood creatures like camels and elephants that are often used in battle

1675
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:37,312
There's a limit to human endurance there's a limit to human morale there's a limit to muscle power

1676
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
And those sorts of

1677
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
Constraints

1678
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
We're operating

1679
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,992
In the armies of the Pharaoh in ancient Egypt

1680
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:51,136
All the way to the armies of Richard II the lionheart you know in the holy land during the Crusades

1681
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,696
There's something about

1682
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:57,536
In a battle over the air is until gunpowder takes over

1683
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,864
We're commanders from different eras could have commanded armies

1684
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,912
From other areas and not been

1685
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,448
2 deep out of the water

1686
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,728
For them to understand

1687
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,544
You know what they were dealing with custard and elements didn't change

1688
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
When you're talking about

1689
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:16,480
The sorts of armies that these great States through against each other they generally included

1690
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:22,368
You know close-order infantry as a sort of the rock around which you built your arm

1691
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,184
The battle line you would say in some.

1692
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,512
A good estimate for a

1693
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:35,168
Traditional set-piece battle with a Persian army might be a 2500 or 3000 yard or meter

1694
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:39,264
Think about unicorn T5 or 30 football fields long

1695
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
And

1696
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,128
A solid line of man across a ton of that space

1697
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:50,784
The battle line was generally makeup maybe if you wanted to just get it off the top of your head estimate a 7275

1698
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,600
Avi charmi side is made up of these

1699
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,880
Phalanx has

1700
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:58,720
Units of men patch shoulder-to-shoulder next to each other

1701
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,584
And keeping that pack nature things staying together and then multiple ranks behind

1702
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,728
The rank death changed and if you had four ranks behind you that's pretty shallow formation

1703
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,776
In the Hellenistic period

1704
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,104
You'll get some Hellenistic Phalanx is little go 72 Mandeep

1705
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:20,992
The armies of this periods near East tended to be organized a simile

1706
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,296
So the smallest unit would be 10 men

1707
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:27,904
Turn up to a hundred and a thousand were told the Persians had 10,000 man units

1708
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:36,608
The Tweak that the Persians are supposed to have made Modern historians think to the age-old formations of the Assyrians in the Bible

1709
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:41,728
Have to do with how many ranks of archers they have versus how many ranks of Spearman

1710
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:47,104
Story Nigel chalice is one of many who points out that the Assyrians thought and the Babylonians

1711
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
Copied them

1712
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,432
That you needed to have half of your

1713
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,992
Units ready for hand-to-hand combat

1714
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,296
And the other half could be armed with missile weapon

1715
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,648
That's what they would do is pack the front half of the unit with the Spearman

1716
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
It was a big spear heavy

1717
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Big Shield

1718
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,792
How many if you could an armored if you could

1719
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,352
And so if you had a formation that was

1720
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:14,752
8-ranked deep the first four in the Syrian Army would use to get a hand-to-hand combat guys the rear for The Archers

1721
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,056
And The Archers would shoot over the head of the Spearman

1722
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
Pretty very flexible formation

1723
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:23,968
Any enemy that won't come to grips with you you can strike from a distance

1724
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,368
Any enemy you want to advance on and close with you can weaken before your spearmint have to engage in hand-to-hand combat

1725
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:33,184
Anyone who just sits there you can shoot for a while

1726
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:36,256
And anyone who comes at your unit

1727
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,864
You can kill on the way in making an easier job for your spearmint when they finally get to you

1728
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:49,568
Historians think that the Persians tweaked that formation by taking out most of the ranks of close-order Infantry

1729
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Spearman

1730
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:54,432
And replacing them with archers often archers with little or no armor

1731
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
I know she'll

1732
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
Most of these Persian units

1733
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:03,136
Are going to have a front rank of Speer armed

1734
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,160
Shielded

1735
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,208
Often armor but not always

1736
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,280
Infantry that protect the archers behind them

1737
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:15,680
They have a shield that's made of wicker but that looks like a boogie board for you Americans of almost a man size

1738
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,728
Size tall wicker plant

1739
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,776
Hot Square

1740
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,688
And it looks like when all the front rank decided to close together those things are going to fit together like a perfect wall

1741
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:33,088
Imagine in a 70 to 75% of your 2500 to 3000 yard front

1742
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,648
Has a wall of wicker

1743
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,952
Shields in front of it protecting

1744
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,256
New your archers from any missile fire back

1745
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:45,888
But your Rogers AR shooting over the heads of the troop and just blowing people away so I did some calculations

1746
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,216
Assuming loan numbers

1747
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,240
And every step

1748
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:54,848
Imagine of 50,000 man Persian army which would be alone number believe it or not

1749
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,640
Imagine that

1750
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:02,528
In that battle line that the Persians have probably increased the Firepower over Syrian versions by

1751
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
In a 20 or 30% more

1752
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:08,672
Imagine that twenty thousand archers are in that main battle line

1753
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,768
Each Archer fires about Five Arrows a minute

1754
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,888
And their Quivers carry 120 but just for the sake of argument will say that they're not

1755
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
I will give them all a hundred arrows each

1756
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,520
That means that across that battle line

1757
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:27,872
When these troops were sitting behind the wall of wicker Shields are shooting

1758
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,408
If shooting a hundred

1759
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,200
Thousand arrows a minute

1760
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,248
From the main battle line

1761
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,320
Distance of about

1762
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,368
200 yards in front of the

1763
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,928
Army beyond that they can shoot

1764
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,256
But effective range is 175 to 200 yards

1765
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,840
They can keep up this fire

1766
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:50,656
For as long as their muscles will hold out or

1767
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:55,264
Until their arrows run out which at that rate would be after about 20 minutes of shooting

1768
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,080
And after 20 minutes of shooting they would have fired

1769
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,360
2 million arrows

1770
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
Now

1771
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,248
Infantry with armor

1772
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,296
Might be able to withstand that

1773
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,624
But if you run a horse in front of that crowd

1774
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Your dad

1775
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,952
Pure driving a chariot

1776
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:19,072
You're gone you don't get anywhere near the battle line right you're blowing away at a distance

1777
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:26,496
That's a great sort of military change that they made over the Assyrians if you're fighting the kind of enemies

1778
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,568
Improve those Assyrian formations

1779
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,616
Unless of course enemy

1780
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,920
Hand to hand combat troops

1781
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,712
Finally get to you

1782
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,272
Here's the way historian Nigel Talent talks about

1783
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:42,880
You know this change the Persians did the Tweet the traditional Assyrian formation quote

1784
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:49,792
It is likely that the battle array of this kind would be highly effective when facing the large mounted forces no

1785
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,864
At least the second millennium BC

1786
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,936
The horse is a large and vulnerable Target for archery

1787
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,496
Well equipped infantry is less vulnerable

1788
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,032
As the Persians worded discover

1789
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:06,688
It is probable that achaemenid formations follow the elamites tradition of maximizing the number of archers in the in

1790
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:07,456
Infantry units

1791
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:13,088
Unlike the Assyrians who seem to have maintained a 50/50 ratio of archers to shielded Spearman

1792
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
And quote

1793
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:20,256
I know it's tempting to think of all this as minutiae right war game

1794
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:24,096
But if the majority of historians are more than two Millennia are right

1795
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:29,472
This is the kind of minutiae that determines why these battles were about to go the way they do

1796
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
Now

1797
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:36,896
Whereas the majority of the Persians in this time. Or going to be in that battle line we just talked about

1798
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,712
You're also going to have some Cavalry in the Persian take brake caliper

1799
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
I've often thought of the Persian army in this period

1800
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,832
As a moor

1801
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
For lack of a better word

1802
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,720
Barbara raised version of the Assyrian army at its height

1803
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,816
They often compared to like ancient Rome if you look at the Roman Empire at their height

1804
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,376
It's so tempting to see them almost as like

1805
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:04,032
The Nazi Germany are aware they're all marching in almost lockstep goose-step formation with intricate precision

1806
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,824
Immaculate drill

1807
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,408
You know everybody's sleeping in the barracks everyone professional in the whole thing

1808
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,552
And then I think of the Roman Empire a couple hundred years later where the Army is lost

1809
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
Some of that

1810
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
Spit in Polish

1811
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,952
And instead of having everybody or the majority of troops you know what the top being Roman you have

1812
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:22,976
You know some

1813
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,256
Barbarian

1814
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,560
Call them tribal peoples more

1815
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:30,656
Aristocratic I mean hands delbrook calls the Persians

1816
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,472
From this. The calvary Knights

1817
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
So imagine

1818
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:39,104
You are more barbarize version of the Roman Empire's Army

1819
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,384
With Norman's

1820
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:46,016
And maybe that's a little like what the Persians are I think the Persians could give the Assyrians a run for their money but they're

1821
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,064
There's not as much spit in Polish

1822
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,344
And there is more

1823
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,648
Aristocratic tribal nobility

1824
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,720
But the Cavalry can fight like hell and there's a lot of them

1825
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:00,864
They fight a little bit like these Gideon's in the Huns in the Mongols and those people that shoot you

1826
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,936
In a from a distance in small units with bows

1827
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:07,520
Generally thought that the big unit of Cavalry would go over

1828
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,056
2 near where it wants to attack

1829
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:13,664
Stay at a distance and then send out subunits smaller Squadron

1830
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,784
Food then go up to where they want to attack unleash all their javelins and arrows until they're out

1831
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:23,648
Right back to the main body and then another smaller Squadron comes and repeat the process until

1832
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:26,976
The unit that they're firing at begins to get all disorganized

1833
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,024
Or their morale brakes

1834
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,816
Or they become so weekend

1835
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
That there

1836
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
Easy prey for the

1837
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:39,776
Persian infantry once they run out of their 2000000 missiles or however many it is to come in mop-up

1838
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
And of course once an army broke

1839
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,384
Starting to run away

1840
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,456
All that Persian Cavalry becomes absolutely leaf

1841
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
They do nothing better

1842
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,064
Cow breathing running down fleeing

1843
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
Rotting fruit

1844
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,184
How does Calvary was one of the most feared elements

1845
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,512
Of the Persian army and it worked in conjunction with the Infantry in fact

1846
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:04,096
It's tempting to make a case that the Persians might have rationalized

1847
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:08,704
Getting rid of all those close combat troops and replacing them with archers by suggesting that

1848
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,824
Their overwhelming calorie could make up for the difference and their battle system required

1849
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:20,480
Combining what's a Cavalry was probably doing on the flash with what the Infantry was doing in front and close cooperation with created

1850
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,272
Lethal combined-arms

1851
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,808
Reproach

1852
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576
Wentworth

1853
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:29,440
The Persians also had those guard units we talked about they were called The Immortals

1854
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,000
Also called the attendance of the attendees

1855
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,536
Probably armored

1856
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:38,400
May have fought in a similar way to the rest of the normal troops but just at a higher quality level

1857
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:44,800
Also the Persians use mercenaries and hired them more and more by the way as the Empire went on

1858
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
And lastly

1859
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
The Empire could Levy

1860
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,272
Troops from its own Empire which is what it did with the main Force the main forces are Persian and Madeon and elamites

1861
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:58,880
And the troops from the center of the Empire but they had all these provinces stretching from

1862
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,928
Modern-day Pakistan

1863
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:06,816
Two modern-day Libya up all the way to Afghanistan and down all the way to like practically Saudi Arabia

1864
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:10,656
The huge territory naked Levy troops or the entire thing

1865
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,216
And when you read your Herodotus by the way

1866
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:19,616
He says that at least nominal units from all those different people

1867
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:24,992
And Herodotus runs down more than 40 of them you know when he runs down the Persian army

1868
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:30,880
Seattle these people we just talked about then you have all the Exotic people from the periphery of the Persian Empire

1869
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,160
Herodotus

1870
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,720
Talked about the Indian troops that are in the army

1871
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:41,120
He talks about the troops or Africa who will paint half their body white and have their body red and tip their Spears with antelope

1872
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,424
P*** black troops are modern-day

1873
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,448
Sudan

1874
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:51,360
You talk about what he calls the black Ethiopians from India which modern historians think you're probably dravidians because they are

1875
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,920
They're dark but they have straight hair and horsehair helmets

1876
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,480
I mean it's a wonderful exotic list and historians think

1877
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,784
Depart of what the Persians were doing

1878
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,392
Is showing the flag a little bit to these people that they were fighting basically saying

1879
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,184
Look at the rec

1880
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:11,840
And scope of the people we can draw from this is how big our Empire is that we Encompass all these groups in your singing just a small

1881
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:15,168
Small number of them imagine how many are back at home that we could call on

1882
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,448
If we needed them

1883
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,264
Historians are unsure

1884
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,288
How much does

1885
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,360
Troops played a role in a typical set-piece battle

1886
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,664
But it just kind of shows the

1887
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,712
Width and breadth of the

1888
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,480
Persian

1889
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,040
King of Kings ability to call on troops

1890
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:36,928
And sometimes because of your specific skill you know I need this done call of the Ethiopians

1891
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,976
Mean for example.

1892
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,560
In a Persian get the greatest Navy in the world like overnight

1893
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,376
When they take over the Phoenician cities

1894
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,656
They're on the coast

1895
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,008
They essentially I would say subcontract but there's no

1896
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,800
Choice in the deal it's like

1897
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:58,688
You know the CEO Darius of Persia core announces the acquisition of The Phoenician Navy

1898
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,760
And now the Phoenician Navy is a division of Persian War

1899
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,296
Something like that

1900
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,880
But that's how they are with everything right we take over the local institutions

1901
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:13,280
And we let you do things your way as much as possible I mean part of the fun of of running a Persian Army in ancient

1902
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:15,328
Was it all these troops got to fight

1903
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,912
In their own local Style again that was sort of a subsidiary

1904
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,984
Of the Persians letting you do things your way it kind of go up to you

1905
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,544
According to the way we used to think anyway and say

1906
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:30,176
What is it to do while while we're very good at spear-throwing okay why don't you do that for us

1907
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,736
You'll be just like the Phoenicians maybe they're really good on the water

1908
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,040
According to

1909
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:40,672
History of lies and b-list the Persian army is real strong point and they're also it Above the Tie

1910
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:47,840
He lists intelligence as something they do wonderfully you know reconnaissant sending out diplomats and spies

1911
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:52,960
And Merchants who report back and they usually know quite a bit about the territories around them

1912
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:59,360
Besides diplomatic Warfare as his number two thing that he says the Persians have a huge advantage in

1913
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:04,736
As we've been saying that kind of always ready to make a deal measure the profit loss and all that kind of thing

1914
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,040
And if you weren't so willing to make a deal

1915
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:11,392
You know when the Persian army was a long way way they send diplomats with the army so that

1916
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:15,488
They just check back with you to make sure you're sure on that deal decision

1917
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,096
You know when they have 3050 a hundred thousand men with them armed

1918
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
Abilene

1919
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:28,544
Ivan B says meticulous planning was one of your strong suits in a you would think that is inheritors of the whole mess

1920
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,568
Tradition

1921
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,432
Greatest record-keepers in the Ancient World ride the Babylonians and Sumerians and all those people

1922
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:37,760
You think that you inherited the ability that

1923
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:41,344
Can handle that sort of thing will keep your records keep your books and

1924
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,880
Be organized

1925
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:47,488
But that actually played into how far away from the Homeland you could move your armies

1926
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:52,864
Because if you weren't a meticulous planner those armies starve when they get a certain distance away

1927
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:57,728
Every Army is constrained by sort of a range of motion by how well you can supply it

1928
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:02,336
And this year fact that what we call the greek and Persian Wars will happen in Greece

1929
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:06,176
Shows you in a how good the person planning was

1930
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,992
Make a projector power along way

1931
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:16,416
And finally laughing B says that they had an engineering expertise that he says was quote of a high order and

1932
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,464
Basically

1933
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
The Greeks were

1934
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:24,864
Blown Away by the Persian ability to bridge rivers to dig canals

1935
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:30,240
To knock down walls in this is really cute when you think about it we've been comparing the Persian

1936
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:37,152
You know approach and conquest of territory and expansion to The Blob

1937
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Lava

1938
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:42,528
They just kind of you know when they have to reconquer territories they just so to go in there

1939
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:48,928
And one after another slowly but surely knocked down reliably knock down the walls of the city take it

1940
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,464
Yuan to the next city

1941
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:53,536
It is a very business-like approach to the whole thing

1942
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:56,352
And if you weren't good at that

1943
01:49:56,608 --> 01:50:01,216
You would've been able to do with the Persians did too many cities had walls and that was such a huge part of

1944
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:01,984
Conquest

1945
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,848
As I said before I would love to see what this all

1946
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:10,432
Look like actually in battle actually go watch by the way

1947
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:16,832
You know some of the worst riots you've ever seen that are on the internet and everything because you'll see often times police

1948
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:19,136
Who have big field that are like the Romans

1949
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:24,000
And it kind of packed into formations and you'll see the Riders on the other side and flinging things and

1950
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:27,584
An attacking sometimes and sometimes Cavalry comes into what you think yourself okay

1951
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:34,240
It is not really apples and apples at all but they're certain we get back to the physics of the battlefield element

1952
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:41,408
It make me think okay maybe this is a little what it's like look at how those two bodies of people move when they get close to each other what happens when a horse

1953
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,432
Cinders the picture

1954
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:45,504
I mean maybe you can just get the tiniest taste of what the physics

1955
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
A bottle

1956
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,160
Did everybody up until the time. The gunpowder took over would have known instinctively

1957
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,696
What's your experience

1958
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,000
Worship leader common knowledge

1959
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:00,864
According to ancient Greek authors the Greeks had especially before

1960
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,912
You know the big tangle happened

1961
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,728
A healthy respect a very healthy respect

1962
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:08,544
For the great Kings armies and capabilities

1963
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872
As we said

1964
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,944
Up until this time this is an army that basically win

1965
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:21,856
But then sometime between 5:15 and 5:10 BCE

1966
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,696
Jiraiya's decides to give this Army one of those tests

1967
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:30,816
That are so difficult it would be a surprise if they didn't fail

1968
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,168
Many great armies over history of fail a similar test by the way

1969
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,216
He decides to go invade

1970
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,752
The land

1971
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,032
Occupied

1972
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,080
Are the Central Asian nomads

1973
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,408
And becomes just another one of those

1974
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,200
Little leaders over time

1975
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:53,600
Who found out the people who live on the wide-open expenses of the steppe weather in ancient time

1976
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,880
Or

1977
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:57,952
20th century versions of them

1978
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:02,048
Have the option of Simply retreating into the interior

1979
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,584
And then you have to follow them

1980
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,888
Ask Napoleon how well that can work

1981
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:12,544
And that was in an era by the way Napoleon's time when there were cities and things that could be burned down and taken

1982
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,872
The secret weapon of these people to rise tries to conquer

1983
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,664
Is it there's nothing to conquer

1984
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:24,064
The Nomad there are no cities there are no Urban centers and how do you with your fantastic Army deal with them

1985
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,368
Is there strategy to deal with you

1986
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:32,512
It's just simply retreat in front of you and keep going and going and going while your supply lines get longer and longer and longer

1987
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,536
Cuz guess what

1988
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,816
You aren't

1989
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,632
Central Asian tribal nomadic horse archers

1990
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:44,032
And you can't just apply a huge Army whatever that means with lots of infantry and horses and camels and all sorts of

1991
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,824
The things endlessly

1992
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,640
On a wild goose chase or in this case

1993
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,688
Awhile Centaur Chase

1994
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:57,600
Now there are two reasons why this gets a ton of historical attention because dries it actually had to quell a revolt against

1995
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,160
Central Asian people right when he came to power

1996
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,208
Biscuits a ton of attention though

1997
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,048
Herodotus makes it a key scene

1998
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,864
In his narrative so when he's giving his performance

1999
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:12,192
And another opportunity to emphasize the wonderful

2000
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:17,312
Colorful nature of the Skitty into one of his favorite subjects and let's be honest one of mine too

2001
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:23,712
Cuz if you're trying to entertain people these people are the color brilliant historical color and fearsome

2002
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,504
Full of all sorts of exotic customs

2003
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,808
They play the same role

2004
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:32,416
His story that Native Americans play in the old dime novel westerns right

2005
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:38,048
And there's a similar feel by the way mean Americans would recognize a lot of the same things

2006
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,144
Because tribal people share certain qualities in the same way for example

2007
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:48,800
That tribes would band together in the confederations in the Americas and we've always considered them fairly or otherwise to be

2008
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:55,456
The next level in state development when you go from Individual tribes confederacy's banding together into Super tribe

2009
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:57,504
I would like the Iroquois Confederation

2010
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,552
Well they did this in

2011
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:05,952
This entire world of the Central Asian Nomads and so the tribes that we actually know the names of our infect confederations of

2012
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:06,720
Many tribes

2013
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,304
And it's a hard enough Army to try to deal with

2014
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:15,424
When the Central Asian the Barbarian nomadic people from the step that's the traditional

2015
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,728
We would say today probably racist

2016
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:24,384
A culturally need is Centerfield they can move the million name to describe how the Herodotus is views of The Barbarians are

2017
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:29,760
But it's one thing to try to deal with them when they break into your territory that's hard enough

2018
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,576
Trying to deal with them in their territory

2019
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:35,136
Let's put it this way won't be too long

2020
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:40,768
You're down in the history where makedonian armies from the. Of Alexander the Great or leaving their bones

2021
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,376
You know on these desolate steps trying to chase down these armies of

2022
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,400
Horse Snowman

2023
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,984
In Herodotus a story there a wonderful scene

2024
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:55,616
Your course makes it a personal thing you put dialogue in people's mouth

2025
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,176
Ascidians you know

2026
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:01,504
Play the djingis Khan role in this story they are

2027
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,832
A combination of merciless and menacing

2028
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:08,672
And by the way now if you look at a map showing

2029
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:13,536
You know the route that dries Tookie crosses that little strip of water that separates

2030
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,096
Europe from Asia yunnan modern-day turkey

2031
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:19,680
Becoming an Invader now from the ancient near East

2032
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,728
Stepping foot on European soil

2033
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
And it moves through

2034
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,384
You know the area east of modern-day Romania and up into the southern Ukrainian area

2035
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:32,480
I mean it's an enormously long Rock Co

2036
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,320
Whatever there might be

2037
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:40,160
In an attempt to somehow bring these people to battle

2038
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,464
But they won't stop running

2039
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,792
Herodotus in his account rights quote

2040
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:51,680
Does there seem to be no end of this Pursuit which is going on for a long time

2041
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,240

2042
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,288
King of the Skippy and would this message

2043
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,408
You extraordinary man why do you keep Fleet when you could certainly do otherwise

2044
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:07,296
If you think you were able to challenge my power then stop your wandering and stand to fight it out

2045
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,696
Or if you acknowledge that you are too weak for that course then you should stop running away bring gifts of Earth and

2046
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,976
Water to your master

2047
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,768
And enter into negotiations

2048
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:18,816
And

2049
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,680
Sounds like a civilized kingly approach right

2050
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,216
Let's settle this here in now

2051
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,800
But that's not how they did business on the Central Asian steppes

2052
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,080
Andronicus

2053
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,360
As the reply

2054
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,152
From the very scary

2055
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,944
In a barbarian

2056
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,760
Central Asian tribal leader

2057
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
Direct quote

2058
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:43,648
To this I didn't king of this Gideon's responded

2059
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,952
This is my situation Persian

2060
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,024
I've never get blood from anyone out of fear before

2061
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,816
And I'm not fleeing from you now

2062
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:55,424
What I have been doing is in fact no different from what I'm accustomed to do in times of peace

2063
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,240
I'll tell you why I do not engage you now

2064
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:03,872
It is because we have no other towns nor cultivated land to worry about being captured or raised

2065
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:06,688
Which might induce us to engage you in battle sooner

2066
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:12,832
But if you really must come to battle without further delay know that we do have ancestral Graves

2067
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,368
So come on

2068
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,416
Find them and try to destroy them

2069
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:18,976
And you will know whether or not we shall fight for the grave

2070
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,512
But before that

2071
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:24,096
We shall not engage you in battle if we see fit to do so

2072
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,656
Ethan says quote

2073
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:32,288
Instead of gifts of earth and water I shall send you the kind of tokens you really married

2074
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:35,360
And in response to your claim to be my master

2075
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
I tell you

2076
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,152
Wheat

2077
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,712
That is your answer from the Skitty in

2078
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:40,992
And quote

2079
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:42,528
Week

2080
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,392
That's a great scene in a movie isn't it

2081
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,440
So is this one that's recalled by

2082
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,744
Historian made Ave

2083
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
Quote

2084
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:58,400
The security and risk a decisive

2085
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:01,984
They therefore resorting to their beloved scorched-earth tact

2086
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,520
They retreated

2087
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:07,616
Taking with them their livestock burning the grass and feeling in the waterpik

2088
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,896
In addition

2089
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:13,504
To get the in Cavalry repeatedly attacked and destroyed small Persian hunting parties

2090
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:19,648
The Persians were worn out by their protracted pursuit of the Skippy in the deep into their own territory

2091
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,720
When the riots was looking for a way out of this predicament

2092
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:27,584
The Skippy and leaders in response to his demand that they would either come out for an open bottle

2093
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,376
Or submit voluntarily

2094
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,424
Send a messenger to the Persian camp

2095
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,496
Subsequently if Herodotus is to be believed

2096
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,056
Urias was presented by the messenger

2097
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,848
With a bird a mouse

2098
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,640
A frog and Five Arrows

2099
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:44,480
Jiraiya thought that the Scorpions dust announce their submission

2100
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,272
Cabrillas however

2101
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,832
One of the seven conspirators against murder

2102
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:49,600
Bardia

2103
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,904
Gave a completely different explanation

2104
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,976
If a person could not fly in the sky like birds

2105
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:57,280
Could not burrow into the ground

2106
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,584
Or jump into the Lakes like frogs

2107
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,632
Then they should expect to die by Arrow

2108
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,168
And quote

2109
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:09,824
There's a lot of different ways to interpret this generally it's always been considered to be some kind of a

2110
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,664
Lost in the Persians come struggling back to Asia lucky to make it over

2111
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:16,224
The bridge of boats held by Greeks

2112
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:21,600
The modern-day historians look at this number different ways one of which is

2113
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,880
These leaders

2114
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:27,488
People who are descended from steppe tribes themselves dealt with them all the time

2115
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,768
Knew that you couldn't

2116
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:34,400
Capture them or force them into battle and so in effect what they were doing was something like what the Chinese did

2117
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:39,520
For Millennia to try to control the people on their border sometimes you have to just punch it.

2118
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,104
Just launched a raid essentially with a huge Army

2119
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:46,944
Go smack them around sometimes you can depose their leaders and put in

2120
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,992
A client King cuz is

2121
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:55,648
Condemning your points out you can't actually in a put a Persian ruler like a sad trap to rule over the

2122
01:59:55,904 --> 02:00:00,768
Tribal people they won't they have to have a tribal Chieftain or something like that but you can

2123
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:01,792
Pam pick that.

2124
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,936
So another words might have just punched these tribes exactly how he wanted to

2125
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:14,848
Historians point out in which case you almost have to look at this as a victory that when King derailleurs comes home

2126
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:18,176
Supposedly struggling with this Gideon's close on his heels

2127
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
He leaves a general

2128
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,016
In frase

2129
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,808
Traces in the modern-day Balkan

2130
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
And this General's orders

2131
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,928
Are they continue the conquest

2132
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,976
And subject that entire area

2133
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:33,024
Entire area

2134
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,584
Is Europe north of Greece

2135
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,144
The northern part of the Black Sea

2136
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,680
A place where

2137
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:44,288
Cities like Athens depend on grain shipments that all of a sudden

2138
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,848
Are threatened by an army

2139
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:51,968
Whose capital is located in modern-day Iran

2140
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,528
But these Persians are in

2141
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,552
The Balkans

2142
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:58,880
This is the setup

2143
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,928
For what's about to happen

2144
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,232
And what's about to happen

2145
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,280
Kicks off of the revolt

2146
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,072
In cities that are

2147
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,352
In modern-day turkey

2148
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,632
Greek City

2149
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,216
But cities that were under Persian domination at this time

2150
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,032
Many of these cities

2151
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:22,688
You know we're going to province of Nina what's now modern-day turkey Asia Minor called Ionia so they're called I own

2152
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:23,456
In Greek

2153
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:26,016
And this Revolt is called the ionian revolt

2154
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
A logo for like

2155
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,112
499 to like 490

2156
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,648
3 BCE

2157
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,792
The Greeks were great colonizers ahead cities all over the Mediterranean

2158
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:41,120
The coast of turkey on the Aegean like these cities

2159
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
And they had

2160
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,960
Many of the islands in that whole region were Greek

2161
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:49,824
They had colonies on the North African Coast they had

2162
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,640
One outside of Egypt they had

2163
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:56,992
Mini on Sicily they had some in Italy

2164
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,016
These are great

2165
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Can you colonize

2166
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,624
And so they have cousins all over the Mediterranean

2167
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:09,280
And it is to the mainland Greece at the ionians go for help after they were ballon realized

2168
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,560
And we're screwed

2169
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,096
If we don't get some help here

2170
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:16,960
When terrible terrible trouble is one of the leaders of this revolt

2171
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:21,312
Back to Mainland Greece to essentially make a pitch like a business proposition

2172
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:23,872
I know this whole show as a sort of

2173
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,200
Corporate business feel but this is the way Herodotus portrays it

2174
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,272
He actually has this guy going here would like a PowerPoint

2175
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:32,320
Presentation first of the Spartans

2176
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:36,928
And has him acting as a clever businessman to try to sell

2177
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,952
Sparta

2178
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:41,024
On Intervention in their revolt against the Persians

2179
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:43,584
When is Mardi gra parts of Herodotus

2180
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,352
Where

2181
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:47,680
Essentially he has the story of aristagoras first going to

2182
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,472
King cleomenes

2183
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,800
Spartans remember the Spartans had two of them

2184
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:53,824
In this case

2185
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,896
Aristagoras goes in there with his

2186
02:02:57,152 --> 02:03:00,992
Bronze tablet so you think of Uriel laptop PowerPoint presentation

2187
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:06,112
And he sits down with the Spartan King and he starts giving them the rundown of all the good things you'll get

2188
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,160
If you invest in this

2189
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:10,208
You know ionian Revolt idea

2190
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,744
That I have here for you today

2191
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,328
This is for my Purvis translation

2192
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:17,120
He translate that he should buy the

2193
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,144
Greek

2194
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,936
As Helene's

2195
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,776
So when we say Helens we mean when we say like a demonias we mean Spartan

2196
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:24,544
Misquote

2197
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,872
According to the account of a lack of daemonium

2198
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:32,480
What do you want to talk with cleomenes aristagoras had with him a bronze tablet

2199
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:35,296
How much a map of the entire world was engraved

2200
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,600
Including all rivers in every sea

2201
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:40,672
To begin the discussion aristagoras dead

2202
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:46,048
Cleomenes do not be surprised at my urgency in coming here for this is how matters stand

2203
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:50,400
That the sons of the ionian their slaves instead of free men is a disgrace

2204
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,192
And the most painful language

2205
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,984
But also to you

2206
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:57,568
Especially of all the others and as much as you were the leaders of Hellas

2207
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,872
So now by the gods of the hellions

2208
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:04,736
They were the same blood as you after all

2209
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:07,040
This will be easy for you to accomplish

2210
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,088
Since the barbarians are not valid

2211
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,160
Why you've attained the highest degree of excellence in war

2212
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:17,280
They fight with bows and short Spears wearing trousers and turbans on their head

2213
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,816
Easily subdued

2214
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:24,448
Further the inhabitants of that continent possess more good things that all the other people of the world put together

2215
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,520
To begin with they have gold as well as silver

2216
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,312
Colorful clothing

2217
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:34,176
Beast of Burden enslave all of which could be yours if you really desire them

2218
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
And quote

2219
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:43,136
He then runs down every territory that the Persians have at least the ones Herodotus knows about

2220
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,184
And with each one he says what it has

2221
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,000
This one had a lot of gold and silver

2222
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:51,584
This one has a lot of cattle in this one have a lot of slaves in other words

2223
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,888
And he's running down the benefits right of this

2224
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,680
Business proposition of his

2225
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:58,752
Leader of Sparta says

2226
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:02,592
All right go away let me think about this for a couple of days I'll come back and give you my answer okay

2227
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,360
He comes back

2228
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:07,200
And he asks a simple question of this aristagoras guy

2229
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:09,504
He's just so how far is it

2230
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,552
From where we are now

2231
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:17,440
To where this king is wants to know how far it is to the Persian Capital how far do I have to go to win this war that you're trying to sell me on

2232
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,768
Says at this point

2233
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:26,400
This business proposition ghost our when aristagoras makes a mistake

2234
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,960
When he takes the opportunity to not

2235
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:31,008
Lie to the Spartans at this point

2236
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:35,104
This is how to write a test for my de selincourt translation puts it

2237
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
You know right before

2238
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,176
They're supposed to meet again

2239
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:40,224
For the Spartans to give the answer

2240
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,040
As to how they feel about investing in this ionian revolt

2241
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,064
Quote

2242
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:47,136
That was as far as they got at the moment

2243
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:52,768
Open the day came on which cleomenes had agreed to give his decision and they met at the appointed place

2244
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:57,632
He asked aristagoras how far off Sousa was Susan the Persian capital

2245
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,704
How many days it took to reach it from the ionian coast

2246
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,264
Up to this aristagoras have been clever

2247
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,080
Headland cleomenes on with great success

2248
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:08,640
Answering this question he made a bad mistake

2249
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:13,760
If you wanted to induce the Spartans to invade Asia he never ought to have told them the truth

2250
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:14,784
But he did

2251
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,576
And he said it took three months

2252
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,600
And quote

2253
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:24,512
Herodotus writing 2500 years ago I mean think this is a great scene right there

2254
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:27,072
You must think about him as the sort of this sleazy

2255
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:33,472
In a Salesman type comes in here and tries to saw to put one over on the Spartan King and then all of a sudden falls into the Trap and says 3

2256
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:36,032
How long it's going to take to get to the Persian capital

2257
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,336
I mean he's basically said get the hell out of here

2258
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,408
He says be out of Sparta by sundown

2259
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,944
Are you crazy

2260
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:49,600
And she would have instantly understand that this whole time and he's been late on that Herodotus says that in a plane

2261
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:51,648
Please go back home in the sales guy follows him

2262
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:59,072
Tries to start bribing him to do the deal, I'll give you $50 if you do it I'll give you $100 if you do it

2263
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:02,656
Neurologist is a little Spartan boy one of the sons of Pekingese was in the room

2264
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:08,544
And said something like Daddy better get out of here cuz this man's going to corrupt you if things keep going the way they're going it's another one of those stories about the

2265
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,080
Interruptible Spartan

2266
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
Now

2267
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:16,992
Because he fails with the Spartans this aristagoras character then goes to the Athenian

2268
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:20,064
Being a democracy Now

2269
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,624
Pretend 15-20 years and it's a short

2270
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,696
New kind of system are running with their

2271
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:28,768
And it's not like a democracy you were I would recognize

2272
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,816
But as Herodotus points out

2273
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:35,680
Instead of having to convince a king or two in Sparta to invest in your idea

2274
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:42,080
Here you have to kind of convince the majority of whomever it is that makes the decisions here that they shouldn't be

2275
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,872
Other words voters

2276
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:46,432
Remember the heck that might be in an ancient democracy

2277
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,528
This also from The Descendant or translation

2278
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,296
Quote

2279
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:57,952
He was at this moment when the Athenians have made their decision and we're already on bad terms with Persia that Arista Gore

2280
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,976
Mulitas

2281
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,536
We've been turned out a Sparta by cleomenes

2282
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,816
Arrived

2283
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:06,912
He knew that Athens at this time was the next most powerful state in Greece

2284
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,936
Accordingly

2285
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,496
He appeared before the people and made a speech

2286
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:13,824
And when she repeated the arguments he previously used it Sparta

2287
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,384
About all the good things to be found in Asia

2288
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,432
And the Persian methods of warfare

2289
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:21,760
How to use neither Shield nor Spears and easy to beat

2290
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:28,160
In addition to this he pointed out that mulitas have been founded by Athenian settlers

2291
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:33,024
So it was only natural that the Athenians power should help

2292
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:39,680
Indeed so anxious was he to get Athenian Aid that he promised everything that came into his head until at last he succeed

2293
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:44,288
Apparently it's easier to impose upon a crowd then upon an individual

2294
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:47,872
Aristagoras would fail to impose upon

2295
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,432
Succeeded with thirty thousand Athenians

2296
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:55,040
Once persuaded to ac2 aristagoras is a peel

2297
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:58,880
The Athenians passed a decree for the dispatch of 20 ships to Ionia

2298
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:01,952
How did the command of a distinguished Athenian

2299
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,744
Erotic Justin says

2300
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:08,864
The sailing of this fleet was the beginning of trouble not only for Greece but for other people's

2301
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,656
And quote

2302
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:16,544
Dutch translation of that line differs book to book of translation to translation

2303
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,104
But that's the that's the moment when

2304
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,896
The Athenians decide

2305
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:26,528
To do something that's a little bit crazy because they essentially giving in and Herodotus

2306
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:29,344
Putin blames democracy for this

2307
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:35,744
That one spot and came to see the flaw in this dude's proposal from the get-go right spotted the flaw like the Shark Tank

2308
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,512
Investor

2309
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:41,632
Venture capitalist should get the heck out of here don't you try to cheat me but 30,000 Athenian

2310
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:44,192
Voter is part of the electorate there

2311
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,776
They could have the wool pulled over their eyes by a clever salesman right

2312
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:49,312
Any Athenian send

2313
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,080
20 ship

2314
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:54,688
To go help the ionian Revolt the 20 ships is not enough to do anything except

2315
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,224
Get you in trouble

2316
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:01,088
These Athenian ships will join with other ships they will

2317
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:05,440
Disembarking join rebellious ionian troops who will

2318
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:10,816
Among other things burn the provincial capital at Sardis maybe accidentally

2319
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,376
And then that Army will get

2320
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,960
By one of the provincial Persian armies

2321
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:19,008
And crushed with heavy casualties

2322
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,336
At this point

2323
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,128
The Athenians who's

2324
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:26,432
Support for this ionian Revolt is kind of like

2325
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:30,272
Not a little more than symbolic but quite a bit less than useful

2326
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:32,832
Be kind of pull back and go I am going to win

2327
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:33,600
Anymore

2328
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,952
We can kind of see echoes in a

2329
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:44,352
In an inconsistent policy where public opinion just sort of changes right this there's no King

2330
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
Public wasn't sure anyway

2331
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,472
And all of a sudden maybe these Persians didn't look like the pushover is that the

2332
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:53,312
Salesman for the ionian Revolt said they'd be yeah we're out

2333
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,616
And hopefully

2334
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,920
We'll just forget that this ever happen

2335
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,992
Of course Herodotus makes a point

2336
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,272
To say that

2337
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:08,672
Dries of course it's not going to forget that it happened one of Herodotus is great stories revolves around

2338
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,208
Notoriety

2339
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:14,560
Trying to make sure that he didn't forget most all his problems

2340
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:15,840
Yuan his Empire

2341
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:17,376
Those people

2342
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,656
The Athenians

2343
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:22,240
Herodotus a story talked about after the burning sardeson

2344
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:24,032
Dries gets the news about that

2345
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
Quote

2346
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:29,152
It is said that when the riots first heard this report

2347
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,944
He disregarded the ionian

2348
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:34,528
She knew that they at least would not Escape punishment for their revolts

2349
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:37,088
Inquired as to who the Athenians were

2350
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,160
And after he's been told he asked for a bow

2351
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:44,256
He took the bow and arrow on the string and shot the arrow towards the heavens

2352
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,816
And is it flew High into the air he said

2353
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,584
Zeus

2354
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,400
Let it be granted to me to punish the Athenians

2355
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:53,216
After saying that he appointed one of his attendance

2356
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:56,288
Repeat to him three times whenever his dinner was served

2357
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,312
My Lord

2358
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,592
Remember the Athenians

2359
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,384
And quote

2360
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:07,296
That's how they did things back in the analogue era no word on whether the attendance name was Siri

2361
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:14,208
Probably either just totally false her

2362
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:20,608
You know another way to look at it is that this Athenian problem of daraya this was so small he had to have someone

2363
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:24,960
Remind him everyday three times a dinner otherwise he forget about it with all the things he had to deal

2364
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:30,592
To show you what a low priority this whole Revolt is for the Persian Empire

2365
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:36,992
The great king himself doesn't even worry about the ionian Revolt delegate to an underling and the Persians like slow-mo

2366
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:40,832
Moving lava methodically reduce these rebellious cities

2367
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,880
In Asia Minor and off the coast

2368
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,184
And it's often

2369
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,208
Awful

2370
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,768
The retribution of these Empires

2371
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:54,656
Meat out too rebellious it is but let's understand that's that's something that in much of the world is still treated rather harshly

2372
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:59,776
And this time. Standard operating procedure what an extreme experience

2373
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:02,592
For example the home city of aristagoras

2374
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,384
The PowerPoint presenter

2375
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:07,456
Of Herodotus he gets his City level

2376
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,992
Maletis

2377
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,016
Is the name of it

2378
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:14,368
And the men are for the most part killed but the boys were told are castrated

2379
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,136
Instant back

2380
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,672
To Persia to be eunuchs

2381
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:20,256
The girls and women sold into slavery

2382
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:23,840
And so if you don't look at aristagoras two-way Herodotus

2383
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,888
Like some clever manipulator

2384
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,680
And instead look at him

2385
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:32,800
As someone who one way or another gets involved in this Revolt but once you're in

2386
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:37,408
The stakes are everything you see what happened to his home City when it got

2387
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:40,480
Cannery taken by the person he knows what the stakes are

2388
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:44,320
If you're thinking every man dies every boy gets castrated every woman and girl gets

2389
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:46,368
Sold into slavery in your cities leveled

2390
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,160
Wouldn't you do anything

2391
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:55,328
When you by hooker by crook tell the Athenians anything that they needed to hear to get public opinion on your side enough to send help

2392
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:59,424
And even though Herodotus ordered makes this

2393
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:03,776
Aristagoras in his movie version of events out to be a little like

2394
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:06,592
Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man

2395
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:11,456
I'm in inter-cell River City on the idea of a boy's band with instruments that'll never show up

2396
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:18,880
And the people of Athens released a sizable percentage of their electorate is easily Hoodwinked by Professor Hill

2397
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,672
It's clear that

2398
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,464
At least some Athenians

2399
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:25,280
This issue of ionian freedom

2400
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:27,072
Greeks in Asia Minor

2401
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:29,376
Is big and passionate and import

2402
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,936
Historian Peter Green

2403
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:34,240
Tells a story of a play

2404
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,776
The aired in Athens

2405
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:38,336
Right after the ionian Revolt collapse

2406
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:41,920
He says it may have been the first time that recent historical events

2407
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,200
As opposed to miss

2408
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:45,760
I've been represented in the Athenian theater

2409
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:46,784
Any rights quote

2410
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:53,952
In the early spring of 493 the dramatist Fran I guess put on a play called the capture of Meletis

2411
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:57,280
Vividly depicting the collapse of the ionian revolt

2412
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:59,072
The effect was remarkable

2413
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:03,168
Copernicus saw his audience weep tears of grief and patriotic shame

2414
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:07,776
Strong into Swift action the pro Persian Lobby got the play band

2415
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:10,080
When in doubt green rights

2416
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,616
Fall back on censorship

2417
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:14,432
Tinnitus himself was fined a thousand drachmas

2418
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:17,248
Almost three years pay for the average working man

2419
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:21,856
But the idea of subservience to Jiraiya's however reasonable it might be

2420
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:23,648
Now rapidly lost Brown

2421
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:25,184
And quote

2422
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,256
How modern does that sound

2423
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:30,304
Public opinion

2424
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:34,656
Altered by a popular portrayal of events

2425
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,752
Wild

2426
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:40,544
Historian Peter Green

2427
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,592
Writing in 1970

2428
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:47,456
You know she has an attitude that we probably would share today living when and where we do

2429
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:52,320
The censorship is not a good thing censorship of the arch is not a good thing in that public opinion

2430
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:53,344
Should matter

2431
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:59,232
Democracy or Republic remember Athens is in what you could call the testing phase Maybe

2432
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,792
How this whole democracy thing is going to work

2433
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:08,704
There certainly must have been other Democratic experiments the world over to Athens is credited with

2434
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,752
Quote and quote first democracy

2435
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,568
And they probably are given the scale you know

2436
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:15,104
First major attempt

2437
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:19,712
Experiment that is democracy only 10 or 20 years old at this point

2438
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:26,112
And if you're watching from the sidelines and you're a member of the conservative former but still powerful ruling class

2439
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:29,696
And you're looking at how public opinion is doing so far

2440
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,976
I trying to

2441
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,024
You know Governor things intelligently

2442
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:39,680
They've already done something the Spartan King refused to do and got involved in a Revolt that tweets the nose of the gray

2443
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:41,216
Great King of Persia

2444
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:47,104
But never had a chance of achieving anything really meaningful with the small amount of people they sent

2445
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,152
Was just enough to get you into trouble

2446
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:50,432
You already did that

2447
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:54,272
And now this playwright is writing plays that get them all

2448
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:57,600
Fired up about confronting Persia cuz of all the injustice

2449
02:16:57,856 --> 02:17:00,160
Darth Vader on the evil star Empire

2450
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:07,584
If this is the same thing as like remember the Maine was the newspaper campaign the fired-up Americans in the Spanish

2451
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,656
Going to go to war with Spain

2452
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,496
It's a little bit different because in that conflict

2453
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:20,128
You could argue about historical Justice and all that kind of stuff with the United States

2454
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:25,504
So propaganda that got public opinion to support the idea of chicken Spain's rear end

2455
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,040
Is something that is not

2456
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:29,088
2 detrimental

2457
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,368
To the country

2458
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:34,464
This is much more like the people in Latvia

2459
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:39,072
Being encouraged war fever

2460
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,400
In order to confront the Russians

2461
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,472
Or the Mexicans

2462
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:50,848
You know having the propaganda and the entertainment in public opinion and everything pushing towards

2463
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:55,456
Going back and reconquering those States they lost to the United States a century-and-a-half ago

2464
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:58,528
That's something that in that case

2465
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,880
Is public opinion leading you toward National Suicide

2466
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:07,488
Already shown a propensity to get you into trouble that's why you're on the

2467
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,792
In a great change naughty list already

2468
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:12,352
It's no wonder that guy was fined

2469
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,960
Just stoking those kinds of emotions at this time at this place

2470
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,520
Existential threat

2471
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,056
Athens at this point

2472
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:27,968
It is interesting the ability to portray the Persians in such an evil light

2473
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,760
I thought because if you actually look

2474
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,112
How the Persians dealt with it afterwards

2475
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:38,720
They actually did so in a way that was just typical of their Style

2476
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:42,304
They punished the rebellious City's horribly as we said

2477
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:46,400
But then winning in trying to figure out why the ionians kept revolting

2478
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:50,496
Lower taxes in places change some trade deals in others

2479
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:53,568
Try to alleviate the problem at its core

2480
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,360
And ironically enough

2481
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:59,968
Because some of these cities that have revolted didn't like the tyrants that were ruling them

2482
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:03,552
This newfangled thing called democracy they wanted a piece of that too

2483
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,600
The Persians let them have it

2484
02:19:07,136 --> 02:19:09,952
Remember they were known for allowing local customs

2485
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:16,608
You have to stay in place as long as things still worked out for them and if the local custom was going to be to collect your own leaders in your own City

2486
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,888
Directions were fine with that

2487
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,704
As long as the city stayed loyal to Persia

2488
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:28,640
So once again the Persians kind of look like the place we all like to live if we had to live back in those days

2489
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:31,456
In a absolute monarchy right

2490
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,832
On the ancient monarchy scale you know they score very highly

2491
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,880
Leniency tolerance compassion

2492
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:40,416
Common sense

2493
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,000
But if you're Greek you're not going to

2494
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,560
Look at it that way at least not if you're Athenian

2495
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,888
The last thing you want to do is have a

2496
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:51,936
You have a democracy Now

2497
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,472
And if your Spartan

2498
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:55,520
You want a king but you want a spark

2499
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:58,592
Can laughing you want to some Barbarian King so

2500
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:03,200
No people ever in the path of being conquered by any other people

2501
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:05,760
Could see the upsides can you blame them

2502
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:12,160
But you know I've always thought that if you were another city-state in Greece remember

2503
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,952
Greece is not unified place

2504
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,744
It's a bunch of competing

2505
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,048
Often warring in some cases

2506
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:19,584
Bitter enemy

2507
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:20,864
City state

2508
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:23,680
What is a city-state

2509
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:26,496
Athens is a bunch of places

2510
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,032
Argos

2511
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:34,688
What do you think in democracy did by sending those 20 ships to Aid the ionian revolt

2512
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:40,832
Is take the great king of kings the most powerful figure in the world

2513
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:48,512
Turn it into your direction and he doesn't just seatins he's everything over there

2514
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:51,840
What is the people in Argos do to deserve that

2515
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:56,192
They might have eventually been absorbed by The Blob who knows

2516
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:00,032
Athenians essentially declare war on Persia

2517
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:05,664
What lives in the neighborhood that the Persians couldn't help but trampled on on their way to punishing the Athenians

2518
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:11,296
And this is partly why the story has magnified in terms of importance

2519
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:13,600
For the people in Greece

2520
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:16,160
This is life-or-death

2521
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:20,256
To the Persians this is a frontier disturb

2522
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:24,096
Historian ATMs that has a chapter I love the title it

2523
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,400
Problems on the Greek Frontier

2524
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,960
Storing George cockwell

2525
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:33,312
Entitled his whole book The Greek Wars instead of the Persian Wars because

2526
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:35,360
The Persian Wars makes it sound

2527
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:40,224
In a like the Greeks are talking about it because they're them that's what this was but to the rest of the

2528
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:46,880
In a world that was centered around Mesopotamia these were the Greek Wars something over on the frontier something that didn't

2529
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,928
No way you could ever imagine

2530
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,464
Could threaten the empire

2531
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
The Athenians

2532
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,792
Whatever we're doing

2533
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,352
And I knew it was coming

2534
02:21:57,376 --> 02:22:03,520
Soldiery traditionally there's a lot of focus on Athenian internal politics in the war

2535
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,592
In what the Athenians sometimes called collaborate

2536
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:10,432
They had a word for it based on you it was the Persians in the medes

2537
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:12,224
So they called it me dies

2538
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:16,576
Can you or me doubting you were talking about collaborating or giving in to the great king

2539
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:20,160
They had these different factions that buy different powerful families in Minnesota

2540
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:23,232
Sparring and fighting it out in meanwhile

2541
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:27,072
Are the existential threat in 492 BCE gets going

2542
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:32,192
Led by a son of one of the assassination hit squad members

2543
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,728
Who also happened to Mary

2544
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:40,384
Into the royal family so you know you can see how this test you with all this assassination hit-squad thing is starting to be

2545
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:45,248
His name is mardonius he's fascinating I wish we knew more about him he's an interesting

2546
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,784
In a Persian General

2547
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,344
And he takes an army and a fleet

2548
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:54,720
Working together in a way we would call Lancey operations today

2549
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:58,560
And leaves Asia crosses the Dardanelles in 2 years

2550
02:23:00,608 --> 02:23:06,752
Nobody Knows the size of this Army Herodotus says it was 300 ships take that with a grain of salt but it doesn't

2551
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,568
Matter if it's half that big this is a mammoth operation

2552
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,104
For navies in the ancient world

2553
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:14,688
The Persians of course did not create their own Navy

2554
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:20,832
They took over the best one in the world and then they test it with things that never could have been tasked with the for like

2555
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,624
Okay we want you to support

2556
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:26,464
A 20 or 30 or 40 thousand man army with your Navy

2557
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:30,816
That's a new level of sophistication and operations and what the Persians are doing

2558
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:34,912
In his conquest of Greece which is something that they might have done in Egypt to

2559
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:38,496
Earlier but this is where you really get a chance to see it on display

2560
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,800
Is a precursor to

2561
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:43,360
Delancey operations today involving

2562
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:45,664
In a Marine Amphibious Landings everything

2563
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:48,736
Please please can be used

2564
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:53,600
To spit offshore and follow an army that's marching along the coast

2565
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:54,624
And feed it

2566
02:23:55,904 --> 02:24:00,512
Extending operations nobody knows how many troops mardonius have buddy lands in this area

2567
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:02,048
Controlled by

2568
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:02,816
Thracian

2569
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:09,216
The entire region around the Balkans during this time. In this particular area of courses up in

2570
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:11,264
And sort of by where Modern North

2571
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,080
Eastern tip of Greece's you up in that area

2572
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:20,480
All a bunch of stration tribes Herodotus labeled them the second most populous nation in the world after the Indians

2573
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:21,760
And

2574
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:26,880
Extremely warlike he said that they would have conquered the world if they didn't love fighting each other too much

2575
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,672
And they are

2576
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:33,024
I know you don't want to be so stereotypical about barbarians because all these people had wonderful

2577
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,304
Cultures and values

2578
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:40,704
Religious beliefs in puberty right to mean it's all a part of it but you can't help but look at it

2579
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:45,056
Inspiration and think there's your Hollywood casting directors idea of a barbarian

2580
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:48,128
They look a lot like a Skitty in without the horse

2581
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,200
They got the warpaint they got the tattoos they like to cook

2582
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:54,784
Carry severed heads around with them when they're trying to intimidate their enemies

2583
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,064
And they're tough

2584
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:58,624
Any like ambushes

2585
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:01,440
And it like to kill prisoners I mean they scare people

2586
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:07,584
And this area had submitted to derive this whole area when he came along chasing those kittens while back

2587
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:11,680
But you know the Persian army then goes home and they kind of

2588
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:16,288
You'll get a little locks and yeah we haven't heard from him in a while and whatever

2589
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:21,408
And then the Army comes back and says you know what we just going to tighten that relationship a little bit more

2590
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:26,016
And made all of those areas that have been formally sort of just yeah we're your vassals kind of deal

2591
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:28,320
Into official provinces

2592
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:30,112
Run bike governors

2593
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:31,904
Appointed by the Persian king

2594
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:34,208
One of these provinces

2595
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:36,768
Is the is the is the next little

2596
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:40,864
Kingdom I guess you could say on the way to greasy go from Thrace to

2597
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,400
Makedonia

2598
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:45,728
If the name rings a bell the king at the time will

2599
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,568
The Ringgit even harder Alexander Alexander the first

2600
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,848
A makedonija

2601
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:54,176
You know what he does when the Persian army under mardonius shows up

2602
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,968
He submits

2603
02:25:56,992 --> 02:26:00,064
Tecumseh Governor under the control of the Persians

2604
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,088
And

2605
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:05,184
Some historians in a wonderful ironic Twist of History say

2606
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:10,304
But if not for the stability and centralization and State Building

2607
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,584
Climate that

2608
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:17,984
Persian control in a gave makedonija during this. They may never have coalesced into a strong centralized state

2609
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,544
It would eventually evolve into something

2610
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:24,896
That could destroy the very people who made that centralized State possible

2611
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:29,760
Oh and just for the fun of it do it under a king with the same name

2612
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:32,320
Don't you just love history

2613
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,880
Nonetheless

2614
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:40,256
Thracian tribe do get one good Sucker Punch in

2615
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:43,328
I'll mardonius before they get crushed brutally

2616
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:46,912
A tribe of them will Ambush the Persian army at night

2617
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:50,752
And create great Havoc including wounding mardonius

2618
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:54,080
Right around the same time

2619
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:55,104
This Fleet

2620
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:58,688
It is accompanying the Persian army will try to round

2621
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:00,992
A point called Mount Athos

2622
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:05,344
Herodotus says as soon as like going around the tip of Florida

2623
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,368
I think about it that way

2624
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:09,952
And as soon as the fleet hits the tip it gets hit by

2625
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:10,720
When

2626
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:15,072
Strong winds according to Herodotus and he says 300 ship sank

2627
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,376
In 20000 men died

2628
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:20,960
Is what my perviz translation of Herodotus

2629
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:21,728
It says

2630
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:22,496
Quote

2631
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:28,384
From fastest to Fleet crossover and sale close to the shore of the Mainland

2632
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,712
From which they set out and then attempt around Mount Athos

2633
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:35,552
But if they were sailing around a strong North Wind came up on them

2634
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:41,952
Which was so impossible to deal with it and battered them badly in rectum any of their ships against the shore of Mount Athos

2635
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:45,792
In fact it is said that about 300 of their ships were destroyed

2636
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:47,584
With more than 20000 men

2637
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,656
And since this city is full of savage creatures

2638
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:52,704
Some were snatched up and killed by them

2639
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:55,264
While others were dashed against the sharp Rock

2640
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:58,080
Some men perished because they did not know how to swim

2641
02:27:58,336 --> 02:28:00,128
And still others died from the cold

2642
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,920
So that is what happened to the fleet

2643
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:03,456
Indica

2644
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:07,552
I'm sorry my head right now I just think to myself

2645
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,088
What do God look like

2646
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,904
300 ships

2647
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:14,464
Twenty thousand men

2648
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,328
Somewhere between 13 and 14 Titanic

2649
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:20,864
It's going down in terms of

2650
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:24,448
Live Loft if eroticism numbers are anywhere near correct

2651
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:28,032
Even more from a visual standpoint

2652
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:31,104
Is the ID of 300 ships wrecked

2653
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:32,384
All

2654
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:38,784
I mean what are they all bunched together in one place or are they scattered around in the entire coastline

2655
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:42,880
Usually doing the movie who doing the cinematography on that

2656
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,440
How much do we have to use

2657
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:49,792
Is CGI computer Graphics because there's no way otherwise to

2658
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:52,608
In the show that see how much would it cost to do that

2659
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:56,704
1950s Elizabeth Taylor Richard Burton style right

2660
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,728
Analog

2661
02:28:58,240 --> 02:28:58,752
How to get

2662
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:01,824
300 fake ships and I mean think about

2663
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:03,360
The visuals just

2664
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:10,272
All the people in the water I mean everything that people find so horrifying about going down to the Titanic you have happening

2665
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:12,064
You know route Mount Athos

2666
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,112
I know what you think about

2667
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:19,744
The precariousness of Maritime traveling bad storms will sink ships today

2668
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,024
We all know

2669
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:27,936
Well the farther back you go in history in general

2670
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,216
Away from the coach Dreamer

2671
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:33,312
Standard operating procedure was to beach the ships at night

2672
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:37,664
And then in the morning push them back out and get their big ships but you still beat them

2673
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:39,712
140 guys at red

2674
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:40,480
It took two

2675
02:29:41,248 --> 02:29:43,552
Essentially lift a trireme

2676
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:45,088
On to the shore at night

2677
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:52,768
I wonder how much it took to actually give these these weeds trouble but the idea of 300 vessels going down

2678
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:59,936
When they rounded the cape a it just boggles the mind

2679
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:01,728
Have to be the Kamikaze right

2680
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,776
The divine wind

2681
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,592
When Japan was saved

2682
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:11,200
You know from the Mongol horde because the storm came up and battered the fleet

2683
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,736
Saint Paul uShip

2684
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:16,064
The Invasion right

2685
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:17,856
Maybe this was

2686
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:20,416
Grease his own version of a kamikaze

2687
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,232
The one thing

2688
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,512
Did the Greeks knew

2689
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,072
Is that this was not going to say that

2690
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,656
This Kamikaze was not

2691
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:32,704
Deliverer

2692
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,496
It was a double layer

2693
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:38,080
Ending a nier

2694
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,360
2 years

2695
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:41,152
The riots will have

2696
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:43,712
Is next Invasion Force ready

2697
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:47,296
Irish dancing

2698
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:50,624
We will stop most ancient empires in their tracks

2699
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:55,744
Persians methodically just put together another one

2700
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:59,840
In 490 it's ready to go and it is bigger

2701
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:02,400
It is nastier

2702
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,216
It is going to be handled

2703
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:10,848
Better and we're going to take into account everything we learn from the failures of the last Expedition

2704
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:13,152
And this time it is going to be right

2705
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:14,176
The heart

2706
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:14,944
Avastin

2707
02:31:16,992 --> 02:31:21,088
And it's tempting to see the CEO role

2708
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:26,208
As already seen that the odds are

2709
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:29,024
I mean in the celestial Casino in the sky

2710
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:35,424
The battle between Athens and the Persians is off the books are not taking bets on that there are no odd there is no

2711
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,192
Champs

2712
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:39,008
And the rice is still trying to

2713
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:41,312
Get a little edge here or there

2714
02:31:43,104 --> 02:31:47,712
Leave no stone unturned planning White

2715
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:51,808
In the year between you know the first expedition that Founders off the rocks

2716
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:53,088
Bose

2717
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,368
And the one coming up

2718
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:55,648
Ethan zohn voice degrees

2719
02:31:56,928 --> 02:32:00,768
They go to all these Greek States and Greek Islands and they asked for earth and water

2720
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:04,352
Remember earlier we said that was the traditional token of submission

2721
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,656
Most of these places give it to

2722
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:11,008
Vast majority of the islands a bunch of Creek State

2723
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:14,080
Two notable holdouts though

2724
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:20,736
Athens who either throws their Persian Envoy into a pit that they usually have four convicts win

2725
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:23,552
Execution or throws them off a cliff take your pick

2726
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:29,952
Which one of the famous movies of all time although some historians doubt it ever happened

2727
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:36,608
Supposedly throw the Persian Envoy into a well when he asked for or some water and tell them he can get both of them down there

2728
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:40,448
That killed the Persian Envoy

2729
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:44,544
And puts both the Spartans and the Athenians if they really did that

2730
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:46,848
Onto The Ledger of

2731
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:52,992
Misdemeanors and high crimes at the Persians are keeping track of remember what happened to the Egyptians

2732
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:54,272
When they kill

2733
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,552
Persian on boys

2734
02:32:55,808 --> 02:33:01,184
Can Pisces got to sit there and watch a thousand or 2,000 other kids executed and sold into slavery

2735
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:05,280
A bunch of Greek city-states and Highland

2736
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:09,376
Chose what you probably have to see you the only realistic answer

2737
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,400
And submitted

2738
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:12,960
Earthen water to the Persians as ass

2739
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,288
And instantly becoming not just

2740
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:17,312
Neutral

2741
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:20,896
In the struggle that Athens is about to engage in

2742
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:21,920
But adversary

2743
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:25,760
Other city-states in Greece all of a sudden were subjects of the great king

2744
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:32,160
That's like a slow-moving lava on the other side of the Emoji and all of a sudden launches Embers into the sky

2745
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:35,744
Sky the drop-down on city-states in Greece near Athens

2746
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:40,608
The great king is going to Levy troops from these other

2747
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:43,680
Greek cities to use against the Athenians

2748
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:46,496
If you're already we're going to crush poor

2749
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:47,520
Little Greece

2750
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,336
With your Persian forces

2751
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:53,920
Well now he's isolated the Athenians for the most part the Spartans with them

2752
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:56,480
So now he's just going to crush that little part agrees

2753
02:33:56,736 --> 02:34:01,856
Now he's going to add Greek city-states to his side and their armies to his

2754
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:05,440
I mean this is a guy who really likes to load the dice right

2755
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:08,256
When you hear

2756
02:34:08,512 --> 02:34:09,536
The scale

2757
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,560
Of this attack

2758
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:16,448
And what it takes to logic gives you a an absolutely new appreciation for the capabilities of ancient

2759
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:20,544
And you really do think you're so cool we do this today

2760
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:25,152
If we had no computers and none of the modern stuff we normally use I mean

2761
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:26,176
You try to take

2762
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:27,968
Let's just say it 50000

2763
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:29,504
Stadium size

2764
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,528
Crowd of people

2765
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:34,880
And transported over water and land

2766
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:36,672
A long way

2767
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:39,232
And not have it be a catastrophe

2768
02:34:41,024 --> 02:34:42,048
Historian Tom Holland

2769
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:49,216
You know how both of the generals of this Expedition one guy's name is artha Franny's and he's related to the Royal

2770
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:49,984
Family

2771
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:54,336
The others called datus and he's a Mead and they come in this Expedition and from their eyes

2772
02:34:55,104 --> 02:35:01,248
He has them see the preparations that were so large and massive and went on for a whole year and there's no doubt the Athenians

2773
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:03,040
This was going on Holland rights quote

2774
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:10,720
Every Day's Journey Westward brought them fresh evidence of the barely believable scale the great Kings

2775
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,488
Resources

2776
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:14,560
The labor gangs toiling to maintain the roads

2777
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:16,608
Whole population sometimes

2778
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,424
Transplanted from the farthest reaches of the Earth

2779
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,240
The guard station beside every bridge

2780
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:25,824
Every flotilla of pontoon Every Mountain Pass

2781
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,616
The troops in their own rear

2782
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:31,712
Not merely Persians and medes but Levi is drawn from further

2783
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:32,992
Bactrian

2784
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,016
Sean Diaz

2785
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:35,552
An axe-wielding soccer

2786
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:38,368
What was Athens the people such as B

2787
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,904
Not even a name

2788
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:41,696
Get on they marked

2789
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:45,024
Directed by the will of their far-off All-Seeing King

2790
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,584
And every evening no matter where they halted

2791
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,120
These men from the steppes

2792
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:51,680
From the mountains from The Villages of a Ron

2793
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:54,752
They would be provisioned out of monstrous depots

2794
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:59,360
Supplied punctually with jugs of wine and loaves of bread and barley for their horses

2795
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:00,896
And when it last

2796
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:07,296
Having passed through the Syrian Gates and descended into the plains of culicchia on the Southeastern coast of modern-day turkey

2797
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:10,624
Turkey they found there waiting for them

2798
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:12,928
Sun Builders weapons of war

2799
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:14,208
Others as horse trainer

2800
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:16,256
And quote

2801
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:22,144
In the history of Naval Warfare what the Persians are about to do here

2802
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:27,008
It's hard to find an earlier version it's hard to imagine that anyone moved

2803
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,800
Tens of thousands

2804
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:30,848
Of troops across the water

2805
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:36,224
And landed the minute like an amphibious assault situation with the Persians are doing here

2806
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:38,784
Is breathtaking and remember

2807
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:45,440
2 years ago you would have to go two years ago they lost three hundred ships and 20,000 men doing something

2808
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:46,208
Like this

2809
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:50,048
So they know what might happen

2810
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:56,192
This Time by the way they're going to go much more direct route none of this going around the long way and supplying

2811
02:36:56,448 --> 02:37:00,544
In the Army we're going to transport the Army on the ships and we're going to Island

2812
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,592
Across the Aegean from Turkey to Greece

2813
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,384
Take the islands on the way

2814
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,712
If you are in Greece

2815
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:09,760
Especially if you are in Athens

2816
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:13,856
It's hard to imagine those folks feeling a whole lot different than the British

2817
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:16,416
In the second world war after France fell

2818
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:18,976
And they knew they just knew

2819
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:20,512
Okay brace yourself

2820
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:22,304
Storm is Coming

2821
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,608
Athenians

2822
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,656
In 490

2823
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:27,936
The storm breaks

2824
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:31,776
In the summer of 490 BCE

2825
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:32,800
Persian X

2826
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:34,336
Expedition gets underway

2827
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,152
Herodotus says

2828
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:38,176
It consists

2829
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:39,968
Hungary ship

2830
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:43,808
Now modern-day historians have done a great job

2831
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:48,416
Poking holes in the ancient authors numbers where they were talking ships are men

2832
02:37:48,928 --> 02:37:52,768
But they have no real agreement over what numbers to plug in for them

2833
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:57,376
I miss broad disagreement in fact historians are not even sure what the goal of this mission is

2834
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,936
Is this a mission just to punish

2835
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:03,776
Athens and some of their in a small island friends and whatnot

2836
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:05,824
Well if so we require

2837
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,360
A1 size Force

2838
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,920
If on the other hand this is an expedition

2839
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:14,272
With the intention to punish Athens and conquer the rest of Greece you need another size

2840
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:16,064
Even trying to figure out

2841
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,648
You know your numbers requires you to make certain assumptions and historians differ

2842
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:27,072
I mentioned earlier that this operation is really a different sort of operation than what you saw before this.

2843
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:29,888
The Persians as we said may have done this already

2844
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:33,216
Generation before when conquering Egypt

2845
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:39,616
Earlier. You always had Warfare but it was something more like a glorified version of what the

2846
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:41,152
Vikings did than this

2847
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:44,224
What the Persians are doing is really the precursor

2848
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:50,624
You know they will eventually evolved into say the D-Day Landings in June

2849
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:53,184
Because when

2850
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:59,584
The Trojan Wars happen for example and the Mike Indians come over from another area that's now Greece in the NBA

2851
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:02,144
Meaning of the Trojan War they come over on ships to

2852
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:06,752
But they don't bring sophisticated Horse Transport

2853
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:12,640
And food carrying ships do nothing but bring the supplies to keep everybody fed and watered

2854
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:14,688
That's a modern-day operation

2855
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:22,880
I'm going to see people's came to Egypt in ancient times they didn't bring Horse Transport in everything they needed to supply in

2856
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:24,672
An army with them by sea

2857
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:28,512
In 1944 when the Allies cross the English Channel they did

2858
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:29,792
And they did here too

2859
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:37,984
By going island-hopping when these islands in the Aegean are relatively close to each other the Persians can avoid having to

2860
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,544
Cross like a large stretch of Open Water

2861
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:42,848
Think of a place to place to place

2862
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:45,920
You know most of the time probably just Beach their ships at night

2863
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,480
Some cities get

2864
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:55,136
Destruction treatment the first when they go to is one called nexos and they owed some payback to that one

2865
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:59,232
And so even though the population fled up into the mountains places got burned

2866
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:00,768
Your bad things happened

2867
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,072
But then they arrive at another Island

2868
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:06,656
One that is supposedly the birthplace of the god Apollo

2869
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:12,032
And the population runs away they're all scared and the Persians stop and they tell them to come back you have nothing to fear

2870
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:14,848
Because that Island didn't do anything they submitted

2871
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:16,384
Then the Persian

2872
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:18,176
General goes up today

2873
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:21,760
To the altar of Apollo and burns and out

2874
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:22,784
Frankincense

2875
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:26,368
Massively over tipping the God is a kind of a

2876
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:28,416
A way to say listening

2877
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:32,512
This guy is going to get even more than he's used to you know when you were taking care of

2878
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:35,840
The characteristic approached at the Persians

2879
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:37,632
Then they go to another city

2880
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:38,912
And they ripped

2881
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:39,680
Shreds

2882
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,496
The city's name was Eritrea

2883
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:45,312
It was one of the two cities

2884
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:51,200
In a long without them but really supported the ionian Revolt so it's on the hit list for the Persians

2885
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:52,480
And they

2886
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:59,136
Take advantage of the divisions that seem to be in almost all these Greek cities

2887
02:40:59,392 --> 02:41:00,160
Steven Sparta

2888
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:01,696
Using their gold

2889
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,976
Their promises

2890
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:05,792
And this carrot and stick approach of theirs to essentially

2891
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:07,584
You note are the Greek

2892
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,984
Up from within 2 exploit divisions that already exists

2893
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:14,752
The Greeks art

2894
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:20,640
But it's not just a division between the city-state Argos does not get along the Sparta

2895
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:22,688
Divisions within the city-state

2896
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:26,272
Example of how MA Den Daniel describes

2897
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:30,112
What happens when the Persians lost this expedition to the islands

2898
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:32,416
And begin to punish people

2899
02:41:32,672 --> 02:41:33,184
Quote

2900
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:37,024
The Persians disembarked on naxos which was still independent

2901
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,328
They conquered the island and pillaged it

2902
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:42,144
The majority of the people of the island fled to the mountains

2903
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:46,496
Thereupon the Persian army sailed to the town of eretria on euboea

2904
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:50,080
At that time Eritrea suffered from the strong antagonism

2905
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:51,872
Between two political parties

2906
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,688
The aristocrats wanted to defend their town

2907
02:41:57,504 --> 02:42:01,088
The Eritrean has offered resistance against the Persians for 6 days

2908
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:02,368
On the seventh day

2909
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:04,416
The Democrats surrendered their City

2910
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:08,256
I hope that the Persians would give them the power over Eritrea

2911
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:12,608
The Persians however burnt and destroyed the city and its Temple

2912
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:14,912
Into captivity

2913
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:17,216
They were deported to suzhou

2914
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:18,752
In modern-day Iraq

2915
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:24,896
And thereupon by orders of daraya settled in the village about jurica in the ELA my district of Kiss ER

2916
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:25,920
And quote

2917
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:31,296
Supposedly the great King's orders to his generals have been to reduce

2918
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:34,368
Eritrea and Athens to slavery

2919
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,672
And then to bring the slaves to him

2920
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:44,096
I have always assumed that to be rhetorical you need doesn't mean really likes all the people in the city state

2921
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:45,632
Put them on the ship

2922
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:51,008
Send the ships back to the Asian mainland in March than 3 months to him and chains and Suzette does e

2923
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:53,056
And then I remember that

2924
02:42:53,824 --> 02:42:58,176
If people have been moving whole populations of other people since time began

2925
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:04,576
He wanted to come to look at history through a lens of population movement and start by determining that there's two basic kinds

2926
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:09,184
Voluntary population movement and involuntary population movement

2927
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:12,512
Movie the people who want to go elsewhere

2928
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:15,584
And the movement of peoples that somebody else wants to go elsewhere

2929
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:19,936
Joseph Stalin was doing this kind of stuff in the 1950s

2930
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:23,264
So maybe not that hard to believe

2931
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,568
And certainly if you were the Athenians

2932
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:28,640
You get worried about this Eritrean disaster

2933
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:32,480
And you get an idea if you know what you're very near future

2934
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:33,504
Probably looks like

2935
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:40,928
Can you have divisions within your city every bit as contentious as those that brought down Eritrea

2936
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:42,720
And

2937
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:44,768
You can't help but notice once again.

2938
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:47,584
In a very modern move the Persians are

2939
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:49,120
Taking advantage of this

2940
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:52,704
With them leading them guiding them and helping them

2941
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:56,288
On this Expedition towards Athens is a guy that used to run the place

2942
02:43:57,824 --> 02:44:01,664
They're bringing back an old Tyrant And I stress the word old cuz that's what a Rattata

2943
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,432
Chastise

2944
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:09,088
This is a guy who ruled the place before democracy broke out in the Persians are bringing him back there interested

2945
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:11,904
We would say today in regime change

2946
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:15,232
And they're bringing a foreign army to back it

2947
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:19,584
But the assumption is that there's going to be a bunch of people in Athens who welcomed this

2948
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:20,608
From the other

2949
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:21,888
Party if you will

2950
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:26,240
Supposedly there are high signs and all kinds of other things

2951
02:44:26,496 --> 02:44:30,080
Conspirators and those who want to revert back to the

2952
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:31,616
In old days meaning

2953
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:38,016
The city divisions in Athens are clear they're open they're talked about by the primary sources in the Persians appear

2954
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:41,344
Designing their strategy to take advantage of this

2955
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:49,024
It seems just like them. And then you know how we going to rule this fractious very political place will it bring somebody back in your nose delay

2956
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:59,520
Faction in Athens is opposed by some of the most famous people in this story if you're looking at it from the

2957
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:01,312
Traditional Greek point of view

2958
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,080
Guys like

2959
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:03,360
Temistocles

2960
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:05,664
A lot of historians compared to

2961
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:08,736
Churchill figure in the story and

2962
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:09,760
Another one name

2963
02:45:10,016 --> 02:45:11,296
Yuletide at ease with

2964
02:45:11,552 --> 02:45:14,624
Play a key General role in this upcoming

2965
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:17,184
Your face off that we're about to happen

2966
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:25,376
According to Herodotus it is the former Athenian tyrant in between wheezing and coughing fits that's a

2967
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:29,728
Supposedly tells the Persians the best place to land for their amphibious operation

2968
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:31,776
A plane called

2969
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:32,800
Marathon

2970
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,640
About 25 miles outside the city of Athens

2971
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:42,016
You could call it a staging point for your amphibious operation right unload everything

2972
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:45,856
I get yourself all put together and then you can march on the city or

2973
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:48,672
You can just act as the incentive

2974
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:50,208
For Athens to

2975
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:56,096
Interchange public opinion favor and more these people who are saying it would be great to have the old Tyrant back

2976
02:45:56,352 --> 02:46:00,192
And at the same time will be realistic about cutting our losses against the great king

2977
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:03,519
Who now has an army 25 miles from here by the way

2978
02:46:03,775 --> 02:46:04,543
Did I mention that

2979
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:06,847
In a war party Themistocles

2980
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:10,431
What you going to do about that

2981
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:12,991
Of course this leads

2982
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:16,063
To a famous encounter first of all

2983
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:18,111
The Athenians do the smart thing

2984
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:19,903
And they send a runner

2985
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:23,231
Which boggles the mind when you think about how this is a

2986
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:25,279
Life-or-death issue

2987
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:29,375
Do we send a Horseman know there had to be a reason why and I don't know what it is

2988
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:33,215
We'll leave it to a story to explain why somebody would run

2989
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:34,495
To Sparta

2990
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:41,663
But that's what they do because they need help and you know who you going to call most of Greece is already working that with the Persians

2991
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:46,527
And besides the Spartans could kick all their rear ends in combat anyway send to the Spartans

2992
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:48,319
And begin to put your own

2993
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:50,623
House in order and get your soldiers together

2994
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:54,719
And this is where the story once again you to focus a bit on the soldiers

2995
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:58,047
We describe the Persian army early

2996
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:00,351
We pointed out at that time that

2997
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:04,703
There's a real importance to things happening on the battlefield level

2998
02:47:05,215 --> 02:47:08,031
Tactical questions that impact the rest of human history

2999
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:09,311
Because

3000
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:10,847
Remember this is a

3001
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:13,919
Encounter that should be off the books at the wedding

3002
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:19,295
Casino the celestial Casino mean this is the great Persian Empire encompassing most of Asia

3003
02:47:19,807 --> 02:47:23,391
At least a part of Asia that anybody knows about all the way to India

3004
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:24,927
And Athens

3005
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:27,743
What is going to make

3006
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:31,327
Resistance anything other than completely futile

3007
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:33,631
Maybe the weapon system

3008
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:37,983
It's kind of crazy to think of

3009
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:43,871
When you realize how long military history has been happening in places like

3010
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:46,943
Innovative Middle East right or or

3011
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:51,807
China or any of those places they've already got thousands of years of military history under their belt

3012
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,343
Button

3013
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:57,951
490 reading this dussehra right they were talking about BCE

3014
02:47:58,207 --> 02:47:59,999
This is the emergence the beginning

3015
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:02,047
The entrance on the

3016
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:03,839
In historical stage

3017
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:05,119
European

3018
02:48:05,375 --> 02:48:06,399
Military history

3019
02:48:07,679 --> 02:48:08,959
Obviously there's

3020
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:12,287
As much European military history there is anything else if you can

3021
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:14,335
Enough we had the tribal record

3022
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:15,615
All the peoples

3023
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:17,919
That existed on what's now the European

3024
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:20,735
Continents going back to 10000 BCE

3025
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:22,015
But we don't

3026
02:48:23,551 --> 02:48:25,087
Historians can try to reconstruct

3027
02:48:25,599 --> 02:48:31,231
In some sort of Dark Age or heroic. Of Greek history in a during the time of the Trojan Wars

3028
02:48:31,743 --> 02:48:32,511
I am large

3029
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:37,887
You know the first record we have of European armies armies armies were talking about right now in Greece

3030
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:41,215
The vast majority of them

3031
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:44,543
Made up of average everyday folks

3032
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:49,151
Dressed and equipped and fighting as heavy infant

3033
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:57,343
That because this is the earliest form of of Western military history you you will have whole schools

3034
02:48:57,599 --> 02:48:58,623
Historical thought

3035
02:48:59,135 --> 02:49:05,279
And they were dominant for the last twenty-five hundred years most of the time that will assert that there are qualities in the

3036
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:06,047
These Greeks

3037
02:49:06,559 --> 02:49:12,191
Either what makes them fight or how they fight or their theories behind how you should fight

3038
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:16,287
That have influenced maybe even made

3039
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:18,847
Military

3040
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:20,895
For the last 2500 years

3041
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:26,527
Reciting a phrase you might hear from someone from the Victor Davis Hanson School of

3042
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:29,343
Yuan historical thought on these questions for example

3043
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:31,903
The idea that the Greeks

3044
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:35,487
Were people who believe in decisive battle

3045
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:41,631
And that we ourselves are the inheritors in the modern world of that same idea as a whole

3046
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:45,471
Easy to get lost in the rabbit hole and I will leave it to the

3047
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:52,383
Mainstream historians Hanson's of provocative character but he gets a lot of pushback and there's a lot of great arguments repeat

3048
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:53,407
Like yours truly

3049
02:49:55,967 --> 02:50:00,063
The part of what makes the Ancient. Warfare so fun for a guy like me

3050
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:02,367
Is that you get to see

3051
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:03,391
The most

3052
02:50:03,903 --> 02:50:06,975
Variation between cultures and peoples and societies

3053
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:10,303
And their influence on warfare than you see in any other.

3054
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:12,351
They were very standardized

3055
02:50:12,863 --> 02:50:14,143
If you look at a military

3056
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:16,191
From say modern-day South America

3057
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:19,519
I compare it to one from modern-day Asia

3058
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:25,663
They're going to be dressed the same they're going to be using the same equipment they're going to be using very similar tactics

3059
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:28,479
I mean the difference between the two will be minimal

3060
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:34,111
But the farther back in time you go especially to the ancient.

3061
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:39,743
All of these cultures are in their most exuberant shall we say flamboyant Maybe

3062
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:44,607
And distinctive sort of cultural incarnations for lack of a better phrase

3063
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:46,655
They all look very

3064
02:50:47,167 --> 02:50:52,031
Like their culture they fight in ways that are connected to their culture their organization everything

3065
02:50:54,591 --> 02:50:58,687
The contract is part of what I love about the. When the Persians and the Greeks

3066
02:50:59,455 --> 02:51:02,015
First meet in this. They were talking about right now

3067
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:04,575
This is a clash of cultures literally

3068
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:10,463
And that's part of what makes this such a rabbit hole of stereotypes and motifs and everything like that to go down because

3069
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:13,023
It's been this west-east Dynamic ever since

3070
02:51:14,047 --> 02:51:15,583
But you can't help but notice

3071
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:19,679
The wonderful distinctiveness for example the Persians are a combined arms Army

3072
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:22,751
When we talked about them you have all these different

3073
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:26,079
Things to talk about first you talk about the Cavalry then you talk about the light

3074
02:51:26,335 --> 02:51:27,871
When you talk about the line Infantry

3075
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:30,687
The Greeks don't have much of that during this time.

3076
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:32,991
They have heavy Infantry

3077
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:33,759
Hoplite

3078
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:39,135
You are wargamer it's part of what makes Greek armies from this. Kind of boring

3079
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:42,207
Everything you get it is a hoplite basically

3080
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:47,071
The hoplite is the quintessentially Greek heavy Infantry

3081
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:51,167
And they're one of the examples that historians often look

3082
02:51:51,423 --> 02:51:56,031
To to try to answer another man's horrible but fascinating question

3083
02:51:56,543 --> 02:52:01,151
Especially from the pre gunpowder in a period of military history as to why some people

3084
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:08,063
In a developed weapons types and Weapons Systems and soldiery the others can't imitate of me why are there

3085
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:12,415
In Japan why can't the Chinese emperor just decide one day

3086
02:52:12,671 --> 02:52:18,815
Those Samurai are really badass I want some samurais I'm going to get a disgruntled Samurai bring him over here let him train

3087
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:22,911
My guys I'll give him the same weapons and armor

3088
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:29,823
We can't do that can you there's something cultural right the cultural carrots and sticks that are reinforced by the Japanese

3089
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:32,127
Feudal society that you can't create

3090
02:52:32,383 --> 02:52:33,151
Samurai

3091
02:52:33,407 --> 02:52:34,431
Just cuz you want them

3092
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:42,111
In history when the Roman legionaries were reigning Supreme during the Roman Empire. Other commanders tried to imitate that

3093
02:52:42,367 --> 02:52:43,903
Is imitation legionaries by the

3094
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:47,999
Couple centurions

3095
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:50,047
By the same armor weapons and I'll have

3096
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:52,607
Legionaries too but they never quite measured up

3097
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:53,375
Decant

3098
02:52:53,887 --> 02:52:55,935
Do that there have to be some of the cultural

3099
02:52:56,191 --> 02:52:58,751
Aspects that are very hard to reproduce

3100
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:00,031
Same thing with hopper

3101
02:53:01,823 --> 02:53:03,103
Historian Victor Davis Hanson

3102
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:05,151
Gives a remarkable

3103
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:07,711
Statistic in his writing he says quote

3104
02:53:09,247 --> 02:53:11,295
For nearly 300 years

3105
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:13,855
From 6:50 to 3:50 BC

3106
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:18,207
No foreign army despite any numerical superiority

3107
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:20,767
Withstood the charge of a Greek phalanx

3108
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:24,607
The battles of marathon and potato

3109
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:28,703
Relatively small numbers of well LED heavily-armed Greeks

3110
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:33,055
Had little difficulty in Breaking right through the hordes of their more lightly equipped

3111
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:35,871
Unless cohesively rank adversaries from the East

3112
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:37,151
And

3113
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,455
Why

3114
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:45,599
This is a fascinating question to ponder and it goes down unquantifiable

3115
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:46,879
Unmeasurable

3116
02:53:47,903 --> 02:53:50,719
You know when you start getting into questions of things like toughness

3117
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:56,863
How on Earth does one measure toughness and how is toughness infused

3118
02:53:57,119 --> 02:53:59,167
You know if you could take all the children from a

3119
02:53:59,423 --> 02:53:59,935
So cold

3120
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:06,335
How civilization and transfer them to the parents from a so-called weak civilization whatever time

3121
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:13,503
I take the children for the week civilization and give them all to the parent of the tough generation a generation from then do you change the

3122
02:54:13,759 --> 02:54:15,039
Power relationships at all

3123
02:54:15,551 --> 02:54:19,391
Does the week civilization stay week or does it get tough and vice-versa and then why

3124
02:54:21,695 --> 02:54:22,975
What is toughness anyway

3125
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:25,535
What the heck is this

3126
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:30,399
Dominance that these hoplites have something that simply based on

3127
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:34,495
You know the way they fight between their formations and their weapons and stuff like that

3128
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:37,311
This is the stuff that historians argue about

3129
02:54:39,103 --> 02:54:41,151
Victor Davis Hanson probably is the

3130
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:47,039
In a leading proponent of what maybe you could call the traditionalist approach to thinking about hoplites as

3131
02:54:48,063 --> 02:54:51,647
Did he call them at one point in one of his books I love the way he phrased it

3132
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:55,231
He called them heavily armed and armored farmer

3133
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:58,047
And each city-state

3134
02:54:58,303 --> 02:55:00,351
Is a little like a sports team

3135
02:55:00,607 --> 02:55:05,215
And they all have personalities even if you think of the Pittsburgh Steelers is tough blue collar

3136
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:09,567
You know guys and that's reflected in the way that they play in the toughness of their teams

3137
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:15,967
I would like to know you have fever to the city-state of rustic farmers and they're always out there

3138
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:21,087
But they're a little rustic I mean every every city-state had its own kind of reputation

3139
02:55:21,599 --> 02:55:24,159
And record versus traditional opponent

3140
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:26,207
How are the Spartans doing against the argyle

3141
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:32,351
And some of these city-states were considered to be tougher than others

3142
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:36,191
But according to the traditional approach

3143
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:39,519
Most hoplite armies are militias

3144
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:42,335
Are the citizens of the city state

3145
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:45,151
Usually just a percentage of them but

3146
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:46,431
Hanson point.

3147
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:52,575
About 80% of most of these city-states were made up of farmers are people who made money in farming

3148
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:58,719
Athens and Sparta are always kind of exceptions to the city-state ruled by the way

3149
02:56:00,255 --> 02:56:03,839
Athens is kind of a New York City or the Paris or the London

3150
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:06,399
Of ancient Greece a little bit more chic

3151
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:13,055
Little bit more gossiping with more gossamer into the theater in the latest trends and very glib politi

3152
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:14,079
Ethically speaking

3153
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:15,103
Talented

3154
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:17,151
Funny humorous wonderful entertainers

3155
02:56:18,431 --> 02:56:24,575
And the Spartans are a laboratory experiment I love these things where you use human beings

3156
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:26,367
You can create a soldier

3157
02:56:27,135 --> 02:56:30,463
You know this extra special of all the societal carrots and sticks are arranged

3158
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:38,143
When I was growing up there was a ton of admiration for Sparta and their system and everything

3159
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:44,543
Nowadays even conservative historians are much more hard on the Spartan system than they used to be

3160
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:46,591
Victor Davis Hanson

3161
02:56:47,103 --> 02:56:47,871
Himself

3162
02:56:48,383 --> 02:56:49,919
Will say about Sparta quote

3163
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:53,759
Are disclosed militaristic Society

3164
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:55,551
Produced an army of professional

3165
02:56:56,063 --> 02:56:59,391
Immune from pressing economic a rather peacetime obligations

3166
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:01,695
They were free to threaten the Farms of others

3167
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:03,999
The fight year-round if need be

3168
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:05,535
Secure in the knowledge

3169
02:57:05,791 --> 02:57:08,351
But in their nightmare a system of Apartheid

3170
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:10,399
Servants were busy with their own Harvey

3171
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:20,127
There's all kinds of debate and discussion and disagreement among historians about a lot of things that mean you have Victor Davis Hanson in one quart

3172
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:23,455
You got a guy like hands band

3173
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:26,527
And he wrote a fascinating book

3174
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:29,087
Greek Warfare myths and realities

3175
02:57:29,343 --> 02:57:35,487
But I'm still trying to get my mind around cuz it's so challenging to traditional beliefs doesn't make it true doesn't make hands and true

3176
02:57:35,743 --> 02:57:40,607
As One reviewer I read said maybe it's more like something in between the two is true

3177
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:47,519
Says that everything we know about hoplite Warfare comes from a later.

3178
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:50,591
5075 years after

3179
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:54,175
And that the armies were talking about here

3180
02:57:54,431 --> 02:57:57,503
Are much more rustic even than the ones

3181
02:57:58,015 --> 02:57:59,039
Nina from Classical Greece

3182
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:01,087
It's called this is still archaic

3183
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:10,047
He says they're only reason that the Spartans are considered dangerous at all is because they're the only Greek city-state

3184
02:58:10,303 --> 02:58:12,095
The prepares for war at all

3185
02:58:12,863 --> 02:58:16,447
What's that line in a world where we went blind the one-eyed man is King

3186
02:58:16,703 --> 02:58:19,007
Maybe the Spartans aren't so badass

3187
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:22,079
Compared to anybody who actually trains for war

3188
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:23,615
That seems heretical

3189
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:24,895
His point is that if

3190
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:31,295
Most of these city-states are simply getting all their people together you know the ones who fight the 30 or 4

3191
02:58:31,551 --> 02:58:34,879
40% of the male population out there free male population actually fights

3192
02:58:35,647 --> 02:58:39,487
When you get them out there if they're not trained to move as a group

3193
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:42,559
You know to follow commands and do drills

3194
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:44,095
What are they going to do

3195
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,119
Out there

3196
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:52,543
And fun ways is pointed at the Spartans actually did do that drilling which made them seem almost otherworldly to these arms

3197
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:53,311
Men's Wear

3198
02:58:53,567 --> 02:58:59,711
You know guys just got together one day when we needed for war imagine you know you have a spear and some armor that's

3199
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:00,479
It's over

3200
02:59:00,735 --> 02:59:05,599
You know your fireplace and has needed once or twice a year or maybe once every two years

3201
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:11,231
You down the armored you meet up with everybody in your neighborhood that you normally fight within your go out there for the day

3202
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:16,095
And you try to beat the neighboring city-state on a in a nice wonderfully labeled flat

3203
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:18,911
Field of battle with some certain rules probably

3204
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:21,215
So we've been believe that these freaking rules.

3205
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:27,103
You're not too many of us are going to use bows or anything like that right this is a man on man contest right

3206
02:59:28,895 --> 02:59:30,431
In terms of weaponry

3207
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:32,479
The Greek hoplite was a Spearman

3208
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:39,391
Wielding a 789 foot long sometimes we even hear longer long spear

3209
02:59:40,927 --> 02:59:42,463
But that spear was only about an inch thick

3210
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:45,791
Had an iron spear head

3211
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:48,095
And a bronze butt Spike on the end

3212
02:59:49,119 --> 02:59:51,423
Historian said that was called the lizard

3213
02:59:52,191 --> 02:59:53,727
Whatever that means it sounds awful

3214
02:59:55,519 --> 02:59:57,055
And that these

3215
02:59:57,311 --> 03:00:01,151
Troops would form up injury close formation shoulder-to-shoulder essentially

3216
03:00:01,407 --> 03:00:02,687
With their shield in front

3217
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:03,967
And their Spears

3218
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:10,111
You know ahead of them now this means that the spears for about three or four ranks behind the front rank

3219
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:11,647
Protrude

3220
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:15,231
Beyond the front of the formation so you have a pincushion here

3221
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:17,535
Usually the ones behind that week

3222
03:00:17,791 --> 03:00:18,815
Keep your Spears up

3223
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:21,375
Hoplite formation is called

3224
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:22,143
Phalanx

3225
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:25,983
We now know as we didn't maybe 50 years ago or sixty years ago that

3226
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:32,639
The Phalanx is a formation that has been used ever since very very ancient times Mesopotamian cities were using

3227
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:33,663
A long time ago

3228
03:00:34,431 --> 03:00:39,295
But the Greeks may have formed even closer than the norm it's debated and debatable

3229
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:45,695
The one thing that these formations had a real problem with his any sort of difficult to rain in fact

3230
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:47,999
Maybe even just a little uneven ground

3231
03:00:48,255 --> 03:00:49,791
Because if you were trying to stay

3232
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:56,191
Shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you in front of you and behind you the last thing you want to do is run into for example

3233
03:00:56,447 --> 03:00:58,495
Your formation

3234
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:04,127
Victor Davis Hanson approach to thinking about how this Phalanx spot

3235
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:07,967
Would make it seem something like a very very very pointy

3236
03:01:08,223 --> 03:01:10,015
Irresistible Steamroller

3237
03:01:11,807 --> 03:01:13,343
And usually they would put

3238
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:19,487
The best man in front and an often times the best man in the rear file to

3239
03:01:19,999 --> 03:01:20,767
And put the least

3240
03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:27,423
Trustworthy Brave experienced what-have-you man in the middle of the formation because the news really no way

3241
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:28,191
Out

3242
03:01:28,959 --> 03:01:30,751
And many of the people who write about

3243
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:32,031
The Greek hoplite

3244
03:01:32,287 --> 03:01:33,311
Phalanx

3245
03:01:33,567 --> 03:01:36,639
Will point out that it doesn't require a ton of weapons drill

3246
03:01:37,663 --> 03:01:39,967
You don't have to really learn how to do much in the way of

3247
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:44,575
Another great warrior out there with sword player using the spear like that

3248
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:49,695
Like a Shaolin monk not that kind of think you're more of a part of a machine

3249
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:50,719
In the phalanx

3250
03:01:51,231 --> 03:01:57,375
And the Greek authors and the modern-day historians often say that what seems to be strapped in the sources this much more what we were call today

3251
03:01:57,631 --> 03:01:58,399
Physical fitness

3252
03:01:59,423 --> 03:02:00,191
Endurance

3253
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:01,983
Strengths that kind of thing

3254
03:02:02,239 --> 03:02:05,055
And it partially explains why you can have old people

3255
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:09,663
Fighting in the skylights is why everyone doesn't have to be 25

3256
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:10,943
Liking today is Milla

3257
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:14,015
Call Terry what part of it is it's a militia right you're supposed to get

3258
03:02:14,271 --> 03:02:17,855
A cross-section of the public but also because Ena formation like that

3259
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:20,927
Older people aren't required to be so nimble

3260
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:22,207
The arthritis

3261
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:27,839
You could be more control me you just go to stay and do your job standing die or you know conquer

3262
03:02:28,095 --> 03:02:32,447
And move forward but all is apart of this math working together in fact the older people

3263
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:34,239
Added both experience

3264
03:02:37,055 --> 03:02:37,567
Add

3265
03:02:38,079 --> 03:02:39,871
In a veteran status and they could help

3266
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:41,663
Stiff and some of the younger

3267
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,199
We were soldiers in the formation

3268
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:50,623
And some of this is believed by some people to try to explain maybe why these hoplite to do so well

3269
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:54,463
When they face non hoplites are they kicking ass you know who knows

3270
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:56,767
Is the armored wolf other people have

3271
03:02:57,279 --> 03:03:00,863
Is it the long Spears will anybody can put long Spears in the hands of their troops

3272
03:03:01,119 --> 03:03:02,399
What makes them

3273
03:03:02,911 --> 03:03:07,519
Do what they do what makes Samurai so good what makes it so good what makes Mongo

3274
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:10,079
What makes Apache so good

3275
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:14,431
That's always also have another idea about armor and such

3276
03:03:14,943 --> 03:03:16,479
And he points out that well

3277
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:17,503
What am I let him

3278
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:18,783
Explain how

3279
03:03:19,039 --> 03:03:22,367
He sees the development of armor is different from everything we've always learn

3280
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,391
Quote

3281
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:29,023
A Scholars have traditionally reconstructed the history of hoplite equipment

3282
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:30,815
It follows in a perfect Arc

3283
03:03:31,327 --> 03:03:35,679
Beginning in the late 18th century we witnessed a gradual introduction of hoplite armor

3284
03:03:36,191 --> 03:03:41,055
Culminating in the Universal adoption of the full hoplite panoply in the middle of the 7th century

3285
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:47,455
From the middle of the 6th Century onwards parts of the panoply begin to be discarded by the end of the fifth century

3286
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:50,783
We reach the rather lightly equip hoplite already described

3287
03:03:51,295 --> 03:03:53,855
This tidy picture needs a modification

3288
03:03:54,623 --> 03:03:55,135
And quote

3289
03:03:56,927 --> 03:03:58,207
In his opinion

3290
03:03:58,463 --> 03:03:59,999
The artwork is kind of

3291
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:06,911
The biggest baddest guy with the coolest looking armor set

3292
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:07,679
Sometimes I verify

3293
03:04:08,191 --> 03:04:09,215
Affected the history

3294
03:04:10,495 --> 03:04:11,519
Buddy's point is that

3295
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:16,383
And when you actually look at archaeological finds it cost

3296
03:04:16,639 --> 03:04:17,151
Fang

3297
03:04:17,919 --> 03:04:19,711
And when you throw people of different

3298
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:24,575
Wealth classes into a large body of people and tell them to wear

3299
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:26,111
Their own stuff

3300
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:28,671
This is sort of the Hallmark of all of the

3301
03:04:29,183 --> 03:04:31,231
You know city-states except Sparta

3302
03:04:31,743 --> 03:04:33,535
Is you buy and bring your own

3303
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:34,559
Kit

3304
03:04:34,815 --> 03:04:40,959
Right so everybody's kids kind of different than personalizing sometimes they all go down to the neighborhood market they're selling helmets in there

3305
03:04:41,215 --> 03:04:45,311
If you put all these people together on Battlefield

3306
03:04:45,823 --> 03:04:46,847
It doesn't look very yunnan

3307
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:47,615
The Forum

3308
03:04:49,151 --> 03:04:50,687
And because of this were told

3309
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:54,527
There's even conspicuous display of the rich guys come

3310
03:04:55,039 --> 03:04:58,111
Hylan drive up in the BMW is right and they have the

3311
03:04:58,367 --> 03:04:59,903
Horsehair crest

3312
03:05:00,159 --> 03:05:06,303
It's triple and maybe ostrich feather sticking out too and the really cool bronze armor

3313
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:08,351
The Nimbus 2000 kind of thing

3314
03:05:09,119 --> 03:05:12,447
And the poor guy shows up in some leather jerkin or maybe some

3315
03:05:12,703 --> 03:05:18,847
You know nothing of Linden they used to think it went from the Barnstormers into the linen or it might have just always been a Cost question

3316
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:20,895
The more wealthy the phalanx

3317
03:05:21,663 --> 03:05:24,223
No members were the better the armor look

3318
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:25,247
Well

3319
03:05:25,503 --> 03:05:28,575
While the experts May disagree or discuss quite a lot

3320
03:05:29,087 --> 03:05:32,671
Questions of what a hoplite was or how they exactly fought

3321
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:36,511
We can say with a pretty good level of certainty can't we

3322
03:05:37,023 --> 03:05:41,631
That those are the kind of troops regardless of what they are that Athens is going to have to rely on

3323
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:44,191
If they are going to turn back this

3324
03:05:44,703 --> 03:05:46,751
Persian amphibious assault

3325
03:05:47,007 --> 03:05:48,031
We mentioned a little while ago

3326
03:05:49,055 --> 03:05:53,151
That lands at a place called Marathon about 25 or so miles outside of Athens

3327
03:05:54,943 --> 03:05:56,735
It will be a lively debate in this

3328
03:05:56,991 --> 03:06:00,831
Wonderfully interesting democracy and Athenian democracy

3329
03:06:01,343 --> 03:06:05,183
In some ways remind you a little of the early French Revolution in the sense that

3330
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:08,767
Their Democratic about like all kinds of things like they elect General

3331
03:06:09,791 --> 03:06:11,327
And if you believe Herodotus

3332
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:17,727
They liked multiple generals who then have two in a share command somehow Maybe by you know today is my day tomorrow

3333
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:18,751
How was your day I mean

3334
03:06:19,519 --> 03:06:20,799
In that sense it's a kind of a

3335
03:06:21,055 --> 03:06:23,871
Radical democracy in in in in all kinds of ways

3336
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:28,223
There will be a debate in the city about the best course of action

3337
03:06:28,991 --> 03:06:33,087
Dealing with the Purdue given to the Persians at the realism

3338
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:36,927
The fortify the city and stay here with you go out and meet them eventually

3339
03:06:37,439 --> 03:06:38,463
Impart led by

3340
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:41,023
A guy named milk as we mentioned earlier

3341
03:06:41,279 --> 03:06:45,119
They will put together their hoplites and maybe their attendance

3342
03:06:45,887 --> 03:06:49,471
The debate over how much the people that actually held the armor for the hoplite

3343
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:53,311
And then once the hoplites were ready to fight one of those guys do they pick up

3344
03:06:53,823 --> 03:06:57,151
Javelins and fight his light infantry lot of debate over that too

3345
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:01,503
But I can to put together 10 or 11,000 he's

3346
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:07,391
Citizen militia soldiers who may be trained every now and then is going on some sort of yearly event or

3347
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:10,719
What not and they certainly would have had experience fighting

3348
03:07:10,975 --> 03:07:15,327
But men from different social classes men from different age brackets up to

3349
03:07:15,583 --> 03:07:17,375
Little guys in their 40s certainly

3350
03:07:17,631 --> 03:07:20,191
And prominent people is a lot of prominent people

3351
03:07:20,447 --> 03:07:24,543
Who will forever afterwards remember that they fought in that Phalanx that day

3352
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:26,335
Enable take off for Marathon

3353
03:07:28,383 --> 03:07:30,687
Given that famous order something to the effect

3354
03:07:30,943 --> 03:07:33,247
Take food with them and March

3355
03:07:33,759 --> 03:07:35,551
Grab formations and go

3356
03:07:36,831 --> 03:07:39,135
So this citizen militia of Athens

3357
03:07:39,647 --> 03:07:40,415
Takes off

3358
03:07:40,927 --> 03:07:41,951
Joined by

3359
03:07:42,463 --> 03:07:45,279
800 to a thousand hoplites from the small city-state of

3360
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:46,559
Tortilla

3361
03:07:47,327 --> 03:07:49,631
And then they go and put themselves

3362
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,935
In a blocking position

3363
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:53,215
The chi

3364
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:58,079
The Persians from breaking out of their little beachhead area and expanding out into the country

3365
03:07:58,847 --> 03:07:59,615
And then they sit

3366
03:07:59,871 --> 03:08:00,639
And hunker down

3367
03:08:01,407 --> 03:08:03,199
Within sight of the Persian army

3368
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:06,015
Best face off

3369
03:08:06,271 --> 03:08:09,855
Which goes on for a couple of days I try to keep reminding myself

3370
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:11,647
Of the intimidation

3371
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:15,743
If something that tends to diminish over time

3372
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:19,583
But the Persians in this time. Or like the heavyweight champ

3373
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:22,911
Certain aura about them and Herodotus comments

3374
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:29,311
He says that these Athenians camped out there are the first to endure he says

3375
03:08:29,823 --> 03:08:30,335
Quote

3376
03:08:30,591 --> 03:08:33,663
The site of the medes clothing in the men wearing it

3377
03:08:34,431 --> 03:08:35,967
He called the Persians medes

3378
03:08:36,735 --> 03:08:37,759
He called the Greeks Helen

3379
03:08:38,015 --> 03:08:38,783
Nieces quote

3380
03:08:40,575 --> 03:08:43,391
In fact until then even to hear the name

3381
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:45,951
Spoken would strike Terror into Helen

3382
03:08:47,231 --> 03:08:47,743
And quote

3383
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:51,327
So there's a

3384
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:54,399
Intimidation Factor here there's also a

3385
03:08:54,655 --> 03:08:57,471
Are tactical reality that the Greeks understand

3386
03:08:57,983 --> 03:08:59,007
Persian heavy cavalry

3387
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:02,335
And calorie is something that the Greek

3388
03:09:02,591 --> 03:09:03,615
Way of fighting

3389
03:09:03,871 --> 03:09:04,383
Without

3390
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:07,199
Extra troops around can't deal with a mean

3391
03:09:07,455 --> 03:09:11,039
If you're in the formation where the number one thing you have to do is stand shoulder-to-shoulder

3392
03:09:11,295 --> 03:09:15,135
With the guys around you and not break formation cuz then you're doomed

3393
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:17,951
How do you deal with Cavalry that you can't catch

3394
03:09:18,719 --> 03:09:24,095
They can ride up to you in small squadrons and Pelt you with javelins and then as you move out to deal with them

3395
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:27,935
In a runaway and if you chase them you break your formation

3396
03:09:28,447 --> 03:09:29,215
And then your meat

3397
03:09:29,471 --> 03:09:30,495
For that saying cavalry

3398
03:09:30,751 --> 03:09:34,335
Rewrite the can come in there now that you were all disordered take you apart

3399
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:37,919
The Greeks also don't have archers

3400
03:09:38,175 --> 03:09:44,319
The one thing that might keep that Cavalry at arm's length right away to respond at least at the Tactical level they don't have that

3401
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:47,647
Lots of them

3402
03:09:50,719 --> 03:09:56,095
So that'll keep you camp down for a while wondering what to do the other reason that historians think it's a logical thing to wonder about

3403
03:09:56,607 --> 03:09:59,167
That the Athenians are waiting for here are for spark

3404
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:05,311
They sent a runner to Sparta remember as opposed to a championship Cherry driver

3405
03:10:05,567 --> 03:10:10,175
Or Horsemen we don't understand why but he made it in record time so who's going to argue

3406
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:11,455
And this

3407
03:10:11,967 --> 03:10:18,111
Person tells the Spartans Unity

3408
03:10:18,623 --> 03:10:21,951
Alright now

3409
03:10:22,975 --> 03:10:23,487
Can't make it right

3410
03:10:23,743 --> 03:10:24,511
Right this second

3411
03:10:25,023 --> 03:10:27,839
But as soon as the moon gets into the proper phase were there

3412
03:10:28,863 --> 03:10:29,375
Something

3413
03:10:29,631 --> 03:10:32,191
Athenians are waiting there for the Spartans didn't you know

3414
03:10:32,959 --> 03:10:34,495
Hopefully nothing happens before then

3415
03:10:34,751 --> 03:10:37,823
Historians wonder why the Persians are waiting also and

3416
03:10:38,079 --> 03:10:40,895
Many theories center around the idea that they're waiting for

3417
03:10:41,407 --> 03:10:47,551
You know the coup d'etat to occur in Athens right for the people there to another the realism party which the

3418
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:50,623
War party would call the collaborator party the me dizer

3419
03:10:51,135 --> 03:10:53,183
Just waiting for those guys to get the upper hand

3420
03:10:53,695 --> 03:10:58,559
Nothing historians think maybe those guys are waiting for the Persians to defeat the Athenian Army

3421
03:10:58,815 --> 03:11:02,911
And then throw open the gates everybody kind of wants to hedge their bets right that's natural

3422
03:11:04,447 --> 03:11:09,567
But if Athens gates are thrown open the person can just get back in their ships maybe leave a covering force on the beach

3423
03:11:09,823 --> 03:11:15,455
And sale around Athens and go take it while the army that should be defending Athens is still waiting for the Spartans

3424
03:11:15,711 --> 03:11:16,479
Marathon

3425
03:11:17,759 --> 03:11:18,783
And truthfully

3426
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:21,343
This is an enormously compelling story

3427
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:22,879
And always has been

3428
03:11:24,159 --> 03:11:24,927
If you look at it

3429
03:11:25,183 --> 03:11:25,951
From the Greek side

3430
03:11:27,487 --> 03:11:30,047
I mean with much as I'm trying to look at this from the Persian side

3431
03:11:30,303 --> 03:11:32,607
And I'm only human and I'm a fan of history and

3432
03:11:32,863 --> 03:11:34,143
You know if you forget all that

3433
03:11:34,655 --> 03:11:38,495
In a fun we were having with the nonsense of the home team of Western Civilization

3434
03:11:39,007 --> 03:11:45,151
There's still a compelling angle that a totally neutral screenwriter would want to exploit here forget Herodotus

3435
03:11:45,407 --> 03:11:48,991
You know Greek anyway writing for a Greek audience

3436
03:11:49,503 --> 03:11:55,647
I mean if you're a neutral if your perversion screenwriter you might turn the story into a great movie because

3437
03:11:56,671 --> 03:11:58,463
Kaminis Athenians have no chance

3438
03:12:00,767 --> 03:12:02,303
They're not just the underdogs

3439
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:04,607
But the stakes are everything

3440
03:12:06,655 --> 03:12:10,495
Persians lose here and in what are the odds that they almost never lose

3441
03:12:10,751 --> 03:12:12,031
No big deal to that

3442
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,335
If you think Indians lose

3443
03:12:14,591 --> 03:12:20,735
Well there's two ways of looking at it the macro in the micro the micro isn't the Athenians lose they get sold into slavery

3444
03:12:20,991 --> 03:12:24,063
Dimaio's probably all die a lot of people died

3445
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:27,135
And they will pay for all they've done to Persia

3446
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:33,791
But on the macro Athens hasn't reached its civilizational Hi-Point yet

3447
03:12:34,303 --> 03:12:34,815
Play sit

3448
03:12:35,327 --> 03:12:39,423
You know the part of Athens that makes it so influential on the rest of world history

3449
03:12:40,191 --> 03:12:41,983
The reason we still think of it as different now

3450
03:12:43,775 --> 03:12:49,919
They really haven't come to that point there on the way mean democracy is starting all these things but the high-water Mark is still a ways away

3451
03:12:50,175 --> 03:12:52,479
If they get wiped out before that happens

3452
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:57,855
There's a lot of ways you could play that what if game writes on the macro level we all have a stake

3453
03:12:58,111 --> 03:12:58,879
And maybe

3454
03:12:59,135 --> 03:13:01,695
Athens surviving a little bit longer at least

3455
03:13:02,463 --> 03:13:04,255
But there's almost no chance of that right now

3456
03:13:04,511 --> 03:13:07,071
The Persian numbers are unknown as always

3457
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:14,495
Ancient sources put him as high as 500,000 Persians there on the beach somehow being fed and everything well that's crazy

3458
03:13:16,031 --> 03:13:19,871
I see numbers as low as of 9000 which would make the Greeks outnumber them

3459
03:13:20,127 --> 03:13:21,407
That seems unlikely to

3460
03:13:22,175 --> 03:13:23,711
Historians usually think it was about it

3461
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:26,783
L321 outnumbering us that's a pretty

3462
03:13:27,039 --> 03:13:32,927
Safe number to 25,000 50,000 men seems pretty normal to run into

3463
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:40,351
There's debate over whether or not the whole Army was there on the beach or whether or not some of them are still embarked on ships going elsewhere doing other

3464
03:13:40,607 --> 03:13:41,375
Things don't knows

3465
03:13:43,423 --> 03:13:48,799
Not only do you have this intimidating Army which Herodotus specifically mentions the intimidation Factor

3466
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:50,847
I purged there on the beach

3467
03:13:51,103 --> 03:13:54,175
But they probably outnumber you and they might have number u321

3468
03:13:54,943 --> 03:13:56,735
And you don't even have the Spartans with you

3469
03:13:56,991 --> 03:13:59,295
But you don't have any Cavalry you going to be archers

3470
03:14:00,575 --> 03:14:06,719
So not only is this like a David and Goliath struggle but it's like you go up to David and say I'm by the way give me that's playing in that

3471
03:14:06,975 --> 03:14:10,559
Rock to anything else you might be caring and take your shoes off and do this barefoot

3472
03:14:11,071 --> 03:14:13,375
How many things can be against these

3473
03:14:14,143 --> 03:14:19,007
Something that adds to the compelling nature of the story the odds are just incredible and then they keep getting worse

3474
03:14:21,567 --> 03:14:23,359
Earlier we talked about history

3475
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:24,895
As a crime scene

3476
03:14:25,663 --> 03:14:27,455
How often historians have to go in there and

3477
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:28,991
Beauty investigator

3478
03:14:30,015 --> 03:14:34,111
There have been so many different interpretations on this Battle of Marathon

3479
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:39,487
That is about to happen here and you'd expect that there would be a lot of interest after all

3480
03:14:39,999 --> 03:14:44,351
This battle is often infused with almost mythical levels of importance

3481
03:14:46,143 --> 03:14:50,239
I think it was John Stuart Mill who said that the Battle of Marathon

3482
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:54,847
Was a more significant event in British history than the Battle of Hastings was

3483
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:59,711
But what kind of crazy is for such an important event

3484
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:06,367
We know so little about it for sure and it leaves a lot of room for the experts to sit there and disagree because there's a ton of

3485
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:07,903
Things that have to be pieced together

3486
03:15:08,415 --> 03:15:11,231
Number one on the list is how the heck does that even happen

3487
03:15:12,767 --> 03:15:18,911
According to Herodotus who is the mean the one that closest early sources about 70 75 years later he says there's a disagreement

3488
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:19,935
Amongst the commander

3489
03:15:20,959 --> 03:15:25,055
These democratically-elected generals Alpha Mill tities is one

3490
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:29,407
Erotica signal tities and four other generals want to attack

3491
03:15:30,431 --> 03:15:34,015
And five other generals on the other side don't want to attack and even split

3492
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:38,879
So he says miltiades then goes to the war archon

3493
03:15:39,135 --> 03:15:41,183
Who's there who can break the

3494
03:15:41,695 --> 03:15:45,023
The deadlock and no tities give him a whole bunch of arguments why he should

3495
03:15:47,583 --> 03:15:53,727
The only one that has any bearing on why all of a sudden the Athenians should go on the offensive instead of

3496
03:15:53,983 --> 03:15:56,287
Waiting for the Spartans write them you would think they would wait

3497
03:15:56,543 --> 03:15:59,615
Heidi has more weight and he says that the people in Athens

3498
03:16:00,127 --> 03:16:05,503
You are liable to turn against them to go over the collaboration side to me.

3499
03:16:05,759 --> 03:16:09,343
If they don't do something to rot will get worse according to one of my trans

3500
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:14,975
So the longer we sit here the more the chances are

3501
03:16:15,231 --> 03:16:20,607
That the tide will turn in the wrong party will get a hold of Athens and they'll open the gates and all of this will be for naught

3502
03:16:20,863 --> 03:16:22,143
We can't wait for the Spartans

3503
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:28,287
Later tradition very late tradition probably unreliable tradition suggest

3504
03:16:28,543 --> 03:16:32,127
There was a turncoat spy on the Persian side who told the Greeks

3505
03:16:32,639 --> 03:16:33,919
The Persian cavalry

3506
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:35,199
Was gone

3507
03:16:36,735 --> 03:16:37,503
Horse manure weigh

3508
03:16:40,575 --> 03:16:43,903
The reason that that comes up is because nobody can figure out how

3509
03:16:44,415 --> 03:16:50,559
The biggest thing that the Greeks were worried about the Persian Cavalry how it's not going to play any

3510
03:16:50,815 --> 03:16:53,119
Important role at all

3511
03:16:53,631 --> 03:16:54,655
And what's about to happen

3512
03:16:55,423 --> 03:17:00,287
And given the fact that Herodotus emphasizes that they had specially built Horse Transport

3513
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:02,591
Anime to convey the horses

3514
03:17:02,847 --> 03:17:06,943
And it Marathon was specifically chosen because it would be good for cavalry

3515
03:17:07,199 --> 03:17:08,479
Where the heck are the horses

3516
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:10,271
Turn all of a sudden

3517
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:15,135
No tities is able to convince the war Arc onto support

3518
03:17:15,647 --> 03:17:17,183
An aggressive attack

3519
03:17:17,951 --> 03:17:19,231
Against the Persian live

3520
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:27,679
I should also point out that there are other historians who think that would probably happen to yours that the Persians decided to attack

3521
03:17:28,191 --> 03:17:28,959
And the Greeks

3522
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:31,007
Put on their armor

3523
03:17:31,263 --> 03:17:33,311
Got already formed up and met them

3524
03:17:34,847 --> 03:17:38,175
Another line of thinking is that the Persians finally decided to move

3525
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:43,551
You know that's okay nothing's happening here let's get on our ships and we'll sail to Athens

3526
03:17:44,063 --> 03:17:44,575
And it will

3527
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:49,439
To this Army as we leave them on the beach and then we'll beat them back to their home City

3528
03:17:49,695 --> 03:17:51,487
Doesn't matter what happen apparently

3529
03:17:51,743 --> 03:17:52,767
The Greeks moved out

3530
03:17:53,535 --> 03:17:54,559
According to Herodotus

3531
03:17:55,071 --> 03:18:01,215
They lined up their troops in a way so that they could match the Persian line which supposedly outnumbered

3532
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:08,127
I'm so in order to match the length of the opposite side they had to make their

3533
03:18:09,663 --> 03:18:10,175
Dinner

3534
03:18:11,967 --> 03:18:17,087
Herodotus says that on the wings they were normal depth which most historians think was about eight ranks deep

3535
03:18:17,343 --> 03:18:20,159
But he says that they were only a few ranks deep in the center

3536
03:18:20,927 --> 03:18:21,695
Why historians

3537
03:18:21,951 --> 03:18:22,975
I think that's more like 4

3538
03:18:24,255 --> 03:18:25,791
So they're taking a chance here

3539
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:29,119
They'll avoid getting out flanked on the left or the right

3540
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:34,751
By matching the length of the Persian line but they're taking a chance by going off of shallow in the center

3541
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:38,591
The center is where the Persians put their best true

3542
03:18:41,151 --> 03:18:41,919
According to her on

3543
03:18:43,455 --> 03:18:44,223
Persians are

3544
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:44,991
Caught off

3545
03:18:45,247 --> 03:18:45,759
Guard

3546
03:18:46,783 --> 03:18:50,111
Buy an army of more than 10000 Spearman

3547
03:18:50,623 --> 03:18:52,415
Charging them at a run

3548
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:55,231
He writes quote

3549
03:18:56,511 --> 03:19:00,095
After the troops were in position and the sacrifice is it proven favorable

3550
03:19:00,351 --> 03:19:03,167
When the Athenians were let loose and allowed to advance

3551
03:19:03,423 --> 03:19:05,727
They charged at a run toward the Barbary

3552
03:19:06,495 --> 03:19:09,055
The space between the two armies was about a mile

3553
03:19:09,311 --> 03:19:10,335
And the Persians

3554
03:19:10,591 --> 03:19:13,407
Who saw the Athenians advancing towards them on the double

3555
03:19:13,919 --> 03:19:15,199
Prepared to meet their attack

3556
03:19:15,711 --> 03:19:20,063
They assume that the Athenians were seized by some other least self-destructive Madness

3557
03:19:20,575 --> 03:19:23,135
As they observed how few the Athenians were in number

3558
03:19:23,647 --> 03:19:27,743
And how they were charging toward them with neither Cavalry nor archers and support

3559
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:31,071
The Barbarian suspected that the Athenians have gone mad

3560
03:19:32,095 --> 03:19:32,607
And quote

3561
03:19:34,655 --> 03:19:35,935
Stories been tearing apart

3562
03:19:36,191 --> 03:19:38,751
Herodotus's account of events ever since but

3563
03:19:39,007 --> 03:19:40,031
In many ways

3564
03:19:40,799 --> 03:19:46,943
You know we can't expect him to give us the sort of details that we need to Envision what's really going on here but I mean a hundred years ago

3565
03:19:47,199 --> 03:19:49,247
Hans delbruck was saying there's no way

3566
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:52,575
Those hoplites ran a mile in armor

3567
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:58,207
And then got to the Persian line where they then had to exert themselves fighting impossible

3568
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:05,887
So the many many books and Papers written out there about what actually happened at Marathon

3569
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:07,679
Will disagree about all the specific

3570
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:15,615
Of course what everyone would love is a little bit more detail from Herodotus me since this great story up and then he doesn't tell us

3571
03:20:15,871 --> 03:20:18,943
Anything about the archery of the Cavalry what happening is just

3572
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:20,735
You left a piece of together

3573
03:20:22,271 --> 03:20:28,415
It does appear that there was some running involved because the battle would become known as a battle where these hoplites ran into con

3574
03:20:30,463 --> 03:20:31,999
Victor Davis Hanson says

3575
03:20:32,255 --> 03:20:35,071
You know over the years to follow Veterans of this battle

3576
03:20:35,327 --> 03:20:35,839
Tell others

3577
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:37,631
That they fought there simply by saying

3578
03:20:38,143 --> 03:20:38,655
We were

3579
03:20:39,935 --> 03:20:41,471
And everyone would know what that meant

3580
03:20:43,263 --> 03:20:49,151
But it makes sense to do a lot of historians because if you're going to run into one of the great bow fire armies in history

3581
03:20:49,407 --> 03:20:50,943
You said earlier like a machine gun

3582
03:20:51,711 --> 03:20:52,479
Archery fire

3583
03:20:53,247 --> 03:20:54,527
You don't want to

3584
03:20:55,039 --> 03:21:01,183
So the move into contact by taking your time are you wanting to get to the line so you can start to fight in knots

3585
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:01,951
Suck up

3586
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:05,535
Any more arrows than you have to do on the way in so it makes sense

3587
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:12,959
Like almost all the ancient writers Herodotus is just a big on all the details we would want

3588
03:21:14,495 --> 03:21:20,383
There's a lot of writing about why this isn't going to be too General reasons one the ancient authors thought it maybe not

3589
03:21:20,895 --> 03:21:22,687
Up to the style that they like

3590
03:21:22,943 --> 03:21:27,807
To go into the Gory details we wonder about in terms of the blood and the guts and everything in

3591
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:30,111
How it was visually for the senses like a

3592
03:21:30,367 --> 03:21:31,135
Horror movie

3593
03:21:32,927 --> 03:21:34,207
But also so many of the

3594
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:40,095
Physical elements the physics of the battlefield like we talked about earlier that we'd like to understand better was known to them

3595
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:46,495
And Their audience of mostly people who would have occasionally have fought in battles like this would be known to them too

3596
03:21:46,751 --> 03:21:47,263
The way

3597
03:21:47,775 --> 03:21:48,799
Yohance vanwey

3598
03:21:49,567 --> 03:21:55,711
So the points out this well understood problem we have with the sources not telling us things that's obvious to them

3599
03:21:55,967 --> 03:21:56,735
But the baffle off

3600
03:21:56,991 --> 03:21:57,503
Quote

3601
03:21:59,295 --> 03:22:04,671
Exactly how hoplites fought their fearsome battles is not immediately clear from ancient description

3602
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:09,279
All the most explicit evidence relates to the heavy infantry employed

3603
03:22:09,535 --> 03:22:11,583
By the makedonian

3604
03:22:11,839 --> 03:22:12,863
Guns from Philip II

3605
03:22:13,119 --> 03:22:14,655
Alexander the Great

3606
03:22:15,167 --> 03:22:17,471
Rather than to the heavy infantry of the Greek cities

3607
03:22:19,519 --> 03:22:25,407
Archaic and classical Greek authors assumed that their audiences were familiar with the experience of combat

3608
03:22:25,663 --> 03:22:28,991
And apart from recording the occasional striking detail

3609
03:22:29,247 --> 03:22:31,807
Describe the battle only in the most general terms

3610
03:22:32,319 --> 03:22:33,599
Army's advance

3611
03:22:34,111 --> 03:22:35,135
Fight and

3612
03:22:35,391 --> 03:22:36,415
In quotation marks

3613
03:22:36,927 --> 03:22:37,439
Porsche

3614
03:22:37,695 --> 03:22:39,999
Until one side in quotation marks

3615
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:40,767
Break

3616
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:41,791
And run

3617
03:22:42,815 --> 03:22:43,327
And quote

3618
03:22:46,143 --> 03:22:47,167
So it's sort of left

3619
03:22:47,679 --> 03:22:51,263
Two modern-day historians disorder fill in the gaps a little bit

3620
03:22:52,031 --> 03:22:57,151
And one of the best accounts if you're going to do this movie you're going to turn Herodotus Astorian

3621
03:22:57,407 --> 03:22:59,455
You want a guy like historian Tom Holland

3622
03:22:59,711 --> 03:23:03,039
How to do that in a modern-day screenplay because it's cinematic

3623
03:23:04,319 --> 03:23:09,951
He turned it into one of these Charge of the Light Brigade type stories

3624
03:23:10,975 --> 03:23:11,999
Spirit of the event

3625
03:23:12,511 --> 03:23:14,303
And he has the this phalanx

3626
03:23:14,559 --> 03:23:18,399
You know advancing into combat and all of a sudden the storm of arrows starts

3627
03:23:19,935 --> 03:23:26,079
Pick up account down there in 150 yards are in 100 yard there in 50 yards you to all the way getting closer and closer than he writes quote

3628
03:23:27,871 --> 03:23:32,991
Those of the enemy directly in their path had already begun scrambling defenses

3629
03:23:33,247 --> 03:23:35,039
If they realize to their horror

3630
03:23:35,295 --> 03:23:37,855
At the wall of shields in iron tip Spears

3631
03:23:38,111 --> 03:23:42,207
Far from providing easy pickings for their Bowman as they had first imagined

3632
03:23:42,463 --> 03:23:43,743
Was not going to be halted

3633
03:23:44,255 --> 03:23:45,023
100 yards

3634
03:23:45,535 --> 03:23:46,047
50

3635
03:23:46,303 --> 03:23:47,327
2010

3636
03:23:47,583 --> 03:23:49,631
Then is the Athenians war cry

3637
03:23:49,887 --> 03:23:51,679
A terrifying you ulation

3638
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:55,007
Rose even above the Thundering of their feet upon the dry Earth

3639
03:23:55,519 --> 03:23:59,359
The cacophony of clattering metal and the screams of the panic-stricken enemy

3640
03:23:59,615 --> 03:24:01,919
The Phalanx crunched into the Persian live

3641
03:24:02,687 --> 03:24:04,479
The impact was devastating

3642
03:24:06,527 --> 03:24:10,367
The Athenians at home their style of warfare in combat with other faillite

3643
03:24:11,135 --> 03:24:13,439
Wooden Shield smashing against wooden Shield

3644
03:24:13,951 --> 03:24:17,279
Iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronze

3645
03:24:17,791 --> 03:24:23,935
Now though Kenny's first terrible seconds of collusion there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into Flash

3646
03:24:24,191 --> 03:24:24,703
Flash and bones

3647
03:24:25,215 --> 03:24:29,311
The rolling of the Athenian tied over men wearing at most

3648
03:24:29,567 --> 03:24:31,359
Quilted Jerkins for protection

3649
03:24:31,615 --> 03:24:32,383
And arms

3650
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:34,943
Perhaps with nothing more than bows or slings

3651
03:24:35,711 --> 03:24:37,503
The hoplites ash Spears

3652
03:24:37,759 --> 03:24:42,111
Rather than shivering is invariably happens when one Phalanx crashed into another

3653
03:24:42,367 --> 03:24:43,647
Could instead

3654
03:24:43,903 --> 03:24:45,183
And stab again

3655
03:24:45,439 --> 03:24:51,583
And those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing

3656
03:24:53,887 --> 03:24:54,399
And quote

3657
03:24:57,215 --> 03:25:03,359
The account by Herodotus leaves out almost all the stuff you'd want to know about him and his official account of the

3658
03:25:03,615 --> 03:25:04,895
The battle this most famous

3659
03:25:06,175 --> 03:25:07,455
Yunnan military

3660
03:25:07,967 --> 03:25:10,527
Charges Against All Odds like I said so

3661
03:25:11,039 --> 03:25:12,831
Charge of the Light Brigade kind of thing

3662
03:25:13,343 --> 03:25:14,111
He says quote

3663
03:25:15,391 --> 03:25:18,463
They fought in the battle at Marathon for a long time

3664
03:25:18,975 --> 03:25:25,119
The Barbarians prevailed in the center of the line where the Persians themselves in the secouer deployed and

3665
03:25:25,375 --> 03:25:28,959
As The Barbarians were winning here

3666
03:25:29,471 --> 03:25:30,495
And chase them inland

3667
03:25:31,263 --> 03:25:35,103
But at the same time the simpletons were prevailing on the wing

3668
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:36,895
In their Victory there

3669
03:25:37,151 --> 03:25:39,711
The Barbarian troops that they had routed

3670
03:25:39,967 --> 03:25:46,111
To flee and then drawing both their wings together they fought those enemy troops would broke

3671
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:48,927
And in this encounter to the Athenians were victorious

3672
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:50,975
And as the Persians fled

3673
03:25:51,231 --> 03:25:55,327
The Athenians pursued them and cut them down until they reach the sea

3674
03:25:55,583 --> 03:25:58,911
Where they called for fire and started to seize the ships

3675
03:25:59,679 --> 03:26:00,191
And quote

3676
03:26:01,983 --> 03:26:02,495
One of the things

3677
03:26:02,751 --> 03:26:03,519
Crazy about her rod

3678
03:26:05,311 --> 03:26:05,823
Screenwriter

3679
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:07,103
That's what we're going to see him

3680
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:08,383
He's here he's trying

3681
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:09,663
How to please an audience

3682
03:26:09,919 --> 03:26:11,199
The Greeks

3683
03:26:12,735 --> 03:26:14,527
And he goes into loving paragraphs

3684
03:26:14,783 --> 03:26:15,295
After paragraph

3685
03:26:15,551 --> 03:26:16,063
Detail

3686
03:26:16,831 --> 03:26:18,111
You know over something like

3687
03:26:18,623 --> 03:26:22,719
Psoriasin is 6 hit team assassin's going after the fall

3688
03:26:23,487 --> 03:26:29,375
For one of the greatest battles in world history even recognized at that time as being a huge deal

3689
03:26:30,655 --> 03:26:33,727
He gives us like three paragraphs from start to finish

3690
03:26:35,263 --> 03:26:38,847
And in those three paragraph she take some time off with some digressions

3691
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:40,127
And the one real

3692
03:26:40,639 --> 03:26:44,479
Solid thing you would think you could count on in terms of a fact turned out to be wrong

3693
03:26:44,735 --> 03:26:45,759
Almost assuredly

3694
03:26:48,063 --> 03:26:50,367
This is a perfect example why so many the history into this

3695
03:26:50,623 --> 03:26:54,719
. have to be like crime scene investigators and how little they have to go on and how they all

3696
03:26:55,231 --> 03:26:57,023
Ingeniously do things like

3697
03:26:57,535 --> 03:26:58,559
Mine

3698
03:26:58,815 --> 03:27:02,399
The plays in the drama being performed in the Greek Theater

3699
03:27:02,655 --> 03:27:03,167
For example.

3700
03:27:03,935 --> 03:27:05,471
Write popular entertainment

3701
03:27:06,495 --> 03:27:07,775
Because the playwrights

3702
03:27:08,031 --> 03:27:09,823
We're writing these plays were often

3703
03:27:10,079 --> 03:27:11,103
10 * veterans

3704
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:13,663
Sometimes veterans at these very complex were talking

3705
03:27:15,967 --> 03:27:18,015
The audience members

3706
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:20,575
They make a joke about

3707
03:27:21,087 --> 03:27:21,599
The

3708
03:27:21,855 --> 03:27:24,927
In a rich guy who shows up at the Phalanx with the super

3709
03:27:25,183 --> 03:27:30,303
Nice clothes in the triple horsehair Crest with the ostrich feathers in the Nimbus 2000 armor

3710
03:27:30,815 --> 03:27:32,351
And then by the end of the battle

3711
03:27:32,607 --> 03:27:37,471
You know it's all brown below the waist because he defecated on himself out of fear

3712
03:27:37,983 --> 03:27:39,263
And the audience laughs

3713
03:27:39,519 --> 03:27:42,079
It's kind of because those things may have happened

3714
03:27:42,591 --> 03:27:45,151
The audience is probably sitting there going I know a guy just like that

3715
03:27:45,663 --> 03:27:46,175
Bright

3716
03:27:46,687 --> 03:27:47,455
Play well

3717
03:27:47,711 --> 03:27:49,247
And historians can go a ha

3718
03:27:49,759 --> 03:27:50,271
Piece together that

3719
03:27:51,295 --> 03:27:53,599
Information into the puzzle of what it was like

3720
03:27:54,623 --> 03:27:55,135
To fight these

3721
03:27:56,415 --> 03:28:01,023
Listen full disclosure here there's a small chance that I told you this entire tail

3722
03:28:02,047 --> 03:28:03,839
So that I'd have a reason to talk about my

3723
03:28:04,095 --> 03:28:04,863
Fascination

3724
03:28:05,887 --> 03:28:06,911
With ancient,

3725
03:28:09,215 --> 03:28:10,495
I'm fascinated with all comp

3726
03:28:11,007 --> 03:28:11,519
Actually

3727
03:28:12,287 --> 03:28:13,311
Because they all

3728
03:28:13,567 --> 03:28:17,407
In all combat experiences tend to score pretty highly on my list of

3729
03:28:17,663 --> 03:28:19,199
Extremes of Human Experience

3730
03:28:21,247 --> 03:28:21,759
By that

3731
03:28:22,271 --> 03:28:23,551
But the different eras

3732
03:28:24,575 --> 03:28:28,927
Each come with their own particularly horrifying variables

3733
03:28:29,695 --> 03:28:32,255
Are there certain elements of warfare there unchanged

3734
03:28:32,511 --> 03:28:33,535
Since the Stone Age

3735
03:28:34,815 --> 03:28:35,583
But there's a ton of different

3736
03:28:35,839 --> 03:28:37,631
Where to write what you facing say

3737
03:28:38,399 --> 03:28:39,679
The Battle of Verdun

3738
03:28:40,191 --> 03:28:44,543
Or the battle of the Somme or something in the first world war different experience from what the ancients

3739
03:28:44,799 --> 03:28:45,567
What's your face

3740
03:28:47,871 --> 03:28:51,711
The Warfare since it's a little like the difference between a hundred yard dash

3741
03:28:52,735 --> 03:28:53,503
You know I'd a

3742
03:28:53,759 --> 03:28:54,271
If you'll pardon the

3743
03:28:54,527 --> 03:28:56,063
Marathon

3744
03:28:58,111 --> 03:28:59,391
Ancient Warfare Sprint

3745
03:29:00,927 --> 03:29:03,999
Modern 20th century in a long War warfare that's

3746
03:29:04,767 --> 03:29:06,303
Hard

3747
03:29:07,327 --> 03:29:07,839
Distance from

3748
03:29:10,655 --> 03:29:12,959
The challenges to the front line Soldier

3749
03:29:13,471 --> 03:29:13,983
Different

3750
03:29:15,007 --> 03:29:16,543
Like the worst game ever

3751
03:29:16,799 --> 03:29:17,567
Would you rather

3752
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:19,615
Would you rather be a

3753
03:29:20,127 --> 03:29:24,479
In a soldier in the trenches in the first world war or would you rather be

3754
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:29,087
An ancient Persian Warrior at the Battle of Marathon take your choice

3755
03:29:31,135 --> 03:29:32,415
The challenges in

3756
03:29:32,671 --> 03:29:34,975
The stress on your psyche is different isn't it

3757
03:29:35,231 --> 03:29:37,791
Two kinds of situations you think of the modern Soldier

3758
03:29:38,303 --> 03:29:41,375
And there's a drip drip drip constant pressure

3759
03:29:41,631 --> 03:29:43,167
If you think about it on the psyche of men

3760
03:29:43,935 --> 03:29:44,703
Will serve

3761
03:29:45,215 --> 03:29:48,799
In a week or two or longer on the front lines in the trenches Under Fire

3762
03:29:49,055 --> 03:29:51,871
24/7 risk of death day after day

3763
03:29:52,895 --> 03:29:54,687
The Beats on you in a certain way

3764
03:29:57,759 --> 03:29:59,039
Warriors facing a different

3765
03:30:00,319 --> 03:30:05,183
There lies a relatively fine most of the time outside of battle day but on Battle day

3766
03:30:05,951 --> 03:30:07,231
The stress the intensity in

3767
03:30:07,487 --> 03:30:08,767
Fear it extreme

3768
03:30:09,791 --> 03:30:13,375
So they don't get a drip drip drip on their psyche they get a title wave

3769
03:30:13,887 --> 03:30:16,703
It on your psyche that hits over the space of a couple of hours

3770
03:30:17,983 --> 03:30:19,775
Equally horrific challenge but death

3771
03:30:21,311 --> 03:30:22,335
I think about myself

3772
03:30:22,847 --> 03:30:24,127
I think this is our modern by

3773
03:30:26,175 --> 03:30:26,943
I think we all have it

3774
03:30:27,711 --> 03:30:30,271
In terms of my modern bias as to what I'm going to

3775
03:30:30,527 --> 03:30:31,295
The first World War

3776
03:30:33,343 --> 03:30:36,927
Which I have described several of the battles of his reminding me

3777
03:30:37,183 --> 03:30:37,695
More

3778
03:30:39,999 --> 03:30:44,863
But the first world war is unimaginable is some of it is is something I can conceptualize

3779
03:30:46,655 --> 03:30:47,679
I think we're conditioned

3780
03:30:48,191 --> 03:30:52,799
To understand better things closer to our own time in the way they fought in the first world war something

3781
03:30:53,311 --> 03:30:54,591
And we grew up understand

3782
03:30:54,847 --> 03:30:55,359
Eating right

3783
03:30:56,383 --> 03:31:02,527
Sit there and use the machine guns there be under Fire it's all a part of our understanding of essentially Modern Warfare

3784
03:31:03,551 --> 03:31:05,343
And what people go through and soldiers we know and

3785
03:31:06,367 --> 03:31:08,159
Ancient Warfare is much more exotic

3786
03:31:08,415 --> 03:31:09,951
Can therefore perhaps carry

3787
03:31:11,231 --> 03:31:13,279
Adults only exotic because of the time difference

3788
03:31:13,791 --> 03:31:16,095
Because they were doing this kind of warfare

3789
03:31:16,607 --> 03:31:19,935
Enough from Stone Age times up until a couple hundred years ago

3790
03:31:21,471 --> 03:31:23,519
But for modern people watching it it looks

3791
03:31:24,799 --> 03:31:27,871
Terrific Lee similar to watching Jack the Ripper at

3792
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:30,687
It is

3793
03:31:31,199 --> 03:31:33,759
Butchery in the pure sense of the word

3794
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:36,831
And it's

3795
03:31:37,343 --> 03:31:37,855
Close up

3796
03:31:39,135 --> 03:31:41,951
You're looking into the eyes of the people you're killing

3797
03:31:44,767 --> 03:31:46,303
Maybe I'm just a modern whim

3798
03:31:46,559 --> 03:31:47,839
But it's a lot easier for me

3799
03:31:48,607 --> 03:31:50,143
To shoot from a cross a

3800
03:31:50,655 --> 03:31:52,703
Nice little intervening distance

3801
03:31:52,959 --> 03:31:55,007
Somebody moving towards me whose face I can

3802
03:31:55,263 --> 03:31:56,287
Just barely make out

3803
03:31:57,055 --> 03:31:58,591
Then it is to sit there and hear the ground

3804
03:31:58,847 --> 03:31:59,871
Once in the ground in the last

3805
03:32:01,151 --> 03:32:01,663
Mouth

3806
03:32:02,175 --> 03:32:03,711
And I think most people feel that

3807
03:32:05,759 --> 03:32:06,527
One soldier

3808
03:32:06,783 --> 03:32:08,063
Corded one of the books I read it

3809
03:32:08,319 --> 03:32:10,111
It said that when you know when you're close up and

3810
03:32:10,623 --> 03:32:11,647
And you can hear them

3811
03:32:12,415 --> 03:32:13,439
It's a b****

3812
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:18,559
When Ancient Warfare most of the time once the arrow fire was done

3813
03:32:18,815 --> 03:32:19,583
When he was a b****

3814
03:32:20,607 --> 03:32:22,399
Here's what historian has been we strike

3815
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:27,775
Concerning the differences in what a soldier in the modern 20th century Great War

3816
03:32:28,287 --> 03:32:28,799
Sample might have faced

3817
03:32:29,567 --> 03:32:30,335
And what the

3818
03:32:31,103 --> 03:32:32,383
Ancient warriors on the

3819
03:32:33,151 --> 03:32:33,919
Battlefield America

3820
03:32:36,223 --> 03:32:36,735
Night school

3821
03:32:37,503 --> 03:32:39,295
The trauma of ancient Greek battle

3822
03:32:39,807 --> 03:32:43,391
Was different from the experiences which leave so many modern soldiers

3823
03:32:43,647 --> 03:32:44,415
Shell shocked

3824
03:32:44,671 --> 03:32:47,231
Or debilitative I post-traumatic stress disorder

3825
03:32:47,743 --> 03:32:49,279
Greek soldiers he writes

3826
03:32:49,535 --> 03:32:53,119
Rarely came close to suffering the extremes of physical deprivation

3827
03:32:53,375 --> 03:32:55,423
Associated with trench or jungle war

3828
03:32:56,191 --> 03:32:58,495
And never saw their friends blown to pieces

3829
03:32:59,007 --> 03:32:59,775
On the other hand

3830
03:33:00,031 --> 03:33:02,591
Hoplites suffered the devastating experience

3831
03:33:02,847 --> 03:33:08,991
Almost unknown in Modern Warfare dominated as it is by long-range fighting with guns artillery and bomb

3832
03:33:09,503 --> 03:33:12,575
I'm standing at no more than an arm's length from the enemy

3833
03:33:13,087 --> 03:33:16,159
And laying into one man after another with spear

3834
03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:18,975
Sword and ultimately bare Hands and Teeth

3835
03:33:19,999 --> 03:33:20,511
And quote

3836
03:33:23,327 --> 03:33:24,607
See this is where

3837
03:33:24,863 --> 03:33:25,887
Ancient combat

3838
03:33:26,911 --> 03:33:28,959
Becomes like my little labret

3839
03:33:29,727 --> 03:33:30,751
For observing

3840
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:33,567
You knowing

3841
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:36,127
What's innate in US vs what's

3842
03:33:37,663 --> 03:33:40,223
Activar culture on our development

3843
03:33:42,015 --> 03:33:42,783
We think about yourself

3844
03:33:43,295 --> 03:33:43,807
Per second

3845
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:47,647
I think you like me can imagine yourself firing rifle

3846
03:33:47,903 --> 03:33:48,415
Some enemy

3847
03:33:49,439 --> 03:33:50,975
Can you really imagine yourself

3848
03:33:51,231 --> 03:33:53,535
Under almost any conditions on the battlefield

3849
03:33:54,047 --> 03:33:59,679
In a holding one end of the spears you drive the other end into the chest or face of another human being

3850
03:34:00,959 --> 03:34:02,239
And by the way you're not done yet

3851
03:34:03,775 --> 03:34:04,287
Do something like

3852
03:34:04,543 --> 03:34:05,055
That again

3853
03:34:05,311 --> 03:34:05,823
You can

3854
03:34:06,847 --> 03:34:09,151
Or if that doesn't work and you down to your other weapon

3855
03:34:09,407 --> 03:34:10,687
In a slicing them

3856
03:34:11,455 --> 03:34:13,503
Or stabbing them with a sword

3857
03:34:14,527 --> 03:34:16,575
Face to face while they try to do the same to you

3858
03:34:17,855 --> 03:34:19,903
I mean some of you can understand that we

3859
03:34:20,159 --> 03:34:20,671
We have all kinds

3860
03:34:20,927 --> 03:34:22,975
The people but I mean for the majority of you out there

3861
03:34:23,743 --> 03:34:25,279
Is this something you could realistic

3862
03:34:25,535 --> 03:34:26,559
Stickley imagine yourself

3863
03:34:26,815 --> 03:34:27,327
Doing

3864
03:34:28,351 --> 03:34:28,863
Under almost

3865
03:34:29,119 --> 03:34:29,887
Any circumstance

3866
03:34:31,935 --> 03:34:35,007
Because remember most of the people in these Greek city-state

3867
03:34:35,519 --> 03:34:36,287
Sparta

3868
03:34:36,543 --> 03:34:37,055
Accepted

3869
03:34:37,567 --> 03:34:43,199
Are regular people minis are not professional Warrior these are commercial people these are Baker's these are farmers

3870
03:34:44,223 --> 03:34:45,247
These are even unit

3871
03:34:45,759 --> 03:34:47,039
The politicians of Athens

3872
03:34:47,295 --> 03:34:48,319
Would be out there even

3873
03:34:49,599 --> 03:34:51,647
Mini people going back to their jobs today

3874
03:34:54,463 --> 03:34:54,975
I can't help it

3875
03:34:55,743 --> 03:34:57,023
Austin the same situation

3876
03:34:57,279 --> 03:34:58,047
I mean if the Great

3877
03:34:58,559 --> 03:35:00,863
Simulation player in the sky

3878
03:35:02,143 --> 03:35:02,911
I can't help but think about

3879
03:35:03,167 --> 03:35:05,727
My Nick Bostrom simulation Theory at a time like this

3880
03:35:05,983 --> 03:35:08,543
If he changes the preference on his game

3881
03:35:08,799 --> 03:35:14,175
To one that no longer allows us to have any weapons that were invented after the year 1300

3882
03:35:14,687 --> 03:35:16,479
Could we go back to fighting

3883
03:35:17,759 --> 03:35:19,295
The way they fought back then

3884
03:35:20,319 --> 03:35:21,599
I mean to recreate

3885
03:35:22,111 --> 03:35:22,879
A

3886
03:35:23,135 --> 03:35:25,951
City-state freightlines maybe the Los Angeles ballet

3887
03:35:26,463 --> 03:35:30,303
Train it up for a little while send it back in time to take on the average

3888
03:35:30,559 --> 03:35:31,583
City-states phalanx

3889
03:35:32,095 --> 03:35:33,119
In ancient Greek times

3890
03:35:33,631 --> 03:35:34,655
And have them

3891
03:35:34,911 --> 03:35:35,423
Not

3892
03:35:35,679 --> 03:35:36,447
Defecate

3893
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:37,983
And run away

3894
03:35:38,239 --> 03:35:40,031
As soon as the spears of the enemy came close

3895
03:35:41,567 --> 03:35:45,663
I mean I'm wondering if you could even trained one of our military units of their way forget the people of Los Angeles

3896
03:35:46,431 --> 03:35:47,199
They may be a little

3897
03:35:47,711 --> 03:35:48,223
Too thin for the

3898
03:35:50,015 --> 03:35:51,295
I need to train a military unit

3899
03:35:51,807 --> 03:35:52,831
Career and send it back

3900
03:35:53,343 --> 03:35:57,695
I bet you they be better at than the Greek Phalanx at maneuvering

3901
03:35:57,951 --> 03:36:00,255
And drill and all that kind of stuff I bet they'd have that down

3902
03:36:00,511 --> 03:36:04,095
It's the Rubber meets the road moment does it counts when they

3903
03:36:04,351 --> 03:36:09,727
Have to face the spirit had long of a citizen Phalanx of Bakers and Potter's and farmers

3904
03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:11,263
You've done this before

3905
03:36:12,031 --> 03:36:14,079
From a culture that understands it

3906
03:36:15,615 --> 03:36:16,383
Do you think our

3907
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:17,919
Even military unit with

3908
03:36:18,175 --> 03:36:19,711
Stand there when the spears start

3909
03:36:20,223 --> 03:36:22,271
Jabbing at each other's faces and

3910
03:36:23,807 --> 03:36:24,575
Not run away

3911
03:36:27,391 --> 03:36:28,159
And here's the

3912
03:36:28,671 --> 03:36:30,463
A question that really gets me thinking

3913
03:36:30,975 --> 03:36:32,255
If you want stand

3914
03:36:33,279 --> 03:36:35,583
Because we just don't do that it's not our culture

3915
03:36:35,839 --> 03:36:37,887
And we don't have what they have anymore

3916
03:36:38,143 --> 03:36:39,935
How long would it take to get it back

3917
03:36:40,447 --> 03:36:41,215
If you decided you know

3918
03:36:41,983 --> 03:36:46,335
The great simulator in the sky just took guns away we have to fight like this if we're going to defend ourselves

3919
03:36:46,591 --> 03:36:47,615
How long would it take

3920
03:36:48,383 --> 03:36:51,455
How long does it take for the culture to rebuild the ability to do

3921
03:36:51,967 --> 03:36:53,759
A skill that has not been necessary

3922
03:36:54,271 --> 03:36:55,039
Very long time

3923
03:36:56,575 --> 03:36:59,647
And the thing is you wouldn't think it would be so difficult theoretically

3924
03:37:00,927 --> 03:37:06,303
But it turns out that over the last several hundred years of people have shot at each other more on the battlefield

3925
03:37:06,815 --> 03:37:07,583
It's become

3926
03:37:08,095 --> 03:37:10,143
Harder and harder to actually

3927
03:37:10,399 --> 03:37:13,983
In a walk-up to somebody else and stick them with the pointy object

3928
03:37:14,751 --> 03:37:16,031
It's been quite a bit written about

3929
03:37:16,543 --> 03:37:17,055
This

3930
03:37:18,591 --> 03:37:19,871
It seems to be both

3931
03:37:20,127 --> 03:37:20,895
Particularly

3932
03:37:21,151 --> 03:37:22,431
Beard as one might expect

3933
03:37:23,199 --> 03:37:24,991
But also particularly abhorrent

3934
03:37:25,503 --> 03:37:27,551
To the people who have to do the skill ring

3935
03:37:29,087 --> 03:37:30,367
Can I run elsewhere this is one of the things

3936
03:37:30,623 --> 03:37:31,391
Make some of the

3937
03:37:31,903 --> 03:37:37,023
Feigned military units out there like the British gurkhas for example that are known for hand-to-hand combat

3938
03:37:37,535 --> 03:37:40,863
You know more particularly intimidating because unlike most people

3939
03:37:41,375 --> 03:37:43,423
They're generally okay with the idea of coming

3940
03:37:43,679 --> 03:37:44,191
When to close Grill

3941
03:37:44,447 --> 03:37:45,215
Most people would rather

3942
03:37:45,983 --> 03:37:46,751
I stay away

3943
03:37:47,775 --> 03:37:50,335
Because obviously it's nasty stuff

3944
03:37:52,127 --> 03:37:53,407
In his book on killing

3945
03:37:54,175 --> 03:37:56,223
Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman says

3946
03:37:56,991 --> 03:37:59,039
It is the proximity to the victor

3947
03:38:00,063 --> 03:38:03,647
That determines you know how resistant to killing people tend to be in that

3948
03:38:03,903 --> 03:38:10,047
By the time you get to like bayonet rain she says the resistance on the part of human beings both on the receiving end in the

3949
03:38:10,303 --> 03:38:12,095
The giving end of the band that is intense

3950
03:38:13,631 --> 03:38:16,191
What happens when you're talking about it. And warfare

3951
03:38:17,215 --> 03:38:20,543
Well that's not an unusual event that it is in Modern Warfare

3952
03:38:21,055 --> 03:38:23,103
It's the way you do business is how you fight

3953
03:38:23,615 --> 03:38:26,431
We stick people with pointy things or they stick us with theirs

3954
03:38:27,711 --> 03:38:28,991
Welcome To War 4

3955
03:38:29,503 --> 03:38:32,575
Well most of human history from the Stone Age until a couple hundred years ago

3956
03:38:33,343 --> 03:38:34,111
Nowadays

3957
03:38:34,623 --> 03:38:36,671
It's the nastiest thing most soldiers

3958
03:38:37,183 --> 03:38:37,695
Condoms

3959
03:38:39,487 --> 03:38:39,999
Grossman

3960
03:38:40,255 --> 03:38:44,095
Along with a lot of other historians goes on to point out how most historians think

3961
03:38:44,863 --> 03:38:48,959
That the idea that there was ever bayonet fighting in a band that's those

3962
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:50,751
Does long nylon the ends of

3963
03:38:51,007 --> 03:38:51,519
Rifles

3964
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:53,567
The people used for a long time

3965
03:38:53,823 --> 03:38:59,967
I'm in the American Revolution we had them Napoleonic Wars the u.s. Civil War the first world war they still use bayonets or have

3966
03:39:00,223 --> 03:39:02,271
For military today

3967
03:39:03,551 --> 03:39:05,855
But it seems like almost never

3968
03:39:06,111 --> 03:39:07,647
Is anyone killed by one

3969
03:39:08,671 --> 03:39:11,487
The Dirty Little Secret apparently according to Grossman another's

3970
03:39:11,999 --> 03:39:13,791
Is that one side always run

3971
03:39:14,047 --> 03:39:16,351
Before having to get stuck by the other

3972
03:39:16,863 --> 03:39:22,239
And usually according to Grossman decided didn't have to stick together so I just kind of glad they didn't have to either

3973
03:39:23,263 --> 03:39:29,407
He says when two bayonet lines came together historically he said quote very often neither side could bring itself to

3974
03:39:29,663 --> 03:39:30,943
Clothes with the enemy's bayonet

3975
03:39:31,199 --> 03:39:36,575
The advanced falters in the two parties begin to fire at one another from ridiculously short-range

3976
03:39:37,343 --> 03:39:37,855
And quote

3977
03:39:38,879 --> 03:39:40,671
Ethan quote some other stories that say when

3978
03:39:41,183 --> 03:39:47,327
Soldiers would come in bayonet range with other soldiers somehow they just managed to turn their guns around or off and using the

3979
03:39:47,583 --> 03:39:49,887
The butts of their rifles is clubbing instruments instead

3980
03:39:50,911 --> 03:39:51,679
He said quote

3981
03:39:52,191 --> 03:39:58,079
We can understand then that the average Soldier has an intense resistance towards bayonet in his fellow man

3982
03:39:58,335 --> 03:40:02,175
And that this act is surpassed only by the resistance to being Bayonetta

3983
03:40:02,687 --> 03:40:05,247
The horror of being Bayonetta

3984
03:40:06,015 --> 03:40:06,527
And quote

3985
03:40:08,319 --> 03:40:14,463
Well of course it is so he said that modern people don't want to stick a knife into anybody else and that they don't want a knife stuck into that

3986
03:40:14,719 --> 03:40:15,743
Makes perfect sense

3987
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:22,655
But nowadays you can avoid that in most cases this is the goal of ancient battle the very thing he

3988
03:40:22,911 --> 03:40:24,191
He says modern people

3989
03:40:24,447 --> 03:40:25,727
Would most like to avoid

3990
03:40:25,983 --> 03:40:28,543
Your groceries according veterans who are saying that the worst thing that

3991
03:40:28,799 --> 03:40:33,151
They ever dealt with was the kind of thing that Greek and Persian soldiers dealt with in every battle

3992
03:40:34,431 --> 03:40:37,759
What's mission of course in this whole question is something from the Persian song

3993
03:40:38,527 --> 03:40:41,087
To try to get an idea of what it was like for a Persian soul

3994
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:44,159
Soldier fighting in a little bit more than

3995
03:40:44,671 --> 03:40:45,695
But at least normal

3996
03:40:46,207 --> 03:40:46,719
From the

3997
03:40:46,975 --> 03:40:49,279
Persian side of things but there aren't any accounts

3998
03:40:50,047 --> 03:40:51,839
Individual soldiers in the ranks

3999
03:40:52,351 --> 03:40:54,399
Or generals or anything from the person side

4000
03:40:54,911 --> 03:40:59,263
Just come down to West it would give us the equivalent of what the Greeks do which is a tiny little window

4001
03:40:59,519 --> 03:41:01,823
One more little tile in the mosaic

4002
03:41:02,591 --> 03:41:04,383
Helping the historical investigators

4003
03:41:04,895 --> 03:41:08,479
To recreate a little bit about what this combat must have been like

4004
03:41:09,759 --> 03:41:13,087
It's sort of historically ironic that what little you can

4005
03:41:13,599 --> 03:41:17,695
Divine about what this must have been like for the Persians you get from the Greek sources

4006
03:41:18,719 --> 03:41:21,791
Often talking about hoplites who fought differently

4007
03:41:22,047 --> 03:41:22,559
Then thereupon

4008
03:41:24,351 --> 03:41:25,119
You have to weed out

4009
03:41:25,375 --> 03:41:25,887
Things that are

4010
03:41:26,143 --> 03:41:28,959
Specifically part of the Greek hoplite experience that would

4011
03:41:29,471 --> 03:41:30,495
Why Persian say something

4012
03:41:31,775 --> 03:41:34,079
And then noticed the other things maybe we would call them

4013
03:41:34,591 --> 03:41:36,383
The physics of the battlefield

4014
03:41:36,895 --> 03:41:38,431
That would be present for anybody

4015
03:41:38,687 --> 03:41:39,711
In a pre gunpowder battle

4016
03:41:40,735 --> 03:41:42,271
But they were talking about the womb

4017
03:41:43,295 --> 03:41:43,807
Beer

4018
03:41:45,599 --> 03:41:51,231
Persian have to deal with that on their side as much as the Greeks have to deal with it on theirs but we may only have the Greeks version of the events

4019
03:41:51,743 --> 03:41:53,023
In order to extrapolate

4020
03:41:53,279 --> 03:41:54,815
What's a person experience must have been like

4021
03:41:56,095 --> 03:41:57,375
Mention the idea

4022
03:41:57,887 --> 03:41:58,399
Times of

4023
03:41:59,423 --> 03:42:02,239
A creeping incontinence and then turning and running away

4024
03:42:03,519 --> 03:42:04,799
Because of these ancient battles

4025
03:42:05,823 --> 03:42:06,335
Beer

4026
03:42:06,591 --> 03:42:07,615
Is the key component

4027
03:42:08,639 --> 03:42:09,919
In fact one could make it

4028
03:42:10,175 --> 03:42:15,039
Kstat the main thing that a general wants to figure out how to do in a battle plan is how to create the

4029
03:42:15,295 --> 03:42:15,807
The biggest chance

4030
03:42:16,063 --> 03:42:17,087
Scare

4031
03:42:18,111 --> 03:42:18,879
The other side

4032
03:42:20,159 --> 03:42:21,695
I mean if you think about people is kind of

4033
03:42:21,951 --> 03:42:28,095
Like spooked animals I've ever seen a horse heard when they get scared and all of a sudden the fear spreads for the initial point

4034
03:42:28,351 --> 03:42:28,863
Contact

4035
03:42:29,119 --> 03:42:31,423
Did a little rattlesnake that scare them or whatever

4036
03:42:31,679 --> 03:42:35,519
And you know sort of Moves Like A shockwave through the whole herd

4037
03:42:36,287 --> 03:42:38,847
That's what people facing danger would choose to do

4038
03:42:39,359 --> 03:42:40,895
Allowed to do whatever came naturally

4039
03:42:41,151 --> 03:42:42,943
Playwright we see danger we go in the other direction

4040
03:42:43,455 --> 03:42:46,015
Part of what military discipline has been

4041
03:42:46,271 --> 03:42:49,599
Aiming to do pretty much since ancient Sumeria or before

4042
03:42:49,855 --> 03:42:54,207
Is to keep people from giving into that natural urge right that's self-defense

4043
03:42:54,719 --> 03:42:57,279
Preservation and evolutionary

4044
03:42:59,583 --> 03:43:00,095
Right

4045
03:43:01,631 --> 03:43:03,679
Reason fear is a bigger more

4046
03:43:03,935 --> 03:43:07,519
Cute problem on an ancient Battlefield in a modern one has to do with the size

4047
03:43:09,055 --> 03:43:10,847
And you have an occasion where units

4048
03:43:11,359 --> 03:43:12,383
Panic and run

4049
03:43:12,639 --> 03:43:13,407
Break route

4050
03:43:13,663 --> 03:43:14,943
Whatever term you want to use

4051
03:43:15,455 --> 03:43:16,735
In the big modern Wars

4052
03:43:17,247 --> 03:43:20,319
That is a small cancer in a big organ

4053
03:43:21,599 --> 03:43:23,135
And it can usually be

4054
03:43:23,391 --> 03:43:25,951
Isolated and cauterized

4055
03:43:26,207 --> 03:43:31,327
Relatively easily without the entire Enterprise along a giant line being too badly affect

4056
03:43:32,351 --> 03:43:35,423
Putting the constrained space of these ancient Battlefield

4057
03:43:36,191 --> 03:43:37,471
And it was contagious

4058
03:43:39,263 --> 03:43:40,543
And you don't know

4059
03:43:41,055 --> 03:43:44,639
How many people it takes to run before

4060
03:43:45,151 --> 03:43:45,919
Do everybody

4061
03:43:47,199 --> 03:43:49,503
Nonetheless when people start to run

4062
03:43:50,527 --> 03:43:53,343
It's almost as though the little fin

4063
03:43:53,599 --> 03:43:55,135
Piece of your intellect that is key

4064
03:43:55,391 --> 03:43:56,671
Keeping you wear your

4065
03:43:56,927 --> 03:43:59,999
Supposed to be due to all military discipline and everything else snap

4066
03:44:01,535 --> 03:44:03,327
Any further saying last one

4067
03:44:03,839 --> 03:44:04,863
Is a rotten egg

4068
03:44:05,887 --> 03:44:07,679
Tianjin Battlefield last one is

4069
03:44:09,215 --> 03:44:10,495
Would be a better phrase

4070
03:44:11,263 --> 03:44:12,031
Because

4071
03:44:12,543 --> 03:44:14,591
When a route happen

4072
03:44:15,615 --> 03:44:18,175
The people most likely to stand and try to

4073
03:44:18,687 --> 03:44:24,831
Stick it out of the ones where the most Brave the least likely to give him the ones that don't want to be cowards and sugars and wanting to run away

4074
03:44:25,855 --> 03:44:27,391
But they're also the last to get away

4075
03:44:27,647 --> 03:44:28,927
The one who gets speared in the back

4076
03:44:29,183 --> 03:44:33,023
First during the pursuit where the majority of casualties are dished out by the way

4077
03:44:34,559 --> 03:44:35,583
That's where you died

4078
03:44:36,095 --> 03:44:38,143
On an ancient battle historian Richard Gabriel

4079
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:43,007
In every Army there is a mob waiting to escape

4080
03:44:43,519 --> 03:44:45,055
And it's motivation is fear

4081
03:44:45,567 --> 03:44:48,127
The real killer on the ancient Battlefield Was Fear

4082
03:44:48,639 --> 03:44:52,223
Men in combat have their instinctive flight or fight responses

4083
03:44:52,479 --> 03:44:55,295
Eldon delicate balance by a thin string of intellect

4084
03:44:55,807 --> 03:44:57,087
Continued stress

4085
03:44:57,343 --> 03:45:01,439
Increases the probability that someone within the ranks will lose his nerve and run

4086
03:45:01,951 --> 03:45:03,999
Sometimes the actions of a single soldier

4087
03:45:04,255 --> 03:45:06,559
Are sufficient to Ford's the onset of panic

4088
03:45:06,815 --> 03:45:08,095
In an entire unit

4089
03:45:08,607 --> 03:45:14,239
Once the Integrity of the formation begin to erode the ancient Soldier was a very great risk of death or injury

4090
03:45:15,519 --> 03:45:16,031
And quote

4091
03:45:18,847 --> 03:45:20,127
So everybody's kind of

4092
03:45:20,895 --> 03:45:27,039
You're trying to stand their ground without wanting to be the last guy to get away if things go badly so and everything

4093
03:45:27,295 --> 03:45:27,807
The hell

4094
03:45:28,575 --> 03:45:30,879
By such a narrow strand

4095
03:45:31,391 --> 03:45:32,159
Of discipline

4096
03:45:33,183 --> 03:45:35,743
The Greeks used to talk about the God Phobos

4097
03:45:37,023 --> 03:45:37,791
And that's from the

4098
03:45:38,047 --> 03:45:39,071
Another route

4099
03:45:39,583 --> 03:45:40,095
Phobia

4100
03:45:40,607 --> 03:45:41,119
Beer

4101
03:45:41,375 --> 03:45:42,655
For the god pan

4102
03:45:45,471 --> 03:45:45,983
Panic

4103
03:45:46,239 --> 03:45:51,103
Who can sometimes come into these ancient Battlefield and sweep through them in like a herd of horses

4104
03:45:51,359 --> 03:45:52,639
You just spook everybody

4105
03:45:52,895 --> 03:45:55,199
I mean if you saw someone get around Your Flank

4106
03:45:55,711 --> 03:46:00,575
An ancient Battlefield you might run you might spook and if you do the unit next to you might spook also

4107
03:46:01,343 --> 03:46:03,647
You see a friendly unit route you might spook and run

4108
03:46:05,183 --> 03:46:06,463
And if a bunch of people

4109
03:46:06,719 --> 03:46:08,511
In your unit start getting

4110
03:46:09,023 --> 03:46:10,559
Torn to Pieces

4111
03:46:11,071 --> 03:46:13,631
In a bloody Carnage right near you

4112
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:17,983
You might decide to turn and run two or your psyche might decide

4113
03:46:19,007 --> 03:46:20,799
Eliminate all choice for the matter

4114
03:46:21,567 --> 03:46:24,127
And Terror blind terramai just take over

4115
03:46:25,919 --> 03:46:27,967
And fear is actually

4116
03:46:28,223 --> 03:46:34,367
You know something that is exploitable and it's paid attention to I mean you feel like there's almost a Connect

4117
03:46:34,623 --> 03:46:35,647
Into the animal kingdom

4118
03:46:35,903 --> 03:46:41,023
You're talking about Warfare in the era where you came to grips with your adversary or nearly so

4119
03:46:41,791 --> 03:46:43,583
Some of those animals are get up on their

4120
03:46:43,839 --> 03:46:48,703
Your hind legs are stand up taller than nickel balls out to make them look bigger

4121
03:46:48,959 --> 03:46:51,007
It's a psychological thing right at the

4122
03:46:51,263 --> 03:46:51,775
It's a

4123
03:46:52,031 --> 03:46:54,079
Intimidation

4124
03:46:54,335 --> 03:46:57,407
Part of the reason these Greeks have these giant

4125
03:46:57,663 --> 03:46:58,687
Crest on their helmet

4126
03:46:59,199 --> 03:47:02,015
Same reason was Napoleonic troops would get those really

4127
03:47:02,527 --> 03:47:04,063
Tall Grenadier

4128
03:47:04,575 --> 03:47:09,439
Captain makes you look taller give you that little bit of extra intimidation imposing

4129
03:47:09,951 --> 03:47:10,719
Factor

4130
03:47:10,975 --> 03:47:14,559
On an opponent at least in Greek times you might come face-to-face with

4131
03:47:15,327 --> 03:47:17,375
And that's when something like a little extra

4132
03:47:17,887 --> 03:47:19,679
Intimidation Factor could be the difference

4133
03:47:19,935 --> 03:47:20,959
Between life or death

4134
03:47:21,983 --> 03:47:22,751
In fact some

4135
03:47:23,007 --> 03:47:27,359
Units were considered to be in some people's and armies were considered to be extra intimidate

4136
03:47:27,871 --> 03:47:32,991
There are stories about whole units running before combat sometimes running after they see the

4137
03:47:33,247 --> 03:47:34,015
Lambda

4138
03:47:34,271 --> 03:47:35,551
On the Spartan Shield

4139
03:47:36,319 --> 03:47:37,343
So that they knew

4140
03:47:38,879 --> 03:47:40,415
Some people didn't wait around

4141
03:47:41,183 --> 03:47:42,719
To see how that was going to turn out

4142
03:47:43,231 --> 03:47:49,375
And so to be intimidating was just one extra thing that helped the Spartans when they actually came to battle and they were

4143
03:47:49,631 --> 03:47:50,399
Bunches of units

4144
03:47:50,655 --> 03:47:51,423
And types of

4145
03:47:51,679 --> 03:47:53,983
The troops that had those sorts of intimidating

4146
03:47:54,495 --> 03:47:55,263
Reputation

4147
03:47:55,519 --> 03:47:56,543
Preceded them

4148
03:47:58,079 --> 03:48:03,199
To be intimidating is something that can actually give you an edge in hand-to-hand combat

4149
03:48:04,991 --> 03:48:07,295
Even that term hand to hand combat

4150
03:48:08,063 --> 03:48:11,135
You know I mean it sounds almost nice. Look like a helping hand

4151
03:48:11,647 --> 03:48:15,487
When in reality I keep trying to remind myself that we are talking about

4152
03:48:15,999 --> 03:48:17,791
You know what if it happened today

4153
03:48:18,559 --> 03:48:21,887
Civilians out of context today would be a face-to-face

4154
03:48:22,399 --> 03:48:23,167
Brutal murder

4155
03:48:25,471 --> 03:48:26,751
In a lot of food you can watch

4156
03:48:27,007 --> 03:48:27,519
Moderately

4157
03:48:27,775 --> 03:48:29,055
Conflicts in many places

4158
03:48:29,823 --> 03:48:30,591
See someone get killed

4159
03:48:31,359 --> 03:48:37,503
And they'll be Manning a gun somewhere moving somewhere and I will send you here crack sometimes from a distance when no one's looking at someone

4160
03:48:37,759 --> 03:48:39,807
Fall down and will be this horrifying experience for all

4161
03:48:40,063 --> 03:48:40,831
Concern

4162
03:48:41,087 --> 03:48:42,111
What is this shock

4163
03:48:42,367 --> 03:48:43,391
It's over in 2 seconds in

4164
03:48:43,647 --> 03:48:46,207
And you don't even the terrorists would have after the fact

4165
03:48:47,231 --> 03:48:50,047
The whole different thing when you get a chance to March up

4166
03:48:50,559 --> 03:48:51,583
And see

4167
03:48:52,095 --> 03:48:52,863
Your face

4168
03:48:53,375 --> 03:48:58,495
You know it marches towards you and you know knowing that one of these not getting out here alive and you both might die

4169
03:49:00,031 --> 03:49:05,919
And as you're getting closer to people summing-up you know which person out of that crowd of people you're running towards you're going to

4170
03:49:06,175 --> 03:49:07,455
Aim towards

4171
03:49:07,711 --> 03:49:13,599
You know what might be aiming towards you what means the thoughts that run through the head the challenge you in different ways in these ancient battles

4172
03:49:16,159 --> 03:49:17,695
You again just wonder how people

4173
03:49:17,951 --> 03:49:18,463
Who did this

4174
03:49:20,511 --> 03:49:21,791
Historians often used

4175
03:49:22,047 --> 03:49:23,071
The book The Iliad

4176
03:49:24,351 --> 03:49:25,119
Stories of Homer

4177
03:49:26,143 --> 03:49:28,959
As a tool to understand kind of how these weapons

4178
03:49:29,471 --> 03:49:31,007
In what kind of wounds that they

4179
03:49:31,263 --> 03:49:32,287
Inflicted an LP

4180
03:49:32,799 --> 03:49:33,567
Reacted

4181
03:49:34,079 --> 03:49:34,591
Because

4182
03:49:34,847 --> 03:49:37,407
The weapons are the same even if maybe how they used it was different

4183
03:49:38,175 --> 03:49:40,223
It's terrifying stuff at 1

4184
03:49:40,479 --> 03:49:41,247
Horrific

4185
03:49:41,759 --> 03:49:47,135
An outcome after another the spear goes through the eye hole in the brain loses down the shaft

4186
03:49:47,391 --> 03:49:48,415
I mean it's stuff like that

4187
03:49:48,671 --> 03:49:51,999
Horrible things lots of people get hit in the groin and it's awful and

4188
03:49:52,255 --> 03:49:53,791
And you turn around you start to realize

4189
03:49:54,303 --> 03:49:59,679
You know maybe the reason that the ancient playwrights in these authors didn't get into the Gory details

4190
03:50:00,191 --> 03:50:03,007
You know about all these battles that we want to hear cuz we can't imagine it

4191
03:50:03,519 --> 03:50:06,591
Might be because the people in their audience might have been trying to forget song

4192
03:50:08,639 --> 03:50:09,407
But it's absolutely

4193
03:50:09,663 --> 03:50:10,175
Terrifying

4194
03:50:10,943 --> 03:50:12,479
Warfare terrifying anyway

4195
03:50:12,991 --> 03:50:13,759
But having to face

4196
03:50:14,527 --> 03:50:15,551
This kind of conflict

4197
03:50:16,319 --> 03:50:18,879
I need a I need a river at least in terms of the Greek phalanx

4198
03:50:19,391 --> 03:50:22,207
A lot of times two people fighting right next to you our relatives

4199
03:50:22,463 --> 03:50:23,743
And friends and loved ones

4200
03:50:23,999 --> 03:50:27,583
Local politicians and the Butcher and the baker in the people that you know

4201
03:50:28,095 --> 03:50:34,239
And that's great in terms of stiffening you and helping your resolving and fostering sort of a camaraderie from people

4202
03:50:34,751 --> 03:50:36,287
You know who are training together all the

4203
03:50:36,543 --> 03:50:38,847
All the time you have the camaraderie naturally cuz you're related

4204
03:50:39,103 --> 03:50:40,127
And you know each other

4205
03:50:40,383 --> 03:50:41,919
And you grew up together and what have you

4206
03:50:43,711 --> 03:50:45,759
But when those people start dying

4207
03:50:46,527 --> 03:50:52,159
It's the double edged sword of that affecting all of a sudden you in the ranks trying to keep it together and not run or watching

4208
03:50:52,415 --> 03:50:56,255
Know your loved ones people you know get speared in the face and having the brain

4209
03:50:56,511 --> 03:50:58,559
Run through the I hold down the

4210
03:50:58,815 --> 03:51:00,095
Shaft of the spear

4211
03:51:00,863 --> 03:51:05,983
Is there I mean it's just it's terrifying on a Visa you don't even know how people control themselves forget about having

4212
03:51:06,239 --> 03:51:08,287
Any sort of conscious sense of fear

4213
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:11,103
The Greeks were terrified to all those people have been

4214
03:51:11,871 --> 03:51:13,663
Let's just say very

4215
03:51:14,175 --> 03:51:14,687
Respect

4216
03:51:14,943 --> 03:51:16,991
Full of the power of combat forever

4217
03:51:18,015 --> 03:51:19,295
Stories abound

4218
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:22,367
Besides the involuntary loss of

4219
03:51:22,623 --> 03:51:25,439
The incontinence Joey say of the of the rancors

4220
03:51:25,695 --> 03:51:28,767
Are there stories of trembling in the ranks their stories

4221
03:51:29,023 --> 03:51:30,047
Teeth chattering

4222
03:51:30,559 --> 03:51:32,607
It was so loud and widespread

4223
03:51:33,375 --> 03:51:35,935
I think we're supposed to have drowned out the sound of a speaker

4224
03:51:37,471 --> 03:51:39,007
People understood what they faced

4225
03:51:39,263 --> 03:51:42,591
And there was involuntary responses to that that are just human

4226
03:51:44,383 --> 03:51:45,407
How to be soldiers deal with

4227
03:51:45,663 --> 03:51:46,175
Lithosphere

4228
03:51:47,199 --> 03:51:48,479
Well how would you deal with it

4229
03:51:48,735 --> 03:51:51,807
How is soldiers dealt with it forever there been widespread

4230
03:51:52,575 --> 03:51:55,903
Conversations shall we say most historians were very long time

4231
03:51:56,415 --> 03:52:01,023
Over how much you should or should not assume the presence of alcohol in a lot of these

4232
03:52:01,279 --> 03:52:02,303
These bottles or other drugs

4233
03:52:03,583 --> 03:52:09,471
There are all kinds of problems trying to figure this out I mean for example in a lot of these cultures they drank a lot anyway

4234
03:52:09,983 --> 03:52:14,335
How do you separate what was the normal wine ration for a breakfast

4235
03:52:14,591 --> 03:52:15,615
For some of these soldiers

4236
03:52:16,383 --> 03:52:22,527
You know from the extra amount they drank because they were going to in the face of wall of Spears that they had to run into head on that day

4237
03:52:23,295 --> 03:52:24,319
Hard to figure

4238
03:52:24,831 --> 03:52:26,623
One historian when asked to

4239
03:52:26,879 --> 03:52:28,159
Theorize about the

4240
03:52:28,671 --> 03:52:29,695
Likelihood

4241
03:52:29,951 --> 03:52:31,999
Of hoplites going into battle drunk

4242
03:52:32,767 --> 03:52:35,327
He said that the likelihood was that they were

4243
03:52:35,583 --> 03:52:36,095
Almost

4244
03:52:36,607 --> 03:52:37,119
Drunk

4245
03:52:38,911 --> 03:52:39,679
So take that for what

4246
03:52:39,935 --> 03:52:41,471
It's worth bunny who would be surprised

4247
03:52:43,007 --> 03:52:44,543
One part of me wonders how people

4248
03:52:45,311 --> 03:52:49,151
Give themselves up to do this with the other part of me wonders how they live with it afterward

4249
03:52:50,943 --> 03:52:51,967
We do things haunt

4250
03:52:55,039 --> 03:52:56,063
How would you react

4251
03:52:56,831 --> 03:52:57,855
If you killed someone by her

4252
03:52:58,111 --> 03:52:59,647
And what if you killed 8 people

4253
03:52:59,903 --> 03:53:00,415
With a knife

4254
03:53:00,927 --> 03:53:01,695
Over your lifetime

4255
03:53:02,207 --> 03:53:02,975
Would that change you

4256
03:53:03,999 --> 03:53:04,767
I would that change

4257
03:53:06,303 --> 03:53:07,839
Would you still be normal

4258
03:53:09,119 --> 03:53:09,631
What is Norm

4259
03:53:13,215 --> 03:53:15,519
What if you done this in the service of your country

4260
03:53:15,775 --> 03:53:16,799
He killed eight people with a knife

4261
03:53:18,335 --> 03:53:19,103
Your hero

4262
03:53:20,639 --> 03:53:22,943
Are you unaffected and if you're affected how are you

4263
03:53:25,759 --> 03:53:27,039
And if that's not normal

4264
03:53:27,295 --> 03:53:30,623
Especially in our society today and that person is unusual

4265
03:53:31,135 --> 03:53:32,671
You know when compared to the normal

4266
03:53:32,927 --> 03:53:35,743
In a rank-and-file of the population have an unusual experience

4267
03:53:37,279 --> 03:53:39,583
What about the ancient world were in some of these places

4268
03:53:39,839 --> 03:53:43,423
You can reasonably expect a decent percentage of the

4269
03:53:43,679 --> 03:53:47,519
Are people in these societies to kill people in hand-to-hand combat sometimes multiple

4270
03:53:49,567 --> 03:53:51,871
So in other words what might be very

4271
03:53:52,383 --> 03:53:53,919
Abnormal in the society

4272
03:53:54,175 --> 03:53:54,687
HBA

4273
03:53:55,199 --> 03:53:58,271
Person has killed multiple people with an edged weapon might be a

4274
03:53:58,527 --> 03:54:00,063
Relatively normal expiry

4275
03:54:01,599 --> 03:54:02,879
How does that change the society

4276
03:54:05,183 --> 03:54:06,463
I mean when people could say

4277
03:54:06,719 --> 03:54:07,487
My husband is

4278
03:54:07,743 --> 03:54:08,511
My dad did

4279
03:54:08,767 --> 03:54:10,559
That my grandfather did that until 16th

4280
03:54:11,583 --> 03:54:13,631
And I hope my son will grow up someday and do that

4281
03:54:15,423 --> 03:54:16,191
I'm human.

4282
03:54:16,703 --> 03:54:20,031
Are the carrots and sticks in the expectation levels in society

4283
03:54:20,287 --> 03:54:21,823
How does that alter the equation

4284
03:54:23,871 --> 03:54:29,503
And this whole question about culture and environment and nature nurture I guess you could say it even goes back to

4285
03:54:30,015 --> 03:54:31,807
Really manifests when you

4286
03:54:32,063 --> 03:54:34,367
When you read some of the debates between the experts

4287
03:54:34,879 --> 03:54:36,415
I'm weather in talking to people

4288
03:54:36,927 --> 03:54:39,999
Suffered from what we would call today post-traumatic stress disorder

4289
03:54:40,767 --> 03:54:43,327
Because of their involvement in this kind of murderous cons

4290
03:54:45,119 --> 03:54:50,239
Historian Richard Gabriel suggested there must have been thousands of psychological casualties after these

4291
03:54:50,751 --> 03:54:52,031
Terrible ancient battles

4292
03:54:53,055 --> 03:54:55,359
But there's a whole school of thought that suggests

4293
03:54:55,615 --> 03:54:57,151
That that's not true

4294
03:54:58,687 --> 03:55:00,735
And by the way it's been wonderful to see the addition

4295
03:55:00,991 --> 03:55:05,087
To the traditional historians in classicist to been dealing with this kind of question forever

4296
03:55:05,599 --> 03:55:06,879
Neuroscientist

4297
03:55:07,391 --> 03:55:10,719
Evolutionary biologists biochemists and people who

4298
03:55:10,975 --> 03:55:13,791
In the focus so much on how the brain functions because

4299
03:55:14,047 --> 03:55:20,191
Some of this stuff that these people go through can be impacted by the way they were raised but some of the stuff is just how your brain is why

4300
03:55:21,215 --> 03:55:25,311
Hard to figure out where one ends and the other begins and the debate is fantastic

4301
03:55:27,359 --> 03:55:27,871
For example

4302
03:55:28,127 --> 03:55:29,407
If we went back in

4303
03:55:29,663 --> 03:55:33,247
Are there mythical encounter between the Los Angeles Phalanx in the

4304
03:55:33,503 --> 03:55:34,783
City-state of themes

4305
03:55:35,295 --> 03:55:40,415
Do you think if you could go interview the survivors of the Los Angeles Phalanx 40 years later

4306
03:55:40,927 --> 03:55:46,559
Can we be expecting some psychological PTSD hangover type casualties some effects

4307
03:55:47,839 --> 03:55:49,887
I imagine we would all expect there to be

4308
03:55:51,679 --> 03:55:54,495
Let's just say haunting memories at the very least

4309
03:55:56,287 --> 03:55:59,615
The question over with of the Ancients actually suffered from this that was interest

4310
03:56:00,383 --> 03:56:01,663
As you might imagine

4311
03:56:01,919 --> 03:56:08,063
You know historians and others comb through the original material in fact at the Battle of Marathon

4312
03:56:08,319 --> 03:56:09,087
Rattata says

4313
03:56:09,343 --> 03:56:11,647
There was a case that modern day

4314
03:56:11,903 --> 03:56:14,719
Researchers often point to is an example of

4315
03:56:15,231 --> 03:56:19,327
It'll PTSD Herodotus says there's a story of a soldier who went blind

4316
03:56:19,583 --> 03:56:20,095
Get the bottle

4317
03:56:20,607 --> 03:56:21,887
But who's totally unhinged

4318
03:56:23,679 --> 03:56:26,239
The story is that he saw Warrior huge warrior with

4319
03:56:26,495 --> 03:56:28,031
The huge beard coming to strike him

4320
03:56:28,287 --> 03:56:30,591
And instead the warrior struck the man next to him

4321
03:56:30,847 --> 03:56:33,407
And the site instantly disappeared from this man

4322
03:56:33,663 --> 03:56:39,807
And he never got it back and a lot of is I said modern-day researchers pointed that is an example of what in the first World War II

4323
03:56:40,063 --> 03:56:42,367
Hysterical blindness

4324
03:56:44,159 --> 03:56:45,439
Are these guys are with reading Khalid

4325
03:56:45,695 --> 03:56:49,279
Convergence disorder or something like that it's above my paygrade to understand

4326
03:56:51,071 --> 03:56:56,191
But the point was just a suggested in twentieth-century combat it would not be an unexpected thing to have happen

4327
03:56:59,263 --> 03:57:01,055
Anthropologist Alan Young for exam

4328
03:57:01,311 --> 03:57:01,823
Apple says

4329
03:57:02,591 --> 03:57:06,175
That what we call PTSD today is not timeless

4330
03:57:06,431 --> 03:57:07,455
Or uniform

4331
03:57:08,223 --> 03:57:10,783
He says that the idea of traumatic memory is

4332
03:57:11,039 --> 03:57:12,575
Quote

4333
03:57:13,087 --> 03:57:16,671
And quote something that originated in nineteenth-century thought

4334
03:57:17,183 --> 03:57:18,207
Nieces quote

4335
03:57:18,719 --> 03:57:20,767
Before that time there is unhappiness

4336
03:57:21,023 --> 03:57:23,583
Despair and disturbing recollections

4337
03:57:23,839 --> 03:57:27,167
But no traumatic memory in the sense that we know it today

4338
03:57:28,191 --> 03:57:29,727
Inshort the person

4339
03:57:29,983 --> 03:57:30,751
Quotes and letters

4340
03:57:31,007 --> 03:57:34,335
Reading from says it's a culturally conditioned response to trauma

4341
03:57:35,615 --> 03:57:36,127
And quote

4342
03:57:37,407 --> 03:57:39,455
The person I'm quoting from those historian Lawrence

4343
03:57:39,967 --> 03:57:40,479
Trindle

4344
03:57:40,735 --> 03:57:42,271
Who is suggesting that do

4345
03:57:42,527 --> 03:57:43,039
2

4346
03:57:43,295 --> 03:57:45,599
Neuroscience now becoming involved

4347
03:57:46,111 --> 03:57:52,255
It's starting to look more and more like the responses that modern-day soldiers have just some of their combat experience

4348
03:57:52,511 --> 03:57:53,791
Aziz time listen

4349
03:57:54,303 --> 03:57:56,095
As a sort of a universal Soldier

4350
03:57:56,351 --> 03:57:57,119
Call it a spec

4351
03:57:57,375 --> 03:57:58,399
With the kind of thing

4352
03:57:58,911 --> 03:58:02,751
Where modern day soldiers would be able to commiserate with these hoplites

4353
03:58:03,007 --> 03:58:06,591
With these Persians at Marathon and talk about some similar things may

4354
03:58:09,407 --> 03:58:14,015
I brought your mother rejecting things that suggest that the Greeks for example maybe the Persians to

4355
03:58:14,271 --> 03:58:20,415
Wind of had any bad thoughts about the people that killed they would have been haunted by ghosts and stuff like that because

4356
03:58:20,671 --> 03:58:22,975
All the societal carrots and sticks reward that

4357
03:58:23,487 --> 03:58:26,303
You know they would have been Norwich notches on the story about the

4358
03:58:26,559 --> 03:58:31,679
The family honor would have gone up nothing no societies really discourage the killing of

4359
03:58:32,191 --> 03:58:38,335
You know enemies to the people or the state or your local District or what-have-you so there would have been a ton

4360
03:58:38,591 --> 03:58:39,103
Vim support

4361
03:58:39,359 --> 03:58:43,711
The idea of the great things have been done things worth bragging about as opposed to

4362
03:58:44,223 --> 03:58:44,991
You're fretting about

4363
03:58:46,527 --> 03:58:47,551
At the same time

4364
03:58:47,807 --> 03:58:53,439
Anybody's liable to go through these experiences that just haunt your nightmares and you wake up in cold sweats

4365
03:58:53,951 --> 03:58:58,559
From later I forget about you killing somebody else how about you narrowly being killed yourself

4366
03:58:59,327 --> 03:59:03,679
We're watching your body have that spear shoved through his face or whatever it might be

4367
03:59:03,935 --> 03:59:05,215
The Panic of the moment

4368
03:59:05,471 --> 03:59:08,799
Isn't it just human to expect that that might come and find you later

4369
03:59:09,055 --> 03:59:09,823
In your dreams

4370
03:59:10,079 --> 03:59:10,847
Or elsewhere

4371
03:59:12,127 --> 03:59:14,943
Or does your culture insulate you somehow from that

4372
03:59:15,199 --> 03:59:15,711
2

4373
03:59:16,991 --> 03:59:18,527
Article I read suggested

4374
03:59:19,039 --> 03:59:24,671
Maybe a case could be made that enough of these societies were enough of those people had experienced incidents like that

4375
03:59:24,927 --> 03:59:26,975
Could be called a traumatized Society

4376
03:59:27,743 --> 03:59:29,023
And does that explain thing

4377
03:59:29,791 --> 03:59:30,303
That it

4378
03:59:30,559 --> 03:59:32,351
It wouldn't go through and did I mean

4379
03:59:32,863 --> 03:59:38,495
Does it take a traumatized Society to fight him one of these battle that would traumatize us today cuz they're insulated from it

4380
03:59:40,287 --> 03:59:41,311
I don't know the answer to any

4381
03:59:42,079 --> 03:59:45,151
I find them all fascinating I find the laboratory

4382
03:59:45,407 --> 03:59:46,943
It helps us to

4383
03:59:47,199 --> 03:59:50,527
Do experiments with these kinds of questions is ancient battle

4384
03:59:51,551 --> 03:59:54,111
Door opens up the door I told you I'm totally fascinated by

4385
03:59:54,367 --> 03:59:55,647
What does can tell us about

4386
03:59:55,903 --> 03:59:57,695
People and culture and stuff like that

4387
03:59:59,743 --> 04:00:02,559
And when we think about cultural differences for a minute

4388
04:00:02,815 --> 04:00:08,703
Let's remember what people grew up watching

4389
04:00:09,215 --> 04:00:13,311
We need more people that in a lot of these areas enjoy going to executions

4390
04:00:13,567 --> 04:00:14,847
For the entertainment value

4391
04:00:15,871 --> 04:00:17,663
Right select remember that a little bit

4392
04:00:17,919 --> 04:00:22,527
Victor Davis Hanson tells a story in trying to give us an idea about how terrifyingly horrible

4393
04:00:23,295 --> 04:00:24,063
The battlefield

4394
04:00:24,319 --> 04:00:27,647
For the day after the battle was over in any of these ancient battles

4395
04:00:28,159 --> 04:00:29,183
And he says

4396
04:00:29,439 --> 04:00:30,463
That's sites

4397
04:00:31,487 --> 04:00:37,631
Would go to the battle but sometimes if the rulers would one these battles would actually in a fairy the sightseers over

4398
04:00:37,887 --> 04:00:42,751
Sometimes couldn't even keep up with the demand

4399
04:00:43,263 --> 04:00:48,639
Just for entertainment value. Let me say something here I know we're sick bunch

4400
04:00:48,895 --> 04:00:54,271
And I know that if you put this stuff up on YouTube a lot of you out there would go and watch it

4401
04:00:56,063 --> 04:00:57,599
Many of you out there

4402
04:00:57,855 --> 04:01:01,695
Would click on the website video that showed you one

4403
04:01:02,207 --> 04:01:03,231
These battlefields aft

4404
04:01:04,255 --> 04:01:07,327
You know which is really indicative of how nasty these battles are

4405
04:01:07,583 --> 04:01:09,631
Because unlike Modern Warfare

4406
04:01:09,887 --> 04:01:11,679
This all happens in a confined

4407
04:01:11,935 --> 04:01:18,079
Space and it is the confined space to create the uniquely horrific slaughterhouse that is an ancient Battlefield

4408
04:01:18,335 --> 04:01:19,103
By the way

4409
04:01:19,359 --> 04:01:20,895
Is a historically

4410
04:01:22,687 --> 04:01:26,015
Nobody will ever see this again and nobody has seen it for like 400 years

4411
04:01:27,295 --> 04:01:29,343
This kind of Slaughter in a combined space

4412
04:01:29,855 --> 04:01:33,183
Would you go on the tour I said I want to be in that hot air balloon

4413
04:01:33,439 --> 04:01:37,535
Which by the way I read another book someone else said so I'm obviously ripped it off on consciously

4414
04:01:38,047 --> 04:01:40,095
But I've often said I want to be up there in the hot air balloon

4415
04:01:40,351 --> 04:01:42,143
Looking down and answering all of my questions about

4416
04:01:42,399 --> 04:01:43,167
Hardest formation

4417
04:01:43,423 --> 04:01:45,215
No drill actually move on the battlefield

4418
04:01:45,471 --> 04:01:49,311
Totally forgetting that going on a hundred feet below me is app

4419
04:01:49,567 --> 04:01:50,079
Salute

4420
04:01:53,919 --> 04:01:58,271
People absolutely scared out of their mind cutting each other up at the I mean

4421
04:01:58,783 --> 04:01:59,295
Madness

4422
04:02:01,599 --> 04:02:02,623
And there's no way

4423
04:02:02,879 --> 04:02:04,671
I'm going on the foot tour

4424
04:02:04,927 --> 04:02:07,743
Afterwards I had somebody I knew once you said that you know

4425
04:02:07,999 --> 04:02:09,023
You can kind of say that

4426
04:02:09,279 --> 04:02:11,583
Modern Warfare is like a bunch of jumbo jet

4427
04:02:11,839 --> 04:02:12,607
Crashing

4428
04:02:12,863 --> 04:02:14,655
Over a relatively wide are

4429
04:02:15,935 --> 04:02:16,703
Antibodies are off

4430
04:02:16,959 --> 04:02:21,567
Burned or corn nuts considered to be an extra bad thing if you're the first Rewards

4431
04:02:21,823 --> 04:02:22,847
The torna bodies are

4432
04:02:23,103 --> 04:02:24,895
Destabilizing to your mind it's awful

4433
04:02:25,663 --> 04:02:26,687
And the smell is like

4434
04:02:27,199 --> 04:02:27,711
You know of

4435
04:02:27,967 --> 04:02:28,991
Explosives

4436
04:02:29,247 --> 04:02:30,271
Fuel

4437
04:02:30,527 --> 04:02:31,807
But if you go to an ancient battle

4438
04:02:32,063 --> 04:02:32,575
Oil field

4439
04:02:33,087 --> 04:02:34,367
It looks a lot more like a

4440
04:02:34,623 --> 04:02:35,903
Bunch of individual murder

4441
04:02:39,487 --> 04:02:40,767
Basic basically made it sound like you

4442
04:02:41,023 --> 04:02:42,559
Kind of walk the battlefield

4443
04:02:43,071 --> 04:02:48,191
And recreate what you were seeing this guy stabbed that guy these two people kill each other but both died I mean

4444
04:02:48,703 --> 04:02:50,239
You're watching a lot of different

4445
04:02:50,495 --> 04:02:52,799
Individual stories when you walk those Battlefield

4446
04:02:53,311 --> 04:02:54,591
And you're getting your shoes

4447
04:02:55,359 --> 04:02:56,127
Extremely dirty

Victor Davis Hanson reconstruct

And with one of these fields must have look like and remember he's talking about the onlookers who would go afterwards

4450
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:05,087
To experience

4451
04:03:05,343 --> 04:03:05,855
That's what it was like

4452
04:03:06,623 --> 04:03:07,135
At one of these

4453
04:03:07,903 --> 04:03:12,255
Battlefield the day afterward by the way Herodotus is like 6400 Persians

4454
04:03:12,767 --> 04:03:14,559
Diet marathon in about 200 degrees

4455
04:03:15,583 --> 04:03:16,351
Which shows you

4456
04:03:16,863 --> 04:03:19,679
At one side of ancient battle could be if those numbers are correct

4457
04:03:20,703 --> 04:03:22,751
Imagine going to the battlefield the day out

4458
04:03:23,007 --> 04:03:24,031
After that he was a handsome

4459
04:03:24,287 --> 04:03:24,799
Describes

4460
04:03:25,311 --> 04:03:26,591
The reality of this

4461
04:03:27,103 --> 04:03:29,151
Historically extinct thing

4462
04:03:29,407 --> 04:03:31,455
It must have been very familiar to

4463
04:03:31,967 --> 04:03:34,271
Are human beings for tens of thousands of years

4464
04:03:34,783 --> 04:03:35,551
Your rights quote

4465
04:03:37,343 --> 04:03:39,903
Besides the sheer concentration of bodies

4466
04:03:40,159 --> 04:03:42,463
The most common site to these onlookers

4467
04:03:42,719 --> 04:03:45,279
Would have been the quantity of spilled blood and gore

4468
04:03:45,535 --> 04:03:48,095
And some of the larger battles between hoplites

4469
04:03:48,607 --> 04:03:49,887
Deleon leuctra

Template AI

4471
04:03:51,167 --> 04:03:55,519
Thousands of corpses lay with huge gaping wounds from the spear and sword

4472
04:03:56,031 --> 04:03:58,079
Since the flash was never incinerated

4473
04:03:58,335 --> 04:04:00,127
As it came to be in modern battles

4474
04:04:00,383 --> 04:04:06,527
By the explosion of bomb and she'll head because the entry and exit wounds created by double-edged irons

4475

Beerheads

4476
04:04:07,551 --> 04:04:11,135
Tends to be larger than those caused by Small Arms fire

4477
04:04:11,391 --> 04:04:14,719
The bodies would have drained much of their bodily fluids upon the ground

4478
04:04:15,231 --> 04:04:17,279
Walking among the pile of corpses

4479
04:04:17,535 --> 04:04:20,351
Entailed treading everywhere over stained Earth

4480
04:04:20,607 --> 04:04:21,631
And pools of blood

4481
04:04:22,655 --> 04:04:28,799
Olivia says that after Zama the battlefield was so thick with bloody corpses that it was nearly impossible to advance

4482
04:04:29,055 --> 04:04:29,823
Dance over the ground

4483
04:04:30,079 --> 04:04:30,847
Would suggest

4484
04:04:31,103 --> 04:04:33,151
That many had attempted to do just that

4485
04:04:33,407 --> 04:04:35,455
In his famous description of cornea

4486
04:04:35,711 --> 04:04:38,271
Xenophon recalls that the very Earth had turned red

4487
04:04:38,783 --> 04:04:41,087
A phrase that was probably no exaggeration

4488
04:04:41,599 --> 04:04:45,183
And in Sicily at the final Slaughter of the Athenians in 413

4489
04:04:45,439 --> 04:04:48,767
The bodies of the Dead lay piled on top of each other in the water

4490
04:04:49,023 --> 04:04:51,327
Their spilled blood turning the very current read

4491
04:04:51,839 --> 04:04:53,887
Plutarch recorded a similar picture

4492
04:04:54,143 --> 04:04:57,471
After the death of some 25000 makedonian pipeman impedance

4493
04:04:57,983 --> 04:04:59,519
The entire playing there he says

4494
04:04:59,775 --> 04:05:01,055
Was filled with Corpses

4495
04:05:01,311 --> 04:05:03,359
And the river lukose ran red with their blood

4496
04:05:04,127 --> 04:05:05,407
Again this seems likely

4497
04:05:05,663 --> 04:05:09,247
If each of the following men lost a mere third of his 6 quarts of blood

4498
04:05:09,503 --> 04:05:11,295
Either during the final moments of death

4499
04:05:11,551 --> 04:05:13,343
Or after the corpse lay in the dust

4500
04:05:13,599 --> 04:05:16,671
There could have been more than 10000 gallons to stoke the feel

4501
04:05:19,743 --> 04:05:22,559
10000 gallons of blood soaking a field that

4502
04:05:22,815 --> 04:05:24,863
20 football fields long

4503
04:05:26,911 --> 04:05:27,679
Tumi

4504
04:05:28,191 --> 04:05:33,055
Simply walking that feel the next day would be one of the extremes of Human Experience

4505
04:05:33,567 --> 04:05:36,639
I can't imagine being one of the people who had to create that

4506
04:05:37,663 --> 04:05:38,175
Or

4507
04:05:38,431 --> 04:05:38,943
To be honest

4508
04:05:39,455 --> 04:05:40,991
Anyone want to try to clean it up

4509
04:05:44,063 --> 04:05:46,367
The mess at Marathon afterwards

4510
04:05:46,623 --> 04:05:47,391
Could not have been tidied

4511
04:05:47,903 --> 04:05:48,415
Too quickly

4512
04:05:48,671 --> 04:05:49,439
Because one of the things

4513
04:05:49,695 --> 04:05:51,999
Of course being very different man than yours truly

4514
04:05:52,511 --> 04:05:54,559
That we are told that the Spartans

4515
04:05:55,071 --> 04:05:57,375
Wanted to do as soon as the Moon's phase

4516
04:05:57,631 --> 04:05:59,935
You know turn correct and they were able to show up

4517
04:06:00,191 --> 04:06:01,983
Too late to fight in the battle

4518
04:06:02,495 --> 04:06:03,263
But apparently

4519
04:06:03,775 --> 04:06:07,615
Not too late to see the bodies and they wanted to go look at the dead Persians in the battle

4520
04:06:07,871 --> 04:06:08,383
Field

4521
04:06:12,223 --> 04:06:13,247
R2 on the way

4522
04:06:14,015 --> 04:06:14,527
Different times

4523
04:06:18,367 --> 04:06:18,879
The aftermath

4524
04:06:19,135 --> 04:06:20,415
After the Battle of Marathon

4525
04:06:20,927 --> 04:06:25,023
Is frustrating from a military history standpoint because didn't you say earlier that

4526
04:06:25,535 --> 04:06:26,815
This is an occasion where

4527
04:06:27,583 --> 04:06:30,655
Tactical weapon systems actually impact

4528
04:06:31,423 --> 04:06:34,495
History all the way up to the really big trends and forces level

4529
04:06:35,775 --> 04:06:40,895
But there's not enough information about how this battle went the way it did for you to discern anything

4530
04:06:42,431 --> 04:06:48,575
I mean you want to know how the cavalry's going to face off against the hoplites and how that weird weapons system anomaly is going to play

4531
04:06:48,831 --> 04:06:51,135
Play out but he doesn't even mention the cavalry

4532
04:06:51,647 --> 04:06:53,439
Which is why everyone wonders where it is

4533
04:06:54,975 --> 04:06:58,815
When you wonder about the archery and is the machine gun archery just going to mow these hoplites down

4534
04:06:59,071 --> 04:07:01,375
Piranhas it doesn't mention anything about the archery either

4535
04:07:02,655 --> 04:07:04,703
The only thing you mentioned with any certitude

4536
04:07:05,215 --> 04:07:06,239
Is he said

4537
04:07:06,495 --> 04:07:11,871
That the Victorious wings of the Greek army turned around and surrounded

4538
04:07:12,127 --> 04:07:15,199
End of the Persian Center in other words a double envelopment which

4539
04:07:15,967 --> 04:07:18,783
I can't find historian to think yes that's likely

4540
04:07:19,295 --> 04:07:23,647
Inna. We're Greeks were better trained and better drilled in the Hellenistic era

4541
04:07:23,903 --> 04:07:26,463
You still rarely could have a single envelopment

4542
04:07:26,975 --> 04:07:28,255
Historians suggest

4543
04:07:29,023 --> 04:07:31,583
It's a little strange to think that these citizen hoplites for

4544
04:07:31,839 --> 04:07:32,351
From Athens

4545
04:07:32,863 --> 04:07:34,143
We're able to achieve a double

4546
04:07:34,399 --> 04:07:35,167
Especially

4547
04:07:35,423 --> 04:07:36,959
Planning to and then carry

4548
04:07:37,471 --> 04:07:37,983
Doubt

4549
04:07:39,007 --> 04:07:39,775
So the one thing around it

4550
04:07:40,031 --> 04:07:40,543
Just tells you changed

4551
04:07:40,799 --> 04:07:41,823
How to not be true

4552
04:07:42,847 --> 04:07:43,359
History

4553
04:07:43,615 --> 04:07:44,639
Enable play with ideas

4554
04:07:45,151 --> 04:07:48,735
The Greeks were victorious that they had a lot more to fight for which is certainly true

4555
04:07:50,015 --> 04:07:53,343
But all speculation and it doesn't tell you anything and you feel like you waited

4556
04:07:53,599 --> 04:07:56,671
You threw a whole thing for a cliffhanger episode

4557
04:07:56,927 --> 04:08:01,023
And then the Cliffhanger episode of the show you're watching has a cliffhanger episode at the end

4558
04:08:02,815 --> 04:08:05,119
Is the heavyweight fight that ends on a foul

4559
04:08:05,375 --> 04:08:09,215
Although let's not take anything away from the Greek Victory it's huge

4560
04:08:09,471 --> 04:08:09,983
That's right

4561
04:08:11,519 --> 04:08:13,055
Nathaniel take such pride in

4562
04:08:13,311 --> 04:08:17,663
Their Victory Marathon that they will continually be reminding Greeks of it for a very long time

4563
04:08:19,199 --> 04:08:20,991
Famous playwrights will have it put

4564
04:08:21,247 --> 04:08:21,759
On there

4565
04:08:22,015 --> 04:08:25,343
Or the equivalent of their Tombstone instead of any reference to there

4566
04:08:25,855 --> 04:08:27,135
It'll work in the theater

4567
04:08:27,391 --> 04:08:29,183
I want you to know I fought at Marathon

4568
04:08:29,695 --> 04:08:30,719
The medes know it

4569
04:08:31,743 --> 04:08:32,511
That kind of thing

4570
04:08:33,535 --> 04:08:34,303
So becomes

4571
04:08:34,559 --> 04:08:35,839
Apart of Mythology

4572
04:08:37,119 --> 04:08:39,679
And not just Greek mythology but as we said at the beginning

4573
04:08:39,935 --> 04:08:42,239
In a western traditional mythology

4574
04:08:43,263 --> 04:08:45,567
Ever since but from the Persian point of view

4575
04:08:46,335 --> 04:08:49,663
A marathon may have even just been a single setback

4576
04:08:50,175 --> 04:08:53,503
On an expedition that had tons of positives

4577
04:08:54,271 --> 04:08:56,575
Pierre brillant suggest that this whole affair

4578
04:08:57,343 --> 04:08:58,111
Was a

4579
04:08:58,367 --> 04:09:00,415
Punitive Expedition you know we burned

4580
04:09:00,671 --> 04:09:01,951
Eritrea we

4581
04:09:02,207 --> 04:09:02,975
Had most

4582
04:09:03,231 --> 04:09:07,071
Of the area submit earth and water to the great Kings of before we

4583
04:09:07,583 --> 04:09:10,143
Left those places work beholden to us now they are

4584
04:09:11,167 --> 04:09:13,215
So you have one step back at Marathon

4585
04:09:13,727 --> 04:09:16,799
Troops we can easily replace money we have more than we need

4586
04:09:18,335 --> 04:09:19,103
And by the way

4587
04:09:19,615 --> 04:09:25,759
They don't really look like a beaten Army when they leave Marathon we're told that the Battle of Marathon ends when the Persian to get on their ships and

4588
04:09:26,783 --> 04:09:27,807
But where did they go

4589
04:09:28,575 --> 04:09:34,207
They don't go home like tail between their legs straggling hoping that they're not chase down

4590
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:37,791
You don't run down to the ground they go to Athens

4591
04:09:39,327 --> 04:09:45,471
They take another stab at getting into the city at the Army's not there we just lost the only reason why not sale around take advantage

4592
04:09:45,727 --> 04:09:49,311
Image of our extra mobility and capture Athens while they're gone and again

4593
04:09:49,567 --> 04:09:50,591
Are rumors of

4594
04:09:50,847 --> 04:09:56,223
Fifth columnists inside the city saying how now and field flashing on the top of mountain sides you know

4595
04:09:56,479 --> 04:09:56,991
Who knows

4596
04:09:59,295 --> 04:10:00,831
And you have another part of the story which is

4597
04:10:01,087 --> 04:10:03,135
Is famous again from the Greek point of view

4598
04:10:03,391 --> 04:10:04,415
Troops at Marathon

4599
04:10:04,927 --> 04:10:11,071
Go to 25 miles on foot at high speed faster than you can even expect them by the time the Persian Fleet pulls into the harbor

4600
04:10:11,327 --> 04:10:13,887
What happens if they see the army they just lost to

4601
04:10:14,143 --> 04:10:15,167
Waiting there for the

4602
04:10:16,959 --> 04:10:23,103
So now they compare the profit-and-loss column and especially if breandan others are right in this is more of a Expedition it's on

4603
04:10:23,359 --> 04:10:24,639
Achieve the major goals

4604
04:10:25,151 --> 04:10:26,175
So now they go home

4605
04:10:27,967 --> 04:10:34,111
And while the Greeks and especially the Athenians are justifiably proud of defeating the Persians at Marathon and they

4606
04:10:34,367 --> 04:10:35,903
Should be what are the odds of that

4607
04:10:37,951 --> 04:10:38,463
You can't help

4608
04:10:39,487 --> 04:10:39,999
But think there was

4609
04:10:40,255 --> 04:10:41,279
What's happened here now

4610
04:10:42,047 --> 04:10:44,607
Is the Dave managed to go from

4611
04:10:44,863 --> 04:10:45,631
Anet

4612
04:10:46,143 --> 04:10:47,935
It was a minor annoyance

4613
04:10:48,191 --> 04:10:52,799
What's on a dragon or a giant and they were absent-mindedly swatting at them with their hand

4614
04:10:53,567 --> 04:10:56,639
Just something the bit hard enough to get their full attention

4615
04:10:58,431 --> 04:11:00,479
And find themselves now in the cross

4616
04:11:00,735 --> 04:11:01,247
Harris

4617
04:11:02,783 --> 04:11:04,831
I'm a man who's not just a king of

4618
04:11:06,367 --> 04:11:09,183
But he's been on the throne for more than 30 years

4619
04:11:10,207 --> 04:11:11,743
Is uberconference

4620
04:11:12,255 --> 04:11:14,047
What is people according to Herodotus

4621
04:11:14,815 --> 04:11:16,095
You don't think of him as a shop

4622
04:11:16,863 --> 04:11:20,703
Or hoxter we thought of it more like a CEO he reminds me of like a

4623
04:11:20,959 --> 04:11:22,751
A Steve Jobs type character

4624
04:11:23,007 --> 04:11:23,519
You're somebody who's

4625
04:11:24,031 --> 04:11:25,823
In a whole sort of being

4626
04:11:26,079 --> 04:11:28,639
Is infused in the corporate structure

4627
04:11:29,663 --> 04:11:30,943
I mean after 30 years of world

4628
04:11:31,199 --> 04:11:31,967
The Persian Empire has

4629
04:11:32,479 --> 04:11:33,759
Psoriasis all over it

4630
04:11:34,527 --> 04:11:35,295
And now

4631
04:11:36,063 --> 04:11:37,087
He decides

4632
04:11:37,855 --> 04:11:39,903
If he's going to lead a bigger

4633
04:11:40,415 --> 04:11:41,439
Better prepared

4634
04:11:42,463 --> 04:11:43,487
Expedition

4635
04:11:43,999 --> 04:11:44,767
To Greece

4636
04:11:46,047 --> 04:11:46,559
Can self

4637
04:11:48,863 --> 04:11:50,143
If you want something done right

4638
04:11:50,911 --> 04:11:51,935
Sometimes you just have

4639
04:12:00,639 --> 04:12:02,943
If you think to show you this hurt is worth a dollar

4640
04:12:03,199 --> 04:12:04,991
Dan and Ben would love to have it

4641
04:12:05,247 --> 04:12:07,039
Abacus show it's all we ask

4642
04:12:07,551 --> 04:12:11,647
Go to dancarlin.com for information on how to donate to the show

4643
04:12:11,903 --> 04:12:13,695
Can you have drama without the drama

4644
04:12:15,999 --> 04:12:16,511
It's something like

4645
04:12:17,279 --> 04:12:17,791
Myself

4646
04:12:18,047 --> 04:12:18,559
Look ahead

4647
04:12:18,815 --> 04:12:19,327
Head to the neck

4648
04:12:19,583 --> 04:12:20,607
Next part of the story

4649
04:12:21,631 --> 04:12:24,703
Because if you believe the ancient sources they always make it sound as though

4650
04:12:25,471 --> 04:12:28,031
The mainland Greek life Ethiopians in the Spartan

4651
04:12:28,287 --> 04:12:29,567
Really had little or no Kane

4652
04:12:30,079 --> 04:12:30,591
With the Persian

4653
04:12:31,103 --> 04:12:32,639
Until.the. We just talk

4654
04:12:34,431 --> 04:12:35,967
But once that. Happens

4655
04:12:36,735 --> 04:12:38,783
The Greeks and the Persians you can just see there

4656
04:12:39,039 --> 04:12:40,063
Fates become like

4657
04:12:40,831 --> 04:12:42,623
Unbreakable linked with each other

4658
04:12:45,183 --> 04:12:50,303
And it influences the story dramatically because the dramatic people who are writing about it

4659
04:12:51,071 --> 04:12:53,887
Take the dry facts that you might be able to glean

4660
04:12:54,399 --> 04:12:55,679
From the Babylonian record

4661
04:12:56,703 --> 04:12:57,471
Uniform toddler

4662
04:12:58,239 --> 04:12:59,007
And make them laugh

4663
04:13:00,031 --> 04:13:01,311
They reject the coloring

4664
04:13:01,567 --> 04:13:02,335
Into the situation

4665
04:13:04,383 --> 04:13:08,735
If you talk about big political type things like I tended you in the shows

4666
04:13:09,247 --> 04:13:10,527
Those are dramatized

4667
04:13:10,783 --> 04:13:11,295
My people like

4668
04:13:12,319 --> 04:13:15,391
The Persian Empires doing things in other corners of the rim

4669
04:13:15,647 --> 04:13:18,463
Things that you can sometimes find out about her green

4670
04:13:18,719 --> 04:13:21,279
From things like Babylonian cuneiform tablet

4671
04:13:21,535 --> 04:13:24,607
But that doesn't mean they're dramatic and sometimes there's very little to talk about

4672
04:13:25,119 --> 04:13:25,887
Other than to say

4673
04:13:26,143 --> 04:13:27,679
We can tell that the Persians were

4674
04:13:27,935 --> 04:13:28,703
Operating in the North

4675
04:13:28,959 --> 04:13:29,471
Used to their empire

4676
04:13:29,727 --> 04:13:30,239
During these years

4677
04:13:32,287 --> 04:13:34,335
If a rata tesoura Greek tells that story

4678
04:13:34,847 --> 04:13:36,895
There's probably a love affair involved

4679
04:13:37,151 --> 04:13:39,199
For some wonderful Oracle has spoken

4680
04:13:39,455 --> 04:13:43,039
Or somebody's doing some stuff that he's getting some karmic payback for

4681
04:13:44,831 --> 04:13:47,903
So even though we want to look at the story more from the Persian side

4682
04:13:48,415 --> 04:13:51,487
Pain is normal we're going to be hamstrung like everyone else and we are going to

4683
04:13:51,999 --> 04:13:52,511
Have to

4684
04:13:53,023 --> 04:13:54,047
And you know let's be honest

4685
04:13:54,303 --> 04:13:56,351
It's hard to not lovingly Embrace some of these

4686
04:13:57,119 --> 04:13:58,143
Persian and Greek

4687
04:13:58,655 --> 04:14:00,703
Kabuki dances that they do with each

4688
04:14:02,495 --> 04:14:03,007
Try to look at

4689
04:14:03,263 --> 04:14:04,287
Depression side as much as

4690
04:14:04,543 --> 04:14:05,055
We can

4691
04:14:06,847 --> 04:14:10,175
But as always you're getting the Dan Carlin version of the story and I find

4692
04:14:10,431 --> 04:14:14,527
You just like a filmmaker would be give me as much of latitude please as you can give Oliver Stone

4693
04:14:14,783 --> 04:14:19,903
To take the part of the story out to just blow my mind and string them together I always figured you can get

4694
04:14:20,159 --> 04:14:22,207
The traditional telling of the story

4695
04:14:22,463 --> 04:14:24,767
From some more credible Source than yours truly

4696
04:14:25,023 --> 04:14:29,119
But you can't get my incredible telling of the story from any credible source

4697
04:14:30,911 --> 04:14:33,215
I don't know if that's a compliment or not but

4698
04:14:34,495 --> 04:14:35,775
In the next episode of this program

4699
04:14:36,287 --> 04:14:38,079
We're going to start out pretty darn soon

4700
04:14:38,335 --> 04:14:39,359
At the beginning

4701
04:14:39,871 --> 04:14:40,639
Which war

4702
04:14:42,175 --> 04:14:43,711
And it's one of the most famous Wars ever

4703
04:14:45,503 --> 04:14:47,039
I'm going to be followed by

4704
04:14:47,807 --> 04:14:49,343
Some similar conflicts after that

4705
04:14:51,391 --> 04:14:51,903
If this

4706
04:14:52,415 --> 04:14:53,183
Little

4707
04:14:53,695 --> 04:14:57,023
Intertwined Destiny between the Greek and the Persian

4708
04:14:57,791 --> 04:15:03,935
Little People's it's a little like I was thinking it's a little like a man and a woman that just can't stay away from each other but they had this poisonous relay

4709
04:15:04,191 --> 04:15:04,703
Relationship

4710
04:15:05,215 --> 04:15:11,359
And maybe at some point the man representing the Persian Empire who's the CEO of

4711
04:15:11,615 --> 04:15:12,383
Amigos back

4712
04:15:12,639 --> 04:15:13,919
And finally breaks away and

4713
04:15:14,175 --> 04:15:17,503
And the toxic relationship has ended and then somehow some way

4714
04:15:17,759 --> 04:15:20,063
The Greek Spitfire woman shows up

4715
04:15:20,575 --> 04:15:23,135
With a new abusive boyfriend to punch him in the nose

4716
04:15:23,391 --> 04:15:25,439
Oh did I just give the rest of the show away

4717
04:15:26,207 --> 04:15:30,303
Well probably in the next episode but I've learned to make no promises

4718
04:15:30,559 --> 04:15:31,071
That

4719
04:15:31,327 --> 04:15:32,351
And a whole bunch more

4720
04:15:33,375 --> 04:15:34,399
As we continue this

4721
04:15:35,423 --> 04:15:36,191
Maybe endless

4722
04:15:36,703 --> 04:15:37,215
Sakai

4723
04:15:38,239 --> 04:15:39,007
With Kings of

4724
04:15:40,031 --> 04:15:40,543
Part 3
