EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:47,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm very interested
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:48,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In pain
EDL	00:00:49,920	00:00:53,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not a masochistic Carissa District way
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:55,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm interested in pain and suffering
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:58,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For much the same reason that
EDL	00:00:58,112	00:01:00,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Virtually All of You Are
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:03,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Look at the entertainment you consume
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:08,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take out all of the physical and mental pain and suffering what do you have left
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:13,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's a source of Art and always has been
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:14,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because it's
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Speaks to us on a human level
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does it matter how many things are different
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:23,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With human beings Through the Ages and how much the culture changes us
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:27,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much the technology makes us different from our forebears
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We can all understand pain
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:32,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think about it a lot
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:38,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I say that I'm interested in the extremes of The Human Experience what does that mean
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:42,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes I break it down I think it just means pain
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mental and physical
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:50,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You start to wonder about being so interested in that by James Baldwin the writer
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:56,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wonderfully I thought when he pointed out that this connects us to each other
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:57,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any road quote
EDL	00:01:58,784	00:02:03,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But then you read
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:11,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most with a very things that connected me with all the people who were
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:13,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Oral I've never been alive
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:18,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's such a strange thing this pain right this
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:21,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Evolutionary
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:26,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Adaptation that's probably saved more human lives than anything fear and pain together especially
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The same time
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:31,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think of the loophole
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:35,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think it's a loophole that I wouldn't want to fight say that it's an evolutionary feature
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:36,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think of the
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:42,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Loophole that the infliction of pain the ability to turn your own senses against U2
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hurt you
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:46,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think about what a huge role that's played in history
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:53,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going from a place where the pain is so useful to tell you you just put your hand on a hot stove
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:57,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To a place where somebody else can put your hand on a hot stove
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:03:01,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To hurt you deliberately for one reason or another then all of a sudden
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those sensors that keep you safe
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:06,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are the very
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:07,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Weapon used to hurt you
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:12,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To torment you and to compel you to do things against your will
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Strange thing this
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:16,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sense
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:23,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	My reaction to other people's pain and suffering fascinating to isn't it
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:26,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can sort of run the gamut
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anywhere from
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:29,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Empathy and sympathy
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Two kind of
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:34,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amusement or enjoyment
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:38,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe even you could say emotional voyeurism
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But in our defense
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most of the time the kind of
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pain and suffering we're enjoying is
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Back pain
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:55,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Theatrical pain storytelling pain Hollywood pain and suffering
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:03:59,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And no one getting hurt for real
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:00,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:04,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The more real something seems
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:09,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The more emotionally intense it can be and that can be more satisfied
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:14,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	My kids have been watching
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:22,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Live performances of plays on television and they make a big deal about how it's live and in front of you in more real that way
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:23,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I thought what if they did
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:24,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Action
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:30,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Films or maybe not even the action film just the trailers the promos that run
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:34,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Before the movie that you go to see assuming you still go to see movies
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:36,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is a
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:41,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did a live performance in front of an audience of that in a real car crashes
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Real bullets in the real guns
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What would be a horror show wouldn't it
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:51,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think they go quickly off-script is the bodies piled up at
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:53,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No person in there
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:57,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decent sensibilities would go to watch people killed in public for entertainment
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:05:00,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But of course we all know
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:02,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people have done that
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which is the normal behavior
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:11,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The one that says oh my God torturing and killing people in public for entertainment is barbaric
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the people that say
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:19,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As someone from a time. Where this was common and approved of behavior might say
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hey wait a minute
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:24,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You just put a thin veil
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between what you like
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what we like
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:30,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We both like the same thing
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:31,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He just like yours to be faked
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:39,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whatever part of the brain is enjoying it maybe the same part is being titillated one way or the other
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'd like to warn those who might be squeamish
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:50,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But this particular story is going to be very graphic indeed even by our standards
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:53,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the fact
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:56,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we need to issue such a warning
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:59,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because we might be too sensitive about this
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it self fascinating
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because once upon a time there were people
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:11,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who would appreciate a warning also about this kind of stuff at the warning that they wanted was the one that it was going to happen
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:16,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So they made sure they got there and didn't miss the live version
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in fact for a lot of them
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:23,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that they can get the jump on the high ticket prices that we're going to be charged for the rooms close enough for you to actually Witness
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Smell see and hear
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tortures and executions done live
EDL	00:06:32,959	00:06:35,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a lot of fascinating things about us I think
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the story I want to talk about today but it all revolves around
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:46,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The question of pain one way or the other end in the lot of the stories that we talked about the pain is everywhere in the
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:47,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	StoryBots
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:48,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Interspersed
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:53,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And melded together with the topic in this story it is Center Stage
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:58,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not that long ago
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human beings went to public executions were torture was a huge part of the event
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In order to watch and enjoy it
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:10,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the heck is that
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:17,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well we never promised answer is around here cuz there's no one qualified to give them
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:23,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Questions about what this might say about us either today or back then
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In perpetuity
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:29,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pretty fascinating to but as I said
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:32,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not for the squeamish and if you want the people who can't handle this good for you
EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of us
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:37,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are still fascinated by this
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:38,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reasons
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:41,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That I like to think are
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:47,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	High-minded and educational interesting I hope it's just not a
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:50,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historical voyeuristic
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:56,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trip through time to do the equivalent of virtually sitting in the seat next to that
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:08:02,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectator at the Roman Colosseum where he watches people devoured by lions
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:06,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the things I have to keep reminding myself
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is that if I were born in a different place
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:14,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In different time if you took a baby as I've always said from now in a time machine back to
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This Roman era for example
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:23,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You or your kid might be sitting down next to the guy eating the equivalent to popcorn while you watched wild beasts of
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Flower people for your pleasure
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:30,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's obvious isn't it that there's a huge cultural influence on what's going on here
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:34,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's not obvious maybe at least not to me
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is which direction the cultural influences operating
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:45,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it bloodthirsty times like the era of the Roman games in the Colosseum and whatnot
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Creating
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bloodthirsty human beings that like this stuff or is it
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:50,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Catering to
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:53,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An innate need I mean this question gets
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Really deep when you ask
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:57,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's the default human setting
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:01,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or whether or not you enjoy watching others pain and suffering For Your Entertainment
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:09,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because the really uncomfortable question is to say that yes cultural influences are playing a huge role in whether or not people like this stuff
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's modern-day culture
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just making that stuff not as popular that used to be in other words
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:21,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The default setting of humankind is to enjoy the stuff in the Roman Colosseum and it's only modern
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Enlightened
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:26,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thinking and rationality and empathy with other human beings that is
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:29,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sort of blunted that natural enjoyment
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we said a minute ago
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:37,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people from another time. Might argue if we started wagging are finger what they enjoyed
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:38,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we both enjoy the same thing
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We just like our version to be fake
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:45,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The human equivalent of that little
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:51,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Disclaimer you get at some movies where they'll point out that no animals were actually injured in the making of This film
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well these days we feel the same way about people that have for quite some time no people were actually injured in the making
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This piece of entertainment
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:10:01,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there are people who are purists
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:02,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It would say wash
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't go in for that kind of fakery
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Make my
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Torture violence and what not real
EDL	00:10:11,583	00:10:13,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm not even sure
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:15,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That that's true to be honest
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Depends on
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what side of the bed I woke up
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the morning I'll senecal I'm feeling but
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:24,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It does occur to me from time to time
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:28,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's an untested unproven sort of an assertion that we in the modern develop
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:33,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Enlightened posted like the world that we like our violence fake when were the
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:38,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When were the public ever given the equivalent of a blind taste test on this
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:46,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If we released two movies very similar to each other on the opening Blockbuster Summer movie Seasons first day
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they have to compete head-to-head
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:53,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one is a traditional full of movie Magic in the actors all get-out
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know just doing fine so the film
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:59,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Has to go head-to-head against a groundbreaking new piece of performance art
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:05,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is so unusual that several of your favorite actor did not survive the production of this film everything you see and it is real
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who do you think wins
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:15,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know after one week of ticket-buying you know how many people go to one film over the other what are the reviews
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:18,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But I bet it's a hit
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That would be weird when it is hard to imagine
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:26,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So what if we imagine something that's just as weird but you could see it happening
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Imagine some tin-plated
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:34,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dictator in some poor impoverished countries already executing
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:38,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Everyone he thinks is a criminal anyway probably publicly to
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:40,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How is own people and keep his regime afloat
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if he just decided listen
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a demand for this I could treat it like
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:51,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of those restaurants that serves endangered species on the menu where people would pay $10,000 a plate just to taste something
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:54,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That you never tasted before no one will ever taste again
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many people have seen a public execution we did they pay to go
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Be interesting to think about list
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Famous celebrities that might sign up for something like that just to say they went
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Selfie from the
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:07,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Live execution
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:12,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'd be interested just from the human experiment and data research soda
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:13,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	View of course
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:19,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If the guy just inflated dictator decided to do it all Pay-Per-View globally
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:20,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Esl
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	5995 get to see the execution will be some preliminaries with staging this for entertainment
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:33,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fire Winnie Stacy's big boxing tournaments righteous are you going to have opening acts
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:38,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Walkout fighting is a whole bunch of things that go into keeping the public happy enough to want to buy this again
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We don't get to be the dictator even of a chain plated
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:45,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a little country somewhere else without having a few
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And bits of understanding how to play the crowd
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:52,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'd be very interested the day after
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Something like that occurred
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:58,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To look at the statistics of which countries which regions which peoples
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:05,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Body to the pay-per-view more or less when did be interesting to see which country shunned it or hardly bought at all
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which is which countries
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:08,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Really bought more than their share
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think that would be some interesting human data
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:16,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then I suppose we would have to hope that something like that when the numbers didn't show up
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But they didn't show it was some sort of hit
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can you imagine how that would
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:26,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Blow open the door to incentivizing any number of cash-starved tin-plated dictators
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To Elbow their way into the
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:32,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lucrative in a virtual execution tourism Market
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:40,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But even if something like that happened there is a layer of emotional protection mean you're not there
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:43,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just like there's a layer of emotional protection
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:49,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between you know a live 5995 pay-per-view execution and what a lot of people look at online right now
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can go see
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:56,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historic footage of assassination attempts and executions heck you can go watch
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of the Nazis hung for their war crimes not the
EDL	00:13:59,935	00:14:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Big people in Orangeburg that there were lots of other
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:07,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A punishment down the line and some of them are online and I don't think you were statist if you view it not at all
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's something different is it that happened a long time ago
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:17,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's some Detachment and it being a two-dimensional image maybe even a black-and-white certainly grainy whatever
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Takes you
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More and more away from the scene and there's
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:25,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You said yourself this is like watching a boxing match 35 years ago
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:29,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I know the outcome and no one's hurting right now so somebody got hurt in that fight it's long over
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if you're watching it live it's not
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:40,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let me just contemplate for a minute the idea of watching an execution live I mean if the laws change where you live in all of us
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This became possible and they were going to have one
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:45,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the nearest good-sized city near you
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many of your friends and neighbors do you think would show up to watch
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:52,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you think there be a difference between
EDL	00:14:52,415	00:14:58,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know people who make a lot of money and people who don't make alot of money people have one religious Faith or people have no religious Faith or another
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You see what I'm saying would be interesting to see
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who showed up and why just has a
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mass Humanity psychological experiment
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would you go
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you did
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:12,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What do you think would be the motivation curiosity
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:17,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The idea that listen this isn't some stage thing like
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:22,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You binge-watch on TV Anything could happen right you don't know what's going to go on one of these things
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if it was weird the first time that it happened how long
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:32,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you think how many of these things would it take before people became comfortable with
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If they ever became come
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People with it
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let me blow your mind for a minute if you don't already know about
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's talk about an execution
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That occurred
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:48,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not in the Middle Ages although you would think it was from there when you hear it
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Execution occurred in Paris
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:55,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not all that long ago as a matter of fact to give you an idea of context
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:59,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	George Washington is a full grown adult and is already
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:02,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Been through a war and commanded troops in battle for the British
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It involves a guy who tried to kill the king of France in
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	B1750
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in March 1757
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:14,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He was going to pay for that crime
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:16,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And hundreds of
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thousands of people
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:19,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Flocked into Paris
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:21,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To make sure they had a chance to see it
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:24,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And according to historian Paul Friedland
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people of Paris
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Love
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Execution
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:31,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He said that he italicized the word love

EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:28,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not only weren't the Apollo they were liking it
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:31,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He says this is fake and writing quote
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:38,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Casanova who considered the spectacle quote and offense against our common humanity and quote
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:41,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reports that he several times closed his eyes
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:43,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And blocked his ears to the atrocity
EDL	00:24:43,776	00:24:49,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that his companions were riveted by the spectacle and never once diverted their gaze
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:54,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They felt no compassion for Danielle and they said due to the enormity of his crime
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Casanova's friend to redis
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:02,464	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even had surreptitious sex with one of the women while the ghastly execution proceeded
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:09,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other eyewitnesses describe members of the crowd especially the ladies watching with detached disinterest
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reven chattering and laughing
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	00:25:14,752	00:25:19,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I should point out that this was a particularly extra nasty execution
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:20,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The these people enjoyed
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:24,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because The Executioner's really didn't know what they were doing
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Been done one of these executions in a while
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:34,464	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And when things didn't go as planned they had to improvise for example when they were trying to tear this person apart with four
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:36,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Horses pulling in different directions
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He didn't tear apart
EDL	00:25:38,816	00:25:39,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They had to work
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:45,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know by cutting the joints and seeing if that would help with that didn't help the head to start pulling the limbs in different directions
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:48,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And people
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:53,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would have considered this because they were looking for novelty and the unexpected perhaps
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:25:54,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An added
EDL	00:25:57,504	00:25:59,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The reason this is so interesting
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:02,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is how many of us could have gone
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I seen that
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's different about us
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:10,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And people only a couple hundred years ago
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:13,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who has I said didn't just go and watch this and endure it
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's sacrifice and paid a lot for the privilege
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:22,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are we the more normal example of
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:25,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People on the default setting when it comes to watching
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:26,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other people suffering
EDL	00:26:27,456	00:26:28,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or they
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or maybe that's too cut-and-dried a distinction
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe it depends
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:39,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On who's the pain and suffering is being experienced by
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if the person
EDL	00:26:42,304	00:26:47,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who is providing the entertainment the person being torn apart the hapless victim
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is not in fact
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So hapless
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:55,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And maybe has a lot of victims themselves every what if you are doing this to a horrible
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:57,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Murderous dictator
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:27:00,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You think you're bad people from history
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:07,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I always throw Hitler in there because he sort of my quintessential example but you can fill in the blanks write you have some terrible terrible person
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:12,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Go Saddam Hussein maybe in a rock and let the Shiites in Iraq
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:14,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Watching being torn limb to limb
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:21,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does that take an attitude which if it was anyone else you would be horrified that you were enjoying watching this
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectacle because it's that
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Demonic individual
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:27,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You going to enjoy every last shriek
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now the actual idea
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:33,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For this
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:35,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Talk today this discussion came to me
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:39,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	After re-reading a book that's very interesting it's the
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's a book about the diary of
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:43,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An executioner
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lived in the
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In 15 1600 in that.
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it was fascinating because
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It reminds us that there are multiple shall we say
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:57,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Viewpoint
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:28:03,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In all of these Affairs that we were just discussing these tortures terrible execution will obviously
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:08,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We've been focusing on the audience the people that would like to watch this stuff and isn't that sick
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe not depending on what
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Really
EDL	00:28:11,648	00:28:12,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,464	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there are other angles
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're just as fascinating that book on the Executioner
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:20,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was fascinating to think about the person tasks
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would you doing this I was bad as it is to watch it
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:25,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What about the person who molested
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:28,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Carry out the actual things
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:32,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The modern sensibilities would suggest even watching should make you sick
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that became
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:41,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Germ of an idea to look at this for multiple Vantage points because you have
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:42,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:45,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner and of course the vantage point
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:46,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of the victim
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you want to
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:54,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wonder about what goes on in the minds of people in extreme situations
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is it like to mount that scaffold
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:29:01,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Haven't had plenty of time to think about what you're about to face
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Get up there and look out
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:08,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A crowd of thousands of people that have come to watch you go through with your about to go through
EDL	00:29:09,760	00:29:11,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then begin to go through it
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:12,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bit by bit
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:16,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For hours on end
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:22,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you want the understatement of the century there's a quote attributed to
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Robert Francois
EDL	00:29:25,888	00:29:31,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As he's let out to go begin his ordeal that would take hours and end up with him in pieces
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He just said
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rumor Has It Anyway
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's going to be a hard day
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:45,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I wonder if there was a way to add up all the people in human history
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:48,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The found themselves in that same position that
EDL	00:29:48,928	00:29:50,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's going to be a hard day
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:54,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the position execution victims since the dawn of time
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:57,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I wonder how many of those people there were
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:03,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean public executions have pretty much been going on since history has been
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Written down right we all understand
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's not
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:09,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ubiquitous it's not everywhere all the time but my goodness
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the amount of
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:16,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cultures over the arrows that utilize public executions
EDL	00:30:16,832	00:30:18,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He is far more common than not
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:22,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we said earlier it's an obvious purpose for the state doesn't it
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's a message
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:27,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the Assyrians
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:33,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In one of the earliest people to carve this message in stone showing what they did to people who broke their
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:34,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Biggest laws
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:39,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a way of making sure that even if you weren't there to watch it live you can still get the message
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:45,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Herodotus the so-called father of History so that's how far back we're going here
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tells the story which may or may not be true
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:51,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That one of the early Kings of Persia can't Pisces II
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Force the Nobles of Egypt
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:59,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To convene in a public place to watch 2000 of their children killed in front of them
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:07,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's not for entertainment value because you can't imagine a more horrifying seeing if that were true right away
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is that sound like
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it sends a message doesn't it from the ruler Persian all the people in Egypt
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:15,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Interstate Concord
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:18,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or this will happen again
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:26,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Chinese having been around essentially forever is a civilization also
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:29,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Very familiar with the use of public executions
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a tool of
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:33,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of enforcing state power and sovereignty
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:36,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they've been around so long they've been able to
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:38,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Live through many different eras
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:42,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where are the ideas of legal reform and capital punishment will change
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:45,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some more liberal some quite Draconian indeed
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Chinese are one of the very early civilizations
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:51,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To attempt to deal with crime
EDL	00:31:51,552	00:31:53,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a way that sometimes comes into Vogue
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This idea that
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:58,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if you just punished every little teeny crime in the most severe way
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:01,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wouldn't that just deter everything
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Moron that later
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:09,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the new world of course there are plenty of examples the Aztecs with their
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:16,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tearing of the beating heart out of the sacrificial victims were there war captives or not
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:23,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the northeast of the United States famously other tribes there used to torture people to death in the tri would gather round and
EDL	00:32:23,552	00:32:25,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take part in it including

EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:02,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The fact that people may have been having a good time watching this you can't tell for example
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:06,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You look back on the Assyrian reliefs the carvings were they show

EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:18,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You first start seeing that phenomenon
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:19,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In Rome
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:20,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bright

EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:29,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And people showing up the way you would go
EDL	00:33:29,600	00:33:32,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To a pro wrestling match today
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:36,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If the wrestlers were fully armed

EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:41,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And animals by the way
EDL	00:33:42,400	00:33:46,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is where you clearly can see because the records are so good
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:47,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Connection between enjoyment
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:52,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And horrific

EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:04,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These people are enjoying themselves and going to Great Lengths
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:06,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To make sure they don't miss
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In these horrific
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:13,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Murderous encounters that will play out in front of them in real time
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So let's look at Rome for a minute
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:24,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As part of an evolution or maybe you could call it like you don't really like to grasp history
EDL	00:34:24,384	00:34:30,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you had a wonderful graph like a stock market graph for periods in time we're human beings overtly wanted to
EDL	00:34:30,784	00:34:33,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You do this more for whatever reason including
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A culture that might really encourage it
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Roman gladiatorial game era
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:44,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe the high watermark in history on that graph because it's hard to find anything
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	White so
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:46,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Brazen
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:49,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About the commercialization
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Marketing
EDL	00:34:51,264	00:34:52,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:53,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Staging
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:54,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:56,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Torture and death
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a spectator event
EDL	00:35:00,992	00:35:03,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When it's fascinated people for a long time
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean cuz it's so obviously an interesting question about
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Humanity and Human Nature
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rome's Arenas and the violence that was perpetrated in them in the
EDL	00:35:15,328	00:35:17,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The almost modern marketing of
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:25,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The understanding of what the customer wanted and how things should be advertised in the order that it is
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When should happening
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:28,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As I said a minute ago stage
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And also many of the modern media
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:37,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the Dynamics were also implied the need to continually for example
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:41,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Provide new and novel and more inventive and grandeur
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:44,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectacles to keep the people coming back
EDL	00:35:46,816	00:35:49,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there's all sorts of theories on how this developing
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:56,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's this linear progression from in a very early Roman things and then layer-by-layer new things get added three
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Example when Rome becomes Morgan Empire
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It starts conquering more far-flung places you begin to see
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:06,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The importation of exotic animals from strange locale
EDL	00:36:07,040	00:36:11,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this becomes part of the van right when an animal show the local arena
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:14,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the people can come and look at the animals but somehow that turned into
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:20,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People can come and look at the animals kill each other and have men kill the animals that animals kill the men in
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:24,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Listen to the scale of what we're talking about this becoming eventually
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:28,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And bear in mind this idea that once upon a time
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:34,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It'll probably advertising that you had a giraffe and a monkey and an elephant might be enough to bring the people into the seats
EDL	00:36:35,456	00:36:37,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But eventually you got to go
EDL	00:36:38,016	00:36:39,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Two extremes
EDL	00:36:40,832	00:36:43,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will Durant writing a long time ago

EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:00,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what does that look like
EDL	00:39:02,912	00:39:03,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here's the thing though
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:05,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We might do a movie
EDL	00:39:05,472	00:39:06,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Today
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:08,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With the concept of a war between

EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:07,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That falls in the weird category to me more than it falls into the
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Terrific stuff
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:15,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well that's a terrible thing to say but but I mean in terms of just raw human cruelty
EDL	00:40:15,360	00:40:19,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's almost a sporting element to the other if you really sort of sick
EDL	00:40:19,712	00:40:21,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Lions might win
EDL	00:40:21,504	00:40:23,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the people might win the mean
EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:28,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In one of the injector stand about the Roman too many if you've course already do is they will bet on anything
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:36,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And just because we're pointing out the really Bloodsport aspect of what they loved they loved it all
EDL	00:40:36,352	00:40:40,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Horse races chariot races sporting events that were bloodless I mean all of it
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:47,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a good day at one of the Arenas like one of the good ones in Rome rooms like the New York City in the Broadway of
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of these sorts of shows bigger better and
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:53,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All the highest caliber performers are in Rome
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:56,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The other Arenas are some of the Off-Broadway people
EDL	00:40:57,600	00:41:04,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But a full good day at a place like the Forum involves all sorts of stuff with the violence be
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:09,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Being just one element in a good promoter and somebody staging this thing the right way knows how to make
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:15,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some performances Maybe by your favorite singers with some good stuff in between some religious messages here or there for the kid
EDL	00:41:15,520	00:41:18,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's a whole bunch of stuff and if you were really good
EDL	00:41:18,592	00:41:24,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lunch time at lunch time you run down to the bottom of the Coliseum and everybody would get lunch at the same time but of course you know
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:29,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You still got to have something for the people who are coming back with their lunch a little early you can't have
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:31,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nothing on stay so that was when
EDL	00:41:32,416	00:41:35,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the pure executions would often take place
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lunch time
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:42,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Roman writer say they're usually less people in the stands but because of the empty seats
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those people
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:49,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't have more of a chance or so the influence the way things went naked yell stuff out and
EDL	00:41:50,592	00:41:56,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People would do what they said sometimes another words to please the crowd if you had some person that you were slowly
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:42:00,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Putting to death in front of the people that have come out of the food quarterly
EDL	00:42:00,831	00:42:06,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they had a good suggestion you do it for him write anything to keep their folks happy and coming back next week
EDL	00:42:07,999	00:42:10,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And once again you can't help but sit there and go
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:14,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who else ever did that
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:17,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of these histories I've been reading make it plain that
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:23,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're normally and I tend to fall into this category to you think everything has happened before somewhere
EDL	00:42:23,359	00:42:26,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In history right there's nothing new Under the Sun is the old saying goes
EDL	00:42:27,711	00:42:29,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you'd be hard-pressed to find

EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the
EDL	00:42:43,583	00:42:48,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Interesting arguments used against those who suggest that this is a particularly Roman thing
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:52,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is how popular these games were
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:57,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When they sprouted up in places that have never had them before in the locals found that they like them
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quite a lot to
EDL	00:43:00,479	00:43:00,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But this
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:05,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ability to actually control what was done to the victim
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:10,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The giving the mob essentially the people with the loudest voices are the highest paying customers
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:11,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The right
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:14,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To control the action is like a god-like power
EDL	00:43:15,583	00:43:16,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think about

EDL	00:43:35,807	00:43:36,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This was sheer murder

EDL	00:43:40,671	00:43:42,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	While the Roman writer

EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:47,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was repelled by what he saw during the lunch time break

EDL	00:43:54,751	00:43:58,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Seneca adds a further noteworthy detail often-overlooked
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:02,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All of this happened when the arena was practically empty
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:06,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pure Butchery apparently was not to everyone's taste
EDL	00:44:06,527	00:44:07,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	00:44:08,063	00:44:11,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Eden points out that Seneca trying to make a point about how we know

EDL	00:44:26,239	00:44:32,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Their ability to direct the course of action on the sand would have strengthened an already formidable sense of him
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Empowerment
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:35,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Indeed the ultimate sense of empowerment

EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:42,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This was one of the clearest manifestations of the crowd as Domini

EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:48,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd nearly called out its wishes to see them enacted

EDL	00:44:58,751	00:44:59,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Concept
EDL	00:44:59,519	00:45:01,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you think about it I mean if you really go
EDL	00:45:01,823	00:45:03,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the heck was that like
EDL	00:45:03,615	00:45:04,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To have a person
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:06,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Walking to the arena
EDL	00:45:07,455	00:45:11,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is Dermatology Kyle describes the missing you naked or nearly naked

EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:15,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Held with them around their neck

EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:19,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is and then tying them to a

EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:21,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or he says
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:23,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Alternatively
EDL	00:45:23,071	00:45:26,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just leaving them in the arena alone unarmed
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:28,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To face the Fate

EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:40,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It might be open to interpretation depending with the crowd one that you want to burn somebody there's fire there you want

EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:53,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As I said before I am fascinated by the extremes of

EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I'm not sure
EDL	00:45:55,839	00:46:00,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's anything far greater in terms of extremes and being a condemned

EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The execution
EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you had a scale of like
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:14,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Easiest way to be executed and hardest way to be executed I think these days we do it about as easily
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:17,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we can make it Lethal Injections and stuff like that
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:23,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Our sensibilities are different than the sensibilities of these earlier eras
EDL	00:46:23,999	00:46:24,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where
EDL	00:46:25,023	00:46:27,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People dying execution wasn't
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:28,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The goal
EDL	00:46:29,375	00:46:30,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a byproduct
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:36,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did the goal goal was the suffering and in the case of Rome the suffering wasn't just to pay for the crime
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:38,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was to entertain the crowd
EDL	00:46:40,383	00:46:42,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm hard-pressed to find a situation
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:46,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In terms of being executed and putting yourself in the position of the condemned
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:53,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It would frighten or scare me or drive me out of my mind as I thought about what was going to happen as much as
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The situation
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know in the Roman Arena
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But this may be personality Bass
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:05,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can you go to some of these other cultures the Japanese thought about every way that they can
EDL	00:47:05,471	00:47:08,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Possibly kill convicts and prisoners and people they don't like for example
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:10,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe they'll boil you
EDL	00:47:11,359	00:47:15,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does it help if you know that's what they're going to do tomorrow morning you're going to get boiled
EDL	00:47:16,735	00:47:18,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a history I was reading
EDL	00:47:19,039	00:47:21,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Connected to this and I'm going from memory here
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:26,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But they've been talking about someone who's going to be beheaded in the morning and then the question was how does one prepare
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:26,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hair themselves
EDL	00:47:27,999	00:47:28,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For that
EDL	00:47:29,279	00:47:30,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The night before
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's going through your head
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:36,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are the mental and physical preparations I mean it's not the kind of thing that most people
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:39,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Throughout history have had to think about right although
EDL	00:47:39,519	00:47:45,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We all know is I think I said earlier if you added up all the people throughout history that have been in this position it's a sizable number
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:47,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you're someone like
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:48,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Yourstruly though
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:55,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And someone says you have a choice between knowing what they're going to do to you tomorrow or not knowing what they're going to do tomorrow
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Banality wants to know
EDL	00:47:57,695	00:47:58,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For whatever reason
EDL	00:47:59,231	00:48:05,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So for me the idea that you could go into this Arena ostensibly to be lit on fire and burned to death but
EDL	00:48:05,631	00:48:09,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you know if the crowd has a better idea we may go with that that would frighten me more
EDL	00:48:09,727	00:48:12,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then having someone's everything to tear you apart tomorrow with Tom
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:14,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At least I can sort of mentally
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:15,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Prepare myself how would someone
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Prepare themselves to be beheaded in the morning
EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:21,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It would sure help to know that that's what was coming at least
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:24,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is my personality is sort of organized
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:29,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now what might they do to you
EDL	00:48:30,463	00:48:31,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:36,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The sky's the limit in terms of the inventiveness of man of try to figure out ways
EDL	00:48:36,351	00:48:38,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not just ways to
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:39,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know add a little
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:44,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Variety to the situation but ways that would even
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:45,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Entertain the crowd
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:50,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you go down the list of things
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:54,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crucifixions on their butt crucifixion slow
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:56,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So they often would combine
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:58,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Donald G Kyle says
EDL	00:48:59,135	00:49:01,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crucifixion with some other punishment that they like
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:05,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fire was used a lot they like fire in the arena
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:10,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you know and it surprised me to actually read this I didn't know this
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:15,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Kyle says that the number one way people died in the arena
EDL	00:49:16,031	00:49:18,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do to Beast
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:19,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a wild animal
EDL	00:49:21,407	00:49:24,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And while I knew that that was big in the arena I had no idea
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:27,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it might be the number one cause of
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:29,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Death to the people they were dragging out of there
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:33,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I dunno and Kyle has something in his notes about it where he says
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:35,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That there was quite an emphasis
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:38,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On finding these animals
EDL	00:49:38,303	00:49:44,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the arena by the way just like there was a big emphasis on finding the people for the Arena 2
EDL	00:49:46,239	00:49:51,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's very strange to think about this but here in the New Media world we always talk about needing content
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:52,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To keep the audience satisfied will
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you think about it that way and they did
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:58,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The content that was needed
EDL	00:49:58,271	00:50:02,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At these games and not just the ones that wrong but all the Off-Broadway areas to
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:03,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Worthy
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People
EDL	00:50:04,671	00:50:07,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who's going to die in the arena while we got some slaves and
EDL	00:50:07,743	00:50:09,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is actually true they have
EDL	00:50:09,279	00:50:14,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	New accounts where they try to figure out okay we got some slaves from this Uprising in
EDL	00:50:14,143	00:50:15,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are you there
EDL	00:50:15,167	00:50:21,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Okay let's parcel them out they need them for games here they needed for games here I mean literally it is providing content for these shows
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:26,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And as I said there's other things that the show the performers in magicians and jugglers all kinds of fun things
EDL	00:50:26,687	00:50:27,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if you were to look at the
EDL	00:50:28,479	00:50:31,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Posters that they put up all over the city announcing
EDL	00:50:31,551	00:50:32,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But these are coming
EDL	00:50:33,087	00:50:35,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The violent parts are often
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:36,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are the main events
EDL	00:50:38,463	00:50:41,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in terms of animals to get back to the Beast
EDL	00:50:41,023	00:50:41,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Question
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:43,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Kyle says that they wanted
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:50,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Real wild ones I didn't want anything raised in captivity they didn't want anything that have been in captivity very long because
EDL	00:50:50,239	00:50:56,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	After all if you're selling we have a lot of wild Lions on your little posters all around your City to get people to come to the show
EDL	00:50:56,895	00:51:03,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't want them to get there and find out that the Lions don't do much cuz they just waiting for you to throw their typical meat lunch to them
EDL	00:51:03,039	00:51:06,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You want something that's going to go after these people you've tied to the crosses
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:09,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I should point out
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:12,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But I don't want to go there because there's a lot of controversy
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:14,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the how far you can take
EDL	00:51:15,071	00:51:17,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What was going on in the arena because there's accounts that
EDL	00:51:18,143	00:51:19,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	May or may not
EDL	00:51:19,679	00:51:22,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Try to overhype some of this stuff
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:25,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there are stuff and it again I don't want to get into it
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:31,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean there's stuff about women are going to come in here and be forcibly raped by Bulls before their
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:36,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Put to death any whether or not these things happen the thought that that would even be thrown out there
EDL	00:51:36,575	00:51:40,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Buy some inventive mind is something that people would like to see
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:41,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is extremely disturbing
EDL	00:51:42,975	00:51:44,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For modern person
EDL	00:51:44,767	00:51:49,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this is perhaps a sexist way of thinking but I think it's ingrained in some of us
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:51,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The idea of watching women die in the arena
EDL	00:51:51,935	00:51:56,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is more upsetting than watching the men but it didn't seem to bother the crowd at all
EDL	00:51:57,823	00:52:03,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Watching women ripped apart by Beast was going to be just as fun as watching Men ripped apart by bees
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:05,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's hard
EDL	00:52:05,759	00:52:11,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For we modern people to get our minds around this especially since to me this is so different than say the Gladiator fights
EDL	00:52:12,415	00:52:14,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which maybe we could conceive to something
EDL	00:52:15,231	00:52:15,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:19,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A much more push to the edge version of things we already like
EDL	00:52:20,863	00:52:22,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ever been to a big boxing fight
EDL	00:52:22,911	00:52:24,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In Las Vegas or something
EDL	00:52:24,703	00:52:27,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean this is a violent sporting event
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:32,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The buzz amongst the crowd and there's almost nothing I've ever experienced like it you think yourself well
EDL	00:52:33,151	00:52:39,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Listen to It's very barbaric but you could see the same sort of interplay going on in terms of whatever parts of our brain are being
EDL	00:52:39,551	00:52:40,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stimulated
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:43,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's boxing
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:44,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Plus
EDL	00:52:44,671	00:52:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's pro wrestling with weapons for real
EDL	00:52:48,255	00:52:48,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	00:52:49,279	00:52:50,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As all sporting events
EDL	00:52:50,815	00:52:57,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't know who's going to win training may come into it coaching strategy tactics I mean sports fans could get into something like
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:52:58,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I got you bet on it I could see it
EDL	00:52:59,775	00:53:02,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To me these executions that were different
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:07,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And even if most of the crowd didn't go in for The Butchery
EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:10,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like a professor Fagan had said
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Certainly a number of people did
EDL	00:53:13,599	00:53:16,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm reminded of another quote by Seneca
EDL	00:53:16,671	00:53:20,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Talking about the games and it was like a throwaway line but it was something about how
EDL	00:53:21,023	00:53:24,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He was insinuating you couldn't allow even a dull moment
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:30,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between acts in a call so that the crowd or something could be affected called for some throat-cutting in the meaning
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:32,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In time so that they wouldn't get bored
EDL	00:53:33,823	00:53:37,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again throwaway line but the horrific nice of the actual imagery if you imagine it
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:39,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is sobering
EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:43,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why did the Romans like it
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:44,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how did they just
EDL	00:53:45,087	00:53:46,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't think you seem like
EDL	00:53:46,367	00:53:48,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The most logical follow-up questions
EDL	00:53:49,183	00:53:53,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The why they liked it part we're going to continue to talk about cuz it's really sort of the focus here
EDL	00:53:54,303	00:53:57,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean the obvious things that come to mind right away is curiosity
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But any of these Seneca and you came for all the other stuff
EDL	00:54:02,751	00:54:05,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you just got grossed out by the violence probably not but maybe
EDL	00:54:07,359	00:54:09,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or maybe you're curious you want to see what this looks like
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:12,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the other
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:19,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Things that's talked about in events like these is even if you've been to many of them before this is not scripted Conte
EDL	00:54:19,135	00:54:25,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is like a live sporting event in the sense that you don't want to DVR it and hear what happened later you have to be there cuz
EDL	00:54:25,535	00:54:27,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Something weird could happen and sometimes.
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:29,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This curiosity
EDL	00:54:31,935	00:54:38,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There is sheer sadism and sadism the weird thing I think in my opinion until
EDL	00:54:38,335	00:54:41,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Totally non-academic an unqualified but
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:43,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But doesn't it seem like some of the tendencies
EDL	00:54:43,711	00:54:49,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're more unusual on an individual level become more common on a crowd level so whereas it might be
EDL	00:54:49,343	00:54:53,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rather rare to meet someone who's a sadist in a crowd of people
EDL	00:54:53,183	00:54:55,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a crowd of people I think we're more sadistic
EDL	00:54:56,511	00:54:58,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The whole is greater than the sum of its parts Maybe
EDL	00:54:58,815	00:54:59,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Got a Thang
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:04,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I guess for how the Romans Justified this cuz let's remember
EDL	00:55:04,959	00:55:10,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By our modern standards they are harsh and brutal and strict even in this. Where it's at
EDL	00:55:10,079	00:55:12,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Off their High these to be stricter there
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:14,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Loosening up a little by our standards they're still very strong
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:20,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Romans were into things like Lavo and reason and all these sorts of deals
EDL	00:55:20,831	00:55:22,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How did they look at this kind of stuff
EDL	00:55:23,391	00:55:25,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And say to themselves well listen this serves a good purpose
EDL	00:55:25,951	00:55:26,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The swell Hotel
EDL	00:55:27,487	00:55:30,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Our old friend riding many decades ago will Durant
EDL	00:55:30,303	00:55:31,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's a nice succinct
EDL	00:55:31,583	00:55:32,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Description
EDL	00:55:32,351	00:55:32,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	00:55:33,375	00:55:37,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most Romans defended the gladiatorial games on the ground
EDL	00:55:37,215	00:55:40,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the victims had been condemned to death for serious crime

EDL	00:55:57,695	00:55:58,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	00:55:59,487	00:56:00,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He then
EDL	00:56:00,255	00:56:03,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mentioned several famous Roman writers and how they basically supported
EDL	00:56:03,839	00:56:05,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The idea of the games
EDL	00:56:06,655	00:56:08,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then get to Cicero
EDL	00:56:09,727	00:56:11,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The lawyer writer
EDL	00:56:11,519	00:56:12,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The one-time console
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:15,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Famous at the end of the Republican.
EDL	00:56:16,639	00:56:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And even though Cicero
EDL	00:56:18,431	00:56:21,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would make comments approving of the games sometimes
EDL	00:56:22,271	00:56:24,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He also said this which is a pretty
EDL	00:56:24,831	00:56:29,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Humanist sort of thing for a Roman writer to put pen to paper about
EDL	00:56:29,951	00:56:33,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Durant says about Cicero in the games quote
EDL	00:56:33,023	00:56:35,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cicero was revolted by the slaughter
EDL	00:56:35,839	00:56:36,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:42,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is Cicero what entertainment can possibly arise to a refined and human eyes spirit

EDL	00:56:52,991	00:56:53,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	00:56:55,039	00:56:57,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we said earlier trying to figure out
EDL	00:56:57,855	00:57:00,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why the people in Rome enjoyed this
EDL	00:57:00,159	00:57:01,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These violent
EDL	00:57:01,183	00:57:07,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Entertainments is something that's been interesting to people for a very long time and Crosses into that Territory between a couple of distant
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:08,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ones like
EDL	00:57:08,607	00:57:10,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Psychology and history
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:12,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Has so many variables that it's not surprising
EDL	00:57:13,471	00:57:14,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you don't have
EDL	00:57:14,751	00:57:18,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Widespread agreement on what this is I mean people arguing
EDL	00:57:19,103	00:57:22,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The prevailing Theory tends to change every decade or so
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:27,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are some commonalities the things you run into
EDL	00:57:27,039	00:57:30,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I generally most of the time and the number one
EDL	00:57:30,367	00:57:32,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Commonality something it won't surprise any of us
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:34,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When we ask how
EDL	00:57:34,719	00:57:40,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These ancient people could watch other human being treated this way it's easy if you don't consider them to be human
EDL	00:57:41,887	00:57:44,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the dehumanization of the victims here
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:46,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is Obby
EDL	00:57:46,495	00:57:47,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Samina
EDL	00:57:47,263	00:57:48,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Everyone you'll read points out
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:52,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The vast majority of these people who are dying in the arena
EDL	00:57:52,639	00:57:54,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are slaves one way or the other
EDL	00:57:56,735	00:58:02,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They may not have been slaves their whole life if you capture somebody on the battlefield to make them prisoners they can be slaves the next day
EDL	00:58:03,903	00:58:06,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of these people who died in the arena by the way workout
EDL	00:58:06,719	00:58:07,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Prisoners
EDL	00:58:07,999	00:58:09,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes made to fight
EDL	00:58:09,535	00:58:10,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other prisoners
EDL	00:58:10,815	00:58:12,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the enjoyment of the crowd
EDL	00:58:14,143	00:58:18,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going to let the idea that we expect some sort of empathy and sympathy from the crowd
EDL	00:58:19,263	00:58:22,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Might be flawed if the crowd sees these people as
EDL	00:58:22,847	00:58:25,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well with the Nazis would have called the intervention right
EDL	00:58:25,663	00:58:32,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These are subhumans these are slaves are people with no rights and their people that are widely reviled in the society especially
EDL	00:58:32,063	00:58:35,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actually the ones at the lowest level especially the ones that have broken Roman law
EDL	00:58:37,695	00:58:38,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We said earlier
EDL	00:58:38,975	00:58:40,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many people would be
EDL	00:58:40,767	00:58:46,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Appalled at the idea of watching some horrific torture execution today
EDL	00:58:46,655	00:58:51,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how many would change their mind if you said yes but it's this horrible dictator is a Hitler
EDL	00:58:51,519	00:58:55,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or Saddam Hussein or somebody we're doing two how many people would go out well in that case Count Me In
EDL	00:58:56,895	00:58:58,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well for a lot of the Roman crowd
EDL	00:58:58,431	00:58:59,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I was reading stuff
EDL	00:58:59,967	00:59:03,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By several different authors Kyle among them who are suggesting that
EDL	00:59:04,063	00:59:07,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know a big part of the Roman desire to watch this stuff comes
EDL	00:59:07,391	00:59:10,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From seeing the victims in a similar light to that
EDL	00:59:10,207	00:59:12,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right they're deserving of this
EDL	00:59:12,511	00:59:13,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Therefore
EDL	00:59:13,535	00:59:18,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know why not get a little bit of enjoyment from their death while at the same time making it so horrible
EDL	00:59:18,399	00:59:20,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That other people who might think of doing this or just waited
EDL	00:59:23,263	00:59:24,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now before we leave
EDL	00:59:25,567	00:59:27,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Roman example
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:30,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's one element it's worth bringing up
EDL	00:59:30,431	00:59:31,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because it's a
EDL	00:59:31,967	00:59:34,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's an estuary if you will have to cross over
EDL	00:59:35,295	00:59:36,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between
EDL	00:59:36,575	00:59:37,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The modern
EDL	00:59:37,855	00:59:39,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Violent entertainment
EDL	00:59:39,647	00:59:41,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the ancient entertaining violence
EDL	00:59:42,975	00:59:45,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It has to do with something to some historians call
EDL	00:59:46,303	00:59:47,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Fatal charade
EDL	00:59:48,863	00:59:51,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Fatal charade is something that you can easily
EDL	00:59:51,935	00:59:53,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Imagine developing
EDL	00:59:53,983	01:00:00,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because you need to have more novel a new things to bring in the crowds and remember at the Coliseum they were having
EDL	01:00:00,383	01:00:04,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Naval battles take place for the crowd with water
EDL	01:00:04,479	01:00:07,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The spectacles are amazing so you can imagine how
EDL	01:00:07,295	01:00:12,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Dynamics of it all mean that you know these grown unimaginable proportions a little bit like history
EDL	01:00:12,927	01:00:14,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Got to become 6 hours long
EDL	01:00:14,975	01:00:16,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How do you spell charades
EDL	01:00:17,023	01:00:20,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Involved using The Condemned criminals
EDL	01:00:20,607	01:00:21,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In
EDL	01:00:21,887	01:00:22,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Play
EDL	01:00:22,655	01:00:23,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Comedy
EDL	01:00:23,423	01:00:27,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dramarama anything like addressing the Muppets characters putting in assets up
EDL	01:00:27,775	01:00:29,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And having them reenact
EDL	01:00:29,311	01:00:33,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What went on in the story but the stories they pick are often homicidal
EDL	01:00:33,663	01:00:37,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anaval maimings and so what they did then was they did it for real
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:42,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You said earlier what if you
EDL	01:00:42,879	01:00:44,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Made one of those
EDL	01:00:44,671	01:00:50,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Previews they show the movie theater for an action film that use real bullets and had real people get really hurt
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:52,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what would that be like
EDL	01:00:53,631	01:00:54,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe like these
EDL	01:00:55,423	01:00:57,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a fatal charades in Rome
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:01:01,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Astorian Donald G Kyle in his notes
EDL	01:01:02,335	01:01:04,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quoting several other historians
EDL	01:01:04,639	01:01:06,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wrote about the Fatal charade
EDL	01:01:06,687	01:01:07,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	01:01:08,223	01:01:14,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The combination of theater and execution in the amphitheater was not theater proper
EDL	01:01:14,623	01:01:16,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But rather bartsch says
EDL	01:01:16,671	01:01:20,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A violation of the theatrical by the actual
EDL	01:01:20,255	01:01:21,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or rather
EDL	01:01:21,279	01:01:22,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A conflation of the two
EDL	01:01:22,815	01:01:25,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not a representation but a replication
EDL	01:01:27,423	01:01:28,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As she notes
EDL	01:01:28,447	01:01:30,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The actual death in the charades
EDL	01:01:30,751	01:01:33,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fulfilled the requirements of both the plot
EDL	01:01:33,311	01:01:34,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the penal code
EDL	01:01:35,103	01:01:35,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:01:37,919	01:01:38,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a crazy line
EDL	01:01:40,223	01:01:41,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the deaths
EDL	01:01:41,759	01:01:43,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In these fatal plays
EDL	01:01:44,575	01:01:46,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Met the needs of both the plot
EDL	01:01:46,879	01:01:48,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the penal code
EDL	01:01:50,463	01:01:51,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That it wasn't a
EDL	01:01:52,767	01:01:55,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Representation like a movie would be today
EDL	01:01:56,351	01:01:57,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a replication
EDL	01:01:59,679	01:02:00,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like doing
EDL	01:02:00,959	01:02:03,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A story on the Manson family murders
EDL	01:02:03,775	01:02:07,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But re-enacting them rather than replicating them on film
EDL	01:02:10,431	01:02:12,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what makes it so different as it's right in your face
EDL	01:02:13,247	01:02:14,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's no doubt
EDL	01:02:14,783	01:02:19,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people are really enjoying this where is in all the other situations that come to mind
EDL	01:02:20,159	01:02:23,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That would involve other ancient peoples that you can find
EDL	01:02:23,743	01:02:25,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's so hard to disentangle
EDL	01:02:26,303	01:02:27,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The religion
EDL	01:02:27,583	01:02:29,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From the ritual
EDL	01:02:29,119	01:02:29,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	01:02:29,887	01:02:34,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the lack of sources to tell you specifically the people were having a good time
EDL	01:02:34,239	01:02:39,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To figure out as we said whether or not the Aztecs are enjoying watching the ceremony involve
EDL	01:02:39,103	01:02:39,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human soccer
EDL	01:02:40,639	01:02:42,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or whether it's all part of some giant
EDL	01:02:42,943	01:02:44,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a religious ritual
EDL	01:02:44,479	01:02:48,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That sort of overlays the entire question that explains it in a way that's a lot less
EDL	01:02:49,343	01:02:52,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Denigrating towards the human species than the simplistic
EDL	01:02:53,439	01:02:56,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know attitude of well they're having a good time watching
EDL	01:02:56,255	01:02:57,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Penis person suffering.
EDL	01:02:59,071	01:02:59,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Roman exam
EDL	01:03:00,607	01:03:01,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the most
EDL	01:03:02,655	01:03:03,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I can find
EDL	01:03:04,191	01:03:06,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That forces you to look into a mirror
EDL	01:03:07,007	01:03:10,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you're trying to make the case that human beings are inherently good
EDL	01:03:10,847	01:03:13,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Inherently empathetic and inherently
EDL	01:03:13,919	01:03:17,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With a sense of Brotherhood and Sisterhood toward their fellow man
EDL	01:03:18,271	01:03:19,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know you have to hold this is
EDL	01:03:21,087	01:03:22,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Exhibit a and say well then
EDL	01:03:23,391	01:03:24,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How do you explain this
EDL	01:03:28,255	01:03:30,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So then of course the question arises
EDL	01:03:31,327	01:03:32,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Briefly
EDL	01:03:32,863	01:03:35,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not without controversy
EDL	01:03:35,935	01:03:39,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If these things were so popular why the heck did they disappear
EDL	01:03:41,311	01:03:45,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the answers of course are less simplistic and more argued about than they used to be
EDL	01:03:46,687	01:03:48,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I still think most of the historians
EDL	01:03:48,991	01:03:50,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That you'll look at
EDL	01:03:50,015	01:03:50,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will
EDL	01:03:51,039	01:03:53,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Acknowledge that there's a role in the
EDL	01:03:54,111	01:03:56,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Change and Sensibility shall we call them
EDL	01:03:56,671	01:03:57,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between a
EDL	01:03:57,951	01:04:01,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Minority Christian Roman one that was increasing in
EDL	01:04:02,559	01:04:05,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Importance in that Society Wright the ethics were changing
EDL	01:04:06,143	01:04:08,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the views on things like the
EDL	01:04:08,959	01:04:13,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Arena and how moral something like that was what we're also changing now let's be honest
EDL	01:04:14,591	01:04:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even if it wasn't for ethical reasons connected to their faith
EDL	01:04:17,919	01:04:22,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You could understand why Christians might think the game suck to me look at how many Christians went there and
EDL	01:04:23,295	01:04:24,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In these Arenas her
EDL	01:04:24,575	01:04:27,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well let's be honest there countrymens entertainment
EDL	01:04:28,159	01:04:28,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In many cases
EDL	01:04:30,975	01:04:33,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's an interesting Twist on this by the way this idea that
EDL	01:04:34,815	01:04:37,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Christianity may have helped kill the games but it hasn't
EDL	01:04:37,631	01:04:41,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anything to do with a growth in refinement of sensibilities and all that
EDL	01:04:41,727	01:04:43,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It has to do with
EDL	01:04:43,007	01:04:43,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe
EDL	01:04:44,031	01:04:45,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can call it 8
EDL	01:04:45,823	01:04:46,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Scheduling golf
EDL	01:04:48,639	01:04:49,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean for example
EDL	01:04:49,919	01:04:52,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The games themselves were
EDL	01:04:52,479	01:04:55,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Happening a couple of times a year like many Olympics
EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:58,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that just happens to be the time when you had
EDL	01:04:59,135	01:05:00,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know some of the more serious
EDL	01:05:00,927	01:05:02,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Holiday.
EDL	01:05:02,719	01:05:03,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	4
EDL	01:05:03,487	01:05:03,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Christians
EDL	01:05:04,767	01:05:05,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And so maybe we're talking
EDL	01:05:06,303	01:05:08,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Got something here that has to do with a quest
EDL	01:05:08,351	01:05:10,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Scheduling conflicts as I said
EDL	01:05:10,143	01:05:13,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Leading to a reduction in consumer demand Maybe
EDL	01:05:16,287	01:05:21,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's another theory that these things that only existed as long as they had because the emperors
EDL	01:05:21,663	01:05:22,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Gave
EDL	01:05:22,431	01:05:24,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Them all the support because it helped
EDL	01:05:24,735	01:05:31,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The whole bread and circuses thing will these are the circus is right they play a role for the emperor they play at mystical roll the can
EDL	01:05:31,135	01:05:34,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Connect the emperor to the subject, there's a whole lot of theories about this
EDL	01:05:34,207	01:05:40,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Once it stops doing that to the same degree there's no reason for the emperor to go to those great expenses and all that other trouble
EDL	01:05:41,631	01:05:43,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Have a nice Cherry race and call it good
EDL	01:05:44,703	01:05:45,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I should point out to the
EDL	01:05:45,983	01:05:52,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are these Roman tradition where they have these games these go way back in their history and actually evolved other Italian people like
EDL	01:05:52,383	01:05:58,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stand lights in a truck engine and people who would have sometimes at funerals and whatnot these duels and Duels are not.
EDL	01:05:58,783	01:05:59,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Baton
EDL	01:05:59,551	01:06:00,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Common throughout history
EDL	01:06:00,831	01:06:06,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He was just Roman as we said layering we talked about the animals with layered on all the different levels of
EDL	01:06:07,231	01:06:08,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Performance
EDL	01:06:08,255	01:06:09,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And attraction and
EDL	01:06:09,791	01:06:13,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean these things as we said we're like a variety show
EDL	01:06:13,631	01:06:16,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With the violence as sort of the headliner Act
EDL	01:06:18,495	01:06:20,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But I read that they didn't die out all at once in that
EDL	01:06:21,311	01:06:27,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even quite a bit of time later after Emperor's and whatnot had tried to get rid of them they were still popping up here or there
EDL	01:06:28,479	01:06:28,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So
EDL	01:06:30,271	01:06:33,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe not quite getting the ratings that used to get
EDL	01:06:33,343	01:06:36,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But still bopping around you know the Off-Broadway circuit and
EDL	01:06:37,439	01:06:39,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a pulling into locals every now and then for a little
EDL	01:06:40,511	01:06:42,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nigori equivalent
EDL	01:06:42,047	01:06:44,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Old fashioned dinner theater
EDL	01:06:44,351	01:06:44,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe
EDL	01:06:46,655	01:06:48,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now this worry program dealing with
EDL	01:06:49,471	01:06:50,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executions
EDL	01:06:51,775	01:06:52,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Criminal law
EDL	01:06:53,055	01:06:57,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Criminal justice or the penal system or anything like that there be a lot of examples to go into
EDL	01:06:58,175	01:07:01,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where you're seeing public executions all over the world all the time it's just
EDL	01:07:02,015	01:07:03,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is depressingly
EDL	01:07:03,295	01:07:03,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Familiar
EDL	01:07:05,087	01:07:10,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But what you don't have is the kind of evidence that Rome provided of what the mentality of the crowd watching was
EDL	01:07:13,023	01:07:16,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I know where else do you really see such raw enjoyment for example
EDL	01:07:16,607	01:07:18,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's very possible that those Japanese
EDL	01:07:18,655	01:07:19,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People
EDL	01:07:19,423	01:07:20,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Living nearby would it be
EDL	01:07:21,727	01:07:23,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Person to convict being boiled to death
EDL	01:07:24,543	01:07:27,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Happen if you did that might be unusual and you might want to go watching so
EDL	01:07:27,871	01:07:32,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are you pick up a few friends and you go get some food you go down to the beach to have some fun
EDL	01:07:32,991	01:07:37,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Certainly might have happened in my cynical way of looking at things sometimes I imagine it probably did but I don't have the written sources
EDL	01:07:38,367	01:07:38,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In English
EDL	01:07:39,391	01:07:39,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To prove it
EDL	01:07:41,439	01:07:43,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The next place that I can prove it
EDL	01:07:43,743	01:07:44,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or at least make it
EDL	01:07:44,767	01:07:46,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Logical case with some evidence
EDL	01:07:47,071	01:07:49,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is a lot nearer to our own time than Rome was
EDL	01:07:50,399	01:07:52,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Perhaps a little bit more of an indictment
EDL	01:07:52,703	01:07:54,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's one thing to try to say
EDL	01:07:54,495	01:07:57,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At those ancient people living thousands of years ago
EDL	01:07:57,823	01:08:00,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're almost a different species from us but it's much harder to claim that
EDL	01:08:01,663	01:08:06,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you're talking about a time. Say as we said when George Washington is a young adults

EDL	01:08:09,599	01:08:12,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is being torn apart over four hours
EDL	01:08:12,927	01:08:14,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In front of tens
EDL	01:08:14,719	01:08:16,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thousands of early modern
EDL	01:08:16,767	01:08:17,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Inspect

EDL	01:08:20,607	01:08:21,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	George Washington's life
EDL	01:08:22,399	01:08:23,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actually not
EDL	01:08:23,167	01:08:24,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bad historical
EDL	01:08:24,191	01:08:25,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Marker for this conversation
EDL	01:08:26,751	01:08:28,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because over his life

EDL	01:08:29,055	01:08:30,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These sorts of

EDL	01:08:35,199	01:08:36,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will go out of fashion

EDL	01:08:40,063	01:08:40,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	30s
EDL	01:08:41,087	01:08:42,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hi.

EDL	01:08:47,231	01:08:47,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Often
EDL	01:08:48,255	01:08:52,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Labeled in your high school history textbook says the enlightenment of the Age of Reason
EDL	01:08:53,887	01:08:56,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those kinds of executions don't sound very light
EDL	01:08:56,447	01:08:57,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do they
EDL	01:08:57,983	01:09:00,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they were passing away during this era
EDL	01:09:00,543	01:09:03,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Her bunch of interesting reasons but the reason
EDL	01:09:03,103	01:09:05,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we can use it to examine our question of
EDL	01:09:06,175	01:09:06,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Yunnan people
EDL	01:09:07,455	01:09:08,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And violence
EDL	01:09:08,479	01:09:11,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the extremes of The Human Experience as we get these

EDL	01:09:19,487	01:09:21,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can really see this
EDL	01:09:22,047	01:09:25,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This entire question from multiple viewpoints in ways you've never been able to
EDL	01:09:27,423	01:09:29,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I think that's why if you buy
EDL	01:09:29,471	01:09:34,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reading material in English on this subject it is inordinately concentrated

EDL	01:09:38,943	01:09:39,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because the sources

EDL	01:09:41,247	01:09:44,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And from multiple viewpoints take for example
EDL	01:09:44,063	01:09:44,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the most interest
EDL	01:09:46,111	01:09:47,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There is nothing

EDL	01:09:55,071	01:09:58,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the guy who had to do all these horrible things to The Condemned
EDL	01:09:58,911	01:09:59,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think right
EDL	01:10:00,447	01:10:01,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would know
EDL	01:10:02,239	01:10:03,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But we have
EDL	01:10:03,775	01:10:06,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The equivalent of a diary kept
EDL	01:10:06,591	01:10:09,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By an executioner in Germany in the 16th century
EDL	01:10:10,687	01:10:13,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How amazing is it to have that point of view to add
EDL	01:10:14,527	01:10:16,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To try to three dimension lies this
EDL	01:10:17,087	01:10:18,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what about
EDL	01:10:18,623	01:10:19,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Condemned
EDL	01:10:20,159	01:10:23,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Themselves again nothing from the Roman Arena on how that poor
EDL	01:10:23,999	01:10:26,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Individual felt before they went through what they went through
EDL	01:10:28,095	01:10:31,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But in the air were talking about The Condemned could speak sometime
EDL	01:10:32,447	01:10:33,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what they said
EDL	01:10:33,983	01:10:37,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was written down and transmitted and then of course we have an audience
EDL	01:10:38,079	01:10:42,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That you can examine now from multiple viewpoints over multiple Century in multiple countries
EDL	01:10:44,735	01:10:47,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So if you want to examine this fascination with
EDL	01:10:47,551	01:10:50,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The spectacular Ade of death in people's interest in it
EDL	01:10:51,391	01:10:54,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is perhaps the best laboratory we can work within
EDL	01:10:55,231	01:10:57,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because there's a lot of data to synthesize now
EDL	01:10:58,047	01:11:01,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The problem in talking about this is there is a lot of variation
EDL	01:11:02,143	01:11:03,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Region region
EDL	01:11:03,679	01:11:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Arrinera
EDL	01:11:05,215	01:11:08,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And so any generalize statements are bound to be false in some way so I hope
EDL	01:11:09,311	01:11:11,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I can count on your Indulgence on this
EDL	01:11:11,359	01:11:12,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Try to
EDL	01:11:12,127	01:11:15,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Get us to where we have to be to have a discussion about this we're going to General
EDL	01:11:15,967	01:11:17,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if you want to understand
EDL	01:11:17,759	01:11:20,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What happened that allowed
EDL	01:11:20,063	01:11:21,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Modern people
EDL	01:11:21,599	01:11:27,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know from the Louis XIV era of the Enlightenment to go to these torture executions and enjoy themselves
EDL	01:11:27,999	01:11:30,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You have to kind of understand how it got that way we have to have some contacts
EDL	01:11:32,607	01:11:35,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a bridge to maybe take us backward
EDL	01:11:35,935	01:11:36,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For some
EDL	01:11:37,471	01:11:38,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I was thinking of
EDL	01:11:38,495	01:11:39,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	4
EDL	01:11:40,543	01:11:42,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That a couple of rulers
EDL	01:11:42,591	01:11:44,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	News during George Washington's life
EDL	01:11:44,895	01:11:45,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Implement
EDL	01:11:46,687	01:11:47,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But they were secret reform
EDL	01:11:47,967	01:11:48,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We just kind of Interest
EDL	01:11:49,759	01:11:50,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For example
EDL	01:11:51,039	01:11:54,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Frederick the great of Prussia was considered one of the Enlightenment rulers
EDL	01:11:56,671	01:11:58,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A guy who didn't just
EDL	01:11:58,975	01:12:01,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I read people like Voltaire the famous
EDL	01:12:01,535	01:12:02,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Enlightenment thinkers
EDL	01:12:03,327	01:12:04,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He was a pen pal
EDL	01:12:05,887	01:12:07,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of these people that implemented changes that
EDL	01:12:07,935	01:12:09,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Part of all this stuff that
EDL	01:12:09,983	01:12:11,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Broadly call the enlightened
EDL	01:12:11,519	01:12:12,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Age of Reason
EDL	01:12:12,799	01:12:14,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one of the things that
EDL	01:12:14,335	01:12:16,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Frederick the great tables were formed the Legal Sea
EDL	01:12:17,663	01:12:18,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the 1740s
EDL	01:12:19,967	01:12:21,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now we did away with a couple of
EDL	01:12:21,759	01:12:22,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Medieval type
EDL	01:12:23,551	01:12:28,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executions I mean I think he got rid of burning for example couldn't burn somebody alive anymore I think
EDL	01:12:29,695	01:12:30,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But I know
EDL	01:12:30,975	01:12:31,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But he kept
EDL	01:12:31,743	01:12:32,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stuff like
EDL	01:12:32,511	01:12:33,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Breaking with the wheel
EDL	01:12:34,815	01:12:37,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But his Secret order his reform dictated
EDL	01:12:38,399	01:12:41,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the person who was going to be subjected to this ordeal
EDL	01:12:43,007	01:12:44,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Be strangled beforehand
EDL	01:12:46,335	01:12:48,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's not the interesting part per se
EDL	01:12:49,151	01:12:50,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The interesting part is that Frederick
EDL	01:12:50,943	01:12:54,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mandated that this strangling be done in such a way
EDL	01:12:54,783	01:12:56,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did the crowd would know it
EDL	01:12:56,831	01:12:59,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As far as the crowd was concerned
EDL	01:12:59,135	01:13:01,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were still watching a person being
EDL	01:13:01,695	01:13:05,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Broken apart in the most horrific medieval fashion possible
EDL	01:13:05,791	01:13:06,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But Frederick
EDL	01:13:06,815	01:13:08,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any Executioner's would know
EDL	01:13:09,119	01:13:10,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the person actually felt no pain
EDL	01:13:11,679	01:13:12,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's going on there
EDL	01:13:13,983	01:13:16,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And before we think of it as an isolated exam
EDL	01:13:16,799	01:13:18,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maria Theresa
EDL	01:13:18,591	01:13:20,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Habsburg Empire a couple decades
EDL	01:13:21,407	01:13:24,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Later issued a similar sort of order and her point
EDL	01:13:24,735	01:13:25,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was that listen
EDL	01:13:26,015	01:13:27,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The person is dead anyway
EDL	01:13:27,295	01:13:28,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's what we're really doing here
EDL	01:13:28,831	01:13:30,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here trying to
EDL	01:13:30,623	01:13:33,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You deprive that person of his life why
EDL	01:13:33,695	01:13:34,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Heater prolong the stop
EDL	01:13:35,743	01:13:37,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But then why keep the string
EDL	01:13:37,279	01:13:37,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Angling Secret
EDL	01:13:39,327	01:13:39,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Texas
EDL	01:13:40,863	01:13:43,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To the rationale Behind These
EDL	01:13:43,167	01:13:43,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectacular
EDL	01:13:44,447	01:13:46,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public executions from this
EDL	01:13:47,007	01:13:48,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bizarrely modern era
EDL	01:13:50,591	01:13:52,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why do they do them at all
EDL	01:13:55,455	01:13:57,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The point of all this was to create a
EDL	01:13:57,503	01:13:58,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shockingly Freight
EDL	01:13:58,783	01:13:59,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Prospective
EDL	01:13:59,807	01:14:01,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A deterrent warning
EDL	01:14:02,879	01:14:05,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And for the purposes of
EDL	01:14:05,695	01:14:06,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The warning
EDL	01:14:07,487	01:14:13,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It really wouldn't matter whether or not The Condemned was actually feeling the pain that the audience thought they
EDL	01:14:13,887	01:14:14,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were feeling
EDL	01:14:14,911	01:14:20,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The most important part of the equation was that the audience did indeed think they were feeling
EDL	01:14:20,543	01:14:24,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The pain and suffering and when you consider with the really nasty
EDL	01:14:24,383	01:14:26,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executions that a guy in
EDL	01:14:26,687	01:14:29,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Frederick the Great's time would have had available to him
EDL	01:14:30,271	01:14:34,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're frightfully need I mean burning for those of you who find that particularly horrible
EDL	01:14:35,391	01:14:37,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Others might choose it was a personal
EDL	01:14:37,695	01:14:38,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Question
EDL	01:14:38,719	01:14:41,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As their most horrible most to be avoided
EDL	01:14:41,535	01:14:43,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Potential execution method
EDL	01:14:43,839	01:14:45,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Breaking on the Wheel
EDL	01:14:45,119	01:14:48,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He mentioned a little early what the heck is breaking on the Wheel
EDL	01:14:49,471	01:14:51,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Storing Garrett Fagan
EDL	01:14:51,007	01:14:53,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a horrific description
EDL	01:14:54,079	01:14:56,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you can see after you hear it
EDL	01:14:56,639	01:15:02,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why strangling somebody ahead of time would have been an act of considerable Mercy he writes quote
EDL	01:15:04,063	01:15:06,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Particularly unpleasant was Wheeling
EDL	01:15:07,135	01:15:08,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Also called braiding
EDL	01:15:08,927	01:15:11,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or breaking on the wheel in France
EDL	01:15:11,231	01:15:13,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or breaking with the wheel in Germany
EDL	01:15:14,047	01:15:15,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The procedure he writes
EDL	01:15:15,583	01:15:16,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Took many forms
EDL	01:15:16,863	01:15:22,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And was employed in numerous countries across the European continent and in foreign colonies
EDL	01:15:22,239	01:15:23,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The usual method
EDL	01:15:23,775	01:15:26,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was for the victim to be tied to a scaffold
EDL	01:15:26,079	01:15:30,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Board laid out on the ground with wooden struts to raise the limb
EDL	01:15:30,687	01:15:32,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a wagon wheel
EDL	01:15:32,223	01:15:35,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or a hammer iron bar or club
EDL	01:15:35,039	01:15:36,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Used to break them
EDL	01:15:36,831	01:15:39,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Special execution Wheels were manufactured
EDL	01:15:39,903	01:15:42,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With projecting flanges for atom-smashing power
EDL	01:15:43,487	01:15:44,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Alternatively
EDL	01:15:44,767	01:15:47,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Victims to be run over repeatedly by heavy wagons
EDL	01:15:48,351	01:15:49,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The traditional
EDL	01:15:49,631	01:15:50,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The word means
EDL	01:15:50,399	01:15:51,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	End of the ceremony
EDL	01:15:51,935	01:15:57,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's for The Condemned to have their ruined limbs threaded through the spokes of another Wagon Wheel
EDL	01:15:57,055	01:16:01,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The braiding part of the action which was then hoisted on the pole for display
EDL	01:16:01,919	01:16:04,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They are the victim if not dead already
EDL	01:16:04,735	01:16:06,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Could linger for days
EDL	01:16:06,527	01:16:12,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hey heroin eyewitness account from a 1607 execution reports how the victim was transformed
EDL	01:16:12,927	01:16:15,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote into a sort of huge screaming puppet

EDL	01:16:18,303	01:16:19,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A puppet with four tentacles
EDL	01:16:20,351	01:16:23,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like a sea monster of raw slimy and shapeless flesh
EDL	01:16:23,935	01:16:25,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mixed with the splinters of smashed bone
EDL	01:16:26,751	01:16:27,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:16:29,311	01:16:30,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This takes us back
EDL	01:16:30,847	01:16:35,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To the reasons for the spectacular punishment the justifications and
EDL	01:16:35,455	01:16:37,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you go back to how it all started
EDL	01:16:38,271	01:16:41,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The water becomes very muddy indeed
EDL	01:16:41,087	01:16:41,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For example
EDL	01:16:42,367	01:16:44,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Remember us wondering about
EDL	01:16:44,415	01:16:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Many other peoples in history and whether or not
EDL	01:16:46,975	01:16:53,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The fact that there are heavy religious overtones the what's going on whether or not that means you can determine if they were there
EDL	01:16:53,375	01:16:56,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cuz they wanted to see the violence and meet at the Aztec crowd
EDL	01:16:56,191	01:16:58,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is witnessing the human sacrifice ceremony
EDL	01:16:58,495	01:16:59,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is this fun
EDL	01:17:00,031	01:17:02,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or is this a form of piety right
EDL	01:17:03,103	01:17:05,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hard to tell the waters are very muddy
EDL	01:17:06,175	01:17:07,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the Europe
EDL	01:17:07,711	01:17:10,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Proceeding. We're talking about here the same thing is true
EDL	01:17:12,831	01:17:16,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And big disclaimer that's not to say that there aren't religious overtones in the
EDL	01:17:16,927	01:17:18,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Roman arena there were
EDL	01:17:18,975	01:17:23,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's not to say there aren't religious overtones at Robert Francois Damien's execution there were
EDL	01:17:25,119	01:17:31,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's pretty obvious from those two examples that it's not the number one thing in Rome the number one thing is the amusement of the crowd
EDL	01:17:31,775	01:17:35,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Endymion case the number one thing is demonstrating the authority of the state
EDL	01:17:35,871	01:17:39,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The fact that people are enjoying watching the authority of the state being demonstrated
EDL	01:17:39,967	01:17:42,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a different question that's more human
EDL	01:17:42,015	01:17:44,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the period that leads up though
EDL	01:17:44,575	01:17:47,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To these relatively secular
EDL	01:17:47,647	01:17:51,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pursuits in the mid 1700 do you have very religious execution
EDL	01:17:53,023	01:17:54,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So once again
EDL	01:17:54,303	01:17:56,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the crowd there for fun
EDL	01:17:56,607	01:17:58,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or is this something
EDL	01:17:58,143	01:17:58,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Larger
EDL	01:17:59,935	01:18:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We compared the Roman Arena
EDL	01:18:03,007	01:18:04,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To a kind of
EDL	01:18:05,567	01:18:06,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Theater sword
EDL	01:18:06,847	01:18:09,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Theater where the violence was real
EDL	01:18:10,431	01:18:13,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But maybe touching some of the same parts of your mind
EDL	01:18:13,759	01:18:16,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or psyche that enjoys watching the fake version now
EDL	01:18:19,135	01:18:21,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Entertainment as I said was the goal though
EDL	01:18:21,695	01:18:26,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pride what's the what's the what's the form of execution here that will be most novel and interesting to watch
EDL	01:18:26,559	01:18:28,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the case of the executions
EDL	01:18:28,607	01:18:30,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the Europe of the Middle Ages
EDL	01:18:30,911	01:18:31,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The ones that are the
EDL	01:18:31,935	01:18:35,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Precursors to be later examples we've been going over
EDL	01:18:36,031	01:18:37,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These are also
EDL	01:18:37,055	01:18:37,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like a form of theater
EDL	01:18:39,103	01:18:40,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's more like a morality
EDL	01:18:41,407	01:18:41,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fashion
EDL	01:18:43,199	01:18:44,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of these
EDL	01:18:44,223	01:18:47,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Message oriented displays when there's going to be
EDL	01:18:47,807	01:18:48,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of drama
EDL	01:18:49,343	01:18:51,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is going to be quite a bit of horrific viola
EDL	01:18:53,439	01:18:59,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if it all goes off the way these executions in the Middle Ages were supposed to go off in a lot of these
EDL	01:18:59,071	01:18:59,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cases
EDL	01:19:00,607	01:19:02,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again exceptions exist and there are
EDL	01:19:02,655	01:19:03,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Local variations
EDL	01:19:04,703	01:19:07,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It would be a happy ending at the end
EDL	01:19:08,031	01:19:10,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The person who suffered the most
EDL	01:19:10,079	01:19:12,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pain and violence during the experience
EDL	01:19:12,127	01:19:13,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will find themselves
EDL	01:19:13,663	01:19:15,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If they conduct themselves properly of course
EDL	01:19:16,735	01:19:17,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In heaven

EDL	01:19:20,831	01:19:21,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the crowd
EDL	01:19:22,111	01:19:24,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will it X if these historians are to be believed
EDL	01:19:25,183	01:19:26,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Seem almost jealous of

EDL	01:20:09,471	01:20:12,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now if you had told me I had overlooked something I wouldn't be surprised
EDL	01:20:13,567	01:20:16,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you'd said that there were accounts of the Christian martyrs

EDL	01:20:24,832	01:20:29,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You see accounts like this all over the world at various times very

EDL	01:20:38,144	01:20:41,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are focused more on a long term for ever afterwards venue
EDL	01:20:44,288	01:20:48,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It changes your rational calculation right if you're much more worried about
EDL	01:20:48,640	01:20:50,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An eternity in heaven
EDL	01:20:50,688	01:20:52,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rather than the momentary

EDL	01:21:34,976	01:21:36,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is the area where
EDL	01:21:36,256	01:21:41,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it encompasses the Crusades and encompasses all the religious wars that happened because of

EDL	01:21:52,128	01:21:54,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a line and I'm going from memory that
EDL	01:21:54,176	01:21:55,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I once read a historian said
EDL	01:21:55,968	01:21:57,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That they said in this era

EDL	01:22:17,216	01:22:21,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's actually a lot of folks in some places and there's a bunch of heretical Christian sects
EDL	01:22:21,824	01:22:23,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whether Christian or not of courses
EDL	01:22:23,872	01:22:26,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the main issue that are being wiped out and persecuted
EDL	01:22:26,944	01:22:28,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there's a worldview now in place
EDL	01:22:29,504	01:22:30,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bright
EDL	01:22:30,528	01:22:34,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A reality that in some ways is like our own

EDL	01:22:41,280	01:22:43,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there are other elements of reality
EDL	01:22:43,840	01:22:45,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That are believed
EDL	01:22:45,120	01:22:48,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To be a hundred percent valid by almost everybody
EDL	01:22:48,960	01:22:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The influences everything
EDL	01:22:51,264	01:22:52,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take for example
EDL	01:22:52,800	01:22:55,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The near unanimity of the idea
EDL	01:22:56,640	01:22:57,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there is a heaven
EDL	01:22:58,432	01:23:03,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hell and a god watching over everything and that everything is divinely ordained
EDL	01:23:04,064	01:23:06,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now we have people of course we believe
EDL	01:23:06,368	01:23:06,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That today
EDL	01:23:07,904	01:23:11,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's one of many different belief systems out there in fact
EDL	01:23:11,744	01:23:16,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the great things about living in a free society and a free part of the world
EDL	01:23:17,632	01:23:22,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it you're free to pick and choose your own reality either within limits I mean you still have to ignore

EDL	01:26:42,944	01:26:46,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the Renaissance dd&d draw crowds and I don't see why they wouldn't

EDL	01:26:54,464	01:26:56,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is why we should have set up their religious stuff
EDL	01:26:57,024	01:26:58,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Up till now because
EDL	01:26:58,304	01:27:01,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's what twists in the unique way because

EDL	01:27:07,264	01:27:13,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going to deter people from committing crimes and that's why they hung up bodies and pieces of bodies and heads on Stakes at the bridge

EDL	01:27:19,040	01:27:21,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And we've been a lot of theories about that this
EDL	01:27:21,088	01:27:22,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nothing new in that in that question
EDL	01:27:23,392	01:27:26,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the religious side that to the modern mind is harder to understand
EDL	01:27:27,232	01:27:29,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if you went to this execution
EDL	01:27:29,536	01:27:30,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Instead of feeling

EDL	01:27:52,064	01:27:53,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The source of State depends on
EDL	01:27:53,600	01:27:56,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the bad person did and how they comported themselves during the whole process but
EDL	01:27:57,440	01:28:00,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More often than not in this. We're talking about right now
EDL	01:28:01,024	01:28:01,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd felt
EDL	01:28:02,304	01:28:03,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The connection

EDL	01:28:23,296	01:28:25,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now let's remind ourselves for a second
EDL	01:28:25,856	01:28:27,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But what this beautiful event might be
EDL	01:28:28,672	01:28:31,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then ask ourselves again
EDL	01:28:31,232	01:28:32,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What it would take
EDL	01:28:32,768	01:28:33,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For you
EDL	01:28:33,792	01:28:35,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Over me

EDL	01:28:36,608	01:28:38,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And describe it afterwards
EDL	01:28:38,656	01:28:39,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is beautiful
EDL	01:28:40,960	01:28:44,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So in his book rituals of Retribution historian Richard Evans
EDL	01:28:45,312	01:28:46,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Recounts
EDL	01:28:46,592	01:28:49,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The tale of an Englishman named John Taylor
EDL	01:28:49,408	01:28:52,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who lived in the early 1600s and did a little traveling
EDL	01:28:52,992	01:28:54,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And wrote about what he saw
EDL	01:28:54,528	01:28:55,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the things he saw
EDL	01:28:56,320	01:29:02,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is while he was visiting the contents he got to see one of those executions that they weren't doing much where he was from anymore in England.
EDL	01:29:02,720	01:29:03,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I said earlier I think
EDL	01:29:03,744	01:29:05,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	English of a penchant for hanging
EDL	01:29:06,304	01:29:08,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we'll talk about in a little bit but
EDL	01:29:08,096	01:29:11,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It didn't mean I didn't do other things that just meant it was a little bit more unusual sewing
EDL	01:29:12,448	01:29:14,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	John Taylor goes to
EDL	01:29:14,240	01:29:20,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the continent and sees an opportunity to go to an execution where they're breaking someone with the wheel
EDL	01:29:21,920	01:29:25,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He describes it in his language from that time. This way

EDL	01:30:39,488	01:30:42,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Extended all the broad laying on his back

EDL	01:30:47,424	01:30:48,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Took up a wheel
EDL	01:30:48,704	01:30:51,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Much about the bigness of one of the four wheels of a coach

EDL	01:30:55,360	01:30:58,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And being in his shirt as if he meant to play at tennis
EDL	01:30:58,432	01:30:59,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He took up the wheel
EDL	01:30:59,968	01:31:00,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And set it on the edge
EDL	01:31:01,760	01:31:04,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And turned it with one hand like a top or a whirligig
EDL	01:31:05,344	01:31:06,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then you took it by the spokes
EDL	01:31:07,392	01:31:09,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It looked it up with a mighty stroke
EDL	01:31:09,440	01:31:12,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He beat one of the poor wretches legs in pieces
EDL	01:31:12,512	01:31:13,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The bones I mean
EDL	01:31:14,304	01:31:16,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Witchy roared grievously
EDL	01:31:16,608	01:31:20,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then after a little pause he breaks the other leg in the same manner
EDL	01:31:20,704	01:31:22,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And consequently breaks his arm
EDL	01:31:23,008	01:31:27,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then he stroke for five main blows on his breast
EDL	01:31:27,104	01:31:29,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And burst all his belt in chest and shivers
EDL	01:31:30,432	01:31:32,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Last week he smelled his neck
EDL	01:31:32,224	01:31:33,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And missing
EDL	01:31:33,248	01:31:35,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Burst his chin and jaw autom amex
EDL	01:31:36,064	01:31:37,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lenny took the broken mangled corpse
EDL	01:31:38,368	01:31:40,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And spread it on the Wheel
EDL	01:31:40,160	01:31:46,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And thrust a great poster pile into the neighbor hold of the wheel and then fix the post into the Earth some
EDL	01:31:47,584	01:31:49,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Being in height above the ground
EDL	01:31:49,376	01:31:50,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some 10 or 12 foot
EDL	01:31:51,168	01:31:55,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there the carcass must lie until it be consumed by all-consuming time
EDL	01:31:56,032	01:31:57,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or ravening foul
EDL	01:31:58,336	01:31:58,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:32:00,640	01:32:03,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This was part of the exemplary deterrence
EDL	01:32:03,200	01:32:04,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the idea of the. Right
EDL	01:32:04,992	01:32:07,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You not only have to have the execution be like this
EDL	01:32:07,552	01:32:10,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you have to have pieces of the body lying around to remind people
EDL	01:32:10,624	01:32:15,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You got to put them in gibbets in cages and you got to cut him up in pieces and put the pieces in different places
EDL	01:32:16,000	01:32:20,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you got to leave the people who died on The Gallows hang in there till they fall off by themselves
EDL	01:32:21,376	01:32:22,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As an example to others
EDL	01:32:25,216	01:32:26,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So now considering
EDL	01:32:27,264	01:32:28,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This englishman's
EDL	01:32:29,824	01:32:33,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Description of this rather unusual execution by his standards
EDL	01:32:35,200	01:32:38,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you had witnessed it live you think you would have
EDL	01:32:38,016	01:32:38,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Called it
EDL	01:32:38,784	01:32:39,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Beautiful
EDL	01:32:41,344	01:32:45,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would have been some Sublime spiritual experience for you
EDL	01:32:47,232	01:32:48,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I said earlier
EDL	01:32:48,512	01:32:52,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of the stuff so he's executions are so bizarre if you don't have the faith element
EDL	01:32:52,352	01:32:55,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can't even get your mind around it's hard enough to get your mind around it with the faith element
EDL	01:32:57,472	01:33:00,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Freeland gives another example in his book and I would quote it
EDL	01:33:00,800	01:33:04,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From the original Source accepted there's too much Latin in it it's hard to follow
EDL	01:33:04,896	01:33:06,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But essentially it talks about
EDL	01:33:06,944	01:33:08,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of these breaking on the wheels that happens
EDL	01:33:09,504	01:33:12,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the original source is talking about how
EDL	01:33:12,832	01:33:13,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As the
EDL	01:33:14,624	01:33:18,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Condemned is being killed you know it is if they're being broken on the Wheel
EDL	01:33:18,976	01:33:19,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They are
EDL	01:33:20,256	01:33:22,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Singing or shouting religious verses
EDL	01:33:23,584	01:33:25,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the crowd is picking up
EDL	01:33:25,888	01:33:32,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know where The Condemned leaves off so he'll do the first verse deal do the second in unison he'll do the third they'll do the fourth it's
EDL	01:33:32,288	01:33:32,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Call
EDL	01:33:33,312	01:33:34,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And response
EDL	01:33:34,592	01:33:35,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	While he's being killed
EDL	01:33:37,152	01:33:38,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's more
EDL	01:33:38,176	01:33:42,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	According to this Source he's talking to the guy who's killing in the Executioner
EDL	01:33:42,528	01:33:44,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I guess the only way to put it is he's
EDL	01:33:44,576	01:33:47,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Making requests right tell the crowd I want the next verse in Latin
EDL	01:33:47,904	01:33:48,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then all this kind of stuff
EDL	01:33:51,744	01:33:54,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Completely bizarre to the modern mind
EDL	01:33:55,072	01:33:58,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But as Friedman says this is the kind of thing that the people
EDL	01:33:58,400	01:34:01,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In that era would have seen as potentially beautiful
EDL	01:34:02,496	01:34:08,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A wonderful lesson for the kids write a morality lesson here here's what can happen to you if you go wrong but if you continue to
EDL	01:34:08,896	01:34:10,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Believe in God and you sincerely seek
EDL	01:34:10,688	01:34:14,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Redemption through repentance you too can make it to Heaven I mean
EDL	01:34:15,040	01:34:16,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There is all
EDL	01:34:17,088	01:34:20,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's an element of Faith involved here that's understandable
EDL	01:34:20,416	01:34:21,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The modern people of faith
EDL	01:34:22,720	01:34:24,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But because this isn't modern
EDL	01:34:24,768	01:34:26,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Feh this is a
EDL	01:34:26,048	01:34:29,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Medieval version of Italy Renaissance version of it
EDL	01:34:29,120	01:34:30,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The part that's hard to understand
EDL	01:34:30,912	01:34:33,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did the people in the crowd very well may have seen
EDL	01:34:33,216	01:34:35,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The violence being done to the malefactors
EDL	01:34:35,776	01:34:36,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Body
EDL	01:34:36,800	01:34:37,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As necessary
EDL	01:34:38,592	01:34:41,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To get to the Heavenly goal and if that's the case
EDL	01:34:42,688	01:34:44,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What was being done to that malefactors body
EDL	01:34:45,760	01:34:47,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was it good thing
EDL	01:34:47,040	01:34:48,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And because it was being done
EDL	01:34:48,832	01:34:51,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Someone soul is going to be saved
EDL	01:34:51,136	01:34:52,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you actually watch that
EDL	01:34:53,952	01:34:59,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I did pretty good crazy entertaining show with a good message at the end and a feel-good
EDL	01:34:59,840	01:35:04,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Minnesota an attitude when you get home you're all run out the emotions have been totally in play
EDL	01:35:04,192	01:35:06,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean I guess what I'm saying is there's an entertainment
EDL	01:35:06,752	01:35:07,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That isn't there
EDL	01:35:08,544	01:35:09,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the same time
EDL	01:35:10,336	01:35:14,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is so formalizar when you read the rules by me to have it written down.
EDL	01:35:14,176	01:35:18,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know who stands where and what the formations in line is supposed to be who comes first and
EDL	01:35:18,784	01:35:20,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is a celebration of
EDL	01:35:21,344	01:35:23,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Both religious and secular Authority
EDL	01:35:24,416	01:35:26,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's so ritualize would be hard to make a case
EDL	01:35:27,488	01:35:28,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Edit anything but that
EDL	01:35:28,768	01:35:34,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So if you say people are enjoying what they're seeing and they go home glad they came and there's a huge draw for the next execution
EDL	01:35:35,424	01:35:36,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't think there's any arguing about that
EDL	01:35:38,240	01:35:41,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's not the same thing as what's going on in the Roman arena is it
EDL	01:35:42,848	01:35:43,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Friedland
EDL	01:35:43,616	01:35:44,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Says quote
EDL	01:35:45,152	01:35:51,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Prior to the middle of the 16th century those who attended executions I will resist calling them spectators
EDL	01:35:52,064	01:35:56,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did so largely out of a sincere desire to participate in the ceremony
EDL	01:35:56,416	01:35:58,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That held profound personal meaning for them
EDL	01:35:58,976	01:36:02,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not because they wanted to talk from a distance at the suffering of others
EDL	01:36:03,072	01:36:04,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These were less
EDL	01:36:04,352	01:36:08,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectacles he writes in the way that we understand the word today
EDL	01:36:08,192	01:36:09,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then they were rituals
EDL	01:36:09,472	01:36:14,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In which those who attended saw themselves as full participants rather than onlookers
EDL	01:36:14,592	01:36:20,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When asked was usually the case The Condemned participated fully in the ritual of repentance
EDL	01:36:20,480	01:36:23,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Seeking forgiveness from Divine and Earthly authorities
EDL	01:36:23,552	01:36:26,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Witnesses usually Bridge the physical distance
EDL	01:36:26,368	01:36:27,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between themselves
EDL	01:36:27,648	01:36:29,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the patient meaning The Condemned
EDL	01:36:29,696	01:36:30,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Through prayers
EDL	01:36:30,976	01:36:32,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tears and empathy
EDL	01:36:33,024	01:36:39,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The public transformation of The Condemned criminal into a repentant sinner enable the entire community.

EDL	01:36:48,128	01:36:52,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Don't also had a lot of other ritual important elements to it
EDL	01:36:52,992	01:36:54,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The key though as
EDL	01:36:54,528	01:36:57,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historian Richard Evans points out the whole affair
EDL	01:36:58,112	01:37:03,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Requires an absolute consensus on the part of everyone involved executioner

EDL	01:37:13,472	01:37:16,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Eternal life was indeed what the malefactor sought
EDL	01:37:16,800	01:37:20,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And with the ritual meaning of execution was designed to provide
EDL	01:37:20,384	01:37:25,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Almost without exception The Condemned gave the impression of being penitent Christian

EDL	01:37:31,904	01:37:36,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It depended on the acceptance of all concerned of the possibility of an afterlife

EDL	01:38:03,392	01:38:05,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By ensuring a grateful Corp

EDL	01:38:19,008	01:38:22,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a certain irony isn't there that modern people
EDL	01:38:22,080	01:38:24,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Instantly recognized in a situation like this
EDL	01:38:25,408	01:38:26,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That Europe in its most
EDL	01:38:27,712	01:38:31,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Religiously Fanatic. In its history
EDL	01:38:31,552	01:38:33,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are treating their Outkast
EDL	01:38:33,600	01:38:34,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Malefactors
EDL	01:38:35,136	01:38:36,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And lawbreakers
EDL	01:38:36,672	01:38:42,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In exactly the same fashion as the individual at the center of their religion was treated
EDL	01:38:43,072	01:38:45,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Jesus Christ of course perhaps the most famous
EDL	01:38:46,144	01:38:46,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Victim
EDL	01:38:47,168	01:38:48,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of a hideous
EDL	01:38:48,192	01:38:48,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public
EDL	01:38:48,960	01:38:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Torture execution
EDL	01:38:51,008	01:38:52,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On a cross by the way
EDL	01:38:52,800	01:38:57,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which is just how some of these European execution victims were killed two
EDL	01:38:57,920	01:38:59,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By their Christian Executioner's
EDL	01:39:00,992	01:39:07,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And while historians point out that sometimes the crowd could make the connection between the similarities between the
EDL	01:39:07,648	01:39:11,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Condemned having to make their way to the scaffold and Jesus having to make his way
EDL	01:39:12,256	01:39:14,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Enough to where he was going to be nailed to the cross
EDL	01:39:15,840	01:39:18,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No one seems to make the next obvious connection which is wait a minute
EDL	01:39:19,424	01:39:23,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If our Saviour died in one of these hideous public torture executions
EDL	01:39:23,008	01:39:25,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Should we really be doing this to other people
EDL	01:39:26,592	01:39:29,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nonetheless this is kind of what makes history fun
EDL	01:39:29,664	01:39:31,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And we as people interesting
EDL	01:39:32,736	01:39:34,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You just can't make this stuff up
EDL	01:39:37,856	01:39:40,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So I think it's pretty fair to say
EDL	01:39:40,672	01:39:46,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That while we won't give the people in this era a get-out-of-jail-free card to totally be absolved
EDL	01:39:46,816	01:39:51,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From the charge that they might have been going to these Affairs for you know she or entertainment and enjoyment
EDL	01:39:52,448	01:39:56,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We will say that like all those other cases we mentioned you know the northeastern
EDL	01:39:56,288	01:40:02,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Native American tribes for example we don't know the water is too muddy to say cuz there's obviously ritual
EDL	01:40:02,176	01:40:03,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And religious elements involved
EDL	01:40:06,784	01:40:09,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's only when you strip away those Elliman
EDL	01:40:11,392	01:40:15,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That may be the potential get-out-of-jail-free card religious
EDL	01:40:16,000	01:40:17,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Side of this
EDL	01:40:17,280	01:40:18,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ceases to protect
EDL	01:40:18,560	01:40:20,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The society from charges
EDL	01:40:21,120	01:40:23,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That they're just watching this stuff to get a kick out of it
EDL	01:40:25,472	01:40:30,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the reasons by the way that this will happen over the period for about 1500 to 1800 R complex
EDL	01:40:30,848	01:40:34,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're arguing about they're also interwoven so it's very difficult to say
EDL	01:40:34,688	01:40:41,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You have to pay a lot of attention to this element what's going on because it's hard to quantify how much that matters compared to some other element is going on
EDL	01:40:41,088	01:40:41,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how they interact
EDL	01:40:42,368	01:40:44,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take for example one of the theories
EDL	01:40:44,416	01:40:45,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which I love I love this thing because it
EDL	01:40:46,720	01:40:50,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's an element with it just touches some hardcore history little nerve of mine
EDL	01:40:50,560	01:40:52,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the ideas behind
EDL	01:40:53,120	01:40:58,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How these executions go from these religious experiences with a crowd of The Condemned are working together to get a soul to heaven
EDL	01:41:00,032	01:41:02,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More theories on how this changes Friedland
EDL	01:41:02,592	01:41:04,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Subscribe to this I guess I think
EDL	01:41:05,920	01:41:06,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's at the Lutheran
EDL	01:41:07,712	01:41:08,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Change this a bit
EDL	01:41:10,016	01:41:12,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know there's this great schism right we all understand the Protestant
EDL	01:41:13,088	01:41:17,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reformation the big revolution Martin Luther kicks off and by the way the Protestants as it is
EDL	01:41:18,208	01:41:21,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Overall entity didn't seem to have a problem with executions
EDL	01:41:22,048	01:41:22,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Luther
EDL	01:41:22,816	01:41:24,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was quoted as saying was famous quote.
EDL	01:41:25,120	01:41:28,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hands of the Executioner the hands of God or something like that
EDL	01:41:28,960	01:41:33,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But when these Lutheran's begin to be early on executed as Heretics
EDL	01:41:33,824	01:41:35,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're a curiosity for the crowd
EDL	01:41:36,640	01:41:38,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one of the reasons they were curiosity
EDL	01:41:38,944	01:41:40,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Friedland another's right is that
EDL	01:41:40,736	01:41:43,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They will go to the execution
EDL	01:41:43,296	01:41:44,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Happy
EDL	01:41:45,088	01:41:46,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Glad handing
EDL	01:41:46,368	01:41:47,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Patient and ready
EDL	01:41:47,648	01:41:48,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	01:41:48,416	01:41:54,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The thing about them that's so difficult is that when the the confessors are dealing with them or the priests are dealing with them with your throat
EDL	01:41:54,816	01:41:57,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're dealing with them or the crowd is trying to deal with them
EDL	01:41:57,632	01:42:00,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's almost a like who's out christening huella
EDL	01:42:01,216	01:42:03,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can call them Heretics all you want but when they're
EDL	01:42:03,776	01:42:05,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Screaming
EDL	01:42:05,056	01:42:08,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In pain during the execution there screaming out the name of Jesus Christ
EDL	01:42:12,224	01:42:14,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are we saying earlier that vine I like
EDL	01:42:14,016	01:42:19,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	During this. The most horrible procedures were done on devout Christians by even more devout Christians
EDL	01:42:20,416	01:42:21,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Freeland and others point out that
EDL	01:42:22,720	01:42:24,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This may have short-circuited
EDL	01:42:25,280	01:42:28,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This entire ritual we talked about earlier right the one
EDL	01:42:28,608	01:42:34,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whereas on Peter sparenberg says he says this requires the cooperation of The Condemned for it to work right
EDL	01:42:34,240	01:42:36,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are you go home after watching one of these events feeling
EDL	01:42:36,800	01:42:38,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Satisfied
EDL	01:42:38,080	01:42:43,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And like you did a good thing and like all is right in the world everything has to go as planned but what if the criminals
EDL	01:42:43,456	01:42:46,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As you would have seen them these Heretics
EDL	01:42:46,016	01:42:47,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is they don't repent
EDL	01:42:48,320	01:42:49,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if they don't say they were wrong
EDL	01:42:50,368	01:42:52,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if they don't play the role
EDL	01:42:52,416	01:42:58,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That they're supposed to play well it doesn't number of thing but the one thing it certainly does as pointed out over and over by several different people
EDL	01:42:58,560	01:43:00,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it short-circuits the script
EDL	01:43:01,632	01:43:04,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The one thing these events don't have a lot of
EDL	01:43:04,448	01:43:09,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is uncertainty at the very formalized Affair we just described these executions in the Middle Ages and afterwards
EDL	01:43:11,104	01:43:13,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The fact that these Lutheran's could do anything
EDL	01:43:14,432	01:43:16,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Adds an element of uncertainty
EDL	01:43:17,504	01:43:22,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are they going to recant their faith right before they're about to be burned alive
EDL	01:43:22,624	01:43:24,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes they did sometimes he didn't
EDL	01:43:24,416	01:43:25,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It creates a
EDL	01:43:26,208	01:43:27,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Level of uncertainty
EDL	01:43:28,000	01:43:31,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is not that dissimilar pardon me for saying so
EDL	01:43:31,584	01:43:32,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To a sporting event
EDL	01:43:32,864	01:43:34,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you don't know the outcome
EDL	01:43:36,192	01:43:38,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Freedom quotes historian David Nichols
EDL	01:43:38,752	01:43:43,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who said that people were quote drawn to the burning of Heretics by curiosity
EDL	01:43:43,872	01:43:48,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were Novelties and people wish to see how this new kind of criminal face death
EDL	01:43:48,736	01:43:49,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:43:51,296	01:43:52,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Apparently this
EDL	01:43:52,832	01:43:54,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Curiosity about
EDL	01:43:54,112	01:43:56,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Protestant Heritage won't last very long
EDL	01:43:56,672	01:43:58,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But some historians think that this
EDL	01:43:58,976	01:44:04,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Plays a role in breaking down the barriers if you will separating people were going to these things for ritual reasons
EDL	01:44:05,376	01:44:07,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People are going to these things for spectacles
EDL	01:44:08,704	01:44:15,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now that said before there's disagreement on a lot of this stuff a lot of the question we're getting into now you will find the app
EDL	01:44:15,104	01:44:16,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experts I've noticed
EDL	01:44:16,640	01:44:20,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Disagree not that this is a factor but how much weight you give each fact
EDL	01:44:20,480	01:44:23,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're so we just mentioned the Curiosity factor with Protestants Heretics
EDL	01:44:24,064	01:44:24,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Import news.
EDL	01:44:25,856	01:44:27,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Different people disagree
EDL	01:44:28,672	01:44:30,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are other elements in play here
EDL	01:44:30,720	01:44:32,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That should be mentioned that are interesting that are
EDL	01:44:32,768	01:44:33,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Part of the
EDL	01:44:33,792	01:44:35,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reality of the times if you will
EDL	01:44:35,584	01:44:39,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How about the fact that this is the. Where people really start
EDL	01:44:39,168	01:44:40,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Examining
EDL	01:44:40,704	01:44:41,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	01:44:41,984	01:44:43,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Medically
EDL	01:44:43,776	01:44:45,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dissecting human bodies
EDL	01:44:47,360	01:44:53,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So it'll be like a theater sometimes they'll open up a person and they'll be a crowd watching from above of disinterested science
EDL	01:44:54,528	01:44:58,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who will see y'all at the ligaments work and there is the aorta I needed that kind of stuff
EDL	01:44:59,136	01:45:00,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they get these bodies by the way
EDL	01:45:01,440	01:45:03,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Usually from execution victims
EDL	01:45:03,744	01:45:04,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it's
EDL	01:45:04,512	01:45:10,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Considered to be one of the parts of the sentence that the judge wants to make it extra bad he'll say not only are going to break you on the Wheel
EDL	01:45:11,168	01:45:14,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But afterwards we're going to give you to the doctors to
EDL	01:45:14,240	01:45:17,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was called anatomize you'll be an atomizer
EDL	01:45:18,592	01:45:24,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now you and me we may say who cares we're already dead but you're talkin about people have a very different belief system and being an atomizer
EDL	01:45:24,992	01:45:27,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is not only something that might mess you up
EDL	01:45:27,552	01:45:28,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In heaven question
EDL	01:45:29,088	01:45:30,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's darn
EDL	01:45:30,624	01:45:31,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shameful
EDL	01:45:32,416	01:45:38,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And another thing you'll notice of these executions were modern people will go away. Who cares it's part of shame in the
EDL	01:45:38,816	01:45:43,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Individual and maybe their family and certainly anyone who might want to do what they did
EDL	01:45:44,704	01:45:48,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The by far the greatest amount of agreement you will see when you read from
EDL	01:45:49,056	01:45:51,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Years ago to now the experts on the subject of
EDL	01:45:52,384	01:45:54,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And these kinds of executions and what's involved
EDL	01:45:54,944	01:45:56,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The elephant in the living room is state power
EDL	01:45:56,992	01:45:57,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	State Authority
EDL	01:45:59,808	01:46:03,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You mentioned earlier and if you look at the fall of the Western Roman Empire
EDL	01:46:03,648	01:46:08,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the development of states in the history of all that afterwards you famously will get to the
EDL	01:46:09,024	01:46:15,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Treaty of Westphalia in the 17th century where they will talk about the nation-state being the highest form of four
EDL	01:46:15,424	01:46:17,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Political organization all that kind of stuff
EDL	01:46:17,216	01:46:20,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's during this period that these nation-states these budding
EDL	01:46:21,312	01:46:27,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Infant nation-states are beginning to create the sort of bureaucracy and power and all that stuff that we associate with them
EDL	01:46:27,712	01:46:29,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now the number one thing you have to do by the way
EDL	01:46:30,528	01:46:32,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We secure a monopoly of force
EDL	01:46:32,832	01:46:34,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can't run
EDL	01:46:34,368	01:46:40,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A modern nation-state and have a bunch of War Lords and Barons and other people able to have their own private armies and
EDL	01:46:40,768	01:46:41,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Messing with you
EDL	01:46:42,048	01:46:46,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Job one get rid of them and there's only one Authority and they're in the Capitol you begin to get these
EDL	01:46:46,912	01:46:48,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The so-called absolutist
EDL	01:46:48,704	01:46:51,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	States of the earth Louis XIV era
EDL	01:46:52,544	01:46:56,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a lot of reason this is important as I may be the number one most important part
EDL	01:46:57,408	01:47:01,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's start with the fact that it's the main reason you can't follow the story chronologically
EDL	01:47:02,016	01:47:04,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because depending on how advanced
EDL	01:47:04,576	01:47:07,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The authority of the state is in any given region
EDL	01:47:07,648	01:47:12,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The execution procedures and all that stuff will be at different phases so for example
EDL	01:47:12,256	01:47:13,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Places like London
EDL	01:47:14,048	01:47:15,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A country like England
EDL	01:47:16,096	01:47:18,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which establishes a monopoly of force
EDL	01:47:18,656	01:47:21,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A relatively early compared to the rest of the states in Europe
EDL	01:47:22,240	01:47:25,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You will see the executions take on a different form
EDL	01:47:25,312	01:47:29,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You will see the goal of the state being different you will see the reaction of the crowd watching differently
EDL	01:47:31,200	01:47:32,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Paris will do something similar
EDL	01:47:32,992	01:47:36,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you could go out in the Hinterlands go to some small
EDL	01:47:36,064	01:47:38,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Place in Bavaria Maybe
EDL	01:47:38,624	01:47:45,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you'll find it a long time after they stop doing the whole religious connection with The Condemned and all that
EDL	01:47:45,024	01:47:48,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hiding places like London and Paris they're still doing it in the Backwoods of Bavaria
EDL	01:47:49,888	01:47:51,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So this is all happening at different time
EDL	01:47:54,240	01:47:55,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Noesis we said
EDL	01:47:55,520	01:47:59,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You lose the get-out-of-jail-free card when your ritual turns into a spectacle
EDL	01:47:59,616	01:48:01,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much do you blame
EDL	01:48:01,152	01:48:04,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The power of the state for this well let's understand what they do right
EDL	01:48:05,248	01:48:07,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They begin to have a problem
EDL	01:48:07,296	01:48:09,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With the religious side of this whole deal
EDL	01:48:10,624	01:48:13,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because the state's interest in these public executions
EDL	01:48:13,696	01:48:18,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is four things to be as absolutely horrifying as possible to the crowd to send a message
EDL	01:48:19,072	01:48:20,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Write this is deterrence at work
EDL	01:48:22,400	01:48:23,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But what if through
EDL	01:48:23,936	01:48:27,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All those religious ceremonies that we've been talking about
EDL	01:48:27,776	01:48:32,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The religious side of things turns this Condemned criminal who the public should hate
EDL	01:48:32,640	01:48:37,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And be repelled by and not admire at all with that turns them into and almost fainted figure
EDL	01:48:38,528	01:48:41,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She began to see these complain to me if there is going hey
EDL	01:48:41,600	01:48:42,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We can't have this right
EDL	01:48:43,392	01:48:45,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We don't want the crowd
EDL	01:48:45,440	01:48:46,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To feel
EDL	01:48:46,720	01:48:49,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In any certain admiration we want them to feel
EDL	01:48:49,792	01:48:52,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Scoring for the speakers of the begin to have problems with
EDL	01:48:53,120	01:48:56,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What they want out of these executions conflicting with what the religious
EDL	01:48:56,448	01:48:57,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Side of the
EDL	01:48:57,984	01:48:59,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Budding nation-state
EDL	01:48:59,776	01:49:00,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With the execution
EDL	01:49:00,800	01:49:03,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The goals of the clergy and the state Aurora.
EDL	01:49:06,944	01:49:08,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just by the way
EDL	01:49:08,480	01:49:14,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Correspond to the same. Where a bunch of the Elites in these most civilized society
EDL	01:49:14,880	01:49:21,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's right here in London or Paris or what not the really civilized Elites are not so religious as they
EDL	01:49:21,280	01:49:22,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They used to be
EDL	01:49:22,304	01:49:26,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again it would be stupid to say that they're not religious compared to now
EDL	01:49:26,400	01:49:28,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But compared to the so-called unit
EDL	01:49:28,960	01:49:29,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Superstitious
EDL	01:49:29,984	01:49:31,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	High water mark
EDL	01:49:31,264	01:49:32,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Dark Ages
EDL	01:49:32,800	01:49:34,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The darkest we now know but you know
EDL	01:49:34,080	01:49:34,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean
EDL	01:49:35,104	01:49:39,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is a whole different animal these rationalist of the budding pre Enlightenment era
EDL	01:49:39,968	01:49:41,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they're often the ones
EDL	01:49:41,504	01:49:44,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who are pushing this idea that hey these religious people
EDL	01:49:44,832	01:49:50,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are screwing up the goal of this thing we just to make these criminals the worst people on Earth and you never want to be one
EDL	01:49:53,024	01:49:55,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historian Richard Evans in rituals of Retribution
EDL	01:49:55,840	01:49:57,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Writes about this new
EDL	01:49:57,632	01:50:03,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So I've been lighting Montera that's budding and let's not pretend that it's budding among the rank-and-file in the population it's Buddy
EDL	01:50:05,056	01:50:07,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cream of the inteligencia
EDL	01:50:07,104	01:50:08,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They have an infant
EDL	01:50:08,128	01:50:08,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here's what
EDL	01:50:09,408	01:50:10,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Women's rights quote
EDL	01:50:11,200	01:50:17,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The new rationalistic concentration on public punishment is a theatrical demonstration designed to make the
EDL	01:50:17,600	01:50:19,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Publican w**** the criminal
EDL	01:50:19,392	01:50:20,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was part
EDL	01:50:20,160	01:50:21,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In other words
EDL	01:50:21,184	01:50:22,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Have a broader concentration
EDL	01:50:22,976	01:50:25,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Only educated in deterrent function of punishment
EDL	01:50:26,304	01:50:29,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is easy to see that this concept of penal policy
EDL	01:50:29,376	01:50:33,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ran counter to the religious and crypto materialist rituals
EDL	01:50:33,728	01:50:37,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which played such a major part in capital punishment in the early modern period
EDL	01:50:37,824	01:50:42,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And which before the 18th century were accepted in the elite as well as popular culture
EDL	01:50:42,944	01:50:43,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:50:44,736	01:50:49,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So this is an example of one of the arguments being made by someone Evans
EDL	01:50:49,856	01:50:53,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Identifies as one of the rationalists pamphleteers
EDL	01:50:53,184	01:50:54,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of his day
EDL	01:50:54,720	01:50:56,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Listen to the arguments against
EDL	01:50:57,280	01:50:59,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The religious side of this hole
EDL	01:50:59,840	01:51:02,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What do we call it earlier Sublime beautiful experience
EDL	01:51:05,728	01:51:06,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Evan says quote
EDL	01:51:07,264	01:51:13,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The purpose of the public execution Thunder the rationalist pamphleteer was being completely undermined by this
EDL	01:51:13,664	01:51:14,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Contradiction
EDL	01:51:14,688	01:51:16,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was unfortunately true he declared
EDL	01:51:16,992	01:51:17,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	According to
EDL	01:51:17,760	01:51:19,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pamphleteer from that era
EDL	01:51:19,552	01:51:25,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Set the rebel is not motivated by the desire to hear something good and that's be moved and uplifted
EDL	01:51:25,952	01:51:28,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amelie by the wish to see something new
EDL	01:51:28,000	01:51:29,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ella satisfy his curiosity
EDL	01:51:30,304	01:51:33,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even on many occasions at the cost of human feelings
EDL	01:51:34,144	01:51:40,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The ultimate purpose of public punishment is largely frustrated if the malefactor dies in circumstances that arouse
EDL	01:51:40,544	01:51:42,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The kind of admiration and respect
EDL	01:51:43,616	01:51:45,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Infanticidal woman
EDL	01:51:45,408	01:51:47,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Clothing adorned purely and white
EDL	01:51:47,712	01:51:54,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going joyfully to her spiritual wedding accompanied by the preacher is a very dangerous site for other people
EDL	01:51:54,112	01:51:55,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Call in the conduct of their daily life
EDL	01:51:56,160	01:51:58,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm a murderer he continues
EDL	01:51:58,208	01:52:04,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going to his death accompanied by the size prayers and admonitions of the preacher and by the singing of inspire
EDL	01:52:04,608	01:52:06,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hiring funeral hymns
EDL	01:52:06,144	01:52:07,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Open has the deleterious effect
EDL	01:52:07,936	01:52:13,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of causing Weeknd Melancholy Nature's to desire for themselves a form of Extinction
EDL	01:52:13,056	01:52:14,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which is they think
EDL	01:52:14,080	01:52:20,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Allows them to meet their end more peacefully indeed more joyfully they're on their deathbed after a lengthy illness
EDL	01:52:20,992	01:52:21,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	01:52:23,552	01:52:29,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Evans then point out that this doesn't mean that these people thought The Condemned should have no religious consolation but that he should occur in private
EDL	01:52:30,976	01:52:33,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will heal their souls privately but don't let it
EDL	01:52:33,792	01:52:36,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Soften the crowds attitude toward them in other words
EDL	01:52:36,608	01:52:38,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The idea that this should be something
EDL	01:52:39,424	01:52:41,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Were you see this person
EDL	01:52:41,472	01:52:45,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As going off to some wonderful destination in part because you are sending them there
EDL	01:52:46,080	01:52:48,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That screws up the whole reason the state wants this guy dead
EDL	01:52:49,408	01:52:50,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Woman dead
EDL	01:52:52,224	01:52:53,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now there are other things
EDL	01:52:54,016	01:52:56,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They get thrown into the mix as reasons why
EDL	01:52:56,576	01:53:01,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The attitudes of the spectators change from ritualistic to voyeuristic
EDL	01:53:01,952	01:53:03,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take broadsheet
EDL	01:53:03,744	01:53:06,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For example in the rise of broadsheets
EDL	01:53:07,584	01:53:09,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Huaraches by the way a term still used
EDL	01:53:09,632	01:53:11,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the oversized newspapers today
EDL	01:53:12,192	01:53:14,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a kind of newspaper I guess you could
EDL	01:53:14,240	01:53:18,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Say a booklet of pamphlet sometimes it was just one big piece of paper
EDL	01:53:18,848	01:53:24,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But think about something that looked like Ben Franklin did it on his home printing press and that's not a bad mental
EDL	01:53:26,784	01:53:32,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Often times it was mostly illustrations because you know who knows how many people in the audience could actual
EDL	01:53:32,160	01:53:32,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Read
EDL	01:53:33,440	01:53:39,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The text would often explain what was in the pictures and sometimes it almost look like a comic book where you would see several different panels
EDL	01:53:40,096	01:53:42,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Showing events in chronological order
EDL	01:53:44,448	01:53:48,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When these things first started to appear either late 1500 maybe maybe even earlier
EDL	01:53:49,312	01:53:55,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What they were showing was often sold of a cautionary tale a moralistic cautionary tales
EDL	01:53:55,712	01:53:56,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	First
EDL	01:53:56,992	01:53:59,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pain in the comic book shows the person being born
EDL	01:53:59,808	01:54:00,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Everything looks
EDL	01:54:00,576	01:54:01,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Great
EDL	01:54:01,344	01:54:05,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then the next painting shows the person that adolescents and still going good everything's right
EDL	01:54:05,696	01:54:07,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in the third pain lady shows the
EDL	01:54:07,744	01:54:09,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pivotal moment in their life
EDL	01:54:09,536	01:54:10,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you decide to

EDL	01:54:26,432	01:54:28,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of course the message to be absorbed by the
EDL	01:54:28,736	01:54:31,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Little kitties at night when you show it to them is
EDL	01:54:31,040	01:54:33,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know I stay on the straight and narrow or this could happen to you
EDL	01:54:35,392	01:54:38,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Overtime these broadsheets begin to become more
EDL	01:54:39,488	01:54:40,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's just say lascivious
EDL	01:54:41,536	01:54:42,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Salacious
EDL	01:54:42,816	01:54:45,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mushroom or something we would recognize today in fact
EDL	01:54:47,168	01:54:49,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you said tabloid ask
EDL	01:54:49,216	01:54:50,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That might not be too far
EDL	01:54:51,264	01:54:55,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Off the mark this coincides with a. And again there's a chicken in an egg albumin
EDL	01:54:55,872	01:54:59,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much is this is encouraged by the broadsheets and how much of it is
EDL	01:54:59,712	01:55:02,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In what societies doing in the broadsheets are just
EDL	01:55:02,272	01:55:03,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're playing into the trend of it
EDL	01:55:04,064	01:55:05,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An increased interest in
EDL	01:55:05,600	01:55:06,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crime
EDL	01:55:07,648	01:55:08,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Punishments
EDL	01:55:08,672	01:55:09,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	01:55:09,696	01:55:12,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We would say today gossip I just read one
EDL	01:55:12,512	01:55:17,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	History were the historian was saying that one of the Prime things language has been used for since language
EDL	01:55:17,888	01:55:19,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Began was gossiping
EDL	01:55:20,192	01:55:21,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Depending on how you
EDL	01:55:21,984	01:55:23,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Define that term but
EDL	01:55:24,288	01:55:26,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But in a sense these broadsheets
EDL	01:55:26,080	01:55:27,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's began showing
EDL	01:55:27,872	01:55:34,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Real things when they were talk about these executions which kind of help with the drawer right the people knew that these were real events but then
EDL	01:55:34,272	01:55:35,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people doing the broadsheets
EDL	01:55:36,320	01:55:37,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wood
EDL	01:55:37,088	01:55:43,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Embellish them and dramatize them they make the crimes more salacious and they usually be about unspeakable
EDL	01:55:43,488	01:55:46,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cool things with your course if you're gossiping the best thing to speaker
EDL	01:55:46,304	01:55:47,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they would
EDL	01:55:47,584	01:55:51,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then in lurid detail your talk about the execution
EDL	01:55:51,680	01:55:56,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there would be a lot of focus on the dramatic last moment the climactic
EDL	01:55:56,544	01:56:00,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know last speech maybe from The Gallows or the Ravenstone
EDL	01:56:02,432	01:56:08,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Paul Friedland talked about one of these famous people think about son of a Matt drudge of their day just knowing exactly what sort of
EDL	01:56:09,088	01:56:11,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the mood of the public really was
EDL	01:56:11,392	01:56:15,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Signifying right what buttons do you have to push to release a lot of these broadsheets
EDL	01:56:15,744	01:56:16,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he says
EDL	01:56:17,024	01:56:20,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The titillating short stories had subjects like
EDL	01:56:20,608	01:56:21,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Murderer
EDL	01:56:21,888	01:56:22,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Incest

EDL	01:56:25,728	01:56:26,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And sorcery
EDL	01:56:27,520	01:56:30,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No confirmation yet that one of the most called hardcore history
EDL	01:56:32,640	01:56:34,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you begin to see
EDL	01:56:34,432	01:56:36,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A change in what the people want
EDL	01:56:36,992	01:56:41,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it's difficult to untangle how much of that is because the people were changing
EDL	01:56:41,088	01:56:47,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how much of the fact that the people were changing was due to the fact that they were reading more of these broadsheets and it was interesting the more
EDL	01:56:47,488	01:56:51,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Good morning True Crime and what was going on in these people who were dying on The Gallows and
EDL	01:56:51,840	01:56:52,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As one
EDL	01:56:52,864	01:56:54,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historian said it was a tragic
EDL	01:56:54,656	01:56:55,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Spectacle
EDL	01:56:55,680	01:56:58,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But these people were selling these broadsheet publishers
EDL	01:57:00,032	01:57:05,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it helped change the focus and some unquantifiable way from a religious oriented ritual
EDL	01:57:05,920	01:57:07,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To something that was much more based on
EDL	01:57:08,480	01:57:09,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Curiosity
EDL	01:57:10,272	01:57:11,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And salaciousness
EDL	01:57:12,320	01:57:13,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And maybe even
EDL	01:57:14,368	01:57:20,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Voyeuristic enjoyment of somebody else's suffering in this is where we get to the next and he's broadsheets
EDL	01:57:21,024	01:57:24,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're existing at the same time and were intertwined with these people
EDL	01:57:24,608	01:57:28,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who like to go to the executions now for Less religious
EDL	01:57:28,704	01:57:29,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More fun
EDL	01:57:31,008	01:57:37,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historian Paul Friedland says that he was in the 16th century that you first saw the beginnings of these people who would show up
EDL	01:57:37,408	01:57:38,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are the executions more for
EDL	01:57:39,968	01:57:40,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fun
EDL	01:57:40,736	01:57:45,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Baby funds not the right where they they were almost like a rarefied group of hobbyist
EDL	01:57:45,344	01:57:48,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It seems like for a while till it became a mass thing
EDL	01:57:48,672	01:57:55,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know these people used to be in on it years before the trend started in August to see these guys all the time an Executor Khan
EDL	01:57:55,072	01:57:57,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These cuties people start to purchase
EDL	01:57:58,144	01:58:00,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know select seats so that they could be
EDL	01:58:00,448	01:58:03,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the execution but not right down in the mosh pit
EDL	01:58:04,288	01:58:06,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If I Freeland says that to those folks
EDL	01:58:06,848	01:58:13,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people ride around the scaffold or the Ravenstone to The Gallows those people are actually characters in The Great tragic

EDL	01:58:29,120	01:58:31,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lawyers of the penal system in action
EDL	01:58:31,936	01:58:32,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he says
EDL	01:58:33,216	01:58:34,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That they are
EDL	01:58:34,752	01:58:35,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Perhaps analogous
EDL	01:58:36,544	01:58:42,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The same in a similar way to these people who are now enjoying the broadsheets as they get more and more pop life you know 19

EDL	01:58:47,552	01:58:48,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe you could say
EDL	01:58:48,832	01:58:52,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if there is a connection between the two perhaps maybe one helps
EDL	01:58:52,416	01:58:53,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Create the demand
EDL	01:58:53,696	01:58:58,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well they got it right you read a few broadsheet than you think. Maybe I should see one of these things live

EDL	01:59:01,120	01:59:06,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In many respects we might think of rosettes readers hemans friends while they were set maybe the Matt drudge of his
EDL	01:59:06,752	01:59:08,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Day in terms of broadsheets
EDL	01:59:08,544	01:59:13,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We might think of rough sex readers as analogous to the new penal voyeurs
EDL	01:59:13,152	01:59:16,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who are gathering in Windows overlooking the scaffold
EDL	01:59:16,480	01:59:19,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And precisely the time when he was writing his tragic stories
EDL	01:59:20,064	01:59:26,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Recette tragic realism made readers feel as if they were almost there at the scene of the execution
EDL	01:59:26,720	01:59:30,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What was the relative freedom to experience their emotions as if they weren't
EDL	01:59:30,816	01:59:33,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To forget themselves in SOB with the light in private
EDL	01:59:35,424	01:59:36,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a way he writes
EDL	01:59:36,960	01:59:42,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The new penal voyeurs experienced a similar sense of being almost there
EDL	01:59:42,080	01:59:46,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From behind their windows at a considerable distance from the scaffold
EDL	01:59:46,176	01:59:50,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They can gaze out at the real-life drama unfolding beneath them
EDL	01:59:50,272	01:59:51,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they could take it all in

EDL	01:59:54,112	01:59:56,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Compassion of the crowd
EDL	01:59:56,160	01:59:59,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As if they were all characters in a magnificent spectacle

EDL	02:00:01,792	02:00:02,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The spectators
EDL	02:00:04,096	02:00:05,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were beginning in other words
EDL	02:00:05,888	02:00:12,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To process the execution scenes played out before them almost as if they were watching one of Pierre corneille
EDL	02:00:12,288	02:00:16,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Neil's tragic heroes or heroines deliver a monologue prior to execution
EDL	02:00:17,408	02:00:20,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Peeking in on the most intimate moments of another person's life

EDL	02:00:26,880	02:00:29,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were free to feel a sense of tragic Delight
EDL	02:00:29,952	02:00:32,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're free to feel nothing at all
EDL	02:00:32,000	02:00:37,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For them the crowd gathered around the scaffold have become a kind of Greek chorus
EDL	02:00:37,120	02:00:41,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reacting to the suffering of The Condemned and expressing The Compassion that they
EDL	02:00:41,728	02:00:44,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Seated up above the windows no longer felt
EDL	02:00:45,312	02:00:45,824	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:00:47,104	02:00:52,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now I'm relying on a small number of sources he was smaller than I like because believe it or not there's not a lot
EDL	02:00:53,504	02:00:56,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Especially in the stuff we're talking about here but I think friedland's wonderful
EDL	02:00:56,832	02:00:57,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Facebook is wonderful
EDL	02:00:58,368	02:01:00,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he tries to get his mind around
EDL	02:01:00,672	02:01:04,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These really interesting questions he does as good of a job as any I've ever read on the subject
EDL	02:01:06,048	02:01:09,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He helps us understand this transition which is difficult because
EDL	02:01:09,120	02:01:14,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we said earlier the transitions will happen at different times in different places you can't follow this chronologically
EDL	02:01:16,288	02:01:22,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's true is Need for any of these in a great so-called periods of history in your history books the Renaissance the enlightenment
EDL	02:01:22,688	02:01:26,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Renaissance comes to Italy a lot earlier than it comes to
EDL	02:01:26,272	02:01:27,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	England
EDL	02:01:27,040	02:01:27,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right
EDL	02:01:28,064	02:01:28,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So we all understand
EDL	02:01:29,344	02:01:34,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Changing sensibilities changing cultural attitudes changing ways of life all this stuff
EDL	02:01:34,208	02:01:35,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Happens much more slowly
EDL	02:01:36,256	02:01:39,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then sometimes the histories make it out to be we don't change we people like
EDL	02:01:39,328	02:01:40,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Light switching on a light bulb ride
EDL	02:01:41,632	02:01:43,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But in this era were talking about here
EDL	02:01:44,192	02:01:47,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's an interesting little twist to it all you know someone wants told me
EDL	02:01:48,288	02:01:50,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When we were talking about how many listeners
EDL	02:01:50,592	02:01:51,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Someone had
EDL	02:01:51,872	02:01:52,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For their show
EDL	02:01:53,152	02:01:57,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he said it's not always how many people are listening sometimes it's who those people are
EDL	02:01:59,040	02:02:02,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well what if you manage to create a religion
EDL	02:02:03,648	02:02:05,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you convert
EDL	02:02:05,184	02:02:06,464	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One person
EDL	02:02:06,464	02:02:07,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In another country
EDL	02:02:08,256	02:02:11,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that person is the absolute ruler of that country
EDL	02:02:12,352	02:02:14,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many individuals is that worth
EDL	02:02:15,680	02:02:17,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This day in age in our modern
EDL	02:02:17,984	02:02:20,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Democracies all around the world you got a co-op
EDL	02:02:20,288	02:02:24,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A significant chunk of the population for any big movement in any direction
EDL	02:02:24,640	02:02:26,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if you just had to convert one person
EDL	02:02:27,456	02:02:29,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We mentioned Frederick the great earlier
EDL	02:02:30,016	02:02:32,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The ruler of Prussia so often associated with the enlightenment
EDL	02:02:33,600	02:02:40,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is a guy who for all intents and purposes has done what a lot of other things around history of done convert to a new relay
EDL	02:02:40,000	02:02:45,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Religion and then sort of impose that on his country with his religion for lack of a better word
EDL	02:02:45,632	02:02:46,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's reason
EDL	02:02:47,168	02:02:53,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the Age of Enlightenment values I mean is we said earlier this was not a guy who was just reading Voltaire he was corresponding with
EDL	02:02:53,568	02:02:54,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Vim as a penpal
EDL	02:02:54,848	02:02:58,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He was all in his will
EDL	02:02:58,176	02:02:59,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Enlightenment ideas
EDL	02:03:00,224	02:03:03,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he wanted to create a country that represented this right that didn't have
EDL	02:03:03,808	02:03:09,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Torture is Barbara's torture executions going on all the time I mean one of the first things he did when he took the throne and got rid of the penalty of
EDL	02:03:10,464	02:03:11,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Burning sodomites
EDL	02:03:14,304	02:03:15,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those of you
EDL	02:03:15,072	02:03:16,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Frederick the great fans on
EDL	02:03:16,352	02:03:17,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Understand that there might be some interest
EDL	02:03:17,632	02:03:18,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Irony there
EDL	02:03:20,192	02:03:26,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He also would eliminate execution for a ton of crimes mean you no longer cut the thieves hands off of me he's doing these are all
EDL	02:03:26,848	02:03:27,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Things that
EDL	02:03:27,872	02:03:34,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he can do by himself as the ruler you don't have to convince a whole lot of people in the country that this is the way to go you can just do it
EDL	02:03:35,808	02:03:37,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in Reading Richard Evans is
EDL	02:03:37,856	02:03:40,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Book on this fabulous book on the subject
EDL	02:03:40,160	02:03:42,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's fascinating to note that in this era
EDL	02:03:42,976	02:03:46,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you were going to have for example a less
EDL	02:03:46,304	02:03:52,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Medieval like I'm sorry that historians are cringing every time I use that word I mean it as an adjective of horrible torture
EDL	02:03:52,704	02:03:55,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who is barbaric sort of system in a more enlightened age
EDL	02:03:56,032	02:03:59,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Reform was going to have to come from the absolute rulers because
EDL	02:03:59,360	02:04:05,504	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It doesn't sound like the people they ruled over had a lot of trouble with it at all they were enjoying it they were snapping up the broadsheet
EDL	02:04:06,272	02:04:09,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were still going in large numbers and more and more people reviewing it doesn't event
EDL	02:04:11,136	02:04:17,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So if you'd actually told your people listen we're going to get rid of this breaking on the wheel thing they might have been upset about it if you actually said
EDL	02:04:17,536	02:04:19,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Said something like we're going to
EDL	02:04:19,328	02:04:25,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Strangle them first they don't feel any pain but don't worry we're still going to go through with the execution they wouldn't like that either this is how you
EDL	02:04:25,728	02:04:26,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Explain the idea
EDL	02:04:27,264	02:04:28,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Find secret strangling
EDL	02:04:29,568	02:04:31,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why did Frederick the Great
EDL	02:04:31,616	02:04:38,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tell his authorities to kill the execution victim before they went through the horrible execution but
EDL	02:04:38,016	02:04:39,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Make sure that the crowd didn't see it
EDL	02:04:39,808	02:04:41,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because the crowd wanted to see it
EDL	02:04:41,856	02:04:43,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why did Frederick the great care at all
EDL	02:04:46,208	02:04:48,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is a little bit more interesting
EDL	02:04:49,024	02:04:50,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As I said this is
EDL	02:04:50,816	02:04:51,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe
EDL	02:04:52,096	02:04:54,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A person whose illegitimate convert thinking
EDL	02:04:55,168	02:05:00,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And why must this person suffer any more than is necessary and this gets to the whole idea behind the enlightened
EDL	02:05:00,800	02:05:01,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Write this
EDL	02:05:01,568	02:05:03,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This change in viewing things
EDL	02:05:03,872	02:05:05,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In such religious terms
EDL	02:05:05,920	02:05:08,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you start to see a very modern isn't it
EDL	02:05:08,480	02:05:10,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A focus more on life
EDL	02:05:10,528	02:05:12,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here and Now
EDL	02:05:12,064	02:05:18,464	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not as much of an emphasis on the Hereafter for example we said earlier that in the earlier eras to punish
EDL	02:05:18,464	02:05:22,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Chinese executions was often viewed as the pain and suffering you went through
EDL	02:05:23,328	02:05:25,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The death was the byproduct
EDL	02:05:25,632	02:05:29,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People like Frederick the greater from a much more modern era where they look at the
EDL	02:05:29,728	02:05:31,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Punishment in the execution
EDL	02:05:31,776	02:05:36,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As being the deprivation of any more life or you don't get to live anymore your life ends now
EDL	02:05:36,640	02:05:37,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's your punishment
EDL	02:05:37,920	02:05:38,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If that's the case
EDL	02:05:39,200	02:05:42,272	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why don't you cut your head off why do we have to go through all the rigmarole
EDL	02:05:42,272	02:05:45,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Oh yeah because we need to send a message to the
EDL	02:05:45,344	02:05:46,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Krowd
EDL	02:05:46,112	02:05:47,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So strangle that guy
EDL	02:05:47,904	02:05:48,416	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But don't tell him
EDL	02:05:50,720	02:05:51,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fascinate
EDL	02:05:52,768	02:05:54,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But why listen to me and we can have a next
EDL	02:05:54,816	02:05:56,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mike Richard Evans explain it to us
EDL	02:05:57,120	02:05:59,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He quotes the law code that Frederick is working on
EDL	02:06:01,216	02:06:07,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which enunciate this new rational is the way of viewing things like the penal system and says that these executions in the point of them
EDL	02:06:07,616	02:06:08,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Annie's quote
EDL	02:06:08,384	02:06:12,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not to torment the criminal but rather to make a frightful example of him
EDL	02:06:12,736	02:06:14,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In order to arouse repugnance in other
EDL	02:06:15,296	02:06:15,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:06:17,344	02:06:18,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then
EDL	02:06:18,368	02:06:19,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Batman says
EDL	02:06:19,392	02:06:19,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About that
EDL	02:06:20,416	02:06:21,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	02:06:21,184	02:06:26,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nothing could express more clearly the monarchs understanding of the purpose of punishment
EDL	02:06:26,048	02:06:31,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It did not matter in the least the malefactor was actually dead when the sentence was carried out
EDL	02:06:31,168	02:06:34,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where did it deliberate deception was being played on the public
EDL	02:06:35,520	02:06:37,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The rationalistic Frederick II
EDL	02:06:37,312	02:06:39,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The execution was a kind of pedagogical theater
EDL	02:06:40,384	02:06:44,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Drawing its purposes and its methods from the model of broke tragedy
EDL	02:06:44,480	02:06:49,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Its purpose was not to inflict suffering but you deter by making an example of the offender
EDL	02:06:50,368	02:06:54,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it had to awaken feelings of revulsion in the onlooker
EDL	02:06:54,208	02:06:58,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anything that seemed likely to frustrate this purpose was to be avoided
EDL	02:06:58,048	02:07:02,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This included the infliction of pain to such a degree that the sympathy of the crowd by bia vote
EDL	02:07:03,680	02:07:10,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Apart from this obvious political purpose it is also important to note that Frederick did in the end considered a text
EDL	02:07:10,080	02:07:12,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Excessive suffering was if possible to be avoided
EDL	02:07:12,896	02:07:17,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The degree of pain with to be calculated precisely in rational terms
EDL	02:07:18,016	02:07:18,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:07:20,064	02:07:21,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I love
EDL	02:07:21,088	02:07:24,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That this chapter in Evans book is entitled
EDL	02:07:24,160	02:07:25,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A rational degree of pain
EDL	02:07:28,000	02:07:31,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In other words these Enlightenment rulers had no problem at all
EDL	02:07:31,840	02:07:34,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With inflicting a ton of pain on people and suffering
EDL	02:07:35,424	02:07:38,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But only if it could be justified as practically useful
EDL	02:07:40,032	02:07:45,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This may look horrible to us today but it was a huge improvement over the previous conditions
EDL	02:07:47,200	02:07:51,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another huge Improvement and other Enlightenment execution reform
EDL	02:07:52,064	02:07:55,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It doesn't seem like such a huge Improvement to our modern years
EDL	02:07:56,160	02:07:58,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was the increasing
EDL	02:07:58,208	02:07:59,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Use of
EDL	02:07:59,488	02:08:01,280	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decapitation
EDL	02:08:01,280	02:08:02,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As an execution method
EDL	02:08:03,584	02:08:06,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Used to be something in most of these countries
EDL	02:08:06,144	02:08:11,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was reserved for the nobility back in the old days cuz it's considered to be an easy death when you think about the
EDL	02:08:11,264	02:08:11,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The alternatives
EDL	02:08:13,312	02:08:16,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well over this are right in the more Progressive European Continental
EDL	02:08:16,896	02:08:17,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All states
EDL	02:08:18,176	02:08:18,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The
EDL	02:08:18,944	02:08:21,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Practice of beheading the victim becomes
EDL	02:08:21,248	02:08:22,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More
EDL	02:08:22,016	02:08:27,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Common and you see more and more people that wouldn't have qualified for it half a century before
EDL	02:08:27,648	02:08:28,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Being
EDL	02:08:28,928	02:08:30,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Either with a sword or an axe
EDL	02:08:31,488	02:08:33,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cutting too at the neck
EDL	02:08:34,560	02:08:35,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And before you think about this is
EDL	02:08:36,608	02:08:39,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just the most gruesome thing you can think of let's point out
EDL	02:08:39,680	02:08:41,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But when you think about your options what would you choose
EDL	02:08:46,080	02:08:52,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As long as everything goes well execution by the swords pretty quick right take it over
EDL	02:08:52,480	02:08:55,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Breaking on the wheel taking over strangulation death
EDL	02:08:55,552	02:08:58,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At The Gallows I mean what would you rather have right
EDL	02:08:58,624	02:08:59,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of course the problem is
EDL	02:09:00,416	02:09:01,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That little phrase
EDL	02:09:02,208	02:09:03,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executed well
EDL	02:09:05,024	02:09:07,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This requires some skill
EDL	02:09:07,840	02:09:14,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On the part of the execution or a skill which is only sometimes there are those of you out there who actually practice with a C
EDL	02:09:14,240	02:09:15,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sword
EDL	02:09:15,008	02:09:15,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Know that
EDL	02:09:16,288	02:09:17,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actually
EDL	02:09:17,056	02:09:18,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cutting something
EDL	02:09:18,080	02:09:19,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Efficiently is not as easy as it looks
EDL	02:09:20,896	02:09:21,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's some skill
EDL	02:09:23,200	02:09:27,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And hopefully you want to be relatively sober when carrying out the app
EDL	02:09:28,064	02:09:29,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And sometimes neither of those things
EDL	02:09:30,368	02:09:32,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can be present at an execution
EDL	02:09:33,184	02:09:34,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then you have something really nasty
EDL	02:09:36,256	02:09:37,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In front of you
EDL	02:09:37,024	02:09:39,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But here's the thing if you want the crowd
EDL	02:09:39,840	02:09:42,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Once again this is part of the attraction now
EDL	02:09:43,168	02:09:47,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't know how this is going to go even this has its own draw
EDL	02:09:48,032	02:09:53,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because there's a lot of gossip and how these things go I mean you can go look at the French history where they're talking about
EDL	02:09:53,664	02:09:56,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In letters to each other these decapitations
EDL	02:09:56,480	02:09:58,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the ones that don't go well or extra
EDL	02:09:59,296	02:10:00,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Gossipy
EDL	02:10:00,832	02:10:04,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More interesting little bit more juicy pardon
EDL	02:10:04,160	02:10:04,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Adjectives Arrow
EDL	02:10:06,720	02:10:10,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another thing that has become somewhat of a draw to the crowd
EDL	02:10:10,304	02:10:15,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the fact that the way The Condemned person behaves right before they die
EDL	02:10:15,168	02:10:16,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not as predictable as it used to be
EDL	02:10:17,984	02:10:18,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Remember
EDL	02:10:18,752	02:10:21,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There was a metaphysical carrot
EDL	02:10:21,312	02:10:23,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Involved here that helped Ensure
EDL	02:10:23,872	02:10:25,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did The Condemned criminal
EDL	02:10:25,920	02:10:30,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would play their part in this ritual this script is sort of a fair right there
EDL	02:10:30,528	02:10:32,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Penitent Christian for example
EDL	02:10:32,576	02:10:34,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Undergoing the good death
EDL	02:10:35,648	02:10:36,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But what if they weren't
EDL	02:10:37,184	02:10:40,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pennington what if they weren't even acting like they were Christian
EDL	02:10:40,256	02:10:42,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if they were complaining about the authorities
EDL	02:10:42,816	02:10:45,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if they were abusing the religious figures that were there
EDL	02:10:45,888	02:10:47,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is they were
EDL	02:10:47,424	02:10:50,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Clowning around for the crowd to get the crowds
EDL	02:10:51,776	02:10:52,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Approval
EDL	02:10:52,800	02:10:56,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what if they were just going to their death like Clint Eastwood
EDL	02:10:57,408	02:10:59,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Absolutely fearless and cool
EDL	02:11:00,480	02:11:02,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the crowd looked at them
EDL	02:11:02,784	02:11:03,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	02:11:03,552	02:11:04,320	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thought it was
EDL	02:11:06,112	02:11:06,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Awesome
EDL	02:11:08,416	02:11:09,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Badass
EDL	02:11:10,720	02:11:11,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean
EDL	02:11:11,488	02:11:12,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	None of that
EDL	02:11:13,024	02:11:13,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is
EDL	02:11:14,048	02:11:15,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the enlightenment
EDL	02:11:15,584	02:11:16,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rulers who are
EDL	02:11:17,120	02:11:19,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Orchestrating these new specs
EDL	02:11:19,168	02:11:21,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nicole's that's not what they're trying to achieve
EDL	02:11:21,984	02:11:22,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I remember
EDL	02:11:23,264	02:11:27,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These are people that are a lot more concerned than people from the earlier era
EDL	02:11:27,616	02:11:28,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About effectiveness
EDL	02:11:30,176	02:11:31,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can you take away
EDL	02:11:31,712	02:11:33,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This idea that the
EDL	02:11:33,760	02:11:35,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Person is going to go right to heaven
EDL	02:11:35,808	02:11:42,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if this is all a religious ritual and their souls going to be saying everything's going to be wonderful afterwards if they cooperate
EDL	02:11:42,208	02:11:45,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You take away a big reason for them to cooperate
EDL	02:11:46,560	02:11:49,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Add to that the fact that most of these again more progress
EDL	02:11:49,632	02:11:51,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I say that because there was always
EDL	02:11:51,680	02:11:54,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nasty activities continuing back in the backwood
EDL	02:11:55,520	02:11:58,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The places that are leading the edge of the satellite in Madera
EDL	02:11:58,592	02:12:02,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're not torturing people much anymore either which was the other thing you could do
EDL	02:12:02,944	02:12:04,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If The Condemned criminal wasn't
EDL	02:12:04,992	02:12:06,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the following the proper script right
EDL	02:12:07,552	02:12:10,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Apollo the scripture will take you back and you know tripaneer offer
EDL	02:12:10,368	02:12:12,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take another pinch out of your skin with the glowing hot
EDL	02:12:13,184	02:12:16,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tong's but if you're not doing blowing hot tongs anymore
EDL	02:12:17,024	02:12:20,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if the person doesn't think they're going straight to heaven as long as they cooperate
EDL	02:12:20,864	02:12:23,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't cooperate as much the other thing that happens
EDL	02:12:24,192	02:12:25,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the people who are
EDL	02:12:25,984	02:12:29,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Absolutely out of their minds terrified
EDL	02:12:30,080	02:12:31,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm more of a problem to
EDL	02:12:32,384	02:12:36,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's not good if your Enlightenment ruler trying to send a message to the crowd
EDL	02:12:36,480	02:12:39,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because when they see terrified people who is one author said
EDL	02:12:41,344	02:12:45,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Clearly understand the implications of both what they have done
EDL	02:12:45,184	02:12:47,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what they're about to have done to them
EDL	02:12:47,488	02:12:50,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd tends to become more sympathetic
EDL	02:12:50,048	02:12:51,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Annies Enlightenment rulers want
EDL	02:12:52,352	02:12:55,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You do not want the crowd sympathizing
EDL	02:12:55,424	02:12:58,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or going to the side of the condemned
EDL	02:12:58,496	02:12:59,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a complete
EDL	02:13:00,544	02:13:01,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Slap in the face
EDL	02:13:02,080	02:13:05,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In what the whole point of these executions were right but if you have a poor
EDL	02:13:05,664	02:13:07,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Woman convicted of infanticide
EDL	02:13:07,968	02:13:13,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who no longer be sure that she's going to heaven and has no one telling her that that's everything that's going to happen
EDL	02:13:13,856	02:13:15,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A person who make beats
EDL	02:13:15,904	02:13:16,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Falling Up
EDL	02:13:16,672	02:13:19,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Heart as they're executing her emotionally
EDL	02:13:20,256	02:13:21,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean
EDL	02:13:21,024	02:13:24,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd can be vicious and want to see blood
EDL	02:13:25,120	02:13:27,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But part of why they're going for this event
EDL	02:13:28,448	02:13:31,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it it is an amazing human drama
EDL	02:13:31,776	02:13:33,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's not just watching people
EDL	02:13:33,568	02:13:34,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Be killed
EDL	02:13:34,848	02:13:40,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's watching everything as we quoted from the Freeland piece of me in the most intimate moments of someone's life and death
EDL	02:13:41,504	02:13:43,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you having an emotional
EDL	02:13:44,320	02:13:49,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	High and low roller coaster rides throughout this whole thing is Again part of the attraction what will you ever find
EDL	02:13:50,464	02:13:51,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is this deep

EDL	02:15:42,592	02:15:45,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I need that sort of rings true least to my sensibilities
EDL	02:15:46,688	02:15:48,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Makes you wonder what else is in our

EDL	02:15:50,784	02:15:52,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are we all
EDL	02:15:53,088	02:15:59,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a wired the same way do we all have that secret nature or some people different than other some people choose the real violence movie
EDL	02:15:59,744	02:16:02,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Others would never think of going to that they want to go see
EDL	02:16:02,816	02:16:03,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The imitative
EDL	02:16:04,352	02:16:05,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because after all
EDL	02:16:05,888	02:16:06,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It provides
EDL	02:16:06,912	02:16:11,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A buffer that allows you to enjoy violence where if you knew it was real You couldn't possibly have fun
EDL	02:16:12,800	02:16:14,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Knowing that that person was suffering
EDL	02:16:15,360	02:16:17,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did your thing to me that for other human beings
EDL	02:16:18,432	02:16:21,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's exactly what makes it more exciting and worth watching
EDL	02:16:21,760	02:16:26,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then they pretend stop right people really are suffering the Triumph is Burke said of real sympathy
EDL	02:16:28,928	02:16:34,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now both Charles Dickens in Edinburgh are specifically referring to the English
EDL	02:16:34,048	02:16:39,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Xperia it's not really British yet although often times when you say English in this. Includes whales
EDL	02:16:41,216	02:16:42,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is one of the most
EDL	02:16:43,008	02:16:44,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Intensely studied
EDL	02:16:45,312	02:16:49,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Versions of the public execution experience when we have these questions
EDL	02:16:50,432	02:16:53,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you are reading in the English language
EDL	02:16:53,760	02:16:56,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The majority of the sources you're going to have are from England and it's
EDL	02:16:57,856	02:17:04,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Use the whole thing because the English experience is somewhat different than the continent for example we mentioned earlier a penchant for hanging
EDL	02:17:05,280	02:17:10,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we all know right hanging has been around since before recorded history
EDL	02:17:12,192	02:17:16,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe the cheapest the dirtiest way to execute somebody you can think of right
EDL	02:17:16,800	02:17:19,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No muss no fuss as long as you don't care about the suffering of the victim
EDL	02:17:20,640	02:17:23,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's about as easy as you can get it's also sort of banal
EDL	02:17:23,968	02:17:26,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From a spectacle standpoint
EDL	02:17:26,528	02:17:28,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know if you were actually crafting this for the
EDL	02:17:29,088	02:17:32,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the spectacle itself you'd say hanging really come on
EDL	02:17:33,440	02:17:33,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where is the
EDL	02:17:37,024	02:17:38,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The English we should point out
EDL	02:17:38,816	02:17:45,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I pretty much enjoyed most every type of execution at one time or another they take a backseat to no one
EDL	02:17:45,216	02:17:45,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One on the continent
EDL	02:17:46,496	02:17:48,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And during various reins
EDL	02:17:48,288	02:17:52,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They would boil you they bring it in love to burn Heretics but then who doesn't

EDL	02:17:55,968	02:17:59,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the English experience has really color the whole
EDL	02:17:59,808	02:18:03,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Your question of public executions in the way the crowd behaves
EDL	02:18:04,160	02:18:07,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's colored all of us in English speaking countries cuz the predominant
EDL	02:18:07,744	02:18:09,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amount of evidence comes from England
EDL	02:18:10,816	02:18:11,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Colors
EDL	02:18:11,840	02:18:14,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experience in other ways because the English are
EDL	02:18:14,912	02:18:16,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ahead of their time I guess you can say
EDL	02:18:17,728	02:18:21,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In terms of the development of things that influences the public
EDL	02:18:21,568	02:18:22,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Execution so
EDL	02:18:22,592	02:18:24,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you're one of those historians that wants to make
EDL	02:18:25,152	02:18:26,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	State Authority
EDL	02:18:26,432	02:18:29,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Number one reason for these executions being the way they are
EDL	02:18:29,760	02:18:31,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or the English r
EDL	02:18:31,296	02:18:36,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ahead of most of the rest of the world and state formation modern Post westphalian State formation
EDL	02:18:36,672	02:18:37,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right to their head of the game on
EDL	02:18:38,464	02:18:39,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you see the trends
EDL	02:18:39,488	02:18:40,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Showing up earlier there
EDL	02:18:43,072	02:18:49,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you want to talk about the religious ritual side of the executions and how when that was eliminated because the absolute
EDL	02:18:49,472	02:18:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just rulers
EDL	02:18:50,240	02:18:52,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Didn't think it was helping them deter crime
EDL	02:18:52,800	02:18:53,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again
EDL	02:18:53,568	02:18:57,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The English were ahead of the game on that one too if for no other reason than
EDL	02:18:57,408	02:19:03,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And unlike the absolutist regimes of the. On the continent in England it's not an absolutist Virginia
EDL	02:19:04,320	02:19:07,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You have a king but you have Parliament that mean it's all pretty
EDL	02:19:07,136	02:19:07,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Famous Riley
EDL	02:19:07,904	02:19:14,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	English system different than the continent but interesting lead a whole group of historians will say well that's why the
EDL	02:19:14,304	02:19:15,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	English execution situation so different
EDL	02:19:16,864	02:19:17,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How is it different
EDL	02:19:18,144	02:19:18,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well
EDL	02:19:18,912	02:19:25,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Certainly it fits The Stereotype that we often think of all these executions a lot more because the stereotype itself is of the
EDL	02:19:25,312	02:19:27,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	English experience the whole Carnival Atmos
EDL	02:19:27,360	02:19:28,128	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sphere
EDL	02:19:28,128	02:19:29,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the public execution
EDL	02:19:30,432	02:19:31,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Very English
EDL	02:19:32,480	02:19:33,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The
EDL	02:19:33,248	02:19:39,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bravado and the almost a joking nature that some of the condemned will show with the crowd
EDL	02:19:39,904	02:19:41,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're the famous line
EDL	02:19:41,440	02:19:47,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If they would make the executions go through a very long soda procession on the way to the execution spot
EDL	02:19:47,072	02:19:50,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they were bars on the way and one of the execution victims famous Leanna
EDL	02:19:50,656	02:19:57,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Go to the bar and get the drink or has it brought out them says I'll pay you on the way back and you're the crowd loves that right a little bravado on the way to
EDL	02:19:57,056	02:19:57,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Your death
EDL	02:19:59,616	02:20:06,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The English example is also unusual because they go through one of these periods where they sort of Troy
EDL	02:20:06,016	02:20:09,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Try to deter crime the way we talked about at the very beginning of the story
EDL	02:20:09,344	02:20:11,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But in certain areas the
EDL	02:20:11,136	02:20:14,208	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Legal system will get it through their head that the best way to
EDL	02:20:14,208	02:20:18,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Deter crime is to have maximum penalties for even minuscule cry
EDL	02:20:18,816	02:20:19,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lots of
EDL	02:20:19,840	02:20:22,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a whole Chinese dynasty for example these other areas where
EDL	02:20:22,912	02:20:24,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you steal something you're gone
EDL	02:20:24,960	02:20:25,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any little crime you're gone
EDL	02:20:26,752	02:20:29,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In England is known now as the bloody code
EDL	02:20:30,592	02:20:36,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which was a series of legal measures very class oriented by the way very skewed against the lower classes
EDL	02:20:37,248	02:20:38,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It started making
EDL	02:20:39,552	02:20:41,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Almost anything you can think of
EDL	02:20:41,600	02:20:43,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At least on the law books
EDL	02:20:43,392	02:20:44,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Punishable by Death
EDL	02:20:45,952	02:20:48,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You pickpocket somebody
EDL	02:20:48,000	02:20:49,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	4 more than 12
EDL	02:20:49,536	02:20:53,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pence twelve pence nothing right 12 Pence of value boom
EDL	02:20:53,376	02:20:54,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Eligible for the death penalty
EDL	02:20:56,192	02:20:59,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You wore disguise in the forest boom eligible for the death penalty
EDL	02:21:00,032	02:21:01,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many got to beat like crazy
EDL	02:21:03,872	02:21:06,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean if you go and look at the law codes
EDL	02:21:06,944	02:21:10,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In England in the 1650s there
EDL	02:21:10,016	02:21:11,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Probably half a hundred
EDL	02:21:12,320	02:21:14,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Offenses that can get you the death penalty
EDL	02:21:14,368	02:21:19,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How do you write it in this is an era not that far from the Middle Ages and been on 50 things or what and I'll get you the death penalty
EDL	02:21:21,280	02:21:23,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amir Century later
EDL	02:21:23,584	02:21:25,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's like 200
EDL	02:21:26,912	02:21:28,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Offenses will get you the death
EDL	02:21:28,448	02:21:31,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And as I said many of them very small to very famous.
EDL	02:21:32,032	02:21:33,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In English History
EDL	02:21:33,568	02:21:35,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now we should point out
EDL	02:21:35,616	02:21:37,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That there's lots of Pardons and
EDL	02:21:39,968	02:21:46,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Acts of mercy and all these things that the ruler in the church and whatnot can provide so that a lot of these people sentenced to death don't
EDL	02:21:46,368	02:21:47,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm actually go to The Gallows
EDL	02:21:48,416	02:21:49,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About a 35000
EDL	02:21:50,464	02:21:51,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Death sentences
EDL	02:21:53,024	02:21:54,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	BAC control says
EDL	02:21:54,816	02:21:56,864	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Only 7000 executions happened
EDL	02:21:57,376	02:21:59,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the executions were often
EDL	02:21:59,936	02:22:04,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Have people very much like the poor people who came to watch the execution
EDL	02:22:05,056	02:22:07,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the crimes they were being killed for
EDL	02:22:08,384	02:22:11,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're things that many in the crowd didn't consider all that bad
EDL	02:22:12,224	02:22:14,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You take a woman who starved her child
EDL	02:22:15,552	02:22:18,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And bring her up on the Gallows in England as
EDL	02:22:18,112	02:22:19,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did happen
EDL	02:22:19,392	02:22:23,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the women in the crowd will yell and scream horrible things at the red
EDL	02:22:25,024	02:22:27,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did you bring a little petty pickpocket
EDL	02:22:27,584	02:22:29,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or somebody who is Maybe
EDL	02:22:29,120	02:22:32,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Poaching the king's deer in the forest or something like that up there
EDL	02:22:32,960	02:22:36,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then they make a jaunty Brave speech and maybe talk to her
EDL	02:22:36,032	02:22:39,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pretty girl in the audience right before their executed
EDL	02:22:39,104	02:22:41,664	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the crowd could find themselves very much
EDL	02:22:41,664	02:22:42,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On the side of the condemned
EDL	02:22:45,248	02:22:45,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wow
EDL	02:22:46,272	02:22:50,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's hard to imagine some of the more absolutist machines in Europe putting up with say
EDL	02:22:50,880	02:22:52,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anti-government
EDL	02:22:53,440	02:22:56,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Screens on The Gallows from there condemned
EDL	02:22:56,256	02:23:01,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Criminals in England gatrell says they have a long-standing custom of allowing
EDL	02:23:01,120	02:23:02,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Condemned to say some stuff
EDL	02:23:02,912	02:23:05,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Before they die even if it gets the dishes
EDL	02:23:07,008	02:23:10,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Letter said earlier the English usually like to hang
EDL	02:23:10,592	02:23:11,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're condemned criminals
EDL	02:23:12,384	02:23:16,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And while this might seem like a more merciful sentence than some of the things we've been talking about
EDL	02:23:16,992	02:23:19,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going on in Germany in the Netherlands and France and places like that

EDL	02:23:33,120	02:23:33,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because they're
EDL	02:23:34,144	02:23:37,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Scientifically designed in most cases
EDL	02:23:37,472	02:23:38,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To break the neck
EDL	02:23:39,008	02:23:40,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of the execution victim
EDL	02:23:40,800	02:23:42,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which is theoretically quick
EDL	02:23:43,104	02:23:44,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And theoretically painless
EDL	02:23:46,176	02:23:48,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Before the modern era though
EDL	02:23:48,224	02:23:53,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If somebody's neck broke that was a side byproduct that wasn't the goal
EDL	02:23:53,088	02:23:54,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were often using ropes that

EDL	02:24:04,096	02:24:05,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And gatrell reminds us
EDL	02:24:06,144	02:24:10,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That they are much nastier than the thin veneer of respectability
EDL	02:24:10,752	02:24:15,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is often used with euphemisms another ways to disguise the horribleness of it
EDL	02:24:15,872	02:24:18,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He says when you when you get right back down to Basics you were talking about
EDL	02:24:19,456	02:24:20,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He says the choking
EDL	02:24:20,992	02:24:23,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the pissing and the screaming
EDL	02:24:23,296	02:24:25,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that is often hidden in the sources
EDL	02:24:26,112	02:24:28,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people who went and watched it live
EDL	02:24:29,184	02:24:31,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You damn well what they were saying and getting as
EDL	02:24:31,744	02:24:35,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He also points out and just blew my mind when I read it I'm going to quote it verbatim
EDL	02:24:36,352	02:24:37,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He said quote
EDL	02:24:37,888	02:24:44,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Late eighteenth and early nineteenth century English people were very familiar with the grimy business of hanging
EDL	02:24:44,544	02:24:46,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is so large a social fact
EDL	02:24:46,848	02:24:49,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Separating that era from our own
EDL	02:24:49,408	02:24:53,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That although it is not the most obvious way of defining modern times
EDL	02:24:53,248	02:24:54,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It must be one of them
EDL	02:24:55,040	02:24:55,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:24:56,320	02:24:57,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In other words
EDL	02:24:57,600	02:25:00,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Defining modern times if you want to look at it that way
EDL	02:25:01,440	02:25:03,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's the age where we are not
EDL	02:25:03,488	02:25:04,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Familiar
EDL	02:25:04,512	02:25:06,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With public executions
EDL	02:25:07,840	02:25:09,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where the idea
EDL	02:25:09,632	02:25:12,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you might see a human body hanging
EDL	02:25:13,216	02:25:15,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Somewhere near you
EDL	02:25:15,008	02:25:18,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not think of that as something out of the ordinary
EDL	02:25:18,848	02:25:22,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is what separates modern times from shall we say
EDL	02:25:22,688	02:25:23,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Early modern
EDL	02:25:23,712	02:25:24,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	X
EDL	02:25:25,760	02:25:27,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I will say
EDL	02:25:27,040	02:25:30,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the English rationale the way that the English defend
EDL	02:25:31,136	02:25:33,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Their massive amount of executions compared to
EDL	02:25:33,952	02:25:39,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Places like Prussia and the Netherlands that are starting to really really really decline their execution
EDL	02:25:39,584	02:25:41,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the English do it in sort of
EDL	02:25:41,376	02:25:43,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We Americans would say with a liberty argument
EDL	02:25:44,448	02:25:49,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They claim that the only way to deter crime in their system
EDL	02:25:49,312	02:25:52,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is by making sure that if they catch you
EDL	02:25:52,384	02:25:56,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You will receive maximum punishment because the chances of catching you are tiny
EDL	02:25:57,760	02:26:00,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because the English do not want to live in a police state

EDL	02:26:08,256	02:26:11,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're not having that surveillance to deter crime in advance
EDL	02:26:12,608	02:26:15,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is allowing that they're going to be that crime
EDL	02:26:15,424	02:26:17,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if the authorities catch you
EDL	02:26:17,472	02:26:19,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You will receive a

EDL	02:26:22,336	02:26:23,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it supposed to have
EDL	02:26:23,872	02:26:27,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just like the executions on the European continent a deterrent effect
EDL	02:26:27,968	02:26:30,528	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a famous Axiom from the time
EDL	02:26:30,528	02:26:31,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Said
EDL	02:26:31,296	02:26:35,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In Britain that men are not hanged for stealing horses
EDL	02:26:35,136	02:26:37,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that horses may not be stolen

EDL	02:27:01,760	02:27:03,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hanging isn't
EDL	02:27:03,296	02:27:05,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Something that was chosen because
EDL	02:27:05,600	02:27:08,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's particularly easy necessarily even though it is
EDL	02:27:09,440	02:27:15,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But because it was particularly appalling in terms of sending a message he says no one who lived in
EDL	02:27:15,840	02:27:17,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That era was under the illusion
EDL	02:27:17,632	02:27:20,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hanging was anything other than a horrible way to die
EDL	02:27:22,240	02:27:25,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's also a very dishonorable way to die
EDL	02:27:26,336	02:27:27,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this is not the sort of things
EDL	02:27:27,872	02:27:33,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we would pay much attention to when we look back we're focused on the pain in the suffering of the actual execution are
EDL	02:27:35,040	02:27:37,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if you could bring back someone from that era
EDL	02:27:37,600	02:27:40,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And watch one of these executions on television
EDL	02:27:40,672	02:27:41,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Together
EDL	02:27:41,952	02:27:45,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They would notice things that maybe we wouldn't
EDL	02:27:45,536	02:27:48,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they would be able to determine whether or not the
EDL	02:27:48,864	02:27:50,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The court that sentence this
EDL	02:27:50,656	02:27:52,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Malefactor had considered
EDL	02:27:52,704	02:27:59,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know that they should be extra harsh or extra lenient I mean for example where they dragged into the scaffold to The Gallows or
EDL	02:27:59,104	02:28:00,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Ravenstone
EDL	02:28:01,152	02:28:02,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a freshly skinned

EDL	02:28:04,480	02:28:06,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were it's more dishonorable
EDL	02:28:06,528	02:28:08,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is a whole bunch of
EDL	02:28:08,576	02:28:12,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Things that we would call symbolic today that don't matter much to off that would have been
EDL	02:28:13,184	02:28:16,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To some of these people more important than the fact that they were dying
EDL	02:28:18,304	02:28:20,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I was fascinated to read some of these things where
EDL	02:28:20,608	02:28:22,656	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Yeah they're really trying to
EDL	02:28:22,656	02:28:27,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Alter their sentence these people who are being sentenced to who committed these crimes one way or the other
EDL	02:28:27,776	02:28:33,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But you're not trying to get out of dying either they're trying to die in a more honorable way
EDL	02:28:33,408	02:28:38,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where they're trying to reduce the number of dishonorable things that have to happen to them on the way to their death
EDL	02:28:40,832	02:28:41,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Once again
EDL	02:28:42,368	02:28:46,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hard for us to understand today cuz their status in their society means nothing to us of course
EDL	02:28:49,536	02:28:55,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A shame and dishonor plays its role in the state's effort to use these Affairs to deter other pee
EDL	02:28:55,936	02:28:59,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People from committing these crimes right in that sense the people in England
EDL	02:29:00,032	02:29:02,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We'd better be called British somewhere in the middle of the story
EDL	02:29:03,360	02:29:04,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are not in any way different
EDL	02:29:05,152	02:29:11,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then their neighbors on the continent during this time. And in fact not very different from you know people conducting next week
EDL	02:29:11,552	02:29:15,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fusions all throughout history I mean isn't that the overwhelming reason you do them

EDL	02:29:17,184	02:29:20,768	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Only but it's right stop people from committing those kind of crimes
EDL	02:29:22,560	02:29:23,840	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But of course as we said
EDL	02:29:24,352	02:29:28,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You everyone in Europe during this time. In the West End during this era where
EDL	02:29:28,192	02:29:34,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The ritual side of things the religious side of things soda fading more into the background leaving people that are more concerned with effective
EDL	02:29:34,592	02:29:36,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Deterrence is what you're after
EDL	02:29:36,896	02:29:40,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amor Amor the public intellectuals in these countries start asking
EDL	02:29:40,480	02:29:42,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Legitimate questions about
EDL	02:29:42,528	02:29:43,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well is that what we're getting
EDL	02:29:45,088	02:29:49,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are we getting determined effects for these horrible spectacular executions in there was a lively debate
EDL	02:29:51,488	02:29:53,024	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You would think that exhibit a
EDL	02:29:53,792	02:30:00,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For anyone making the argument these executions were tutoring people would be the fact that the audience is enjoying themselves
EDL	02:30:00,192	02:30:00,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right there not
EDL	02:30:00,960	02:30:04,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Terrified and awed by the Majesty of the Law & Justice
EDL	02:30:05,312	02:30:11,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're more likely to be worried that they didn't pack enough snacks in case the pregame festivities for this little event run long
EDL	02:30:12,480	02:30:18,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She got this disconnect between what you're after what you're getting and then you have this third big elephant in the living room and we've already
EDL	02:30:18,880	02:30:20,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Alluded to this earlier it's
EDL	02:30:21,184	02:30:23,744	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes just called the change in Sensibility
EDL	02:30:25,536	02:30:29,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As with everything in this happens at different times in different places and there's a trickle-down
EDL	02:30:29,632	02:30:34,496	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will start sometimes
EDL	02:30:35,520	02:30:39,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other times it will become some of the litterick Latin to be a trickle-down overtime
EDL	02:30:39,360	02:30:42,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of these changes and sensibilities will never reach
EDL	02:30:42,432	02:30:43,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The lowest class
EDL	02:30:43,456	02:30:43,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people
EDL	02:30:45,248	02:30:50,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm trying to explain the so-called change and sensibilities is as difficult as trying to explain something like
EDL	02:30:50,624	02:30:51,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why did the 1960s happen
EDL	02:30:52,416	02:30:53,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right I mean it's going to be
EDL	02:30:53,696	02:30:54,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is zeitgeist
EDL	02:30:54,976	02:30:57,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As sometimes reality can be referred to
EDL	02:30:57,536	02:31:03,680	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And playing into the Zeitgeist going to be all different kinds of friends and forces and whatnot I mean to just give you one little teeny strand
EDL	02:31:04,192	02:31:05,216	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As an example of how
EDL	02:31:05,728	02:31:10,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many things are playing in with the growth of the popularity of novels
EDL	02:31:10,080	02:31:11,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In this period from about 1500
EDL	02:31:13,408	02:31:15,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People reading more these things
EDL	02:31:15,456	02:31:19,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With characters and storylines designed to get them to
EDL	02:31:19,552	02:31:20,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Feel
EDL	02:31:20,576	02:31:22,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And be sensitive and care
EDL	02:31:22,880	02:31:25,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And have empathy for the people in the story right
EDL	02:31:27,488	02:31:33,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I read one historian who suggested that there's a cause and effects paying back and forth between the culture in these novels but then Essentia
EDL	02:31:33,888	02:31:35,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actually they were training
EDL	02:31:35,936	02:31:36,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People
EDL	02:31:37,472	02:31:43,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To have empathy now again who's reading novels in these societies right the literate people to begin with so
EDL	02:31:43,104	02:31:46,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's not a broad-based change in sensibilities
EDL	02:31:46,688	02:31:48,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is the change in sensibilities amongst
EDL	02:31:49,248	02:31:51,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shall we call the class of people
EDL	02:31:51,552	02:31:53,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The most folk want to emulate
EDL	02:31:53,600	02:31:55,136	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Many of these countries
EDL	02:31:55,648	02:31:57,696	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You now have middle-class people
EDL	02:31:57,696	02:32:01,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a certain amount of Mobility that didn't exist in
EDL	02:32:01,536	02:32:03,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the classes before
EDL	02:32:03,328	02:32:08,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one of the ways you Associated yourself with the better classes to emulate their attitudes
EDL	02:32:09,472	02:32:11,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if they were starting to think
EDL	02:32:11,008	02:32:13,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The public executions were Goshen
EDL	02:32:13,312	02:32:15,616	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if there was something inhuman about them
EDL	02:32:15,616	02:32:16,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And barbaric
EDL	02:32:16,896	02:32:19,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well then those are the kinds of attitudes that began to
EDL	02:32:20,224	02:32:23,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You infuse your class overtime right as I said the trickle-down effect
EDL	02:32:24,064	02:32:24,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now here's the thing
EDL	02:32:25,856	02:32:29,184	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why would these executions be considered
EDL	02:32:29,184	02:32:35,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anything other than great entertainment wasn't at these hobbyist from the upper classes that were first going and enjoying them spectacles to be
EDL	02:32:35,584	02:32:36,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Begin with
EDL	02:32:38,144	02:32:39,168	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well here's the way
EDL	02:32:39,168	02:32:40,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Astoria Paul Friedland explains it
EDL	02:32:41,472	02:32:47,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You brought brushing when you talk about the intellectuals of the Enlightenment because there were different opinions from the intellectual
EDL	02:32:47,872	02:32:48,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rules of the Enlightenment
EDL	02:32:48,896	02:32:50,944	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But one of them was that man
EDL	02:32:50,944	02:32:52,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For lack of a better word
EDL	02:32:52,480	02:32:53,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is basically good
EDL	02:32:54,272	02:32:57,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it would basically sympathetic and basically empathetic
EDL	02:32:57,344	02:33:02,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you're in a situation where a lot of people aren't that way than they've got screws loose right there the outline
EDL	02:33:02,976	02:33:08,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's not normal human behavior that's abnormal human behavior the problem isn't that when these people are writing this
EDL	02:33:09,120	02:33:12,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's the way their societies are behaving Paul Friedman rights quote
EDL	02:33:12,960	02:33:15,008	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The growing public fascination with
EDL	02:33:15,008	02:33:17,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And curiosity about executions
EDL	02:33:17,312	02:33:20,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're on a collision course with contemporary piano Theory
EDL	02:33:20,640	02:33:24,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which regarded exemplary deterrence is the very reason for punishment
EDL	02:33:24,992	02:33:25,760	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I change the French
EDL	02:33:27,040	02:33:27,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He continues
EDL	02:33:27,808	02:33:33,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote while the new penal voyeurism was still restricted to the relatively privileged members of society
EDL	02:33:34,464	02:33:39,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You seem to take notice of the discrepancy between the intent of the punishment
EDL	02:33:39,072	02:33:41,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the way in which it was being perceived by The Spectator
EDL	02:33:42,656	02:33:45,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is this new way of watching made its way down the social ladder
EDL	02:33:45,984	02:33:48,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Alarm Bells were sounded
EDL	02:33:48,800	02:33:49,312	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:33:50,336	02:33:51,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He then points out the
EDL	02:33:51,872	02:33:55,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The praying and weeping crowds from the religious ritual era
EDL	02:33:55,712	02:34:00,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It probably never really been terrified by executions the way the state wanted
EDL	02:34:00,576	02:34:01,344	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This was
EDL	02:34:01,856	02:34:02,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Kind of getting
EDL	02:34:02,880	02:34:04,928	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ctrl e then points out
EDL	02:34:04,928	02:34:10,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there's a third element involved this elephant in the living room this Revolution and Sensibility
EDL	02:34:10,048	02:34:10,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She said quote
EDL	02:34:12,096	02:34:15,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the same time another cultural crisis was looming on the horizon
EDL	02:34:15,936	02:34:18,752	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
EDL	02:34:18,752	02:34:23,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A revolution and sensibilities would sweep over both sides of the channel
EDL	02:34:23,104	02:34:27,712	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human beings would be reimagined as naturally benevolent and compassionate
EDL	02:34:28,224	02:34:30,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The eager anticipation of amateurs
EDL	02:34:30,784	02:34:34,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To watch executions as if they were a dramatic performance
EDL	02:34:34,112	02:34:35,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For perhaps even worse
EDL	02:34:35,648	02:34:37,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The callous indifference of those in the windows
EDL	02:34:37,952	02:34:40,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who watched and felt nothing
EDL	02:34:40,000	02:34:43,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would be difficult to square with the new view of human nature
EDL	02:34:43,584	02:34:45,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As instinctively compassionate
EDL	02:34:46,400	02:34:46,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:34:48,448	02:34:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He then goes on to say
EDL	02:34:50,240	02:34:54,080	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did you have this growing conflict between Spectators desperate
EDL	02:34:54,080	02:34:56,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To watch people die on the scaffold
EDL	02:34:56,384	02:35:02,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Penal theory that is built around the idea that people won't be able to watch that kind of thing without being terrified
EDL	02:35:02,016	02:35:07,904	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he said the culture of sensibility that insist that people can't watch this stuff without being horrified
EDL	02:35:08,672	02:35:10,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because if they are horrified
EDL	02:35:10,720	02:35:12,000	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The kind of inhuman
EDL	02:35:14,560	02:35:17,120	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The reactions of the crowds
EDL	02:35:17,120	02:35:18,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of these cases
EDL	02:35:19,424	02:35:20,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Vexing Boethiah
EDL	02:35:20,960	02:35:21,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Authorities
EDL	02:35:22,496	02:35:24,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a lot of the intellectual class
EDL	02:35:24,288	02:35:26,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It would not reacting the way that they were supposed to
EDL	02:35:28,128	02:35:31,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not as the target audience for these spectacles of Justice
EDL	02:35:31,968	02:35:35,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not as human beings watching cruelty to other human being
EDL	02:35:36,576	02:35:38,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I read in one of the things I was researching to this program
EDL	02:35:39,904	02:35:45,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An account where they were talking about watching somebody burning alive in front of you today
EDL	02:35:46,304	02:35:48,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they said it's impossible for most people
EDL	02:35:49,376	02:35:53,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To watch something like that up close without feeling almost physical pain themselves
EDL	02:35:55,520	02:35:57,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then it's not a mental respond
EDL	02:35:57,056	02:36:01,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's not like you actually process it all its instantaneous
EDL	02:36:01,152	02:36:05,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's right you almost feel the physical pain for the person who suffering in front of you
EDL	02:36:07,040	02:36:10,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just like a drama saying about people not vomiting at the horrible executions
EDL	02:36:10,624	02:36:14,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A people like Damian right there not vomiting we would today in large numbers why
EDL	02:36:14,976	02:36:18,560	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's not a process thing it's something that's so ingrained in US
EDL	02:36:19,072	02:36:21,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did it justice become physical somehow the
EDL	02:36:21,888	02:36:27,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does the cultural Elements by Cantrell said that you cry based on what your culture tells you you should be crying at
EDL	02:36:27,776	02:36:30,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the fact that you couldn't watch somebody burning alive today
EDL	02:36:30,848	02:36:36,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Without feeling physical pain and somebody before this Revolution and sensibilities happened
EDL	02:36:36,224	02:36:36,992	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Could
EDL	02:36:37,504	02:36:39,296	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is an interesting difference in US isn't it
EDL	02:36:41,600	02:36:42,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I still can't
EDL	02:36:42,624	02:36:44,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Make myself believe
EDL	02:36:44,160	02:36:46,720	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That we're not empathetic creatures may just be
EDL	02:36:47,232	02:36:53,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Discriminatory and pathetic creatures I mean if you're watching someone broken on the wheel you may or may not care about
EDL	02:36:53,632	02:36:54,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bottom if it's your child
EDL	02:36:55,424	02:36:59,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think you're going to feel every blow as if it's happening to you personally
EDL	02:37:00,032	02:37:02,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe you feel that way if it was your first cousin
EDL	02:37:02,848	02:37:06,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe you feel that way if it was your second cousin twice removed your neighbor from down the street
EDL	02:37:06,944	02:37:08,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But maybe it's some point
EDL	02:37:08,736	02:37:13,088	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You no longer feel quite the same you're not quite feeling the blows like it's your own child
EDL	02:37:13,856	02:37:16,672	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As we said about the Roman Arena how did these Romans watch these people
EDL	02:37:17,440	02:37:22,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a massacred in front of them in horribly painful ways and enjoyed they didn't see them as human Maybe
EDL	02:37:24,608	02:37:28,448	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I just laid it's a Christian to visit to that not human not the same not my kid
EDL	02:37:31,008	02:37:32,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I said earlier that I want to do this from
EDL	02:37:32,800	02:37:33,568	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A couple of different hang
EDL	02:37:34,848	02:37:40,736	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Simply taking that approach seems to be a perfect example of something we do in the post
EDL	02:37:41,248	02:37:45,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Revolution and sensibilities age that maybe would not have been such an obvious way to do it before
EDL	02:37:46,368	02:37:48,160	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's an effort to try to
EDL	02:37:48,160	02:37:51,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Walk a mile in the moccasins of the people in this story write
EDL	02:37:52,000	02:37:55,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An effort to gain a little empathy for what they were going through a little sympathy
EDL	02:37:56,608	02:37:58,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's kind of strange because of course
EDL	02:37:58,912	02:38:03,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there are so many different things how would you be able to gain any real empathy
EDL	02:38:03,776	02:38:06,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And some of these questions have no answers but
EDL	02:38:06,336	02:38:10,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's something human in this that wants to ask them anyway I mean take for example
EDL	02:38:10,432	02:38:12,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trying to have a little empathy
EDL	02:38:12,480	02:38:14,784	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With someone who's going to get their head cut off
EDL	02:38:15,808	02:38:16,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I asked you
EDL	02:38:17,088	02:38:19,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How would anybody know what that felt
EDL	02:38:20,672	02:38:23,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Doesn't keep us from wondering though does it
EDL	02:38:24,256	02:38:27,584	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I imagine you'd Wonder a hell of a lot more in a lot more intensely
EDL	02:38:28,096	02:38:29,888	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If this be heading that we're
EDL	02:38:29,888	02:38:31,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Theorizing about what about to happen
EDL	02:38:32,448	02:38:32,960	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To you
EDL	02:38:35,264	02:38:36,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If it's me
EDL	02:38:36,800	02:38:38,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I have to break this entire
EDL	02:38:38,848	02:38:40,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experience down into two halves
EDL	02:38:41,664	02:38:42,688	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The obvious have

EDL	02:40:13,824	02:40:14,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Depends on what

EDL	02:40:43,776	02:40:46,848	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pretty pretty common charge in this era
EDL	02:40:47,360	02:40:48,384	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm sure today we would
EDL	02:40:49,408	02:40:50,176	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Chalk a bunch of that up

EDL	02:41:09,376	02:41:10,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most to be decapitated
EDL	02:41:11,936	02:41:13,472	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She was sat in the chair
EDL	02:41:14,496	02:41:16,800	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She was made ready by The Executioner's
EDL	02:41:17,312	02:41:18,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Assistance
EDL	02:41:18,848	02:41:19,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Make sure that the neck is
EDL	02:41:19,872	02:41:21,408	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Get exposed in the right area
EDL	02:41:21,408	02:41:27,808	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in this particular kind of execution By The Sword you swing it like a baseball bat more than you swing it like a chopping

EDL	02:41:29,600	02:41:30,880	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you want a nice level swing
EDL	02:41:31,904	02:41:33,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you didn't always get

EDL	02:41:34,976	02:41:38,048	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	According to 1 Chronicle reprinted by Harrington
EDL	02:41:38,816	02:41:39,328	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	02:41:39,840	02:41:45,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This poor child was very ill and weak so that she had to be carried and brought to the Gallows or Ravenstone
EDL	02:41:46,240	02:41:50,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much is sat down on the chair Meister Valentin he's the Executioner
EDL	02:41:50,592	02:41:51,360	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the way
EDL	02:41:51,360	02:41:52,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Circled around her
EDL	02:41:52,640	02:41:54,432	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like a calf around a Manger
EDL	02:41:54,944	02:41:56,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And with the sword
EDL	02:41:56,224	02:42:00,832	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Struck a span of wood in a piece of skin as big as a coin from her head
EDL	02:42:00,832	02:42:02,624	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Knocking her under the chair
EDL	02:42:02,624	02:42:08,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And since he hadn't heard her body and since she fell so bravely the crowd asked that she be released
EDL	02:42:09,792	02:42:12,352	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No such luck though Harrington says
EDL	02:42:13,376	02:42:17,728	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In from underneath the chair he says the victim now wounded
EDL	02:42:17,728	02:42:20,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cried out this 19 year old girl
EDL	02:42:20,544	02:42:24,640	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote Oh help me for God's sake what she said often and repeated
EDL	02:42:24,640	02:42:29,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then The Executioner's assistant grabbed her and set her back on the chair
EDL	02:42:29,248	02:42:32,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whereupon the Executioner delivered a second blow
EDL	02:42:32,064	02:42:35,392	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this time hacked in the neck behind her head
EDL	02:42:35,392	02:42:37,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At what she however fell from the chair
EDL	02:42:37,952	02:42:41,792	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Still alive again shouting God have mercy
EDL	02:42:42,304	02:42:45,376	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	After this the hangman hacked and cut her head on the ground
EDL	02:42:46,400	02:42:46,912	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	02:42:49,216	02:42:50,240	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's another account
EDL	02:42:50,752	02:42:52,288	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In another book of a hangman in
EDL	02:42:53,312	02:42:55,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Greeting hangman in northern France
EDL	02:42:55,616	02:42:59,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The required more than 20 blows of the sword
EDL	02:42:59,200	02:43:00,224	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To cut off the head
EDL	02:43:00,736	02:43:01,248	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of his bick
EDL	02:43:02,784	02:43:03,552	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm a
EDL	02:43:03,552	02:43:04,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Four Swordsmen
EDL	02:43:04,576	02:43:05,856	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That might even be a
EDL	02:43:06,624	02:43:07,648	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Generous description
EDL	02:43:08,416	02:43:09,952	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But I can't imagine taking
EDL	02:43:09,952	02:43:11,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	20 Strokes of the sword
EDL	02:43:13,280	02:43:14,816	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wrapped in human neck
EDL	02:43:17,120	02:43:21,984	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It should be pointed out that legally most of the time these executions were allowed three strikes it's a little late
EDL	02:43:21,984	02:43:23,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All right three strikes and you're out
EDL	02:43:23,520	02:43:26,592	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And help meant the crowd to pick up stones and throw them at you
EDL	02:43:26,592	02:43:29,920	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not legally of course the king never said what you can kill my executioner
EDL	02:43:29,920	02:43:31,200	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He doesn't do in three Strokes
EDL	02:43:31,712	02:43:34,016	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know there's an Unwritten rules to baseball and
EDL	02:43:34,528	02:43:36,576	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decapitations in this era to
EDL	02:43:38,368	02:43:43,488	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And even if you sat there and wondered about how quickly a decapitation went if it went well
EDL	02:43:44,000	02:43:45,536	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe you would worry that it might not
EDL	02:43:46,560	02:43:48,608	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Unless if it did go well
EDL	02:43:48,608	02:43:50,144	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wouldn't you choose
EDL	02:43:50,144	02:43:52,192	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This method if it were
EDL	02:43:52,192	02:43:55,520	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You up to you although there are different ones right I mean as we said earlier
EDL	02:43:55,520	02:43:57,056	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think you know if you're going to go through
EDL	02:43:57,056	02:43:59,104	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An execution during this era
EDL	02:43:59,616	02:44:04,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what is your choice of method of dying because there's no Lethal Injections
EDL	02:44:05,248	02:44:07,040	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't need a whole lot of accounts of
EDL	02:44:07,040	02:44:10,368	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hemlock drinking since Socrates back in ancient Athens
EDL	02:44:11,136	02:44:13,440	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And believe it or not we modern people
EDL	02:44:13,440	02:44:14,976	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Obviously think of shooting is a
EDL	02:44:15,488	02:44:16,256	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Potential
EDL	02:44:16,256	02:44:18,304	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Method to get out of this
EDL	02:44:18,304	02:44:20,096	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Relatively painlessly
EDL	02:44:20,608	02:44:23,424	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And yet that seems to be something that was confined to
EDL	02:44:23,424	02:44:24,704	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How soldierwood
EDL	02:44:24,704	02:44:28,032	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To be treated rather than someone in civilian life you don't hear a lot of shootings
EDL	02:44:28,032	02:44:30,336	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As a civilian form of execution
EDL	02:44:30,336	02:44:31,872	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When is Sarah starts though
EDL	02:44:32,384	02:44:33,152	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's coming
EDL	02:44:33,152	02:44:36,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ricky cuz it starts off with sort of the biblical approach
EDL	02:44:37,248	02:44:41,600	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Two execution methods write us with an eye for an eye Mosaic law kind of thing
EDL	02:44:42,112	02:44:48,512	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And so for example of a murderer in the latter part of the Middle Ages maybe into the Renaissance
EDL	02:44:48,512	02:44:51,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With a hammer he might be executed
EDL	02:44:51,584	02:44:54,400	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't want to scaffold by an executioner holding a hammer
EDL	02:44:56,192	02:44:59,264	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I've heard all different kinds of accounts what what the ritual was in there
EDL	02:44:59,264	02:45:04,896	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Religious elements to it but it even goes back to pre-christian Superstition canceling out the evil of the deed
EDL	02:45:04,896	02:45:07,968	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You hit your murder victim with a hammer that we hit you with
EDL	02:45:07,968	02:45:08,480	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With one
EDL	02:45:08,992	02:45:12,064	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And even when the era of actually dispatching people that way
EDL	02:45:12,576	02:45:14,112	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know starting to go away
EDL	02:45:14,112	02:45:19,232	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In some places usually once again outside the big cities when you get to the superstitions Countryside
EDL	02:45:19,232	02:45:23,072	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They would still include the eye for an eye thing even if it was only symbolic
EDL	02:45:23,584	02:45:25,632	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So we might strangle the person
EDL	02:45:26,144	02:45:27,936	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who was the hammer murderer
EDL	02:45:28,448	02:45:31,776	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But then after they were dead hit him with a hammer few times as what you know
EDL	02:45:31,776	02:45:32,544	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Symbolic Act
EDL	02:45:34,080	02:45:39,456	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the ways in which people were killed in this early. Though often mirrored what they did if you were an arsonist a burn you

EDL	02:51:49,375	02:51:51,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's remember all these numbers come from
EDL	02:51:52,191	02:51:56,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Times and places where the populations were a lot smaller than they are now
EDL	02:51:57,055	02:52:00,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of these towns that had 20000 people show up for
EDL	02:52:00,383	02:52:04,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executions may not have had 20000 people living in the nearby vicinity
EDL	02:52:05,503	02:52:08,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this was an ERA when it was a lot harder to get from place
EDL	02:52:08,063	02:52:11,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Play some 20000 people showing up at a village execution is a lot of people

EDL	02:52:45,695	02:52:51,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another reason this plays into walking a mile in the moccasins of The Condemned here
EDL	02:52:52,351	02:52:55,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is because they literally sometimes had to do that

EDL	02:53:14,111	02:53:17,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or supported you as the case may be along the way
EDL	02:53:18,207	02:53:18,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In fact
EDL	02:53:19,487	02:53:25,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's probably not too much of a conjecture to wonder if The Condemned person had ever seen a crowd as large as the

EDL	02:53:39,967	02:53:42,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes they were
EDL	02:53:42,015	02:53:46,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All over you in a terrible way making your experience that much worse
EDL	02:53:46,367	02:53:50,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes they were sort of in your Camp praying for you hoping for you
EDL	02:53:50,463	02:53:56,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or maybe just a little bit sympathetic it in the later. To your roguish courage that you're showing on the scaffold or whatever it might be
EDL	02:53:58,399	02:54:01,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's interesting to note that when they will finally do away with the
EDL	02:54:01,727	02:54:06,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a public execution hear some of the people who were critical of that said that your
EDL	02:54:06,079	02:54:12,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Depriving The Condemned of the of the only support they have in this moment where they're going to die right to cry
EDL	02:54:12,479	02:54:14,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crowds on their side but sometimes it's not
EDL	02:54:14,783	02:54:15,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a lot of stories about
EDL	02:54:16,319	02:54:21,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Especially you know the crowd in England could be particularly nasty if they didn't like you
EDL	02:54:21,183	02:54:24,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And things thrown in an epic that's her old and all kinds of things
EDL	02:54:26,047	02:54:28,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think about how much that plays into the experience though
EDL	02:54:28,863	02:54:33,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of the terribleness of it if you're The Condemned having to see all these people
EDL	02:54:33,471	02:54:37,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I just your your senses absolutely must have been overwhelmed
EDL	02:54:37,823	02:54:40,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the amount of sensory input coming your way
EDL	02:54:41,919	02:54:43,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's several accounts where
EDL	02:54:43,711	02:54:49,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The I really just figured you were writing these accounts say that The Condemned all along the procession
EDL	02:54:49,343	02:54:51,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Kept her eyes focused a couple of inches from their face
EDL	02:54:52,415	02:54:53,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Add a crucifix
EDL	02:54:53,439	02:54:59,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fix it was being held out going to just kind of trying to tunnel vision this thing and not think about another thing about the not thinking about it
EDL	02:54:59,583	02:55:01,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you're trying to walk
EDL	02:55:01,119	02:55:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A mile in the other man's moccasins or woman's moccasins as the case may be
EDL	02:55:05,215	02:55:06,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is it that person
EDL	02:55:07,519	02:55:08,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sober
EDL	02:55:09,311	02:55:12,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if it was your situation you were dealing with here would you be
EDL	02:55:14,687	02:55:19,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Earlier we quoted that British Observer who watched a breaking on the wheel in Germany are breaking with the wheel
EDL	02:55:20,575	02:55:25,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he was critical of the idea that these people wouldn't go to The Gallows
EDL	02:55:25,695	02:55:27,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Ravenstone is we said
EDL	02:55:27,999	02:55:34,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So intoxicated that they really didn't know what was going on that it kept them from making their most important last piece
EDL	02:55:34,399	02:55:39,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So what have we got in the world in the whole thing what you want to kind of have your wits about you when you do that cuz it's really important
EDL	02:55:39,775	02:55:42,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He mentioned that the crowds would have took that job
EDL	02:55:42,591	02:55:45,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For him so that maybe The Condemned could be out of it
EDL	02:55:46,175	02:55:49,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In in many of these different areas that are chronicled
EDL	02:55:49,759	02:55:50,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are
EDL	02:55:51,039	02:55:53,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shall we call them alcohol
EDL	02:55:53,855	02:55:59,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Injection opportunities along the way and some of its built into the ritual right some of these places
EDL	02:55:59,999	02:56:05,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These Bars along the famous execution router known for any stop here you bring the condemned in here and he gets
EDL	02:56:05,887	02:56:07,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A glass of wine from Austin
EDL	02:56:07,423	02:56:08,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's gentle
EDL	02:56:08,191	02:56:11,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Contribution to the public do it or whatever it might be
EDL	02:56:12,799	02:56:17,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cottrell points out over and over how many of these people going to the Gallows were
EDL	02:56:18,175	02:56:18,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dead drop
EDL	02:56:18,943	02:56:21,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Practically now here's the thing again
EDL	02:56:21,247	02:56:23,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who wants to broad-brush cuz let's say
EDL	02:56:23,807	02:56:27,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're going to be beheaded on the continent one of those
EDL	02:56:27,647	02:56:30,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lucky people who get the decapitation is your sentence
EDL	02:56:31,231	02:56:37,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't want to be drunk I would think I mean you might want to be so you don't know what's going on but if you don't know what's going on you
EDL	02:56:37,631	02:56:38,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Might move
EDL	02:56:39,167	02:56:44,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The number one reason that people didn't have successful decapitations is cuz they moved
EDL	02:56:45,055	02:56:48,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So you don't want to be swaying around drunkenly
EDL	02:56:48,127	02:56:51,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Having who knows maybe a slightly drunken executioner trying to
EDL	02:56:51,967	02:56:52,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Figure out how to
EDL	02:56:53,503	02:56:54,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Time the wobble
EDL	02:56:56,831	02:56:58,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What
EDL	02:56:58,111	02:57:02,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experience might be when The Condemned finally reaches the scaffold looks out
EDL	02:57:02,463	02:57:03,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cease that crowd
EDL	02:57:05,279	02:57:07,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Look at a fear of public speaking imagine what that's like
EDL	02:57:07,839	02:57:08,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Although some of these
EDL	02:57:08,607	02:57:11,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People in the places that let them speak would speak their usually be
EDL	02:57:12,447	02:57:18,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Awesome religious stuff that would go on the scaffold and during the ritual religious. Quite a bit sometimes
EDL	02:57:20,383	02:57:21,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then the execution with command
EDL	02:57:23,967	02:57:24,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you feel
EDL	02:57:25,759	02:57:30,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anything in a decapitation that goes off well do you have any Consciousness at all
EDL	02:57:31,135	02:57:31,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The tablet
EDL	02:57:32,671	02:57:37,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why do people feel right about this is a famous and I'm sure totally discredited so don't even bother
EDL	02:57:37,535	02:57:40,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'll say it's probably just credited at the outside of people
EDL	02:57:40,863	02:57:45,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some men are doctors during the time. Working in the era when the guillotine was in
EDL	02:57:45,983	02:57:47,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Heavy use you know that Blade the drops
EDL	02:57:49,055	02:57:50,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mechanically separated
EDL	02:57:50,847	02:57:52,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Head from their body
EDL	02:57:53,663	02:57:58,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They have some I guess if I'm going to remember you're had some discussions with The Condemned basically saying listen
EDL	02:57:58,271	02:57:59,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bridges experiment
EDL	02:57:59,295	02:58:00,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Your dad so
EDL	02:58:00,063	02:58:03,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what you feel anything blink you know things like that
EDL	02:58:03,647	02:58:06,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Slapping the face of the recently
EDL	02:58:06,975	02:58:09,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decapitated head and
EDL	02:58:09,023	02:58:10,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trying to get the eye to focus on them
EDL	02:58:10,815	02:58:15,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's just say it's been interesting to wonder even with the spinal cord severed
EDL	02:58:16,191	02:58:19,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How long any amount of Consciousness might exist I mean
EDL	02:58:19,775	02:58:20,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	2 seconds
EDL	02:58:20,799	02:58:21,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	3 seconds
EDL	02:58:22,079	02:58:22,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No seconds
EDL	02:58:24,639	02:58:27,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That brings me to one of the interesting lines about hanging
EDL	02:58:28,479	02:58:30,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That I looked up when I was trying to figure out a cave
EDL	02:58:30,527	02:58:32,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If that's what decapitations like what is hanging
EDL	02:58:33,599	02:58:38,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And hangings weird and I want to be careful here because while I was researching and I was shocked to find
EDL	02:58:38,719	02:58:43,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of comments from people who had relatives who would hang themselves and we're not so happy that
EDL	02:58:43,327	02:58:48,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The various sites I was looking at we're giving detailed information about it I thought maybe you didn't able these horrible
EDL	02:58:49,471	02:58:51,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Family tragedies in there so
EDL	02:58:51,263	02:58:55,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thousand apologies in advance that's not what I'm trying to do here but when you try to get into the minds of people
EDL	02:58:55,871	02:58:57,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lunch is going to go through this
EDL	02:58:57,663	02:59:03,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But who are going to ruminate on what it's like to go through this for a long time before they actually do
EDL	02:59:04,063	02:59:10,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what's that like an and I have to say that there is I've searched and searched I find no common agreement
EDL	02:59:10,975	02:59:14,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On what it's like in terms of painful vs. Painful
EDL	02:59:14,815	02:59:16,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whole lot of different
EDL	02:59:16,351	02:59:17,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Accounts
EDL	02:59:17,119	02:59:23,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of which state very painful other account saying that they were out the minute it happened let's remember something though in this. As we say
EDL	02:59:23,519	02:59:24,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Set earlier
EDL	02:59:24,287	02:59:25,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is not the
EDL	02:59:26,079	02:59:29,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Modern kind of hanging where the goal is to try
EDL	02:59:29,663	02:59:31,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To break the neck
EDL	02:59:31,199	02:59:32,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of The Condemned person through it
EDL	02:59:32,735	02:59:34,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Particularly long drop
EDL	02:59:34,783	02:59:39,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a jerk in a specific direction that supposed to separate the spinal cord
EDL	02:59:39,135	02:59:41,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right considered to be again a quick death
EDL	02:59:41,951	02:59:43,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No one's quite sure how long
EDL	02:59:45,023	02:59:49,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In this era as I said earlier you would often see people hung on very short rope
EDL	02:59:49,631	02:59:50,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It were like
EDL	02:59:50,911	02:59:53,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	12in long I mean if you go look at the
EDL	02:59:53,471	02:59:54,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Artwork
EDL	02:59:54,239	02:59:55,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From the.
EDL	02:59:55,519	03:00:00,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It almost looks like they did it wrong like to Modern are you going with ropes not long enough they must have had to shorten it for that
EDL	03:00:00,895	03:00:04,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To get it into the whole frame artistically speaking know that's how they did it
EDL	03:00:04,479	03:00:07,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It look like somebody basically was hanging by
EDL	03:00:07,039	03:00:09,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A really really 6in short rope
EDL	03:00:09,855	03:00:10,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that means you're strangled
EDL	03:00:11,391	03:00:11,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By Design
EDL	03:00:12,671	03:00:15,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And often times they would simply take you up on a ladder
EDL	03:00:15,743	03:00:17,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Turn the ladder sideways
EDL	03:00:17,279	03:00:18,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Have I said
EDL	03:00:18,303	03:00:19,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And turn you off
EDL	03:00:19,839	03:00:20,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's called
EDL	03:00:20,863	03:00:24,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In England before they got all fancy with the
EDL	03:00:24,447	03:00:27,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The trapdoor stuff that used to just
EDL	03:00:27,007	03:00:29,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take several people sometimes on the back of a cart
EDL	03:00:29,823	03:00:32,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a hook him up to a Gallows which was often just
EDL	03:00:32,895	03:00:33,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A
EDL	03:00:34,175	03:00:35,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Piece of woods
EDL	03:00:36,223	03:00:38,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lay between two trees
EDL	03:00:38,527	03:00:42,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And just drive off and leave those people as it was said dancing in the air
EDL	03:00:43,903	03:00:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those things by the way can go bad too
EDL	03:00:46,975	03:00:48,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because people would
EDL	03:00:49,023	03:00:50,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other lots of stories
EDL	03:00:50,303	03:00:51,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actually about
EDL	03:00:51,071	03:00:54,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Family members and Friends definitely executioner sometimes
EDL	03:00:55,423	03:00:57,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Having to run up and
EDL	03:00:57,215	03:01:01,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You hold on and pull on the legs of their loved one
EDL	03:01:01,055	03:01:03,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To try to speed this process up
EDL	03:01:04,895	03:01:11,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I read several accounts are from people that all said that you get this really loud roaring in your ears

EDL	03:08:22,655	03:08:28,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Breaking women on the wheel you wouldn't want to do that to a woman if you spare them the breaking on the wheel you burn them things like that
EDL	03:08:31,103	03:08:33,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We mentioned earlier the
EDL	03:08:33,151	03:08:35,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People who were burned on witchcraft charges
EDL	03:08:35,711	03:08:37,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And United States that we usually hang but in Europe
EDL	03:08:38,271	03:08:39,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lots of burning
EDL	03:08:39,551	03:08:42,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some estimates as high as a hundred thousand people
EDL	03:08:42,367	03:08:46,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Burned for witchcraft crimes in Germany alone
EDL	03:08:46,207	03:08:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	During this
EDL	03:08:46,975	03:08:47,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Broad.
EDL	03:08:49,023	03:08:51,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It wasn't just women although usually was
EDL	03:08:51,839	03:08:53,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We can be all high and mighty about
EDL	03:08:54,143	03:08:58,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're not understanding our forebears for why they did that because we have the unique advantage of
EDL	03:08:58,751	03:08:59,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well
EDL	03:08:59,519	03:09:00,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most of us
EDL	03:09:00,287	03:09:06,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not believing in sorcery and Witchcraft and not thinking it's a problem in our community and not believing that they live amongst us
EDL	03:09:06,943	03:09:10,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not believing that the only thing that really fixes the problem is burning them to death
EDL	03:09:12,319	03:09:13,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Checkr
EDL	03:09:13,599	03:09:15,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Buy us right at the door on that one
EDL	03:09:17,439	03:09:23,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If we were talking about something like terrorism that we did believe in and it was a hundred percent agreement that the only way you stopped that was through burning Terror
EDL	03:09:23,839	03:09:26,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or maybe even suspected terrorist to death
EDL	03:09:26,655	03:09:27,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I imagine we have a future
EDL	03:09:27,935	03:09:28,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Proponent to that
EDL	03:09:28,703	03:09:29,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even now
EDL	03:09:30,239	03:09:31,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nonetheless what was it like
EDL	03:09:32,031	03:09:34,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To go through that burning experience
EDL	03:09:35,359	03:09:37,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well that depends also
EDL	03:09:37,151	03:09:39,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there's a lot of famous ones you know Joan of Arc comes to mind
EDL	03:09:39,967	03:09:40,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right
EDL	03:09:42,015	03:09:43,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I read some accounts that talked about
EDL	03:09:44,063	03:09:46,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The likelihood that the smoke it
EDL	03:09:46,623	03:09:48,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stealth would render a person unconscious
EDL	03:09:50,207	03:09:55,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	During the later. When they're still doing this into the 17 hundreds in Britain for example
EDL	03:09:55,839	03:10:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're doing the same version of secret strangling that they're doing in places like pressure but they're doing it
EDL	03:10:02,239	03:10:04,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Openly like in one of the particularly horrific
EDL	03:10:05,311	03:10:07,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More recent burnings
EDL	03:10:07,359	03:10:10,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They were executing a woman for killing her
EDL	03:10:10,943	03:10:12,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They call that petty treason by the
EDL	03:10:12,991	03:10:16,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Major treason was like crimes against the state
EDL	03:10:16,063	03:10:18,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Petty treason was a wife killing her husband
EDL	03:10:18,111	03:10:19,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nonetheless they had the
EDL	03:10:19,903	03:10:21,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Strangulation thing rigged
EDL	03:10:22,207	03:10:23,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If the wood cuttings I've seen are
EDL	03:10:23,999	03:10:24,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Correct
EDL	03:10:24,767	03:10:26,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sort of on a chain
EDL	03:10:26,303	03:10:32,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it was around her neck on the steak and then somebody would hold this change well 15 feet away
EDL	03:10:32,191	03:10:36,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Away from the faggots of wood that were burning
EDL	03:10:36,031	03:10:39,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And strangled them just before the Flames reach them
EDL	03:10:39,103	03:10:41,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But this time we were told that the chain got too hot
EDL	03:10:41,919	03:10:44,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the guy whose job it was to strangle the
EDL	03:10:44,223	03:10:48,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The woman so she didn't have to suffer burning in the enlightenment.
EDL	03:10:48,319	03:10:49,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a word course you wouldn't
EDL	03:10:49,599	03:10:50,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The burning will you didn't strangle
EDL	03:10:52,415	03:10:54,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I had to let go with the chain
EDL	03:10:54,207	03:10:56,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And everything got very old-fashioned very quickly
EDL	03:10:58,303	03:11:01,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The woman's name by the way was Catherine Hayes
EDL	03:11:01,119	03:11:02,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who is burned alive
EDL	03:11:02,655	03:11:07,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In London in 1726 this account comes from public executions the Nigel
EDL	03:11:07,775	03:11:08,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hawthorne book
EDL	03:11:09,055	03:11:10,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he takes an account
EDL	03:11:10,591	03:11:16,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sounds like a near primary source but maybe not from the Newgate calendar sound like a newspaper
EDL	03:11:16,223	03:11:17,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it says quote
EDL	03:11:18,271	03:11:20,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's received the sacrament
EDL	03:11:20,319	03:11:24,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much drag on a sledge to the place appointed for her execution
EDL	03:11:24,159	03:11:26,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When The Wretched woman had finished her devotions
EDL	03:11:26,975	03:11:28,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In pursuance of her sentence
EDL	03:11:28,767	03:11:31,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An iron chain with put around your waist
EDL	03:11:31,071	03:11:32,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With which she was attached to the stake
EDL	03:11:33,887	03:11:39,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When women were burned for petty treason it was usual to strangle them by means of a rope
EDL	03:11:39,519	03:11:42,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Passed around the neck and pulled by the Executioner
EDL	03:11:42,591	03:11:45,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that they were willfully insensible to the heat of the flame
EDL	03:11:45,919	03:11:47,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But this woman literally burned alive
EDL	03:11:48,223	03:11:53,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner let go of the Rope too soon and consequence of having his hand burnt by the flame
EDL	03:11:54,623	03:11:56,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Flames burn fiercely around her
EDL	03:11:56,927	03:11:59,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And The Spectator beheld Catherine Hayes
EDL	03:11:59,487	03:12:03,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pushing away the fagets while she rent the air with cries and Lamentations
EDL	03:12:04,095	03:12:10,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Other faggets were instantly piled on her but she survived amidst the Flames for a considerable time
EDL	03:12:10,239	03:12:14,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And her body was not perfectly reduced to ashes until 3 hours later
EDL	03:12:14,591	03:12:15,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	03:12:17,151	03:12:18,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So you have this image of a person
EDL	03:12:19,199	03:12:21,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Struggling to kick away the burning
EDL	03:12:21,759	03:12:25,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a f****** of wood around her and they just keep piling moron
EDL	03:12:25,343	03:12:27,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She doesn't sound like she's dying from smoke inhalation to me
EDL	03:12:31,487	03:12:34,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one of the things by the way that you will read about a little color here
EDL	03:12:35,071	03:12:38,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In these later burnings the Executioner will sometimes hang on
EDL	03:12:38,911	03:12:40,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hello bagra pouch around the neck
EDL	03:12:41,471	03:12:42,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of the person
EDL	03:12:42,751	03:12:44,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Manacled to the stake
EDL	03:12:44,799	03:12:46,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that pouch contains gunpowder
EDL	03:12:47,359	03:12:48,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I hope it is
EDL	03:12:48,895	03:12:53,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That when things get hot enough that will explode putting you out of your misery so you don't have to be burned to death
EDL	03:12:54,271	03:12:56,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And is the. Goes on your Reed
EDL	03:12:56,319	03:12:57,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More more counts of
EDL	03:12:57,855	03:13:04,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like when noblemen have to be killed in a rarely but when noblemen have to be killed like that dildo be having whole bladder
EDL	03:13:04,255	03:13:06,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is filled with this gunpowder hoping for the best
EDL	03:13:08,607	03:13:15,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And while that does by the way look a little like the secret strangling thing which enlightened ruler is trying to limit the suffering of The Condemned
EDL	03:13:15,007	03:13:16,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's also a practical
EDL	03:13:17,311	03:13:19,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Way to look at this I mean this is insurance
EDL	03:13:19,359	03:13:20,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Isn't it
EDL	03:13:20,383	03:13:25,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that you won't have another one of these incidents that gives the state of black I like some woman
EDL	03:13:25,247	03:13:31,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Manacle to a post screaming to the crowd and kicking away the wood as fast as you can pile it back on that doesn't look good for
EDL	03:13:32,159	03:13:35,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Little pouch in gunpowder around the neck might save us all a lot of trouble neck
EDL	03:13:35,743	03:13:36,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Next time
EDL	03:13:38,047	03:13:40,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one thing I don't think we have pointed out that's worth mentioning
EDL	03:13:41,375	03:13:44,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is that a lot of these people being executed are bad people
EDL	03:13:45,215	03:13:46,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who committed bad crime
EDL	03:13:47,007	03:13:47,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Write things we would
EDL	03:13:48,287	03:13:52,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Treat severely today murder rape robbery all those kinds of things
EDL	03:13:53,919	03:14:00,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So let's not make Angels out of these people that don't deserve it although I doubt no matter how bad you are we want you burned alive
EDL	03:14:00,319	03:14:00,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	5
EDL	03:14:04,927	03:14:06,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That having been said let's remember
EDL	03:14:06,719	03:14:10,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That in a lot of these places England for example we mentioned already
EDL	03:14:10,815	03:14:14,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They are executing people for crimes that no modern stay whenever exit
EDL	03:14:14,143	03:14:14,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do people for
EDL	03:14:15,935	03:14:16,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	03:14:17,215	03:14:19,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even with all of our modern techniques
EDL	03:14:19,519	03:14:23,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Justice system and everything we have going for us now we still make mistakes
EDL	03:14:23,359	03:14:24,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And convictions right
EDL	03:14:24,895	03:14:27,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What was the failure rate like you can only imagine
EDL	03:14:27,711	03:14:31,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In this time. Cuz right before this time. When they're doing like
EDL	03:14:31,807	03:14:33,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know trial by ordeal
EDL	03:14:34,111	03:14:35,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm going to throw you in the river in a few hours
EDL	03:14:35,903	03:14:41,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think you're innocent if you float you're guilty I mean in the world a little ways out of that. So
EDL	03:14:41,023	03:14:44,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Imagine a bunch of these people being executed or bad people
EDL	03:14:44,095	03:14:45,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Imagine a bunch of a mark
EDL	03:14:47,935	03:14:52,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if we're going to walk a mile in their moccasins and try to wonder how they must have felt don't you think
EDL	03:14:53,055	03:14:53,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Afraid
EDL	03:14:54,335	03:14:56,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Has to be like the most dominant
EDL	03:14:56,383	03:15:00,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Emotion that's just overwhelming them psychologically breaking them
EDL	03:15:03,039	03:15:04,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There were these Rogues and
EDL	03:15:05,087	03:15:06,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People who went to their deaths almost
EDL	03:15:06,879	03:15:08,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Carefree there were some others who went
EDL	03:15:09,183	03:15:13,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With an almost hinge of Madness or perhaps neither one of those people
EDL	03:15:13,535	03:15:15,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Has affected by fear as
EDL	03:15:16,095	03:15:16,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The average

EDL	03:23:42,207	03:23:47,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That confronts our mental image are stereotypical image of the Executioner in this.
EDL	03:23:47,327	03:23:49,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hooded executioner and whatnot
EDL	03:23:50,399	03:23:56,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's more by the way something that happened in England than the continent but the reason wasn't because the Executioner
EDL	03:23:56,799	03:24:00,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I wanted everyone to see their face and to be proud of the situation necessarily
EDL	03:24:01,151	03:24:03,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of them may have chosen to obscure their features
EDL	03:24:04,479	03:24:09,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But everybody else who lived in the town where the execution was happening
EDL	03:24:09,599	03:24:11,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They damn well wanted to know
EDL	03:24:11,391	03:24:13,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where the Executioner was
EDL	03:24:13,695	03:24:15,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they wanted him to stand out of the crowd
EDL	03:24:16,255	03:24:22,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because they didn't want to accidentally come in contact with him in any way shape or form because he was

EDL	03:24:40,575	03:24:44,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Into a dishonorable person in your heavily class base

EDL	03:24:46,463	03:24:47,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Based almost
EDL	03:24:47,743	03:24:48,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Society
EDL	03:24:49,791	03:24:51,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Simply by touching you
EDL	03:24:53,119	03:24:55,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And by the way this touching doesn't just mean
EDL	03:24:55,935	03:25:02,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a while they are performing their duties as executioner it means running into them even accidentally at the marketplace Avenue
EDL	03:25:02,335	03:25:03,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Brush against them
EDL	03:25:03,615	03:25:05,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can be that innocuous
EDL	03:25:07,199	03:25:08,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is why
EDL	03:25:08,479	03:25:14,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The authorities and the citizens want the Executioner dressed at all times in clothing that clearly marks out the fact you're the
EDL	03:25:14,879	03:25:15,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner
EDL	03:25:15,903	03:25:19,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And some places they have to carry like special staff that are certain colors so that
EDL	03:25:19,743	03:25:21,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd knows wait a minute
EDL	03:25:21,791	03:25:25,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's a guy who kills and tortures for money and if I touch him even accidentally I'm just honored
EDL	03:25:27,423	03:25:31,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I imagine that you in the most crowded Marketplace there must have been a nice
EDL	03:25:31,519	03:25:33,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Buffer zone of no people
EDL	03:25:33,823	03:25:36,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Around this guy and his close family members
EDL	03:25:38,175	03:25:42,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I have to confess the more I read about The Executioner's of this era
EDL	03:25:42,527	03:25:45,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's it's probably fair to call them the X
EDL	03:25:45,087	03:25:45,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The cutioner
EDL	03:25:45,855	03:25:46,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Laugh
EDL	03:25:46,623	03:25:48,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of Central and Western Europe in this era
EDL	03:25:49,439	03:25:50,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The more fascinated I am by them
EDL	03:25:52,255	03:25:53,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's not very much
EDL	03:25:53,535	03:25:54,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On them
EDL	03:25:54,559	03:25:55,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Surprising is that mites
EDL	03:25:56,607	03:26:00,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To 21st century audiences and it's remark upon by some of the historians
EDL	03:26:01,983	03:26:03,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who say that the
EDL	03:26:03,263	03:26:08,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Role of the Executioner was sort of downplay they were seen as more of a cog in the machine
EDL	03:26:08,895	03:26:10,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As opposed to
EDL	03:26:10,175	03:26:15,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How do you appear more now in the histories which could be compared to say a ringmaster at a circus a deadly
EDL	03:26:18,111	03:26:19,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's the person who's
EDL	03:26:20,159	03:26:21,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Orchestrating
EDL	03:26:21,695	03:26:23,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Conducting the entire Spectrum
EDL	03:26:23,999	03:26:25,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If it works
EDL	03:26:25,023	03:26:31,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is the person who in a place like Germany will go up to the magistrate's afterwards and hold the sword up and said my Lord you know did I do well
EDL	03:26:32,191	03:26:32,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You wait for his
EDL	03:26:33,215	03:26:37,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You did exactly what you were supposed to do kind of response that's all formalized in
EDL	03:26:37,311	03:26:37,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And everything
EDL	03:26:39,103	03:26:40,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if that guy screws up
EDL	03:26:40,895	03:26:43,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will Justice get the black guy whose fault is that right
EDL	03:26:44,479	03:26:47,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And before we go any farther let's understand
EDL	03:26:47,551	03:26:51,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the ramifications for screwing up an execution
EDL	03:26:51,135	03:26:53,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Could be a lot worse than losing your job
EDL	03:26:53,439	03:26:54,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People throw stones
EDL	03:26:54,719	03:26:57,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When things like that happens and executioners have been killed
EDL	03:26:59,071	03:27:00,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Interesting me enough
EDL	03:27:00,351	03:27:01,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the historians point out
EDL	03:27:02,143	03:27:03,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That I read that they
EDL	03:27:03,679	03:27:06,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Refrain from touching them though anyway
EDL	03:27:06,239	03:27:10,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why we're still not going to touch him even if we want to kill him or throw things at him cuz if we touch him
EDL	03:27:10,847	03:27:14,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then we get this out of right like leprosy another problem in the.
EDL	03:27:15,199	03:27:15,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it could spread
EDL	03:27:16,479	03:27:17,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't even want to be near
EDL	03:27:18,527	03:27:21,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know somebody who could get you sick and well this is a different kind of sick
EDL	03:27:22,111	03:27:22,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's the
EDL	03:27:22,879	03:27:24,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In early modern
EDL	03:27:24,415	03:27:26,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sickness known as dishonor and if you don't already have it
EDL	03:27:27,487	03:27:28,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You don't want to get it
EDL	03:27:30,559	03:27:34,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The idea of them as extraordinary beings is fascinating to me
EDL	03:27:34,911	03:27:37,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And yet when I read the historian kind of go down the list of why
EDL	03:27:37,983	03:27:39,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do they might be called
EDL	03:27:39,519	03:27:44,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Different kinds of beans to teacher singing and even on a genetic level because what ends up happening is this infamy
EDL	03:27:44,895	03:27:46,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But these people have
EDL	03:27:46,687	03:27:47,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Make them
EDL	03:27:47,967	03:27:49,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Unmarriable for example
EDL	03:27:50,783	03:27:56,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the people that they end up marrying or often women who are from families of executioners also
EDL	03:27:57,439	03:28:03,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So they sort of double down the stories they on their weirdness because they don't get to live with other people either
EDL	03:28:03,327	03:28:05,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're marrying into their own kind of
EDL	03:28:05,887	03:28:09,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Class if you willing into distant relatives and mixing these families
EDL	03:28:09,983	03:28:13,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then over Generations you get these great executioner families
EDL	03:28:14,847	03:28:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But they're a little strange because they're a bunch of people
EDL	03:28:17,919	03:28:22,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Live in this world of executioners on both sides down many generations
EDL	03:28:22,783	03:28:24,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And they don't get to mingle with anyone else
EDL	03:28:27,903	03:28:29,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Historian Richard Benjamin
EDL	03:28:29,951	03:28:30,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Points out
EDL	03:28:30,719	03:28:31,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	03:28:32,255	03:28:37,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because of his dishonorable occupation the Executioner lived outside the community
EDL	03:28:37,887	03:28:40,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which only served to heighten his Sinister image
EDL	03:28:41,215	03:28:43,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He could only marry within his own Circle
EDL	03:28:43,519	03:28:45,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that a succession of execution was involved
EDL	03:28:46,335	03:28:50,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner had to distinguish himself by wearing special clothes
EDL	03:28:50,431	03:28:54,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which generally different from his black or red Robes of office
EDL	03:28:54,527	03:28:58,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Attempts to secure a special status by dress inconspicuously
EDL	03:28:58,623	03:29:02,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Failed on account of the rigid dress regulations for the Executioner
EDL	03:29:02,463	03:29:05,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're a good wages and got uncomfortably
EDL	03:29:05,535	03:29:08,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But he had to live outside respectable Society
EDL	03:29:08,607	03:29:14,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sit alone in a separate place in church and was required to eat and drink on his own at the end

EDL	03:29:18,335	03:29:20,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it's affected everyone in this family too
EDL	03:29:20,895	03:29:21,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Condolences quote
EDL	03:29:22,687	03:29:27,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The social implications of Dishonor we're suffered not only by the Executioner
EDL	03:29:27,039	03:29:29,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At least had an occupation
EDL	03:29:29,087	03:29:30,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But also by his children
EDL	03:29:30,879	03:29:33,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who were forbidden to learn and honorable crafts
EDL	03:29:33,951	03:29:37,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Town Craftsman in particular ostracized the Executioner

EDL	03:29:40,607	03:29:43,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Paul Friedland really blew my mind when he talked about how this
EDL	03:29:43,679	03:29:44,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dishonorable
EDL	03:29:45,471	03:29:46,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Taint
EDL	03:29:46,495	03:29:49,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Turned all these people into people that could only
EDL	03:29:49,823	03:29:53,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You'll hang out and intermarry with each other which overtime creates
EDL	03:29:53,407	03:29:56,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well dynasties an Executioner's related to each other
EDL	03:29:56,735	03:29:58,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But also people who been
EDL	03:29:58,527	03:30:02,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Intermarrying in a small circle for a long time genetically
EDL	03:30:02,879	03:30:04,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Closer to each other
EDL	03:30:04,415	03:30:06,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then did any of the outside population he writes quote
EDL	03:30:08,511	03:30:14,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How are we to explain the rise of this closely interrelated cast of people who gradually came to occupy

EDL	03:30:20,543	03:30:23,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Netherlands and german-speaking Northern and Central Europe
EDL	03:30:24,127	03:30:28,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Perhaps the androgyny of executioners was itself the cause of the opprobrium
EDL	03:30:28,479	03:30:34,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As practitioners of this very problematic profession came to be quite literally a separate

EDL	03:30:59,455	03:31:05,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the Executioner could not come into contact with other people or objects without profoundly altering them
EDL	03:31:05,855	03:31:06,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In other words
EDL	03:31:07,391	03:31:09,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A something kind of magical
EDL	03:31:09,695	03:31:11,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And at the same time
EDL	03:31:11,487	03:31:12,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	An untouchable
EDL	03:31:15,071	03:31:17,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The better ones also seem to be part
EDL	03:31:17,887	03:31:19,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Psychologist or psychiatrist
EDL	03:31:20,703	03:31:22,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because they had to think about this
EDL	03:31:22,751	03:31:24,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Instrument they had to Shepherd
EDL	03:31:24,287	03:31:25,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human beings
EDL	03:31:25,823	03:31:26,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From life
EDL	03:31:26,847	03:31:27,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To death
EDL	03:31:28,383	03:31:29,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The mostest
EDL	03:31:29,151	03:31:32,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stream emotional and stressful moment of their lies right
EDL	03:31:32,479	03:31:33,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And in these
EDL	03:31:33,759	03:31:36,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executions that we're almost always these
EDL	03:31:36,575	03:31:39,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Carefully stage drama these spectacles of Justice
EDL	03:31:40,415	03:31:41,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You had to go a certain way
EDL	03:31:42,463	03:31:43,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Route to come off without a hitch
EDL	03:31:44,511	03:31:47,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner needs the cooperation of The Condemned
EDL	03:31:48,863	03:31:50,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They need to work together
EDL	03:31:50,655	03:31:51,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To pull this thing off
EDL	03:31:52,191	03:31:53,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I know that sounds weird
EDL	03:31:54,239	03:32:00,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's in everyone's interest I mean we mentioned earlier that there's a journal and Joel Harrington's book on the faithful executioner
EDL	03:32:00,639	03:32:01,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Wonderful
EDL	03:32:01,407	03:32:07,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But unfortunately for we moderns the book does not address the things we want to dress The Executioner's name is French
EDL	03:32:07,807	03:32:08,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Germany
EDL	03:32:08,575	03:32:11,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He doesn't say here's how I live with myself and all these things we wanted
EDL	03:32:11,903	03:32:13,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Every time you seem to be
EDL	03:32:13,951	03:32:17,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thinking about the victim too much he switches to what they did
EDL	03:32:17,279	03:32:18,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And what made
EDL	03:32:18,559	03:32:22,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Them end up in this position in the first place the horribleness with their crimes
EDL	03:32:22,911	03:32:23,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the way of something a lot
EDL	03:32:23,935	03:32:25,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of people would do today
EDL	03:32:25,215	03:32:26,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Focus on the crimes not the justice
EDL	03:32:28,031	03:32:29,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	None the less hair even have a great
EDL	03:32:30,335	03:32:33,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Color throughout the book and explains the context of all this stuff
EDL	03:32:34,431	03:32:36,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's just friend Schmidt executed 394 people
EDL	03:32:37,759	03:32:38,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Over his career
EDL	03:32:39,295	03:32:40,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And tortured and
EDL	03:32:40,831	03:32:43,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Dished out corporal punishment the hundred more
EDL	03:32:44,671	03:32:45,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Think about that for a minute
EDL	03:32:47,743	03:32:49,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If a guy like that comes up to me
EDL	03:32:50,559	03:32:56,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the last drink right I mean we said earlier the one of the moments that might be the most impactful of your life is the moment.
EDL	03:32:56,447	03:32:57,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Executioner touches you
EDL	03:32:57,983	03:32:59,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another might be when you're in the
EDL	03:33:00,287	03:33:03,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Poor Sinners parlor as it was sometimes called
EDL	03:33:03,615	03:33:10,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know saying your goodbyes and talking with the religious figures and all that stuff and then the announcement comes in as it often did in the
EDL	03:33:10,015	03:33:11,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	German states especially
EDL	03:33:11,551	03:33:13,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Executioner is at hand
EDL	03:33:14,367	03:33:18,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this person shows up Frenchman showed up in his best Robes of office
EDL	03:33:19,487	03:33:20,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Came with a drink
EDL	03:33:20,767	03:33:23,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And share the famous last drink
EDL	03:33:23,071	03:33:26,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With a condemned there also in many places with a famous line
EDL	03:33:26,143	03:33:28,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Neil sometimes called The Hangman's meal
EDL	03:33:28,447	03:33:30,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this is supremely weird
EDL	03:33:31,007	03:33:33,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think was Richard Evans you pointed out for a lot of these poor
EDL	03:33:34,079	03:33:36,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Convicted German criminals during this era
EDL	03:33:37,151	03:33:43,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This lavish meal that they gave the right before they died was probably the greatest meal that they never had and
EDL	03:33:43,551	03:33:45,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Far above anything that ever even seen
EDL	03:33:46,111	03:33:49,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And often times the people who judge you
EDL	03:33:49,951	03:33:56,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the religious figures and even the Executioner will eat with you at this meal and you might be required to wear your own bear
EDL	03:33:56,351	03:33:58,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Burial shrouds of the whole thing's not weird not at all right
EDL	03:33:59,679	03:34:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's part of the psychological breakdown I mean
EDL	03:34:02,751	03:34:06,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean my burial shroud and having the best meal I've ever had to meet with the guy is going to kill me
EDL	03:34:08,383	03:34:12,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if a guy with 394 kills on his record come to me
EDL	03:34:12,991	03:34:14,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And says listen
EDL	03:34:15,295	03:34:21,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I know what I'm doing here I've done this a lot of times let me tell you how it's going to go easy as for you and easy as for me I think I'm
EDL	03:34:21,695	03:34:23,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going to listen to him after all
EDL	03:34:23,231	03:34:26,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If I squirm around too much and don't do what this guy wants
EDL	03:34:27,071	03:34:32,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's going to take more than one shot at my head if this is a decapitation for example and should be pointed at
EDL	03:34:32,959	03:34:38,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The historian had a great lie you said listen these people are under enough pressure anyway they have a reputation not
EDL	03:34:38,847	03:34:39,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Totally
EDL	03:34:40,383	03:34:45,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Without reason of drinking too much what would you do again your job to kill people how you going to handle that
EDL	03:34:46,783	03:34:50,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But if these guys take too many strokes to do the job
EDL	03:34:50,367	03:34:56,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It might be open season on them and violence is a Richard Evans print out violence against executioners who botched
EDL	03:34:56,767	03:34:57,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The job
EDL	03:34:57,535	03:34:59,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What the sources are abundant
EDL	03:34:59,583	03:35:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that'll make him even more nervous right so you really want this condemned to sit still work with you
EDL	03:35:05,215	03:35:08,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you'll all get out of here as easy as possible Right
EDL	03:35:08,287	03:35:11,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm going to listen to the experts in this case if he explains to me
EDL	03:35:11,103	03:35:13,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The best way to hold my head to make this go fast
EDL	03:35:15,199	03:35:19,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I'm going to be broken on the wheel or broken with the wheel the directions might be a little bit more complex
EDL	03:35:22,367	03:35:28,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just to throw this in there cuz I think it's also interesting another reason these people are so dishonorable as they often had a lot of side gigs
EDL	03:35:28,767	03:35:31,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is in the community that we're also sort of untouchability things
EDL	03:35:31,839	03:35:33,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like cleaning the latrines and
EDL	03:35:34,399	03:35:39,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Picking up dead animals and all the stuff people don't want to do right the unclean kind of stuff
EDL	03:35:39,007	03:35:42,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's kind of interesting because they could often make a really good living
EDL	03:35:43,103	03:35:45,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Almost to the point where they're rich
EDL	03:35:45,663	03:35:51,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one source pointed out how interesting it was good we modern people think that money is the great equalizer
EDL	03:35:51,295	03:35:57,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And his point was not at all in the earlier you can be as rich as Midas but if you're at a certain level of society I mean if your reach is mine
EDL	03:35:57,695	03:35:59,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trains
EDL	03:35:59,231	03:36:00,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nobody cares
EDL	03:36:00,767	03:36:05,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When did real well with all their side games and they were knackers and all these other things but
EDL	03:36:05,887	03:36:07,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nobody wanted to eat with him anyway
EDL	03:36:09,727	03:36:14,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another weird thing about him is it at the same time they are these dishonorable beans that you don't want touching you
EDL	03:36:14,847	03:36:17,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They also were kind of thought it was magical Healers
EDL	03:36:18,943	03:36:21,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Obviously they know a little bit about Anatomy
EDL	03:36:21,759	03:36:22,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They also
EDL	03:36:22,783	03:36:28,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Practice torture and keeping people alive to be executed in fact they probably had pretty darn good amateur
EDL	03:36:28,415	03:36:31,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Knowledge it's kind of tough to have the person do what they need to do
EDL	03:36:31,487	03:36:34,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a way that doesn't dishonor you but people went to them as Healers
EDL	03:36:34,815	03:36:37,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They also had another side business and this
EDL	03:36:37,119	03:36:38,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the weird
EDL	03:36:38,143	03:36:40,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Parts of the era left over from the Middle Ages
EDL	03:36:40,959	03:36:43,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They could sometimes sell a little Blood on the side
EDL	03:36:44,287	03:36:47,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The blood of The Condemned was often thought to have magical properties
EDL	03:36:47,871	03:36:49,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Especially for epileptics
EDL	03:36:49,919	03:36:52,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a lot of these executions people rushed
EDL	03:36:52,735	03:36:54,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Scaffold to get ahold of some blood
EDL	03:36:54,783	03:36:55,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the
EDL	03:36:55,551	03:36:58,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Smart are more entrepreneurial Executioner's usually had the resistance
EDL	03:36:59,135	03:37:05,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Already in advance ready to go basically saying something like that they get one they get one I mean
EDL	03:37:05,023	03:37:07,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Son of a Dracula sidegig someone's blood but
EDL	03:37:08,095	03:37:09,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In supply and demand and all that
EDL	03:37:12,191	03:37:13,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Supply and demand is not a bad way
EDL	03:37:14,751	03:37:15,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To describe
EDL	03:37:16,031	03:37:21,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some of the process that led to the decline of these Master Executioner's these Master Craftsman
EDL	03:37:22,175	03:37:23,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because of the 1700s
EDL	03:37:24,223	03:37:25,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No go on
EDL	03:37:25,247	03:37:27,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You get to the ladder part of them
EDL	03:37:27,039	03:37:30,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These executions become rarer and rarer I mean the numbers are actually public
EDL	03:37:31,135	03:37:32,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Rushing record
EDL	03:37:32,671	03:37:34,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What are the records in the Netherlands the records in Paris
EDL	03:37:34,975	03:37:39,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you're seeing single digits in some places it sometimes right there
EDL	03:37:39,071	03:37:44,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	No reason to have a full-time executioner on staff and there's no reason to have a lot of them until they start declining in number
EDL	03:37:46,495	03:37:48,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Amazon probably making professional
EDL	03:37:49,311	03:37:52,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what Champs at the side gigs to make those work full-time but
EDL	03:37:52,383	03:37:54,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You wind up with fewer these people
EDL	03:37:55,199	03:37:56,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And as time goes on
EDL	03:37:56,991	03:37:58,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're getting older
EDL	03:37:58,271	03:37:59,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the
EDL	03:37:59,039	03:38:00,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	History's I read had a letter
EDL	03:38:00,831	03:38:03,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From one of these old Executioner's
EDL	03:38:03,135	03:38:06,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trying to assure a potential employer that he still got it
EDL	03:38:06,719	03:38:07,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right
EDL	03:38:07,487	03:38:11,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Essentially was said something like you know I know I'm old I know the sword is heavy but you know it's like riding a bike
EDL	03:38:13,119	03:38:14,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it's a sign
EDL	03:38:14,655	03:38:19,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you were if you were these people are even around the ones that are around are getting old and they're not exactly
EDL	03:38:19,775	03:38:22,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are they saying boxing to rest is to rust their rusting
EDL	03:38:23,359	03:38:26,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's part of the reason you seem more and more botched
EDL	03:38:26,175	03:38:27,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decapitations during this period
EDL	03:38:28,223	03:38:30,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which was a significant problem
EDL	03:38:30,271	03:38:32,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And as we know being people
EDL	03:38:32,063	03:38:35,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you have a significant problem we're going to try to invent ways
EDL	03:38:35,647	03:38:37,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Two eliminated and that's what the guillotine was
EDL	03:38:38,719	03:38:42,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the blade that drops down the scaffolding and separates a person
EDL	03:38:42,815	03:38:45,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From life to death in the blink of an eye literally
EDL	03:38:47,423	03:38:48,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Attempt to cut out
EDL	03:38:48,959	03:38:52,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The human equation believe it or not as bad as that looks to us now
EDL	03:38:52,543	03:38:55,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a step forward in
EDL	03:38:55,615	03:38:57,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the man's progress towards
EDL	03:38:57,407	03:38:58,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Becoming more humanitarian
EDL	03:39:00,223	03:39:06,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It took away the infamy associated with being touched by the Executioner that would spread to your family in the old days now
EDL	03:39:06,367	03:39:09,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know this was all about a rational penal system
EDL	03:39:09,183	03:39:11,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You have to die but it doesn't have to be any more painful
EDL	03:39:11,999	03:39:13,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then this there's no
EDL	03:39:13,535	03:39:16,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Infamy attached to with The execution is no longer this
EDL	03:39:16,607	03:39:20,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Infamous figure that scares the heck out of people he's just a guy who's a technician
EDL	03:39:23,263	03:39:25,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And as much as the guillotine is associated with these
EDL	03:39:26,335	03:39:31,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bloodthirsty crowd they come to watch the execution like it's something special because we're using the guillotine
EDL	03:39:32,223	03:39:35,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We should remember in context everything we've been discussing right
EDL	03:39:35,551	03:39:38,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	These people the guillotine was to be shortchanged
EDL	03:39:39,135	03:39:44,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's no show you can hardly see it it's over in the blink of an eye you can go watch executions of the guillotine
EDL	03:39:44,767	03:39:45,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Official
EDL	03:39:45,791	03:39:50,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Judicial ones there's one famous one from France I think it was like shot in the 1930s or something
EDL	03:39:51,167	03:39:54,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's in slow motion the entire thing because even then it's
EDL	03:39:55,263	03:39:59,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean they run the prison right boom boom it happened so fast you can't believe it if you came all day
EDL	03:40:00,127	03:40:03,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And tailgated in expectation of that
EDL	03:40:03,711	03:40:07,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's like you know when I used to buy pay-per-view boxing matches
EDL	03:40:07,039	03:40:10,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And somebody would walk out and boom it's over with once you know
EDL	03:40:11,391	03:40:13,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a good way to feel cheated as an audience
EDL	03:40:14,975	03:40:16,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At least one of the histories I was reading made
EDL	03:40:17,279	03:40:18,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sound like
EDL	03:40:18,047	03:40:24,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People really would have preferred to go back to the more spectacular execution simply for entertainment value alone
EDL	03:40:25,727	03:40:26,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some people
EDL	03:40:27,775	03:40:28,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Not all people
EDL	03:40:30,079	03:40:32,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this brings us back around to the third viewpoint
EDL	03:40:32,639	03:40:33,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here I wanted to examine
EDL	03:40:33,919	03:40:34,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Things from
EDL	03:40:35,199	03:40:36,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did The Condemned who did the X
EDL	03:40:36,735	03:40:37,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Did you sniff how about the audio
EDL	03:40:38,783	03:40:41,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The audience is really been the question through
EDL	03:40:41,087	03:40:42,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Throughout this entire conversation has ended
EDL	03:40:42,879	03:40:44,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How the audience is reacting and
EDL	03:40:44,671	03:40:46,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	During this period this is when it kind of gets fascinating
EDL	03:40:47,487	03:40:53,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The aspect of okay so we human beings like this stuff they've been watching it okay so we're maybe not surprised if we're real cynical
EDL	03:40:53,887	03:40:54,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So why did it end
EDL	03:40:55,423	03:40:56,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how did it
EDL	03:40:56,191	03:40:56,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stop
EDL	03:40:57,215	03:41:00,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Definition process is there a roadmap there
EDL	03:41:00,031	03:41:01,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or you can say Okay weave
EDL	03:41:01,311	03:41:04,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We inoculated our self against that once before and here's how we did it
EDL	03:41:05,919	03:41:06,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	During this period
EDL	03:41:07,455	03:41:13,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When the sensibilities as we said earlier begin to change among some people in some classes
EDL	03:41:14,111	03:41:17,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The audience going to be executions begins to in some
EDL	03:41:18,207	03:41:19,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Manner of speaking
EDL	03:41:19,999	03:41:21,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Look at itself
EDL	03:41:22,303	03:41:23,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And not like what it says
EDL	03:41:26,655	03:41:27,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pierce. Bergin his
EDL	03:41:28,191	03:41:29,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The spectacle of suffering
EDL	03:41:31,007	03:41:34,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Gives a primary source account a dramatized one he points out
EDL	03:41:35,103	03:41:36,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From a person who was
EDL	03:41:37,151	03:41:43,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shall we say on The Cutting Edge of these new sensibilities wouldn't even want to see one of these public executions but stumbled into one
EDL	03:41:45,343	03:41:46,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Remember the positive gravity
EDL	03:41:47,391	03:41:48,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Execution site
EDL	03:41:48,159	03:41:48,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Fight in Paris
EDL	03:41:48,927	03:41:49,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quote
EDL	03:41:50,207	03:41:52,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We were proceeding toward the plaza graph
EDL	03:41:52,767	03:41:55,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was late and we thought the execution over
EDL	03:41:55,583	03:41:58,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the gaping mob proclaimed the contrary
EDL	03:41:58,911	03:42:02,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The man was broken on the wheel as where his two companions
EDL	03:42:02,751	03:42:04,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I could not endure the sight of that execution
EDL	03:42:05,311	03:42:06,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I moved away
EDL	03:42:07,103	03:42:09,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	His friend
EDL	03:42:09,151	03:42:10,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Watched it all stoically
EDL	03:42:10,943	03:42:12,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I turned to look at something else
EDL	03:42:12,991	03:42:14,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	While the victim suffered
EDL	03:42:14,527	03:42:15,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I studied The Spectator
EDL	03:42:16,575	03:42:19,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They chattered and laughed as if they were watching a farce
EDL	03:42:19,903	03:42:21,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But what revolted me most
EDL	03:42:21,439	03:42:23,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's a very pretty young girl
EDL	03:42:23,231	03:42:25,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lysol with what appeared to be her lover
EDL	03:42:26,047	03:42:28,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She uttered peals of laughter
EDL	03:42:28,095	03:42:31,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Suggested about the miserable man's expressions and screams
EDL	03:42:31,935	03:42:33,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I could not believe it!
EDL	03:42:34,751	03:42:36,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I looked at her five or six times
EDL	03:42:37,055	03:42:39,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Finally without thinking of the consequences I said to her
EDL	03:42:39,871	03:42:40,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Mademoiselle
EDL	03:42:40,895	03:42:43,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You must have the heart of a monster
EDL	03:42:43,199	03:42:47,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	At the judge by what I see of you today I believe you're capable of any tribe
EDL	03:42:47,551	03:42:50,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If I Had The Misfortune to be your lover I would shun you forever
EDL	03:42:51,391	03:42:52,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As she was no fish wife
EDL	03:42:52,927	03:42:54,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He writes she stood mute
EDL	03:42:54,719	03:42:56,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	! again
EDL	03:42:57,279	03:43:00,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I expected some unpleasant retort from her lover
EDL	03:43:00,095	03:43:01,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He said not a word
EDL	03:43:01,631	03:43:05,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then a few steps away I saw another young girl drenched in tears
EDL	03:43:06,239	03:43:10,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She came to me leaned upon my arm hiding her face and she said
EDL	03:43:10,847	03:43:12,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is an honorable man
EDL	03:43:12,639	03:43:14,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who feels pity for those in anguish
EDL	03:43:15,199	03:43:16,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	! again
EDL	03:43:17,759	03:43:18,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	03:43:20,575	03:43:22,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those comments also emphasized
EDL	03:43:22,879	03:43:29,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another key thing it was making some in the crowd judge others in the crowd harshly for their way that they were reacting
EDL	03:43:30,047	03:43:30,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Women
EDL	03:43:32,095	03:43:33,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Women were
EDL	03:43:33,887	03:43:36,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Staples at these executions pretty much every source
EDL	03:43:36,959	03:43:38,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Suggest from the get-go
EDL	03:43:39,519	03:43:44,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some sources suggest that women and boys traditionally made up the majority of the crowd
EDL	03:43:45,407	03:43:51,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It hadn't been a problem before this era but this is the error remember that has certain built-in assumptions amongst Allah
EDL	03:43:51,807	03:43:53,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of the inteligencia
EDL	03:43:53,343	03:43:54,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About human nature
EDL	03:43:55,135	03:43:57,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And one of those assumptions have to do with Womanhood
EDL	03:43:58,719	03:44:00,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how women are naturally
EDL	03:44:00,767	03:44:06,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The more compassionate sex is one primary source quote are red it's a basically something like they're scared of spiders
EDL	03:44:06,911	03:44:10,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But they can go to these executions and watch intently and enjoy it
EDL	03:44:11,519	03:44:13,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the reality of women that these executions
EDL	03:44:14,591	03:44:20,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was clashing with the inteligencia view of what Womanhood was in their minds in their writings in there was
EDL	03:44:20,991	03:44:22,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Assumptions once again
EDL	03:44:22,271	03:44:25,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If woman who does really like this ideal compassionate
EDL	03:44:25,599	03:44:29,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a mothering State than what we're seeing when we see women go to these executions are
EDL	03:44:30,463	03:44:31,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Twisted people
EDL	03:44:31,999	03:44:36,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People with a screw loose in other words they are establishing a new Baseline for normalcy
EDL	03:44:36,863	03:44:37,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One that is
EDL	03:44:38,399	03:44:39,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Idealistic perhaps at least
EDL	03:44:40,447	03:44:43,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For some people in their times and then what they're seeing on the ground
EDL	03:44:43,775	03:44:45,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Ground Zero
EDL	03:44:45,311	03:44:46,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Clashes with their ideal
EDL	03:44:48,383	03:44:54,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it is fascinating as a modern person to read some of these letters that are published in the histories
EDL	03:44:54,527	03:44:56,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are upper class women in
EDL	03:44:56,575	03:44:58,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	France free sample in their letters are in Freeland
EDL	03:44:59,391	03:45:00,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	As wonderful as I said
EDL	03:45:00,927	03:45:05,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you can see that there is an element of the soap opera
EDL	03:45:05,535	03:45:06,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going on here
EDL	03:45:07,071	03:45:08,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some executions are
EDL	03:45:09,375	03:45:15,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Horrible others are wonderful others are beautiful the people are all huge part of the draw I mean you have likes
EDL	03:45:15,775	03:45:17,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Celebrity executions imagine simatai
EDL	03:45:18,335	03:45:18,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most famous
EDL	03:45:19,359	03:45:24,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People who have tons of cosmetic line the reality show them to getting into trouble and then the public execution where
EDL	03:45:24,991	03:45:27,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Their former popularity
EDL	03:45:27,295	03:45:33,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Plays into the draw the crowd later I mean if you love this person in this nut film would you love to see them their final
EDL	03:45:34,463	03:45:35,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On the scaffold
EDL	03:45:37,791	03:45:41,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Freeland actually uses some of these letters as a way to

EDL	03:49:12,319	03:49:14,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now this heading cause any sort of fuss
EDL	03:49:14,623	03:49:18,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For a long time by the 1690s you were starting to get the very earliest
EDL	03:49:19,231	03:49:21,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a complaint and Rumblings about women
EDL	03:49:22,303	03:49:27,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	John Holland seemingly it was it they might enjoy this kind of stuff and they were having the same problem with boys kids
EDL	03:49:28,447	03:49:33,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the ritualistic religious are you could have choirs of kids singing and humming during the
EDL	03:49:33,567	03:49:35,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Worst of the executions
EDL	03:49:35,103	03:49:36,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Considered to be
EDL	03:49:36,383	03:49:38,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A good lesson hold them up on
EDL	03:49:38,175	03:49:40,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The shoulder of the father so that they could see better
EDL	03:49:40,991	03:49:47,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take him to the Gallows afterwards let him see what happens to malefactors take him to the gibbet showing the dead bodies rotting inside
EDL	03:49:47,903	03:49:54,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The better classes started looking at that and thinking that there was something wrong with that child abuse we would say today
EDL	03:49:54,047	03:49:57,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or at least the stirrings of people who began to think that way
EDL	03:49:59,423	03:50:01,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And for anyone who didn't there was beginning to be
EDL	03:50:02,495	03:50:05,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public pressure in the culture on them
EDL	03:50:05,567	03:50:08,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it's interesting that it was only directed at the so-called better
EDL	03:50:08,895	03:50:11,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People for example V AC control in his book The Hanging Tree
EDL	03:50:11,967	03:50:13,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Talked about Sir Joshua Reynolds
EDL	03:50:14,015	03:50:16,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of these so-called better people
EDL	03:50:16,319	03:50:21,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who in 1790 decided to go to water hanging you know no big deal
EDL	03:50:22,207	03:50:23,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was starting to become important
EDL	03:50:24,255	03:50:24,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which p
EDL	03:50:25,791	03:50:26,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And he was
EDL	03:50:26,559	03:50:31,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Appalled to find the newspapers criticizing him the next day for going
EDL	03:50:31,935	03:50:34,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They basically said that the man he went with
EDL	03:50:34,751	03:50:38,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Someone lower on the social strata we would expect those kind of
EDL	03:50:38,079	03:50:40,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People to go but not somebody like sir Joshua Reynolds
EDL	03:50:41,407	03:50:43,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And Reynolds was kind of confused
EDL	03:50:43,455	03:50:49,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Should have caught off guard by the change in sensibilities if you will and so we wrote a letter
EDL	03:50:49,087	03:50:53,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To his friend Boswell who we went to the execution with afterwards kind of saying
EDL	03:50:53,183	03:50:58,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's wrong with going do an execution right here here's the defense if you will
EDL	03:50:58,047	03:50:59,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For enjoying
EDL	03:50:59,327	03:51:04,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hanging a good hanging hanging well carried out and I should point out that he went to the hanging to watch
EDL	03:51:04,959	03:51:07,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will five people being hanged but one of them was
EDL	03:51:07,519	03:51:10,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Aeon servant-girl for somebody he knew
EDL	03:51:10,591	03:51:12,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And a servant girl
EDL	03:51:12,127	03:51:12,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	New him
EDL	03:51:13,407	03:51:19,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She recognized him right before the news with put around your neck and bowed to him in front of this giant crowd
EDL	03:51:19,295	03:51:21,599	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	She by the way was being hanged for a little theft
EDL	03:51:23,135	03:51:24,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Such was the bloody code right
EDL	03:51:25,439	03:51:31,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But Reynolds says the whole thing went well what's the problem he wrote to his friend Boswell about the criticism he received
EDL	03:51:31,839	03:51:33,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Even the newspapers for going
EDL	03:51:33,375	03:51:34,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And said quote
EDL	03:51:35,679	03:51:37,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I am convinced it is a vulgar error
EDL	03:51:38,495	03:51:41,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The opinion that hanging is so terrible spectacle
EDL	03:51:41,567	03:51:45,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Heard it in any way implies a Hardness of Heart or cruelty of disposition
EDL	03:51:45,919	03:51:49,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any more than such a disposition is implied in the seeking Delight
EDL	03:51:49,503	03:51:51,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the representations of a tragedy
EDL	03:51:52,063	03:51:54,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let me stop here he means like a drama or a play
EDL	03:51:54,879	03:51:55,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He continued
EDL	03:51:56,159	03:52:02,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Such an execution as we saw where there was no torture of the body or expression of Agony of the Mind
EDL	03:52:02,559	03:52:04,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Who were the criminals on the contrary

EDL	03:52:06,399	03:52:07,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Without the leaf trembling

EDL	03:52:29,183	03:52:31,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is moderate exercise is necessary for the body
EDL	03:52:31,999	03:52:37,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If the criminals had expressed great Agony of mine The Spectators must infallibly sympathize
EDL	03:52:37,887	03:52:40,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But so far was the fact from it

EDL	03:53:35,231	03:53:38,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We enter as it were into his body

EDL	03:53:51,615	03:53:53,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So then what does that make pee

EDL	03:53:55,455	03:53:57,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like poor sir Joshua Reynolds

EDL	03:54:05,183	03:54:08,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It also shows a change in the mood and these historians will
EDL	03:54:08,511	03:54:14,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Go over letters and comments and editorials and all sorts of things to show that the mood is changing at this change of sensibility
EDL	03:54:15,167	03:54:18,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now we told you like when we were talking about how you

EDL	03:54:22,591	03:54:24,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The 1960s for example
EDL	03:54:24,639	03:54:30,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well how much value to place on this change in sensibilities among some classes in some places
EDL	03:54:31,039	03:54:33,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And how much weight to put on the fact
EDL	03:54:33,343	03:54:39,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the authorities are not liking some of the main things involved in these executions anymore
EDL	03:54:39,231	03:54:40,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is sort of all
EDL	03:54:41,279	03:54:47,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know what tomato or tomahto thing if you're an expert I mean this is the kind of things they have debates over no one argues that they all Play-Doh
EDL	03:54:47,679	03:54:49,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What did you argue over how much of a role
EDL	03:54:50,495	03:54:53,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The people out there that are Ground Zero Cenex
EDL	03:54:53,567	03:54:54,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will point out the listen
EDL	03:54:55,359	03:54:56,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There was never
EDL	03:54:56,639	03:55:02,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A real change in the attendance rates at these executions and unless you want to say that they continually grow
EDL	03:55:03,551	03:55:05,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is Richard Evans points out
EDL	03:55:05,087	03:55:10,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The high-water mark for attendance of public executions in Western Europe are right before they're taken behind
EDL	03:55:10,975	03:55:13,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the jail walls and made private
EDL	03:55:13,791	03:55:15,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Showing that there's no drop-off in demand
EDL	03:55:17,631	03:55:20,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People who put a great amount of importance on this particular angle
EDL	03:55:21,215	03:55:23,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will point out that people never
EDL	03:55:23,519	03:55:29,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Grew out of public executions because of a change in sensibilities they had the public execution in the spectacle taken
EDL	03:55:29,919	03:55:30,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Away from them
EDL	03:55:31,967	03:55:32,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the authority
EDL	03:55:34,015	03:55:36,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are lots of reasons the authorities seem to be
EDL	03:55:36,831	03:55:42,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Less than satisfied with these public executions the first thing is is that slowly but surely
EDL	03:55:42,463	03:55:48,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A consensus was developing that they weren't doing what you wanted to do not just because people weren't terrified
EDL	03:55:48,095	03:55:49,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because they weren't deterring crime
EDL	03:55:50,399	03:55:54,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Voltaire and other in a public intellectuals that argued that the
EDL	03:55:54,751	03:56:00,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know death penalty for almost anything or these spectacular ones actually made certain kinds of crimes worse
EDL	03:56:00,639	03:56:07,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So the authorities during this big are of penal reform in the 1700 especially were trying to get down to a Bedrock Prince
EDL	03:56:07,039	03:56:08,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About what works
EDL	03:56:09,599	03:56:13,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The other thing that was happening in the 1700 if you remember your history
EDL	03:56:13,951	03:56:19,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the always present fear of the mob amongst the European
EDL	03:56:20,863	03:56:22,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Autocratic rulers
EDL	03:56:22,399	03:56:23,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Exploded
EDL	03:56:24,959	03:56:25,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Intensity
EDL	03:56:26,495	03:56:28,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right around the 1790s
EDL	03:56:28,799	03:56:31,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That wonderful party known as the French Revolution happened
EDL	03:56:31,871	03:56:36,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which would spread some of these ideas like an intellectual contagion all over Europe
EDL	03:56:36,991	03:56:41,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And all of a sudden the most dangerous thing if you are a ruler of one of these countries that you can think of
EDL	03:56:42,367	03:56:46,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is a large crowd of your people together in one place
EDL	03:56:47,743	03:56:50,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Especially if a lot of them are perhaps partying
EDL	03:56:50,815	03:56:53,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Especially if they're very wound up about something
EDL	03:56:53,887	03:57:00,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean worst case scenario imagine at the public execution that you are staging to draw all these people into one of your main cities
EDL	03:57:00,287	03:57:02,591	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To watch and get all drunk and excited about
EDL	03:57:03,103	03:57:04,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is somebody who's
EDL	03:57:04,895	03:57:06,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crime was political
EDL	03:57:06,943	03:57:08,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Against you the regime
EDL	03:57:09,759	03:57:14,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The hundreds of course will be the era of revolution in Western Europe 1848
EDL	03:57:14,367	03:57:15,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crown Jewel year
EDL	03:57:15,903	03:57:19,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But all of a sudden the idea of getting a lot of
EDL	03:57:19,743	03:57:23,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The masses in one place at one time
EDL	03:57:23,327	03:57:25,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I want a sudden sounding very
EDL	03:57:26,911	03:57:28,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	BAC Cantrell says
EDL	03:57:28,959	03:57:33,311	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That it was the authorities that imposed emotional restraint
EDL	03:57:33,311	03:57:36,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	On the crowd by taking away their public execution
EDL	03:57:36,639	03:57:43,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cuz it wasn't serving the needs of the state and you have some German sources that talk about the execution itself
EDL	03:57:43,039	03:57:45,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think I'm quoting here but from memory
EDL	03:57:45,087	03:57:46,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Brutalizing
EDL	03:57:46,367	03:57:47,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Spectator
EDL	03:57:48,159	03:57:51,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So you can't argue that they're enjoying what they're singing
EDL	03:57:51,487	03:57:57,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What you're arguing that it's the exposure to these kinds of spectacles that are making you enjoy right to become
EDL	03:57:57,887	03:57:59,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Palace used to it
EDL	03:58:00,447	03:58:01,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Numb
EDL	03:58:02,751	03:58:04,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there is a ton of
EDL	03:58:04,799	03:58:09,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Class animosity in the sources where the dumbasses who go to these executions are portrayed
EDL	03:58:09,663	03:58:13,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know increasingly is lower and lower class more and more brutal
EDL	03:58:13,759	03:58:16,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And Jennifer example the Prussian nobility Justice
EDL	03:58:16,063	03:58:18,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Completely disconnected from the Richard Evans
EDL	03:58:18,623	03:58:24,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They sneer the masses and think of them as bloodthirsty and low in terms of culture
EDL	03:58:26,047	03:58:27,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the middle 1800s
EDL	03:58:28,095	03:58:34,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Most of these major states are doing away with public executions changing them in ways to make the crowds
EDL	03:58:34,495	03:58:38,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Very small for example they will still execute people publicly in Paris
EDL	03:58:38,591	03:58:40,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Till 19th of 1930
EDL	03:58:41,151	03:58:44,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What they'll do it in a way that minimizes crowd size
EDL	03:58:45,247	03:58:46,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Chinese Publix pek
EDL	03:58:46,271	03:58:48,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Vehicles will go from being encouraged and staged
EDL	03:58:49,343	03:58:50,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To being discouraged
EDL	03:58:50,623	03:58:51,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Deterred
EDL	03:58:51,647	03:58:53,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And eventually simply taken away
EDL	03:58:54,719	03:58:55,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	From the public
EDL	03:58:57,023	03:58:58,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The best quick rundown
EDL	03:58:58,815	03:59:03,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To describe the process that we did in this whole particular section of this conversation this
EDL	03:59:03,935	03:59:06,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Case study if you will from the early modern era
EDL	03:59:07,007	03:59:07,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is
EDL	03:59:07,775	03:59:08,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why not
EDL	03:59:08,543	03:59:11,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Richard J Evans rituals of Retribution
EDL	03:59:11,615	03:59:12,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Where he says
EDL	03:59:13,151	03:59:13,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	About
EDL	03:59:13,919	03:59:19,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The ending of public executions and he goes down a list of what year they happened in all these different states 1850
EDL	03:59:19,551	03:59:21,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I just ate did it 1856 this state did it
EDL	03:59:21,855	03:59:25,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And then he says of the ending of the public executions in Germany quote
EDL	03:59:26,463	03:59:31,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The predominant immediate motive for this change was official fear of the mob
EDL	03:59:31,583	03:59:33,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public executions attracted huge crowds
EDL	03:59:34,143	03:59:39,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any emotions which they were thought to arouse wenzhou considered dangerously unpredictable
EDL	03:59:41,311	03:59:45,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Evans Ben says that what happened was you had this religious ritual
EDL	03:59:45,151	03:59:51,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the state of NC took their religion out of destabilizing the whole thing and basically leaving nothing left
EDL	03:59:51,551	03:59:52,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For people to enjoy it
EDL	03:59:52,831	03:59:54,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Virtuosity reasons
EDL	03:59:54,623	03:59:57,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or sadistic reasons or fill in the blank reasons he writes quote
EDL	03:59:59,231	04:00:05,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Decades of official attempts to secularize the execution ritual remove it from the arena of popular
EDL	04:00:05,631	04:00:12,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Culture and Krypto materialist religion and converted into a solemn expression of state power head only
EDL	04:00:12,031	04:00:13,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Only succeeded in destabilizing it
EDL	04:00:14,335	04:00:17,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The transition from a status bound Society
EDL	04:00:17,407	04:00:22,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tawana growing class antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat
EDL	04:00:22,015	04:00:24,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And broken asunder the synthesis
EDL	04:00:24,319	04:00:28,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Estate in community ritual that had created the early modern public execution
EDL	04:00:29,439	04:00:33,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The educated middle-class has now found the crowd Behavior repugnant
EDL	04:00:34,047	04:00:40,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	While it's deliberate desacralization at the hands of the authorities and gradually stripped it of its mean

EDL	04:00:51,455	04:00:53,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I destroyed the structured crowd
EDL	04:00:53,759	04:00:58,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And replaced it in the eyes of the authorities with a formless volatile Ma
EDL	04:00:59,391	04:00:59,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	04:01:01,695	04:01:08,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So this idea that public executions went away because they were no longer serving the interest of the authorities
EDL	04:01:08,095	04:01:10,911	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He's a popular one off and heavily weighted when people

EDL	04:01:23,199	04:01:25,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can find a lot of little variable that

EDL	04:01:41,631	04:01:42,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean that's a
EDL	04:01:42,655	04:01:43,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Quick Change
EDL	04:01:43,679	04:01:44,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the wave
EDL	04:01:46,495	04:01:47,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some people
EDL	04:01:47,775	04:01:49,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Anyway right which peep
EDL	04:01:49,823	04:01:51,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would be a good question to ask
EDL	04:01:53,151	04:01:54,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	My history books when I was on high
EDL	04:01:54,687	04:01:56,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	High School made a kind of sound like
EDL	04:01:56,991	04:01:59,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The arrow we just talked about was the
EDL	04:01:59,039	04:02:01,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The time where humankind in the better parts
EDL	04:02:01,855	04:02:03,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The world grew up
EDL	04:02:03,391	04:02:04,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a moral

EDL	04:02:10,303	04:02:14,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And into the Modern Age when it comes to moral sensibilities write the Modern Age where you could come up with
EDL	04:02:15,679	04:02:17,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human rights in Concepts like
EDL	04:02:17,727	04:02:19,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	War crimes and all these sorts
EDL	04:02:19,519	04:02:20,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The things
EDL	04:02:22,335	04:02:25,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I actually think there's a pretty strong case for that
EDL	04:02:26,175	04:02:28,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If we're talking about humankind
EDL	04:02:28,735	04:02:29,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Collectively
EDL	04:02:30,271	04:02:31,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All of us together
EDL	04:02:33,087	04:02:36,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What if we're just talking instead of humankind my food just talking about human
EDL	04:02:38,719	04:02:39,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then you might have
EDL	04:02:39,743	04:02:40,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Say
EDL	04:02:41,023	04:02:43,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Well that differs on a case-to-case basis
EDL	04:02:45,887	04:02:48,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean most of our societies no longer impose
EDL	04:02:49,215	04:02:51,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The sort of cruel and unusual public
EDL	04:02:51,519	04:02:52,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Punishment on criminals
EDL	04:02:53,567	04:02:56,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that doesn't mean their people wouldn't turn out to see it
EDL	04:02:58,175	04:03:00,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I mean many societies have examples
EDL	04:03:02,015	04:03:08,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Let's call it extrajudicial justice that have happened since the early modern era that Drew huge crowds
EDL	04:03:08,671	04:03:10,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When in the United States to take for example
EDL	04:03:10,975	04:03:11,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lynching
EDL	04:03:13,279	04:03:14,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Lynching is annex
EDL	04:03:14,559	04:03:15,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Extrajudicial
EDL	04:03:17,119	04:03:18,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Something carried out often
EDL	04:03:18,399	04:03:20,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And by a mob or by vigilantes
EDL	04:03:21,727	04:03:22,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the United States
EDL	04:03:23,263	04:03:24,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot of black
EDL	04:03:24,543	04:03:30,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	American males have been the victim of lynchings between 1890 and 1929 330 I think the
EDL	04:03:30,943	04:03:31,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cut off was
EDL	04:03:31,711	04:03:34,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More than 3000 estimated
EDL	04:03:34,015	04:03:35,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Black males lynched
EDL	04:03:36,319	04:03:39,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And racism obviously a huge part of The Americans
EDL	04:03:39,135	04:03:40,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experience including
EDL	04:03:40,159	04:03:41,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trying to keep people down
EDL	04:03:41,951	04:03:48,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	After reconstruction and the Jim Crow laws
EDL	04:03:48,351	04:03:49,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All that was going
EDL	04:03:49,119	04:03:49,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And yet
EDL	04:03:50,655	04:03:56,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The United States of America has our citizens turned out for lynching involving white folks to
EDL	04:03:57,311	04:04:00,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there are photos of them at lynchings of black folks
EDL	04:04:01,151	04:04:02,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Smiling next to tortured
EDL	04:04:03,455	04:04:05,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A charred corpses of The Condemned

EDL	04:04:09,087	04:04:11,903	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And there are also photos of them smiling next
EDL	04:04:11,903	04:04:12,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do the hanging
EDL	04:04:13,439	04:04:15,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In some cases partially stripped

EDL	04:04:23,935	04:04:24,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In other words
EDL	04:04:24,703	04:04:25,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If we're doing it
EDL	04:04:25,471	04:04:26,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experiment on whether or not
EDL	04:04:26,751	04:04:27,519	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People
EDL	04:04:27,519	04:04:30,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Would still come out to a public execution if they were ever brought back
EDL	04:04:31,615	04:04:32,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the
EDL	04:04:32,383	04:04:33,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	20th century
EDL	04:04:34,175	04:04:35,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The datapoint suggest
EDL	04:04:35,967	04:04:42,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the answer would be yes in fact United States didn't even stop public executions until the middle 1930s and I believe 20,000 peep
EDL	04:04:42,367	04:04:43,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People showed up for the last one
EDL	04:04:44,927	04:04:50,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The difference though it was a kind of what would you say simple hanging out
EDL	04:04:50,815	04:04:51,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take offense at that statement
EDL	04:04:52,607	04:04:53,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But at least it was
EDL	04:04:54,143	04:04:58,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The punishment prescribed by the enlightened of 20th century Society
EDL	04:04:58,239	04:04:59,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of the time
EDL	04:05:00,031	04:05:00,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One of the really
EDL	04:05:01,567	04:05:05,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Interesting comparison points when were talking about the lynchings in the United States is
EDL	04:05:06,431	04:05:08,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You are not constrained by
EDL	04:05:08,479	04:05:14,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The law that said you can't have cruel and unusual punishment you off and we're going for cruel and unusual punishments in the air
EDL	04:05:14,879	04:05:17,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Actual accounts of diesel engines are terrifyingly horrible
EDL	04:05:19,231	04:05:21,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You think blowtorches is that enough for you
EDL	04:05:23,839	04:05:27,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Many of them were done in private by small groups of people
EDL	04:05:27,679	04:05:34,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's part of the history of the ACT but that doesn't really concern us here for what we're talking about the ones that are interesting is sort of day
EDL	04:05:34,079	04:05:35,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Data points if you will
EDL	04:05:36,127	04:05:36,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are the ones that
EDL	04:05:37,407	04:05:38,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Drew huge crowds
EDL	04:05:39,455	04:05:41,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because you can write off small groups of people

EDL	04:05:47,135	04:05:48,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A lot harder when the sampling

EDL	04:05:53,023	04:05:54,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like Waco Texas
EDL	04:05:55,583	04:05:59,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In 1916 and I don't mean to single out Waco it's just the most famous
EDL	04:05:59,679	04:06:00,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Case
EDL	04:06:01,215	04:06:01,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those of you
EDL	04:06:01,983	04:06:03,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Know your history of lynching

EDL	04:06:08,639	04:06:12,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And Washington's a good example because I had people come up to me and try to
EDL	04:06:12,991	04:06:14,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Downplay
EDL	04:06:14,015	04:06:18,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Play the stuff and one of the arguments they'll often uses yeah well of course I'm innocent people
EDL	04:06:18,623	04:06:24,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're Lynch but most of these people did bad things as though that would somehow be okay
EDL	04:06:24,767	04:06:28,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Remember if Jesse Washington had faced legal justice
EDL	04:06:28,863	04:06:31,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For the crimes he supposed to have committed he would have been hanged
EDL	04:06:32,447	04:06:33,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	A simple hanging right
EDL	04:06:34,239	04:06:35,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But he wasn't

EDL	04:06:48,319	04:06:51,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Stan's is one of the most widely known and scrutinized lynching
EDL	04:06:51,903	04:06:53,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because it in many ways

EDL	04:08:17,663	04:08:19,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And other Grizzly Remnant from the day's events
EDL	04:08:20,479	04:08:20,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And quote
EDL	04:08:23,295	04:08:25,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Folks this is not really modern
EDL	04:08:25,343	04:08:27,135	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	France which is shocking enough
EDL	04:08:28,159	04:08:29,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is 20th century
EDL	04:08:29,951	04:08:31,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the Main Street America
EDL	04:08:33,535	04:08:35,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you go look at the photos
EDL	04:08:35,583	04:08:38,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which were taken of this lynching in progress
EDL	04:08:39,679	04:08:42,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You can see why they turned out to be so
EDL	04:08:43,007	04:08:45,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Galvanizing in the anti-lynching movement
EDL	04:08:46,847	04:08:48,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because you look at it and you are
EDL	04:08:48,639	04:08:50,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Staring into a time machine
EDL	04:08:51,199	04:08:52,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They're dressed differently
EDL	04:08:53,503	04:08:55,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But that's a photograph
EDL	04:08:55,295	04:08:57,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That gives you a pretty good idea
EDL	04:08:57,599	04:09:00,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What these early modern executions must have look like two
EDL	04:09:02,975	04:09:05,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The scenery changes the costumes evolve
EDL	04:09:06,559	04:09:08,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But those people wearing those clothes
EDL	04:09:09,631	04:09:12,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's the same species as it always was
EDL	04:09:12,703	04:09:13,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We are the lab rats
EDL	04:09:14,751	04:09:15,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experiment
EDL	04:09:15,775	04:09:18,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which wonder is about how we react
EDL	04:09:18,847	04:09:19,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To this
EDL	04:09:21,151	04:09:24,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And by the way the things that they did to Washington as
EDL	04:09:24,223	04:09:26,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's the case in a bunch of these lynchings
EDL	04:09:26,783	04:09:30,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Are every bit as nasty as the stuff that went on
EDL	04:09:30,111	04:09:32,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In those executions in early modern Europe we talk
EDL	04:09:32,415	04:09:34,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bottoming chopping off fingers
EDL	04:09:34,207	04:09:39,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Burning people Jesse Washington was raised and lowered over fire for at least an hour or some sources say two
EDL	04:09:40,607	04:09:44,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	He tried to climb up the chain that was suspending him over the fire
EDL	04:09:44,959	04:09:50,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But apparently was unable to because he lacked fingers which has been chopped off along with his genitals
EDL	04:09:50,335	04:09:51,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This Is Not Unusual
EDL	04:09:52,639	04:09:53,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crowd of people watch this
EDL	04:09:54,431	04:09:55,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Participated in it
EDL	04:09:55,967	04:09:56,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Enjoyed it

EDL	04:10:06,207	04:10:06,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We missed
EDL	04:10:06,975	04:10:07,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Good Barbie
EDL	04:10:09,791	04:10:11,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	This is cruelty

EDL	04:10:21,823	04:10:22,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Clearly.
EDL	04:10:23,359	04:10:24,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And it's not a few outliers

EDL	04:10:28,479	04:10:31,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's a wide cross-section of an early 20th century American city
EDL	04:10:34,111	04:10:38,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's tempting to label something like the Jesse Washington lynching as
EDL	04:10:38,207	04:10:40,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Involving inhuman cruelty
EDL	04:10:41,791	04:10:43,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it looks all too human
EDL	04:10:43,839	04:10:44,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	After you
EDL	04:10:44,607	04:10:45,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Leaf through

EDL	04:10:49,727	04:10:51,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Probably safe to say that this
EDL	04:10:51,263	04:10:52,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	His cruelty element is
EDL	04:10:52,799	04:10:55,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is a universal part of The Human Experience
EDL	04:10:57,663	04:10:59,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Uncomfortable questions start coming into
EDL	04:10:59,967	04:11:00,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Play
EDL	04:11:01,503	04:11:02,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you ask
EDL	04:11:02,271	04:11:02,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why
EDL	04:11:05,087	04:11:07,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	For now by the way and I think I have that
EDL	04:11:07,903	04:11:09,439	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There is no agreement
EDL	04:11:09,439	04:11:10,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Over this way
EDL	04:11:10,975	04:11:11,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	My issue
EDL	04:11:12,255	04:11:15,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Why people are violent why they would enjoy watching violence
EDL	04:11:15,583	04:11:17,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are theories there are ideas
EDL	04:11:17,375	04:11:18,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are debates
EDL	04:11:18,655	04:11:19,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There are studies at
EDL	04:11:19,935	04:11:21,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Crosses many disciplines
EDL	04:11:24,031	04:11:27,103	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think storytellers have always understood
EDL	04:11:27,103	04:11:28,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Unconsciously
EDL	04:11:28,639	04:11:30,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there are these buttons they can push
EDL	04:11:31,455	04:11:32,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That
EDL	04:11:32,223	04:11:38,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Trigger emotional responses in us that may be chemically related maybe they know how to push the dopamine or serotonin button
EDL	04:11:38,879	04:11:41,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Every three pages of your script to make sure you get whatever
EDL	04:11:42,463	04:11:43,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You need
EDL	04:11:43,743	04:11:46,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To keep reading the story and be interested maybe it's a gunfight
EDL	04:11:47,327	04:11:49,119	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe it's a little sexual activity
EDL	04:11:49,631	04:11:51,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe it's some sort of Twisted
EDL	04:11:52,191	04:11:54,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In a scene that makes you laugh
EDL	04:11:54,239	04:11:55,263	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or freaked out
EDL	04:11:56,287	04:11:59,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But somebody knows that that's a button that will work for you why does it work
EDL	04:11:59,871	04:12:01,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you want over the eras of
EDL	04:12:02,687	04:12:06,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In evolutionary adaptations built on evolutionary adaptations
EDL	04:12:06,527	04:12:07,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is that
EDL	04:12:07,295	04:12:12,927	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Flying into Isabel don't like playing into a jungle cats inability to not follow something
EDL	04:12:12,927	04:12:16,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It looks like it's running away from it I mean is there something deep in our souls
EDL	04:12:16,255	04:12:18,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was once upon a time very useful
EDL	04:12:18,559	04:12:20,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's just left over like an appendix
EDL	04:12:21,887	04:12:25,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We don't need this cruelty or this desire to see cruelty anymore
EDL	04:12:25,727	04:12:28,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So what you still doing there do we need to get rid of it because
EDL	04:12:28,543	04:12:32,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know we haven't needed it in a long time and it causes a whole lot of side effects as we all know

EDL	04:12:35,199	04:12:36,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Question that always the Wonder
EDL	04:12:37,247	04:12:39,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If that's not the case if we still need it somehow
EDL	04:12:41,599	04:12:44,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If it's a standard part of Who We Are
EDL	04:12:44,927	04:12:50,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And along with all the obvious negative signs to it has some positive benefits I like to
EDL	04:12:50,047	04:12:52,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sometimes uses an analogy and you knew I was
EDL	04:12:52,863	04:12:53,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Going to go here
EDL	04:12:53,887	04:12:54,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Star Trek app
EDL	04:12:55,679	04:12:56,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Captain Kirk
EDL	04:12:56,959	04:12:57,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Explaining to the
EDL	04:12:57,727	04:13:00,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The two halves of his personality I guess you could say
EDL	04:13:00,031	04:13:01,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Politically call them
EDL	04:13:01,567	04:13:04,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The positive and negative half a good the bad half
EDL	04:13:04,127	04:13:07,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The one with the most celebrated positive human qualities in the one
EDL	04:13:08,223	04:13:10,015	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another sort of shows us that are most
EDL	04:13:11,551	04:13:14,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Will seven deadly sins oriented best maybe you could
EDL	04:13:15,903	04:13:17,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Throughout most of the episode
EDL	04:13:17,695	04:13:22,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know there's a good in the bad one of the bad ones doing all these bad things and getting into trouble that Goodwin is worried about
EDL	04:13:22,559	04:13:25,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The moral of the story is there comes a point where
EDL	04:13:25,375	04:13:30,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You're hardcore decisions that affect life and death and all these kinds of things comes into play
EDL	04:13:30,495	04:13:34,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the half that doesn't have the negative qualities is ill-equipped
EDL	04:13:34,079	04:13:36,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	There's something about those negative qualities that help
EDL	04:13:36,895	04:13:38,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Round this person out
EDL	04:13:38,687	04:13:44,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So that they have what they need in different situations most of the time maybe you don't need that cruelty Jean
EDL	04:13:44,575	04:13:45,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To come into play
EDL	04:13:45,855	04:13:47,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But maybe sometimes you do
EDL	04:13:48,927	04:13:50,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's a weird thing to think about
EDL	04:13:50,719	04:13:52,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right and maybe let's suggest
EDL	04:13:52,767	04:13:54,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It has to do with
EDL	04:13:54,047	04:13:55,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Chances what if it's like fire
EDL	04:13:57,887	04:13:59,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you don't have it at all you freeze to death but
EDL	04:13:59,935	04:14:04,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe in a place like ancient Rome were there watching people die in the arena let's remember
EDL	04:14:04,543	04:14:05,823	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The Romans
EDL	04:14:05,823	04:14:07,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is Will Durant pointed out with
EDL	04:14:07,615	04:14:10,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Argue that the arena was good for their people
EDL	04:14:10,175	04:14:11,199	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In their day right
EDL	04:14:11,711	04:14:17,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Made you less of Shia blood made you a better Soldier made you tougher to watch this kind of stuff or so they thought
EDL	04:14:18,623	04:14:25,023	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And maybe for their own time that's the level of Cruelty that those people needed to thrive maybe we don't need that level of cruel
EDL	04:14:25,023	04:14:25,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How much less
EDL	04:14:26,047	04:14:26,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Cruel Society
EDL	04:14:27,839	04:14:28,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Then the neck
EDL	04:14:28,607	04:14:32,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Next uncomfortable question that arises from that one is so how much cruelty do we need
EDL	04:14:35,775	04:14:41,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Perhaps the follow-up uncomfortable question after that is even if you decide how much cruelty you need
EDL	04:14:42,431	04:14:43,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What is X Change
EDL	04:14:45,759	04:14:49,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of course all implies that you can control cruelty like a
EDL	04:14:49,855	04:14:50,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Temperature gauge
EDL	04:14:55,231	04:14:56,255	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is strange to think of
EDL	04:14:57,535	04:15:03,423	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And we've been talkin bout a revolution sensibilities the idea that you could have a counter-revolution in sensibilities
EDL	04:15:04,703	04:15:05,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People can become
EDL	04:15:06,751	04:15:11,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Potentially more brutal depending on how you measure it more cruel than their parents or grandparents
EDL	04:15:12,895	04:15:13,407	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Understand
EDL	04:15:13,919	04:15:17,503	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Our parents and grandparents maybe the high-water mark of
EDL	04:15:17,503	04:15:18,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Empathetic
EDL	04:15:18,527	04:15:20,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human development I mean
EDL	04:15:20,063	04:15:21,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's pretty recent
EDL	04:15:23,647	04:15:25,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It's impossible to imagine today though
EDL	04:15:26,207	04:15:31,839	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Play Jesse Washington type lynching happening in a small American city
EDL	04:15:31,839	04:15:37,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In 21st century America in front of all those people can't even imagine it's a we call that progress right
EDL	04:15:39,263	04:15:43,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Might we ever slide back in the other direction I mean I can't imagine
EDL	04:15:43,871	04:15:46,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You never see something like that again
EDL	04:15:46,687	04:15:51,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But maybe you could say that in 20 years do the whole bunch of different modern influences
EDL	04:15:51,807	04:15:58,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you took a pinion Polo 20% more of the survey people would say that what was done to the victim
EDL	04:15:58,207	04:15:58,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Was correct
EDL	04:15:59,743	04:16:01,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	See what I'm saying that would be back
EDL	04:16:01,279	04:16:02,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Sliding wooden it
EDL	04:16:04,607	04:16:06,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And yet there's this weird dichotomy
EDL	04:16:07,167	04:16:08,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Between what
EDL	04:16:08,703	04:16:14,847	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I guess without study or thinking about it what one would think should be happening to society now
EDL	04:16:15,359	04:16:16,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Versus what you see
EDL	04:16:16,895	04:16:23,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Because what you see is a very empathetic Society some have suggested that the pendulum has even swung too far in that
EDL	04:16:23,295	04:16:25,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Empathetic
EDL	04:16:25,343	04:16:26,623	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Too weepy
EDL	04:16:26,623	04:16:28,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bright overly so may
EDL	04:16:29,439	04:16:31,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Which then of course begs the question you know just
EDL	04:16:31,487	04:16:32,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The pendulum swing backwards
EDL	04:16:34,047	04:16:35,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The fire naturally
EDL	04:16:35,583	04:16:39,679	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Note to self correct to the right amount of heat for the tenor of the times
EDL	04:16:41,471	04:16:42,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe something
EDL	04:16:42,495	04:16:48,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Like a 911 happens and all of a sudden you need to change the cruelty level on the thermostat to allow for more
EDL	04:16:50,175	04:16:52,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Darkside Captain Kirk activities necessary
EDL	04:16:54,527	04:16:59,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You dial it back too often though into shorter. Of time you might find the room uncomfortably cold
EDL	04:17:01,439	04:17:02,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The weird dichotomy
EDL	04:17:03,487	04:17:07,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is that in this era this Uber sensitive Uber empathetic error
EDL	04:17:08,351	04:17:11,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We have more influences on us
EDL	04:17:11,935	04:17:14,239	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That theoretically should have worked us
EDL	04:17:14,751	04:17:18,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	According to the experts that when I was a kid were telling me
EDL	04:17:18,847	04:17:23,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That the number of simulated murders that I have seen on television is my brain was developing
EDL	04:17:23,455	04:17:29,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know something in the 14000 whatever they used to throw the number of the average American Child by the time they're fourteen years old is she and 14th
EDL	04:17:29,855	04:17:32,159	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does Rachel whatever it was the slogan
EDL	04:17:33,951	04:17:35,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The implication was
EDL	04:17:35,231	04:17:39,071	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I don't blame him this was all pretty new stuff you got a 1960's television
EDL	04:17:39,071	04:17:43,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Those hardly even counted murders by 1970 standards and those hardly counted murders by
EDL	04:17:43,935	04:17:46,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Our standards today in terms of how came they are
EDL	04:17:46,751	04:17:49,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Nonetheless there was ample worrying
EDL	04:17:49,567	04:17:55,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But the accumulated effect of all this simulated violence would do something nasty to my generation when we got older and we're old
EDL	04:17:55,967	04:17:56,735	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Weather now
EDL	04:17:57,759	04:17:58,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What happened
EDL	04:18:00,319	04:18:05,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The problem of course we all faced as we are immersed in the modern Zeitgeist we can't tell
EDL	04:18:05,951	04:18:06,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If we've been warped
EDL	04:18:07,743	04:18:12,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You got to bring somebody back from another era and instantly say hey notice anything weird about us
EDL	04:18:12,863	04:18:14,399	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Weird funny to you
EDL	04:18:14,399	04:18:20,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bring back Captain America I love this about the Captain America character by the way he's a 1940's ERA American instantly transfer
EDL	04:18:20,799	04:18:22,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Folded into the now
EDL	04:18:22,079	04:18:24,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And you get to see his reactions to all the changes
EDL	04:18:24,639	04:18:26,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But he didn't get to go through slowly like
EDL	04:18:26,943	04:18:28,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The rest of society did
EDL	04:18:29,503	04:18:31,295	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pay 1940s American
EDL	04:18:31,295	04:18:32,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do we look warped
EDL	04:18:32,319	04:18:32,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you
EDL	04:18:35,647	04:18:36,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But
EDL	04:18:36,415	04:18:39,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Tumi living in the milieu as I am
EDL	04:18:40,255	04:18:42,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't see that we have been
EDL	04:18:42,559	04:18:45,375	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Terribly affected in a nasty way
EDL	04:18:45,375	04:18:51,775	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you would gone to the people the 1970s and show them the kind of violence we would see simulated today
EDL	04:18:51,775	04:18:53,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hey the realism level of it
EDL	04:18:54,079	04:19:00,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I can't imagine what they would have said I mean the movies that you can go see the day and lots of the R-rated ones meet this crime
EDL	04:19:00,479	04:19:03,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Criteria we've been rated X when I was a kid
EDL	04:19:03,551	04:19:07,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	X by the way traditionally what you labeled hardcore pornography
EDL	04:19:07,647	04:19:09,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And kids Once Upon a Time
EDL	04:19:09,183	04:19:11,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	By the scale of today
EDL	04:19:11,231	04:19:14,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It was a lot more tightly controlled in places like the United States
EDL	04:19:14,815	04:19:17,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So they have your non-pornographic movie
EDL	04:19:17,887	04:19:24,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Labeled X for violence with a huge deal right you basically wouldn't be making your movie we got lots of movie
EDL	04:19:24,287	04:19:24,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Movies like that now
EDL	04:19:26,335	04:19:27,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again
EDL	04:19:27,359	04:19:27,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So what
EDL	04:19:28,639	04:19:35,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Society seems to be standing and the problem in trying to figure out if you can see long-term damage
EDL	04:19:35,039	04:19:38,367	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do do I see more and more simulated violence but more more real
EDL	04:19:38,879	04:19:40,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is the Zeitgeist thing again
EDL	04:19:40,415	04:19:42,463	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How do you differentiate
EDL	04:19:42,463	04:19:48,863	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In all the strands of reality and try to quantify that we have more school shootings with youngsters than we used to maybe it's violent video game
EDL	04:19:48,863	04:19:50,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How would you know
EDL	04:19:50,143	04:19:52,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	$15,000 variables acting on those kids as well
EDL	04:19:53,983	04:19:56,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But Society still standing right
EDL	04:19:57,567	04:20:00,383	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When you think about what we were exposed to it a little bit shocking
EDL	04:20:00,383	04:20:02,431	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Take for example this is what occurred to me
EDL	04:20:02,431	04:20:05,247	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many people have seen the images of the terrorists who are
EDL	04:20:05,247	04:20:11,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Is slitting the throats with the knives of the people in the orange jumpsuits at their feet was on like every magazine cover at one point
EDL	04:20:11,391	04:20:14,719	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The videos are all over the internet been viewed a bazillion times
EDL	04:20:16,255	04:20:22,655	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That's more graphic than anything 99% of the population of the western world would have seen when
EDL	04:20:22,655	04:20:23,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When I was a kid
EDL	04:20:24,447	04:20:27,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The kind of stuff you'd only see if you were in combat
EDL	04:20:27,519	04:20:32,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Or a first responder or a journalist or somebody who looked at autopsy photos I mean that's
EDL	04:20:33,663	04:20:36,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That would have shocked America in 1974
EDL	04:20:39,039	04:20:39,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now
EDL	04:20:40,063	04:20:42,879	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	How many things like that have we seen
EDL	04:20:43,647	04:20:50,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Does it do anything to us at all if you watch a hundred real chilling forget about the simulated stuff they were worried about
EDL	04:20:50,047	04:20:51,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Black kids watching the 1970s
EDL	04:20:51,839	04:20:57,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you watched a hundred real killings online in a 24 hour period Does he do anyting
EDL	04:20:59,007	04:21:00,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Here's the funny part
EDL	04:21:00,287	04:21:02,079	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If it does something
EDL	04:21:02,079	04:21:06,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I find that really interesting if it doesn't do anything I find a Justice interesting
EDL	04:21:06,943	04:21:08,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Experiment right
EDL	04:21:09,759	04:21:11,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Of course it would be if we had kept
EDL	04:21:11,551	04:21:13,855	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The variables the same I mean if you'd shown
EDL	04:21:14,367	04:21:20,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	American children 1970s level television violence for a hundred years and then looked at the results
EDL	04:21:20,767	04:21:22,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But it would be one thing but we haven't done that obviously
EDL	04:21:23,839	04:21:25,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Deepened and intensified
EDL	04:21:25,887	04:21:28,191	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The experience a lot since I was a
EDL	04:21:28,191	04:21:28,703	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The kid
EDL	04:21:29,471	04:21:31,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We just mentioned the
EDL	04:21:31,007	04:21:35,359	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	More realistic fake violence there is the real violence now online to contend with
EDL	04:21:35,359	04:21:38,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The assassination and execution videos all that stuff you could see
EDL	04:21:39,199	04:21:40,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But there's a
EDL	04:21:40,223	04:21:41,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Temperature
EDL	04:21:41,759	04:21:44,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Element now that wasn't involved back in the day
EDL	04:21:45,087	04:21:48,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Yeah I just asking how watching the stuff affects people
EDL	04:21:48,415	04:21:51,999	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Now you can ask how participating in it does in a virtual sense right
EDL	04:21:52,511	04:21:56,351	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The first person shooter games come to mind but there's a lots of things out there
EDL	04:21:56,863	04:22:01,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But do similar sorts of things in terms of immersing you in a fantasy world
EDL	04:22:01,471	04:22:04,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And allowing you to behave in ways you would never behave
EDL	04:22:04,543	04:22:05,567	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In the real world
EDL	04:22:06,079	04:22:08,127	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I don't think there's anything wrong with that
EDL	04:22:10,687	04:22:16,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I know what these people think time should remain static and how would you have prevented this this is the experiment
EDL	04:22:16,319	04:22:17,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	People are affected by this
EDL	04:22:17,599	04:22:19,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And so far I'd say
EDL	04:22:19,391	04:22:23,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know we're doing pretty well but it's such a short term Horizon I mean what's the
EDL	04:22:23,743	04:22:27,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Computer error been like 20 years since that really took off
EDL	04:22:29,631	04:22:32,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Thirty years I mean this is short-term Horizon stuff
EDL	04:22:32,447	04:22:33,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Call me in a hundred years right
EDL	04:22:34,239	04:22:36,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When we will have the ability to put you
EDL	04:22:37,311	04:22:39,615	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Into any of these situations
EDL	04:22:39,615	04:22:42,175	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We talked about that are really extreme
EDL	04:22:42,175	04:22:44,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In an almost real sent to me how long until that's the case
EDL	04:22:45,759	04:22:46,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Again
EDL	04:22:46,783	04:22:48,831	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I don't see anything wrong with that either
EDL	04:22:50,111	04:22:52,671	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And this is an extension of Storytelling
EDL	04:22:53,439	04:22:59,327	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And its existence of the very beginning of Storytelling which was oral a long time before anybody ever wrote anything down
EDL	04:23:01,375	04:23:05,215	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Pushing the same buttons in a more intense and realistic way
EDL	04:23:05,215	04:23:06,495	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is always been pushed
EDL	04:23:08,031	04:23:13,663	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	All you storytellers out there understand the pain raises the emotional stakes in the story
EDL	04:23:13,663	04:23:14,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Human beings right
EDL	04:23:15,199	04:23:18,783	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Whether we talked about emotional physical or even the kind of pain

EDL	04:24:35,583	04:24:36,095	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	That much
EDL	04:24:38,399	04:24:39,935	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Another thought occurs to me
EDL	04:24:40,447	04:24:43,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And that's what we talked about a long time ago on this day
EDL	04:24:43,007	04:24:46,335	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Discussion that you know there's never been any blind taste test on this
EDL	04:24:46,847	04:24:48,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In terms of making these statements about
EDL	04:24:49,663	04:24:51,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What might happen Generations from now
EDL	04:24:51,967	04:24:55,807	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It is slow poison of portrayed or real violence
EDL	04:24:55,807	04:24:59,391	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Seeps into the body politic over several Generations in thaxted
EDL	04:24:59,903	04:25:03,487	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe we're already we're we're worried we might get to
EDL	04:25:04,511	04:25:07,583	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If you say if we're not careful Generations from now they want to watch
EDL	04:25:07,583	04:25:10,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public executions who says we wouldn't now
EDL	04:25:11,423	04:25:13,983	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I we mentioned earlier one of the theories on this whole thing is that
EDL	04:25:14,495	04:25:20,895	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	They never went out of fashion these public execution that this was a free market capitalistic content-related decision
EDL	04:25:20,895	04:25:22,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And the audience got to decide
EDL	04:25:22,687	04:25:24,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It never would have gone away maybe
EDL	04:25:26,527	04:25:29,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bounce that we were going to have the first
EDL	04:25:29,599	04:25:31,647	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Public execution in the United
EDL	04:25:31,647	04:25:33,183	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	State since the 1930s
EDL	04:25:34,207	04:25:34,975	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Put it in the sun
EDL	04:25:36,255	04:25:37,535	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Centralized
EDL	04:25:37,535	04:25:38,559	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Bigspot
EDL	04:25:38,559	04:25:40,607	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Some scaffold in the middle of Las Vegas
EDL	04:25:41,119	04:25:41,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Right near all the hotel
EDL	04:25:43,167	04:25:45,471	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you think you'd be able to get a ringside seat
EDL	04:25:46,495	04:25:52,639	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can you be able to rent one of those rooms with a picture window of you down on the scaffold and one of the nearby hotels
EDL	04:25:54,943	04:25:55,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I wonder
EDL	04:25:55,711	04:25:56,479	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And
EDL	04:25:56,479	04:25:58,527	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know I think that there's a breakdown
EDL	04:26:00,319	04:26:01,343	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Age that would have
EDL	04:26:01,343	04:26:07,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I've been where you tap this first execution it be this groundbreaking event and everybody would be appalled and just
EDL	04:26:07,231	04:26:13,631	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Outrage in there be a lot of public shaming you be sir Joshua Reynolds all over again in the media would be there but of course only to cover
EDL	04:26:13,631	04:26:17,727	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know the human depravity of the people that showed up to watch this acting are there any famous ones
EDL	04:26:20,031	04:26:20,799	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What happens
EDL	04:26:22,079	04:26:26,943	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	With the next one in a war on public execution number three since the government reinstated public X
EDL	04:26:26,943	04:26:27,455	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Vacations
EDL	04:26:28,223	04:26:30,271	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I bet by then things start to
EDL	04:26:30,783	04:26:31,551	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Melo
EDL	04:26:32,063	04:26:36,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And once the public pressure relaxes cuz these things are much more common I bet the entire
EDL	04:26:37,183	04:26:37,951	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Media
EDL	04:26:38,463	04:26:39,743	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Approach shifts and we're not
EDL	04:26:39,743	04:26:40,511	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Looking at
EDL	04:26:40,511	04:26:42,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd any longer in
EDL	04:26:42,303	04:26:46,143	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Shaming them to the rest of the country we are in fact playing to that crowd
EDL	04:26:46,655	04:26:48,959	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I doing some man on the street interviews
EDL	04:26:48,959	04:26:52,031	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You so did you know the person who's being broken on the wheel today here in Vegas
EDL	04:26:53,055	04:26:55,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I realize that example sounds more like a dystopian
EDL	04:26:55,871	04:27:00,223	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Movie script than it does any sort of reality but then I have to keep reminding myself listen
EDL	04:27:00,735	04:27:01,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We can get
EDL	04:27:01,759	04:27:04,319	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hundreds of people in the world like 500 people died
EDL	04:27:04,319	04:27:06,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	It showed up to Ted Bundy's
EDL	04:27:06,111	04:27:08,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Execution when he was put in the electric chair
EDL	04:27:08,927	04:27:11,231	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Hundreds of people will show up to these things
EDL	04:27:11,231	04:27:13,791	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	When they're happening behind Prison Walls
EDL	04:27:13,791	04:27:14,815	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Any can't see anything
EDL	04:27:15,839	04:27:19,167	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Imagine how many more would show up if they could if the
EDL	04:27:19,167	04:27:22,751	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Person conducting the execution said this guy is so bad that just has one time
EDL	04:27:22,751	04:27:24,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	We're going to move the execution back out in public
EDL	04:27:25,055	04:27:29,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Can you imagine in the modern era how quickly that would spread on social media
EDL	04:27:30,431	04:27:32,991	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Do you think you can get that 500 people that were there
EDL	04:27:33,503	04:27:36,063	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To see an execution that they couldn't see
EDL	04:27:36,575	04:27:38,111	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You think that would
EDL	04:27:38,111	04:27:41,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Suelto something keeps could you beat the 20000 people that showed up
EDL	04:27:42,207	04:27:44,767	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	To the last public execution in the United States
EDL	04:27:45,279	04:27:46,303	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And if you could
EDL	04:27:46,815	04:27:52,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What does that tell you in terms of Trends right we could still pack of moon just as well as we could have in the 1930
EDL	04:27:55,007	04:27:57,055	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	What's it going to be an interesting human experiment
EDL	04:27:57,567	04:27:59,871	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I tend to think and again my
EDL	04:27:59,871	04:28:01,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Opinion on this
EDL	04:28:01,151	04:28:01,919	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Just simply personal
EDL	04:28:02,687	04:28:03,711	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I tend to think that
EDL	04:28:04,223	04:28:09,087	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Maybe some of us are hardwired definitively one way or the other right give me my
EDL	04:28:09,087	04:28:12,415	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Eye pain and suffering fictionalized cuz that's how I take it best
EDL	04:28:12,927	04:28:18,047	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And other people that they know I want to see it real here I wanted to be real when I read my history books and no
EDL	04:28:18,047	04:28:24,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	But yes this historical figure suffered this way or I wanted Reno like I want to see it live I think there are people who are hardwired
EDL	04:28:24,447	04:28:27,007	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	One way the other than that I think there's a lot of us there probably
EDL	04:28:27,519	04:28:28,543	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You know could go either way
EDL	04:28:29,823	04:28:34,687	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Much more likely to be influenced by the culture we grow up in the times and what not I mean
EDL	04:28:34,687	04:28:40,575	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You might not be hardwired to like watching animals chew people up in the arena but hey if everybody's going anyway
EDL	04:28:40,575	04:28:45,695	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And I like the food there it's kind of fun and I have fun life I mean I think there's a lot of people that you know go along with
EDL	04:28:45,695	04:28:46,207	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	The crowd
EDL	04:28:47,487	04:28:49,279	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	So whereas we
EDL	04:28:49,279	04:28:53,887	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	In this particular era are going along with the crowd by being naturally empathetic
EDL	04:28:53,887	04:28:56,447	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	If the crowd changed or the times changed
EDL	04:28:56,959	04:29:00,287	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	I think it's a lot of people in the mushy middle that could go either way
EDL	04:29:00,287	04:29:05,151	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	And people that would never be caught dead in a live public execution today how gauche
EDL	04:29:05,919	04:29:07,967	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Might change their minds if you know
EDL	04:29:08,735	04:29:09,759	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	You got trendy again
EDL	04:29:10,527	04:29:11,039	| dchha61_BLITZ_Painfotainment |	Leica
