EDL	00:01:02,720	00:01:07,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bliss like that I mean I think we probably all have pretty similar things at least it
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:10,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The top of the list when we met wouldn't loved ones
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:11,680	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Be on that list right near the top
EDL	00:01:12,960	00:01:13,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I would be willing to die

EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Likely something on that list near the top would be possession
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:28,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things of one kind or another
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:29,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Land

EDL	00:01:58,528	00:02:00,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean we're something like freedom
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:07,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's funny because if you go and look
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,512	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All throughout human history
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Slogans like New Hampshire state motto

EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:15,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You going when you look at my
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:16,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like revolutionary France
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:23,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And all these other movements throughout history and some form of Give me liberty or give me death Live Free or Die is on the
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:25,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	List of people willing to give their own lives
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:28,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Based on the idea than an unfree life isn't worth living
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:37,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So willing to die for a concept for the concept that means everything when you talked about your day-to-day life and we should play
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:40,000	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Point out that freedom is always meant different things to do
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,512	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Different people
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:42,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's been different things in different
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:43,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Eras
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:47,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The two big definitions you run into is the obvious
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	1 freedom is
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	My right to personal
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Control in autonomy and sovereignty
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The other one that was a political sword
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Freedom
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That says as long
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:02,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Has no outside people or power or state or entity is controlling
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:02,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	My Pitt
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then we're free we may live in
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:05,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Dictatorship
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:06,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That kind of thing
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:08,416	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So Freedom involves
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:10,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Freedom from outside control
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tell me change the

EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	4

EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:23,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What time in the twentieth century look at how many people
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In order to
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Protect their societies freedom

EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:41,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To deal

EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:54,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That General Okoye New Hampshire state motto Live Free or Die
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the Revolutionary War
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For example
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He wrote that phrase decades after the war
EDL	00:05:02,335	00:05:04,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And in total freedom and
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:04,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Safety
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now I have no doubt he would have been willing
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To give his life
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the service of what was

EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	During the Revolutionary War
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you can also take some comfort in the idea
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That he wasn't going to have to give much more than
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean the
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	British were not going to come in today

EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's a different kind
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's genocide
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And people still deal with that

EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Basically means war the way the ROM
EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:17,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Total War
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Legal definition I got from one place in
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bellum romanum is all out War without restraint
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:27,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As the Romans practiced it against groups they considered to be barbaric
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And let's understand that the British crown

EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can treat them the way
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:43,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Rome treated Barbarian
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:49,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Often times with what we would call today

EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:51,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Often time
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:58,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With choices unlike the Jews and the Gypsies in the second world war Holocaust
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Often times the choice was

EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And accept

EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:11,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And see everyone
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Either killed or sold into slavery
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:17,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What passes for a city in your culture destroyed
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And maybe your culture itself

EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But I see A Certain Romance
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Doom sort of Rome
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:37,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The same sort of thing you see with the Native Americans sometimes will you watch this story that is a calamity
EDL	00:09:37,791	00:09:38,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it times
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:42,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Behavior of the human beings in it make a tear roll down your cheek
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:44,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Touch something deep in your soul
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Those were willing to say

EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:48,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you'll kill all of us or

EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Subjugate ourselves to you
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But we're going to
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:57,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Take the chance here and try to Live Free or Die
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The only one that sees the obvious
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Entertainment
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The compelling nature
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Green situation
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A choice like that
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put human beings into because it's a Hollywood
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cliche isn't it
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Storytelling
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A recurring theme
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean it would be very easy to tell this to
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Story and turn it into Brave
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:26,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'll try very hard not to do that
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it's an old theme and it's easy to become
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Soda
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In Norwich
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	2x overtime
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:35,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So numb
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:36,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The other problem
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:43,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These situations that were talking about the reality of them is actually so intense and so extreme
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:49,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Any portrayal or discussion of them can't help but somehow minimize or trivialize or height
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:51,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a different way for entertainment.
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the people were actually going through
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I always try to think of myself
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Imagine if that list that we mentioned a minute ago
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Genocide list
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:03,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Imagine if only one of those things was going to happen to me
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In my cushy life here
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:09,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where I'm in no danger or say having my culture wiped out
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can't even imagine what they
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That would mean
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Blue jeans illegal
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:23,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	No more iPhones and they start destroying the Christian religion I mean I'm not quite sure in the modern sense in the United States where I live
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean you can't even get your mind.
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:29,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe in some weird
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Emotionally voyeuristic
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's what
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The kind of intriguing
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As I've always said
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:39,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can't imagine dealing
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With yourself
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:46,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The story that I would like to use to highlight that has a very familiar ring
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because we've seen this movie historically speaking before
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:51,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Over and over
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Again

EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:57,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's the story of a European power
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:11:59,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Using it
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Technological and civilizational advantages
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To dominate

EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:08,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And colonize the land
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of a tribe
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Less sophisticated politically speaking tribal people

EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obviously over the last 500 or so years
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:26,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We've seen this movie play out in the Americas
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would European colonization and Conquest
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We saw play on an Africa to same thing
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The difference here
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:38,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is it the people the tribal people
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:44,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On the receiving end of European conquest and colonization are themselves European
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this didn't happen a couple hundred years ago
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This happened more than 2000
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:57,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the reason I wanted to talk about this story as opposed to any of the others with similar themes
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because this is one of the times where you
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Look at the
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Odds
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you say there's a halfway decent chance here
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:10,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the people on the receiving end
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the European colonization
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To fight back
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:15,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And when
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:21,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Native Americans for example never had a chance never a chance ever
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:26,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If for no other reason and there's a lot of other ones just a disease alone
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you're about to have it
EDL	00:13:27,935	00:13:29,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A hemispheric civilizational
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:32,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Conflict in a between the New World in the old world
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You don't want to lose
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:41,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe I mean I saw an estimate that's at 98% I think that's got to be high but let's just say 85
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:45,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	5% of the entire population of the hemisphere to disease right off the bat
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There are bunch of experts who
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:56,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Try to explain what the situation must have been liking these tribes in the center of the Americas you know there were still Untouched by
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What European
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Contact
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What the disease is managed to find them
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:03,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we're just like shell shocked
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Traumatized
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:11,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Remnants by the time Europeans got to the interior
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:16,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Diseases like a magic imagine the Bubonic plague in Europe but worse from the Middle Ages
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:22,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I see numbers that say that in the end say 1800 they were estimating what the
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:26,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tribal population of North America was
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:32,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	No not the North America that constituted the United States in that area back that because that was just a sliver compared to today
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:35,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the native population throughout
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In from the Pacific to the Atlantic
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:38,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what's now the United States
EDL	00:14:39,615	00:14:41,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some estimates are as low as 600000 people
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a pretty unfair fight right there isn't it
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not just that as we all know
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's not
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	600000 people
EDL	00:14:51,135	00:14:57,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Smooshed into one state right next to the 13 colonies when the United States becomes a state right it's not like the US
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:15:02,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Play Saturday with 600,000 native next door they're spread out in small groups
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know the width and breadth of the territory
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Able to be picked off
EDL	00:15:05,983	00:15:09,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Divided and conquered one by one over time which is what happened
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:13,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean it still blows my mind to realize
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:18,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How small the number of Native American warriors there are
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:19,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fighting
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:23,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Against the encroachment of manifest destiny at any time
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:30,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And how well they did based on how small they were would you know if you get 1500 North American Native American
EDL	00:15:30,303	00:15:31,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Warriors
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In one place at one time that's a sizable Force
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:41,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The highest estimates I've ever seen for the largest Native American Force of Warriors Everest
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:44,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is between 4 and 5000 people
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:47,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A Little Bighorn why do people think that's the biggest battle that's
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The largest numbers I've ever seen or just under 5000
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:51,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	5000
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:54,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the Spanish
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:16:00,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Conquistadors found the Aztec empire the Aztecs could raise tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of War
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:01,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Warriors
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obviously there's a different state organizational system which plays into the store
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Dory
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:09,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the same time it's also
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:13,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	First Contact basically in the disease had not had time to take hold
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:17,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then fast forward a couple hundred years
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:18,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And all of a sudden you go from
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:21,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hundreds of thousands of Warriors Maybe
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To 1500 being a sizable Force
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And look how long it took the US to deal with that
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And to be fair
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:33,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It wasn't like United States had a hundred thousand people against 1500 native
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The forces of the European
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Powers fighting in the new world were very small also
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can 1500
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:47,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And US forces fighting these Native American tribes half of which might be local militia that was not uncommon either
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:54,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Even in the big Wars like the American Revolution the numbers are smaller than you would think I mean again
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:56,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	25000 would be a ton in America
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you wonder how the US
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:04,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or before then the British and French explorers would have fared
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:08,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If they were exploring the interior say of North America and They Came Upon some
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:15,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	People that had not been impacted by the disease I mean what if the Aztec empire instead of being in the middle of Mexico
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:20,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Was on the opposite side of the Mississippi to be running to buy the Europeans at some point
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or better yet
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:24,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Let's make it an interesting combat
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:26,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Let's put ancient Gaul
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On the western side of the Mississippi
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:34,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is regardless what the Romans called an area about the size of Texas
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:36,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the ancient world
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The comprised
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:43,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well most of Northwestern Europe modern-day France a lot of Belgium Western strip of Germany's of a Switzerland in
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:45,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	During one part of this.
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Northern Italy
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:52,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Estimate of the ancient population range from 3 to 7 million people
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:56,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm a kind of armies that they could put in the field
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:18:02,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well let's just say I'd imagine they're pretty close to the kind of numbers that the Aztecs probably could put
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The field
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:05,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An army of forty or fifty thousand
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:06,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Garlic
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:07,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Peoples
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	5 or 10000 of which might be mounted
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's Not Unusual
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:15,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Imagine imagine those armies
EDL	00:18:16,191	00:18:22,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Better used to brushing aside $1,500 maybe on a really bad day 2508 is having two.
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Chat with 40 or 50 thousand
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of them instead
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	No I have no doubt
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:31,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Given the technological
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:37,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Advantages and more importantly these State organizational advantages of a place like the early United States
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:42,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Before than the British in the fight I have no doubt they would conquer this
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:44,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Latter-Day version of gall at some point
EDL	00:18:46,655	00:18:47,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But I wonder if they are
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:49,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Concrete as quickly as Caesar did
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the real thing
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:53,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	2000 years before
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:56,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if they couldn't
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What does that say
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Rather than
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Attributed to any

EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	European or American forces in North America
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe it says how
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Incredibly awesome Julius Caesar
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:18,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bellossom doesn't mean good
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:21,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:24,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Up until relatively recently
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What she did
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:27,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Golf
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Will celebrate
EDL	00:19:30,687	00:19:31,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And in fact going back
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	100 or 200 years and they are aware
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:41,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The great Powers especially the great powers of Europe are celebrating the idea of doing exactly what Julius Caesar
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:45,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the Romans were doing to the tribal peoples north of them in their own era
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:48,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They tended to see Caesar as the good guy
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Story I want to talk about today
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is narrated by Julius Caesar
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:00,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's a little like hearing the Star Wars saga
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As Told by
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:02,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Darth Vader

EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The same time of course
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:23,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What Caesar was suggesting and we'll get to that in a minute was that they needed a preemptive War
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,136	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because he Lions could attack at any time so it gets murky quickly

EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All over you are more dangerous
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They are
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:44,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Vikings a thousand years before there are Vikings and I don't mean in the in the pirate like sense I mean
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the European Barbarian stereotype sense
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:54,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the Vikings are like version 3.4 something because that the Celts are the Alpha version of the Europe
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Northern European Barbarian type
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They exhibit all the typical traits
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:07,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They get crazy and battle supposedly in a fight with enormous amounts of like ferocity
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The geographer strabo said that they are warm at
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The ancient sources also point out that the Celts are Headhunters
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:18,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which is always a
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Little bit unnerving
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:23,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ancient peoples are always more comfortable with head shopping than we are in the modern world
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:27,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in the more settled societies when it was done it was sort of
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:34,464	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They didn't enjoy it they didn't Revel in it they didn't take pride in it it wasn't something you showed off to visitors
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:38,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in the Celtic world according to the ancient sources that were not Celtic
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:44,960	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This was something that was done it only says he's visiting Celtic homes and they want to bring out the heads of slain
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:51,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Enemies you know that they've kept in a chest you know soaked in cedar oil so everything stays nice and pristine and you can still recognize
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:51,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nice the features
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:59,808	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they have found by the way the archaeology has shown that there are these for example pillars
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,112	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I think they find with little cubby holes
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:06,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With skulls still in some of them by the way in little hangers to
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:08,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Do a fix the skull to the back of these things I mean
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:15,680	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This may be a religious thing but to the settled people cutting the heads off people keeping them in and adorning your temples and
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,960	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What not with headset that's just freaky
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:24,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And was even then by the waypost Adonia says he would get used to it after a while but never quite got comfortable
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:27,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With people treating human heads the way some people treat
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:31,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Yeah the antlers of the deer they shot last fall
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:34,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put up on the wall mounted with a name tag underneath
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:35,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To talk to it
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:39,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Always give that great story about that you killed this dude
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,560	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I should also point out that
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Besides the religious significance of the head
EDL	00:26:44,864	00:26:51,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that the the Gauls believed in the theory of reincarnation soda maybe you could call it was simple
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:57,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A major philosophical group in Greece always believed that the Gauls kind of believe that when you die in this world
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You just born into the other one then we done the other one you just born back into this one
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:02,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A correctly
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:06,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that this is part of the reason why they're so Fearless in battle
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:12,000	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because instead of being worried about having your existence not doubting you just you know in Oblivion
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,536	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You just going to be born in the next world
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just to avoid confusion by the way
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because it can be very confusing
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The terms
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gaul and celt
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:27,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are used by the ancient sources in a way where it's impossible not to get everything
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:34,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Archaeologist John Collins has a whole rundown of the various ways you can interpret this the most common ways we were going to do it
EDL	00:27:35,552	00:27:39,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We're going to assume that when we say Celtic Women Celtic people across
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The width and breadth of areas
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:47,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That have Celtic language and culture if we say Galls we specifically mean the Celts in

EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:06,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They might have only been like 6 feet if we could go back in a time machine
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:11,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But if that's five or six inches taller than your average Mediterranean type
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Still like fighting giants and battle isn't it
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:16,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that's what made fighting the Celtic peoples
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:20,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know scary to it's not just their enormous numbers according to the ancient authors
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:27,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Listen if you were in a 21st century Army and I tell you listen we're going to go to battle going to fight another 21st century Army
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:31,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An old by the way everyone in that Army is six inches taller than all of us
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You might think to yourself
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Dang it doesn't sound so good I don't like the sound of that
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the same time you don't you realize
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:44,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	7 foot tall people or whatever they are go down from bullets and she'll fire and bombs just like shorter people do
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:46,464	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're so it's not that big of a deal
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:53,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in the ancient world when you say you're going to fight an army people that is on average five inches taller and proportionately stronger doll
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:56,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All the rest of us when you're doing that in a hand-to-hand sense
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It can make a huge difference
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Celtic people were scary
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:05,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When they had scared Rome before
EDL	00:29:05,152	00:29:05,920	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:10,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All the modern historians point out that this was somehow a scar
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ran through the Roman psyche
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:17,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So that even after the Celts really weren't that dangerous to the Romans anymore
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:20,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They still felt the memory of
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:23,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Lion attacks a long time ago
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I never quite got over them
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:27,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know if you look at Roman history there are a couple of Famous Tate
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:33,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of them is 410 AD right the famous fall of Rome to the Germanic barbarians
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:35,616	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Why do people like to make that.
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:38,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Exclamation point at the end of the Western Roman Empire
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Always debatable of course
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:48,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the reason it's such a big deal is basically wrong with being on a huge winning streak to Joe DiMaggio hitting streak
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:50,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know ancient
EDL	00:29:51,232	00:29:56,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Runs in the sense that Rome hadn't been sacked by a foreign conqueror in almost a thousand years right
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:59,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a pretty big deal in the ancient world
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The last time though that they were stacked
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It was these Celtic people that did it
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:08,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Roman never forgot it and is a famous phrase that sort of
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:15,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sums up the whole. And I've always wondered if the ancient author writing when the Roman Empire was around take
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:19,136	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Taking everybody's but didn't have a Sly reason for putting it in there
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pointing out that
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:25,536	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if the Cavs can say that back then we can live by those same rules the line was
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:27,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	5 victus
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or why we
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:31,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The translation usually

EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:38,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because that's what happened to the Romans famously
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:42,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I had a Forever After remembered as an inauspicious day in Rome

EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:48,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The first Celtic Army
EDL	00:30:48,064	00:30:51,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the Romans had ever encountered supposedly in their history
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:56,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bore down on the city itself and we're coming at speed
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:58,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Jerome completely unprepared to meet them
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,728	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bunch of different ancient historians who written an account of what happened here
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:11,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Livi is of course the most famous most romantic and goes into the most detail about
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,176	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Interesting battle where
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:21,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And I love ancient battles and then when you try to recreate what happened it's kind of impossible any people do their best but the physics
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which of the whole thing or just not understood
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	00:31:23,904	00:31:27,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ideas and Concepts go in and out of fashion as to what really happened
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But there are elements
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:34,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Humanity on an individual level
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:36,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things like
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Beer
EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:38,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And intimidation
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:41,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And very hard to quantify
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sides of a human beings that
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:48,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A part of when you take those things collectively right what is fear do when you magnify it
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:51,808	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Yuan to a whole group of people as opposed to one individual
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:57,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is the part of human history that make history hard to turn into any kind of hard science
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:59,488	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How do you quantify things like that
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:03,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How do you say that one side in a battle
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:04,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's more scared
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:07,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then another side in the battle and that's what made the diff
EDL	00:32:08,448	00:32:09,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or that one side was tougher
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:11,776	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that's what made the difference
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:12,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is clearly
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The ancient writers and let's be honest historians writing
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Even 1500 years ago had no problem saying this
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:20,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But when you need evidence to prove it
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:26,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There are certain parts of humanity infused into history that you just can't quantify
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:32,512	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean the most logical way if you want to follow the sources anyway especially Livy
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:35,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To view this battle that's about to happen when the Romans in the
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic armies first Clash
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Supposedly
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:42,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is to say that the Romans were terrified
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:49,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then 2300 plus years later it actually seeps through
EDL	00:32:49,664	00:32:50,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know can you imagine
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:56,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That you can walk up to one of them things they listen as a friend as you are it'll be it'll be recorded in people
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:33:00,672	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Thousands of years from now will know how scared you are of this alien people coming down
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:01,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	North
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:04,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Aliens are keyword to see you add the fact that these are
EDL	00:33:05,280	00:33:06,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obviously big people
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:13,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the entire look and feel of them had an alien quality that just is scary and understand Barberry
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:14,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are always scary
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To settled societies
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,616	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not just scary sometimes a little sexy
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,176	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can see styles that catch on
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like in Rome the start wearing those tight German pants
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:29,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the barbarians where there's a certain element to then that's a little Clint Eastwood at times
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you know I like to think that there's a barbarian scale
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:36,000	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	12101 being most barbaric
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:39,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can being one step away from being a Roman with a mustache you know
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:43,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's what depends on where you are
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:49,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The really cool barbarians walking around Roman leather jackets you know they're there more like a nine or a 10 on the scale if they get
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,384	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Drunk to get hurt somebody but otherwise they pretty well-behaved
EDL	00:33:52,384	00:33:56,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You take one or two and put them in there and they're going to be like a bull in a china shop
EDL	00:33:56,736	00:34:00,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that in 390 or 387 BCE
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:05,440	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is what the Romans are facing on the opposite side of the battlefield and by the time they get there
EDL	00:34:05,440	00:34:11,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	According to Levy the battlefields already swarming with these people so you don't even have time to get your lines all straightened everything all figure
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're not in a Felix brace ourselves
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:20,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You are essentially having an encounter bottle with it with a Celtic Army heading down toward Rome and it's about
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:21,056	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	7 miles away from the city
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:23,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In all fairness
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is not the Roman Empire or even the
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:32,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Romans of the Julius Caesar are that we normally think of those terrible badasses that are absolutely frightful
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:34,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is a militia Army
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:37,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And at this battle it's also about half of it is just a
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:38,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Citizen
EDL	00:34:38,976	00:34:40,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Citizen DeSoto
EDL	00:34:40,256	00:34:44,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Raising so you have your militia Farmers you do all your fighting for you anyway and then you have
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:46,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Townsfolk and other people
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:50,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it's an emergency and it happened so quickly there was no time
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:52,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They resist rmb hastily
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:57,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Rome at this time is merely a city in Italy probably the predominant
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they just had a
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A long conflict
EDL	00:35:00,224	00:35:02,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With an arch enemy Etruscan City
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:05,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That they had just recently defeated and it was only like
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:11,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are 10 miles from the city of Rome so you can see the small-scale they're operating on in this era
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But this early Roman army of
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:14,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Militia and
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:15,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Soul of a citizen
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Contingent as well
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:21,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Meet this Army of huge tall

EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we are told it takes

EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:58,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I know one knows how many people fought there either

EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:14,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It may be 30 miles around the city somewhere in that area
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:19,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That means so this is a really small scale very early version of Ron they probably didn't have too many soldiers to defend them
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:23,680	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The problem is is regardless of how many of those soldiers there were

EDL	00:39:12,640	00:39:14,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A night having passed without action
EDL	00:39:14,944	00:39:18,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The gulls found their Lust For Fighting much abated
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:21,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At no time had they met with any serious resistance
EDL	00:39:21,088	00:39:23,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it was no need now to take the City by assault
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:28,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When therefore they entered on the following day it was coolly and calmly enough
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:30,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The colline gate was open
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:33,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they made their Way to the Forum
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:36,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Looking with curiosity at the temples and at the Citadel
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:38,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The only place to give an impression of a city at War
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:43,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They left a reasonably strong guard in case of attack from the Fortified Heights
EDL	00:39:43,872	00:39:45,920	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then dispersed in search of plunder
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:47,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Finding the streets empty
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:53,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Crowds of them broke into the first houses they came to others went farther afield
EDL	00:39:53,344	00:39:58,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Presuming supposedly that buildings more remote from The Forum would offer richer prizes
EDL	00:39:58,720	00:40:01,792	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they're the very silence and Solitude made them uneasy
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:04,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Separated as they were from their companions
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:07,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And suggested the possibility of a trap
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So they soon return
EDL	00:40:08,448	00:40:09,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Keeping close together
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:11,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To The Neighbourhood at The Forum
EDL	00:40:11,776	00:40:14,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Here they found the humbler houses locked and barred
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What dimensions of the nobility open
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:19,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The former they were ready to break into
EDL	00:40:19,968	00:40:23,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it was a long time before they could bring themselves to enter the ladder
EDL	00:40:23,040	00:40:24,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Something akin to all
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Held them back
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:26,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It what met their gaze
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:29,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Those figures seated in the open courtyard
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:32,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The robes and decorations
EDL	00:40:32,256	00:40:34,560	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	August Beyond Reckoning
EDL	00:40:34,560	00:40:39,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Majesty expressed in those grave calm eyes like the Majesty of God
EDL	00:40:39,936	00:40:42,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They might have been statues in some holy place
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:43,776	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And for a while
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The garlic Warriors stood entranced
EDL	00:40:46,336	00:40:47,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then on an impulse
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:51,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of them touch the beard of a certain Marcus Poppy rhoeas
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:57,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It was long as was the fashion of those days and the Roman struck him on the head with his Ivory staff
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:40:58,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That was the beginning

EDL	00:41:01,952	00:41:04,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the others were butchered where they sat
EDL	00:41:04,256	00:41:06,560	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From that moment no mercy was shown
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Houses were ransacked in the empty shell set on fire
EDL	00:41:10,912	00:41:11,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote

EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:34,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The problem
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Probably a lot more
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:40,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What a lot of beat writer to write about the Romans
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's quite a bit pointed
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:41,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How did they have this
EDL	00:43:42,975	00:43:48,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Inability to accept defeat and humiliation and where has most people probably would
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Write something off and move along with their lives the Romans
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:54,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Faster and focus on things and remember

EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:10,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just supposedly this first Celtic army they ever fought at the Battle of the Aaliyah
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then seeing their City sacked by them
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:14,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By the way I should point out because I think it's
EDL	00:44:14,975	00:44:15,743	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cool
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:18,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the old idea that this is a try
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:25,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic people that has shown up the sacrum is challenged by a lot of historians and there's people on both sides who said
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:29,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just at the evidence shows that this may have been a group of hired mercenary
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:32,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It has been hired by
EDL	00:44:32,895	00:44:35,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A ruler on the modern-day
EDL	00:44:35,711	00:44:37,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Island of Sicily to fight with him
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:44,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that Rome was just on the way and what the heck will second pick up a couple extra bucks to eat on the way in a while we're doing it
EDL	00:44:44,415	00:44:48,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So this idea that what we have here is a try maybe wrong and
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:53,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's kind of important because when seizures conquering Gaul hundreds of years later
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:56,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Don't be talking about yeah that's right over there those are the ones that
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:57,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Affect our country
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:45:00,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	340 years ago

EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:07,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unfortunately not just for the Celts before every
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:13,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's worth pointing out that you know in 390 win this battle happens to the Celtic peoples of Europe are very powerful
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:15,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they're all over the place
EDL	00:45:16,159	00:45:18,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And who they are is a great question
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:25,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Once upon a time when it was easy to classify these things in ways that sounded easy to understand but now seem totally ridiculous
EDL	00:45:25,119	00:45:26,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They were a race
EDL	00:45:27,423	00:45:31,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celts were a race like Anglo-Saxons were a race writing all these
EDL	00:45:31,519	00:45:34,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You divide the world into the different racial group
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:37,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These are the yellow people in these are the black people in these other white pill
EDL	00:45:37,151	00:45:39,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean a hundred years ago you open up history book and that's how they do it
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:47,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As the complexities mounted and that whole way of looking at things went out of fashion 50 years ago 40 years ago the counter and

EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:58,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like everyone else would have insinuated most of the time that these Celtic people were probably all related by blood
EDL	00:45:58,911	00:46:02,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Those people that sacked Rome in 390 BCE
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:05,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are the ancestors of the people in Ireland
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:07,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	500 years later or today
EDL	00:46:09,407	00:46:10,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nowadays
EDL	00:46:10,431	00:46:14,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a pretty tough argument to make given the way it scene
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:18,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Amongst most of the experts and I don't mean to speak for them because they're and then just Celtic studies stuff is
EDL	00:46:19,391	00:46:25,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fascinatingly debatable and the passion with which the experts go out of this fun to watch from the sidelines
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:28,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it means you have to be really careful and there are a lot of people out
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:33,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You are very passionate about their view of who a caliph is
EDL	00:46:33,471	00:46:34,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And who is not a celt
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:37,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I love the way
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:39,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Barry cunliffe we mentioned earlier
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:42,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I push it because it gets me out of all kinds of trouble to say it
EDL	00:46:42,431	00:46:46,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The way he said it he said account is a person who believes
EDL	00:46:46,015	00:46:47,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Him or herself to be Celtic
EDL	00:46:49,343	00:46:52,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I thought of a t-shirt that I should Market I'm going to make it green of course
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:54,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And I'm going to say
EDL	00:46:55,743	00:46:56,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:58,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's not a nationality it's a way of life
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:03,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the point is the same the modern view of a lot of the experts on this and then there were
EDL	00:47:03,935	00:47:07,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Archaeologist linguist historian everything all kind of look at this in
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:07,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Different
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:10,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is that what we're looking at here is a culture
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:12,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Shared culture and similar language Maybe
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like blue jeans
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:17,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You don't rock and roll and beer drinking I mean
EDL	00:47:17,759	00:47:19,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's something that spread

EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:23,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:27,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Foundation of which might have been in place since the last ice age if you think about it
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:31,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then overtime succeeding waves
EDL	00:47:31,327	00:47:37,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A people and immigrants an in-memory and all that adds layers of spice to the original but when they do DNA test today
EDL	00:47:37,727	00:47:43,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's hard to not find lots of people who have been there since lots of DNA strands that have been there for a very long time much earlier
EDL	00:47:44,383	00:47:48,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did the Celtic era in history in fact maybe you could look at the entire Celtic.

EDL	00:48:03,327	00:48:05,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And after Caesar is mortally wounded

EDL	00:48:18,687	00:48:20,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you look at a map of where

EDL	00:48:30,975	00:48:31,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some kind of
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:34,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Terrible ethnic cleansing

EDL	00:49:39,583	00:49:42,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Most of these accounts come from the same guy supposed
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:43,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The eyewitness account

EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:39,743	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they also make it there practice by artificial means
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:43,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To increase the distinguishing color which nature is giving it
EDL	00:50:43,071	00:50:46,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For they are always washing their hair in lime water
EDL	00:50:46,143	00:50:51,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they pull it back from the forehead to the top of the head and back to the nape of the neck
EDL	00:50:51,007	00:50:54,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the result that their appearance is like that of satyrs

EDL	00:50:55,359	00:50:58,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:50:59,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it differs in no respect
EDL	00:51:00,223	00:51:01,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From the main of horses
EDL	00:51:01,759	00:51:05,087	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some of them shave their beard but others let it grow a little
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:06,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the noble shave their cheeks
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:09,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they let the mustache grow until it covers the mouth
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:10,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:14,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you haven't looked at the wonderful art
EDL	00:51:14,559	00:51:19,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pergamene art that includes this figure called the dying Gaul go take a look at it cuz it's beautiful
EDL	00:51:20,191	00:51:26,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it describes sort of maybe a stereotype but maybe not the classic look of these people the Warriors and
EDL	00:51:26,591	00:51:28,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Anyway it's just described by diodorus
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:30,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They look like
EDL	00:51:31,199	00:51:37,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Punk rockers first of all with the haircut and you have to imagine the bleach blond hair that he just described there cuz that's what
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:40,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put the lime water would have done with bleached it like bleach blonde hair and if you've ever had
EDL	00:51:41,439	00:51:46,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like I have before the bleach blonde hair gets all horse mating like after a while
EDL	00:51:46,559	00:51:52,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So this figure in the artist sitting there with like wounds in its side and remember it's statue stone color so you have no color
EDL	00:51:52,959	00:51:57,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you can see the blood dripping down and he's holding his wounds in the broken he gets a broken sword by his side
EDL	00:51:58,335	00:52:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's also got a mustache though that's not very Punk of the time
EDL	00:52:01,407	00:52:04,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the punk hair cut the mustache and the build is interesting because
EDL	00:52:04,991	00:52:08,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know what's the difference between the modern weightlifting muscles today
EDL	00:52:08,575	00:52:11,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the life natural muscles but he's muscular
EDL	00:52:11,903	00:52:17,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But also sort of sinewy and long and there was actually the ancient sources say that
EDL	00:52:17,279	00:52:19,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At least in the. We're talking about
EDL	00:52:19,583	00:52:21,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The a lot of these Celtic tribes had rules
EDL	00:52:21,631	00:52:23,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they would fine Warriors if your belly
EDL	00:52:24,447	00:52:28,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Drooped over your belt line so they were required soda to be in shape supposedly
EDL	00:52:30,079	00:52:33,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This guy is heroic Lee new does it's called
EDL	00:52:33,919	00:52:40,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's hard to figure out cuz the Romans like portraying barbarians is heroically new but they sometimes by portraying themselves
EDL	00:52:40,319	00:52:40,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ugly nude
EDL	00:52:41,599	00:52:43,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's hard to figure out what to Convention and what's real
EDL	00:52:43,903	00:52:47,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this may have had religious overtones or other things

EDL	00:52:56,447	00:52:58,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic warriors especially
EDL	00:52:58,239	00:53:02,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Select the groups of Celtic Warrior stripping off all their clothes

EDL	00:53:07,711	00:53:13,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Armleder anklet or something I guess you would describe it so he's got no clothes on he's got the punk haircut he's got the mustache
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:16,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He looks about 6ft 5
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:18,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	About 200 pounds of raw muscle and you know

EDL	00:53:19,999	00:53:20,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the talk around it
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:23,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm sorry visually it's
EDL	00:53:24,095	00:53:29,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Striking and Cool Whip and if not naked then you get those wonderful Celtic Fashions right supposedly the stripe
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:31,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Clothing the check
EDL	00:53:31,519	00:53:32,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Clothing
EDL	00:53:32,287	00:53:34,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We would call today the Plaid clothing
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:38,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They are wonderfully colorful
EDL	00:53:38,687	00:53:43,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Interesting cool people add to that the women she got the Celtic women
EDL	00:53:43,039	00:53:46,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Once again we get absolutely shafted by the fact that
EDL	00:53:46,111	00:53:52,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These Celts did not leave a historical written record that we could get their views on things and historian

EDL	00:53:53,791	00:53:55,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Try to find any little piece that might
EDL	00:53:55,839	00:54:00,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Help us to understand their personality better in their own words as opposed to hearing from people
EDL	00:54:01,983	00:54:04,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Often despise them certainly belittled them
EDL	00:54:05,055	00:54:08,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But I mean they thought for example in the Mediterranean the Celtic women were beautiful
EDL	00:54:10,175	00:54:12,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But I guess you could say maybe the way the
EDL	00:54:12,223	00:54:15,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You describe them today or their attitudes were that they were also
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:16,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Uppity
EDL	00:54:16,575	00:54:21,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And somewhat ferocious a memory I think sometimes in the descriptions it reminds me of the old stereotype
EDL	00:54:22,463	00:54:23,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's an old one now.
EDL	00:54:23,999	00:54:30,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Housewife in the henpecked husband in the housewife was kind of Burley and had a rolling pin in her hand would smack the husband upside the head
EDL	00:54:30,399	00:54:30,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sometimes with it
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:34,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Among some of the people out there that
EDL	00:54:34,751	00:54:39,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are sort of that that people that think of the Countess of a new age kind of thing there there's a
EDL	00:54:39,359	00:54:43,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A view out there that women were equal to men in these societies and Barry cunliffe among others
EDL	00:54:44,479	00:54:45,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Said that they miss
EDL	00:54:45,759	00:54:46,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Perception
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:48,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because they're only
EDL	00:54:48,319	00:54:53,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	More free than women in the Mediterranean are for example Greek and Roman women by comparison
EDL	00:54:54,719	00:55:01,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So maybe a bit uppity by Greek and Roman standards but that's kind of points out the husband still has the power of life
EDL	00:55:01,119	00:55:02,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Death overs wife
EDL	00:55:02,399	00:55:05,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The law in most of these places allows the wife
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:08,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To be tortured to find out how husband died so
EDL	00:55:08,287	00:55:11,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not exactly equal rights but maybe a bit uppity by
EDL	00:55:12,127	00:55:13,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mediterranean standards
EDL	00:55:13,919	00:55:14,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I will say
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:15,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the
EDL	00:55:15,967	00:55:21,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ancient sources talk about these women is every bit as tall and strong and athletic at the men
EDL	00:55:21,855	00:55:28,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They talked about a society where there's more sexual freedom and these women have more freedom to be what the Greeks and the Romans were
EDL	00:55:28,255	00:55:29,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Consider to be promiscuous
EDL	00:55:32,351	00:55:33,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Certainly there are

EDL	00:55:47,455	00:55:48,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And their stereo
EDL	00:55:49,759	00:55:52,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So if I told you the story about a particular Celtic Woman

EDL	01:19:04,191	01:19:09,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it was long pauses my brain trying to figure out the proper answer to that I said well there's no such thing as magic
EDL	01:19:10,079	01:19:11,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says I know that
EDL	01:19:11,871	01:19:12,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you know that
EDL	01:19:12,895	01:19:16,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the people in the story didn't know that and they believed otherwise
EDL	01:19:16,735	01:19:20,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And because they believe these things to be real and true
EDL	01:19:20,063	01:19:22,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It impacts reality cuz they act upon those beliefs
EDL	01:19:24,927	01:19:31,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Play give me a call at the Tinkerbell effect or something but the idea was similar to because you believe in this as reality ubass
EDL	01:19:31,327	01:19:33,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Your moves and how you behave on that
EDL	01:19:34,399	01:19:35,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if that changes real history
EDL	01:19:38,239	01:19:40,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nonetheless this guy dipika shifts
EDL	01:19:40,543	01:19:46,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Was there to explain to the Romans that a terrible battle have occurred in the deep dark Barbarian country
EDL	01:19:48,223	01:19:53,087	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There must have been thousands upon thousands of these battles throughout history don't you think these ones that happened
EDL	01:19:53,087	01:19:58,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You were great Deeds were performed an amazing things occur but they happened in the Deep darkness of
EDL	01:19:58,463	01:20:02,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Prehistory somewhere between tribal people you don't know anything about him unless somehow
EDL	01:20:02,815	01:20:03,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They come to light
EDL	01:20:04,607	01:20:07,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So there's this battle that you can look up now that exist that's real
EDL	01:20:08,191	01:20:09,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Call the Battle of megiddo Borgata
EDL	01:20:10,495	01:20:16,384	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you know about it because this guy this Druid showed up to explain to the Romans that his people lost that battle
EDL	01:20:17,408	01:20:23,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It was against one of their traditional Celtic enemies and again we think of Native American tribes were there were just tribes
EDL	01:20:23,296	01:20:25,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That were long-standing enemies of
EDL	01:20:25,600	01:20:26,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Each other

EDL	01:20:32,256	01:20:38,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Apache and Comanche when you didn't matter what you did they would Ally with an outside power to go against them rather than
EDL	01:20:39,168	01:20:41,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Reunite with their historic enemies in this case
EDL	01:20:41,728	01:20:45,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It may have been a war that was over trade rights
EDL	01:20:45,824	01:20:49,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I could charge tolls on this area of a river and it's something really been all like that
EDL	01:20:50,176	01:20:51,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in this battle the Celtic tribe

EDL	01:21:02,208	01:21:04,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Certainly some of these tribes
EDL	01:21:04,768	01:21:06,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did Caesar called German
EDL	01:21:06,816	01:21:11,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Let's be honest the Roman ethnographers are little bit sloppy and sometimes they just have their all

EDL	01:21:54,176	01:21:55,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Causing a domino effect
EDL	01:21:55,968	01:21:59,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As they become the neighbors of all the Celtic people around them
EDL	01:21:59,808	01:22:00,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All of a sudden

EDL	01:22:10,304	01:22:11,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And a potential opportunity
EDL	01:22:12,352	01:22:12,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In fact
EDL	01:22:13,632	01:22:16,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's a way of looking at the story in a lot of people do
EDL	01:22:16,448	01:22:19,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That this is Julius Caesar's account
EDL	01:22:19,520	01:22:21,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what's going on in golf
EDL	01:22:21,568	01:22:25,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And making it seem like a destabilize national security threat
EDL	01:22:26,176	01:22:28,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is something that works out in his favor
EDL	01:22:28,736	01:22:32,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If he's trying to build a case for why he should go in
EDL	01:22:32,832	01:22:33,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fictional
EDL	01:22:36,160	01:22:40,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And as far as theories about Wyatt broken in the first place why are they having all this
EDL	01:22:41,280	01:22:44,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Destabilization will Caesar has a theory
EDL	01:22:44,096	01:22:45,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And even though it's impossible to
EDL	01:22:45,888	01:22:46,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Approve
EDL	01:22:47,680	01:22:52,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's one of those lenses that you can look at this whole thing through this rather interesting but it brings up other question
EDL	01:22:54,336	01:22:55,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'd like to point out
EDL	01:22:55,872	01:23:01,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The only reason I'm qualified to discuss this is because I don't have a reputation as a historian to protect
EDL	01:23:01,760	01:23:02,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Every now and then
EDL	01:23:03,296	01:23:05,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mopping historian works out in my favor doesn't it
EDL	01:23:06,880	01:23:07,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case
EDL	01:23:07,648	01:23:09,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It allows me to examine
EDL	01:23:09,696	01:23:14,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things that used to be valid theories once upon a time until they required things like
EDL	01:23:14,816	01:23:16,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know supporting evidence for
EDL	01:23:16,864	01:23:20,704	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For valladares Once Upon a Time in Costa Rica to listen to Caesar said this happened
EDL	01:23:20,704	01:23:21,728	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And without
EDL	01:23:21,728	01:23:25,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Something that makes me think he's a liar I'm going to believe him if you do that
EDL	01:23:25,312	01:23:28,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Here's how you can explain the instability in Gaul
EDL	01:23:28,640	01:23:29,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Remember
EDL	01:23:29,664	01:23:32,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This guy has a vested interest in convincing you
EDL	01:23:33,248	01:23:35,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gall needs his help
EDL	01:23:37,088	01:23:41,440	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the way the story is told by Caesar and other earlier historians
EDL	01:23:42,208	01:23:43,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is that the reason
EDL	01:23:43,744	01:23:50,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Celts are having some problems in that that whole area of Gaul most of which is still outside of Roman control the time
EDL	01:23:50,144	01:23:50,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Having problems
EDL	01:23:51,424	01:23:53,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is because slowly but surely
EDL	01:23:53,984	01:23:56,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Due to the infusion of

EDL	01:38:11,328	01:38:14,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's the likelihood that is Rome becomes more powerful
EDL	01:38:14,656	01:38:17,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It doesn't absorb these tribal areas to their North

EDL	01:38:35,392	01:38:38,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Plausibly play with right and what's the likelihood

EDL	01:38:39,744	01:38:41,280	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans don't absorb

EDL	01:38:51,776	01:38:53,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is so tempting
EDL	01:38:53,312	01:38:56,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesars need is so great at this time

EDL	01:39:25,568	01:39:30,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We know what is the first triumvirate today and essentially what it is is a conspiracy
EDL	01:39:30,944	01:39:33,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the great conspiracies in all world history
EDL	01:39:33,760	01:39:38,112	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It is Caesar and the other two most powerful men in Rome and their
EDL	01:39:38,112	01:39:39,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Allies essentially
EDL	01:39:40,416	01:39:41,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Against the rest of the Roman governor
EDL	01:39:42,720	01:39:49,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they are so powerful and they control so many people and one of these guys in this 3-headed Monsters the richest man in Rome
EDL	01:39:49,120	01:39:51,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He sprayed money everywhere and that makes a huge difference that
EDL	01:39:51,936	01:39:55,776	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By this time. As long as these three men Caesar
EDL	01:39:55,776	01:39:58,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pompey and Crassus agree on something it's going to happen
EDL	01:39:59,616	01:40:01,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All three men want something
EDL	01:40:01,664	01:40:04,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So all three men support each man getting what they want
EDL	01:40:04,992	01:40:07,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What Caesar wants is a chance
EDL	01:40:07,552	01:40:08,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To conquer something
EDL	01:40:09,600	01:40:10,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He is the least
EDL	01:40:11,136	01:40:13,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Grand this time. Of those three people
EDL	01:40:14,464	01:40:18,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He doesn't have a whole lot of military conquest to his record or his name yet
EDL	01:40:19,328	01:40:25,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he owes so much money that one point we're told he's not even allowed to leave Rome the creditors basically grab him
EDL	01:40:25,216	01:40:31,616	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Either you're paying up or you're not going anywhere and Crassus one of the members of the three-headed monster the rich guy comes in and

EDL	01:40:34,944	01:40:36,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We just find a way to get the money
EDL	01:40:36,736	01:40:37,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To pay off the debts
EDL	01:40:38,528	01:40:40,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And also
EDL	01:40:40,064	01:40:42,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To spread it around in Rome
EDL	01:40:42,368	01:40:48,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To make more friends because these politicians and that's what Caesar is there deadly politicians their politician generals
EDL	01:40:48,768	01:40:54,912	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But spreading money around Rome throwing games and all kinds of other things is how you get your name out there and it's a

EDL	01:41:11,808	01:41:14,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the attitude being a somebody going to get that it's going to be us

EDL	01:42:58,816	01:43:02,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To have essentially the war dispatches
EDL	01:43:02,400	01:43:06,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of one of the great commanders of all time I mean you have nothing like this from Alexander the Great
EDL	01:43:06,496	01:43:09,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For example or most of the other people in where's Jenkins cons
EDL	01:43:12,384	01:43:15,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the ones that you can have fun reading today for example
EDL	01:43:15,968	01:43:21,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is if you go read the second world war series as penned by Winston Churchill
EDL	01:43:21,088	01:43:27,488	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You get a similar sort of field because instead of having somebody tell you the story they're basically telling you the story from within the story
EDL	01:43:27,488	01:43:30,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's a lot of I said and then he said to me and then
EDL	01:43:30,048	01:43:34,912	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean it's a completely different way to view history you know it's completely biased mean Churchill even said
EDL	01:43:34,912	01:43:38,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I know history shall treat me kindly cuz I should be writing that history
EDL	01:43:38,496	01:43:40,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well that's what Caesar doing to
EDL	01:43:41,568	01:43:47,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of the parts that will screw you up the most if you never read it before is he refers to himself 99% of the time
EDL	01:43:47,968	01:43:48,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm in the third person
EDL	01:43:48,992	01:43:50,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar Caesar did that
EDL	01:43:51,552	01:43:52,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's a little strange but
EDL	01:43:53,088	01:43:55,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you understand and read several books
EDL	01:43:55,904	01:44:02,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just on that book and it's fascinating the way they tear it apart and and look at all the angles cuz Caesars playing three-dimensional chess

EDL	01:44:18,688	01:44:24,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just based on the way Caesars using the Latin language she may have been writing it may have been political purpose
EDL	01:44:25,856	01:44:27,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because instead of writing Maybe
EDL	01:44:27,648	01:44:30,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For the aristocracy of Rome in the power Brokers in the Senate
EDL	01:44:31,232	01:44:36,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar was a popular he was one of these people that made his political name supposedly appealing

EDL	01:50:28,352	01:50:34,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Places necessarily and Caesar is creating boundaries so that he can come to Natural extensions of them and stop
EDL	01:50:34,752	01:50:38,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean it's all very interesting but the point is is that a procedure says with a grain of salt

EDL	01:50:59,584	01:51:03,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	East 350 thousand people or more that Caesar says

EDL	01:51:37,472	01:51:43,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But a couple of modern-day is doing some interesting way of looking at it kind of comparing it to the way you would have compared

EDL	01:51:54,624	01:51:57,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Migration take a longer period of time
EDL	01:51:57,184	01:51:59,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So instead of having like one Army
EDL	01:51:59,232	01:52:00,512	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Moving around you have
EDL	01:52:01,024	01:52:05,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Groups of people migrating in and the way Caesar tells the story it sounds more like
EDL	01:52:07,424	01:52:13,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now these are it should be pointed out probably heavily armed migrants so let's not make

EDL	01:52:16,384	01:52:16,896	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right
EDL	01:52:17,920	01:52:18,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But Caesar claims
EDL	01:52:19,456	01:52:21,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did the migration is all part of a plan
EDL	01:52:22,272	01:52:26,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the leader of this tribe of helvetians is trying to become a king
EDL	01:52:27,136	01:52:29,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the tribe doesn't have Kings anymore

EDL	01:52:34,048	01:52:39,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some sort of aristocratic oligarchic Senate of A Sort and
EDL	01:52:39,680	01:52:45,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The punishment for trying to turn the society back to a kingship is to be burned alive Caesars
EDL	01:52:47,616	01:52:50,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now I should point out that this information is delivered to us

EDL	01:52:55,296	01:52:57,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right after he lays out the way that

EDL	01:52:59,904	01:53:01,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He then explains this story
EDL	01:53:01,952	01:53:04,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The story involves three garlic

EDL	01:53:09,376	01:53:12,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ethan describes a scenario that a couple of historians
EDL	01:53:12,960	01:53:16,544	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You don't point out and it's obvious and ironic and there's some code of psychologic
EDL	01:53:16,544	01:53:18,848	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nothing maybe going on the seizure but he describes
EDL	01:53:19,360	01:53:22,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A three-headed garlic first Triumph

EDL	01:53:24,736	01:53:27,808	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's explaining that these garlic noblemen are working together
EDL	01:53:28,320	01:53:31,136	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To help each other get what they want in terms of more power

EDL	01:53:33,696	01:53:36,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Back in room with those two other guys that make up the

EDL	01:53:38,304	01:53:39,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's a lot more critical
EDL	01:53:40,352	01:53:42,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of their triumvirate the use of his own

EDL	01:53:49,824	01:53:52,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which you know again if we're looking at it from the point of view
EDL	01:53:52,640	01:53:53,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Gauls
EDL	01:53:54,432	01:53:56,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Isn't that what you'd want them to be doing
EDL	01:53:58,016	01:54:04,416	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And by the way it is already been done by other garlic tribes in other areas that the wrong is that already taken over in Spain by the waves

EDL	01:54:19,008	01:54:25,408	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Panigale point of view these three guys might have been national heroes like Winston Churchill type thing the Romans are coming the Russians are coming
EDL	01:54:25,408	01:54:29,504	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We have to combine at the national security question but Caesar plays it ought to be a raw grab

EDL	01:54:31,040	01:54:35,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of them is the helvetian ruler in the reason he's moving his people is much more Sinister than just
EDL	01:54:35,648	01:54:37,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They need more territories part of the plot

EDL	01:54:47,424	01:54:51,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are they going to bring this guy and he shows up with like ten thousand of his best friends

EDL	01:54:55,616	01:54:56,896	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And let him go
EDL	01:54:56,896	01:54:58,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then Caesar says
EDL	01:54:58,432	01:55:03,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Civil Wars about to start then mysteriously the dude dies his name was Argueta Rex
EDL	01:55:04,064	01:55:05,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the tribe still going to move
EDL	01:55:06,112	01:55:07,136	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because it was in the plan
EDL	01:55:07,648	01:55:11,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And sold that starts this chain of events that will eventually lead to
EDL	01:55:11,232	01:55:14,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic culture in with Now France being mortally wounded
EDL	01:55:14,816	01:55:18,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So what's the cause of all this if you're in a war crimes trial

EDL	02:03:17,632	02:03:24,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The helvetians to negotiate and you know Passover all these differences between these tribes right smoothing it out maybe
EDL	02:03:24,032	02:03:25,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So they can work together more
EDL	02:03:25,312	02:03:26,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They organized
EDL	02:03:26,592	02:03:32,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Situation with the helvetians promise we won't do anything we will be very nice and we cross your territory we won't do anything bad and then they go through
EDL	02:03:32,992	02:03:37,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The territory of these tribes that are allies of Rome and then they start breaking stuff

EDL	02:03:51,936	02:03:54,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar says I can't let that happen to my allies
EDL	02:03:54,496	02:03:57,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	She justifies in the book that way then he goes after the helvetians
EDL	02:04:00,128	02:04:02,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar will go raise some more armies real quickly

EDL	02:04:23,168	02:04:23,936	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Procedures must be
EDL	02:04:25,472	02:04:28,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it's a lot of people one way or the other and they're hard to feed
EDL	02:04:28,544	02:04:29,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar
EDL	02:04:29,312	02:04:30,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Comes upon he says
EDL	02:04:31,104	02:04:37,504	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This tribe wear 3/4 of the tribe CrossFit 1/4 was still on the other side waiting that was the side Caesar was on to Zoe
EDL	02:04:37,504	02:04:38,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Attack them
EDL	02:04:40,320	02:04:41,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Killed a bunch
EDL	02:04:42,112	02:04:43,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is women children
EDL	02:04:43,648	02:04:44,672	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wagons
EDL	02:04:44,672	02:04:45,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Warriors
EDL	02:04:45,696	02:04:47,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A bunch of them ran into the forest
EDL	02:04:47,744	02:04:48,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And now
EDL	02:04:48,768	02:04:51,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The tribe comes to seizure and basically says you know
EDL	02:04:51,072	02:04:52,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What do you want from us
EDL	02:04:53,120	02:04:53,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says
EDL	02:04:54,400	02:04:58,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This that and the other thing reparations and oh yeah bunch of hostages now this
EDL	02:04:58,752	02:04:59,776	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is a moment we should
EDL	02:05:00,288	02:05:02,848	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just discussed this for a second cuz it's wild also
EDL	02:05:02,848	02:05:04,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This practice
EDL	02:05:04,128	02:05:05,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of hostages for good behavior
EDL	02:05:07,456	02:05:08,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is very common in
EDL	02:05:09,504	02:05:10,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	World but I always
EDL	02:05:11,040	02:05:13,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I think to myself what if this happened today
EDL	02:05:13,088	02:05:19,488	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What if that's how we ensure good behavior today what if when we were having problems with Saddam Hussein and you have your first golf
EDL	02:05:19,488	02:05:24,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ford at the end of it he stays in power but in order to stop fighting you demand a couple of his sons
EDL	02:05:24,608	02:05:25,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As hostages
EDL	02:05:26,912	02:05:29,728	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would be an interesting way to handle modern diplomacy
EDL	02:05:30,752	02:05:37,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But that's what Caesar said he wants from this tribe and I want hostages and they're always going to be like the Sons and Daughters of the nobility so the people he's negotiating
EDL	02:05:37,152	02:05:39,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Give the sons and daughters and they say
EDL	02:05:39,456	02:05:40,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hey hey hey
EDL	02:05:41,248	02:05:44,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Don't get cocky just cuz you beat us in the situation where we were
EDL	02:05:44,576	02:05:50,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In refugees over River we're basically still undefeated heck we beat you a couple Generations ago
EDL	02:05:51,232	02:05:54,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Practice of taking hostages not giving
EDL	02:05:54,048	02:05:55,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And so
EDL	02:05:55,328	02:05:56,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The meeting broke up
EDL	02:05:57,376	02:06:00,960	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Attributions would not provide hostages go back along
EDL	02:06:00,960	02:06:04,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their merry way continuing their migration the Romans go back to Taylor
EDL	02:06:06,080	02:06:10,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar now is looking for a way to strike at them because they haven't accepted his terms
EDL	02:06:11,968	02:06:13,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Before he can manage to do it though
EDL	02:06:14,272	02:06:16,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It begins to have severe Supply prop
EDL	02:06:16,832	02:06:17,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	More on that in a minute
EDL	02:06:19,136	02:06:20,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Forces him he says
EDL	02:06:20,928	02:06:22,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To break off the pursuit
EDL	02:06:22,720	02:06:28,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And going in opposite direction towards a friendly Garlic City where he can get supplies
EDL	02:06:28,096	02:06:31,680	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar says when they change course away from the migrants
EDL	02:06:31,680	02:06:33,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The migrants turn around and come after them
EDL	02:06:36,544	02:06:38,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Little Caesars stopped he puts
EDL	02:06:38,336	02:06:39,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His entire force
EDL	02:06:39,872	02:06:42,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On a hill where it's covering the Hillwood legionaries
EDL	02:06:42,688	02:06:44,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Reason the traditional three line formation
EDL	02:06:46,272	02:06:47,808	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's preparing for the battle
EDL	02:06:47,808	02:06:54,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says in a very grandiose move for the folks back home but one that has real world dividends
EDL	02:06:54,208	02:06:54,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sleep aid
EDL	02:06:54,976	02:06:58,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar will get off his horse and send it to the rear and take his
EDL	02:06:58,048	02:06:59,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Replacing the front line with the soldiers
EDL	02:07:00,864	02:07:01,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sharing their faith
EDL	02:07:02,656	02:07:03,936	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Encouraging them
EDL	02:07:05,984	02:07:07,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And remember this
EDL	02:07:07,008	02:07:10,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Stage in his career Caesars not the great General that we know
EDL	02:07:10,848	02:07:14,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Was Julius Caesar you seen a lot of fighting but this is really his first
EDL	02:07:14,432	02:07:15,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	True command
EDL	02:07:16,224	02:07:19,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this is where he's making his name and part of making his name
EDL	02:07:19,808	02:07:21,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's showing that he's something special
EDL	02:07:21,600	02:07:24,416	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Napoleon did a bunch of things like this and so did Alexander
EDL	02:07:24,416	02:07:25,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Typical General move
EDL	02:07:27,488	02:07:31,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it can work wonders over the Long Haul seizures earning the trust of his army
EDL	02:07:32,352	02:07:34,912	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says that these gawlik troops these ferocious
EDL	02:07:36,192	02:07:37,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Soldiers come
EDL	02:07:37,472	02:07:41,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Charging uphill at the Romans so you already sent disaster right
EDL	02:07:41,824	02:07:42,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's not a good move
EDL	02:07:43,872	02:07:46,944	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the gulls are not known for tactical brilliance
EDL	02:07:47,456	02:07:48,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In fact it almost seems like
EDL	02:07:49,248	02:07:50,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Inevitable trade-off
EDL	02:07:50,784	02:07:53,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the price you pay for being these
EDL	02:07:53,344	02:07:57,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Out-of-control impetuous Warriors that lose your mind in battle lost
EDL	02:07:58,464	02:07:59,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is that your
EDL	02:07:59,744	02:08:01,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Inevitably
EDL	02:08:01,024	02:08:03,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Less tactically cohesive and less
EDL	02:08:04,096	02:08:05,376	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Concerned about
EDL	02:08:05,376	02:08:11,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things like making sure you save enough energy to be able to fight for a while they traditional book
EDL	02:08:11,264	02:08:14,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Play book the opposition handbook on fighting Gauls says
EDL	02:08:14,592	02:08:17,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the initial charge of these people is
EDL	02:08:19,712	02:08:20,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	While
EDL	02:08:20,992	02:08:22,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And hard to hold
EDL	02:08:22,784	02:08:27,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But if you can stay strong and hold the initial charge they begin to get tired
EDL	02:08:28,416	02:08:30,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then they begin to get disheartened
EDL	02:08:30,720	02:08:35,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that impetuosity phase and then the lack of the armor that they normally have
EDL	02:08:35,328	02:08:41,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The fact that they've totally lost cohesion after all this stuff against to tell if you can sit through
EDL	02:08:41,216	02:08:42,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And whether the initial storm
EDL	02:08:43,264	02:08:44,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You tend to be okay
EDL	02:08:44,800	02:08:48,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Charging up here with a bunch of Roman throwing heavy joblon downhill
EDL	02:08:48,640	02:08:49,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not a good start
EDL	02:08:50,176	02:08:51,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that the
EDL	02:08:51,456	02:08:52,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Roman Pila God
EDL	02:08:52,736	02:08:55,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Stuck in the shields of the Gauls
EDL	02:08:55,296	02:08:56,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Little narrow weaknecht
EDL	02:08:57,088	02:08:58,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Deliberately designed
EDL	02:08:58,624	02:09:00,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tube and so then all of a sudden it's
EDL	02:09:00,928	02:09:06,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Dragging down the shields of these Gaul Caesar says they shake their arms for a long time then throw their shield down
EDL	02:09:06,816	02:09:08,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You take the people already not
EDL	02:09:08,608	02:09:14,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Heavily armored and take away the Shields and then the Romans charge down at them with swords and it begins to be
EDL	02:09:15,008	02:09:19,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know a typical Roman battle against Gauls where they're going to get chopped up pretty good
EDL	02:09:20,384	02:09:23,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says you never see their back they don't run
EDL	02:09:23,456	02:09:24,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they conduct a
EDL	02:09:24,992	02:09:30,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fighting withdrawal up to a nearby Hill and when the Romans pursue them they're hitting the flanked by two other tribes that were nearby
EDL	02:09:32,928	02:09:33,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We should point out
EDL	02:09:33,952	02:09:38,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar has every interest to exaggerate how dangerous this enemy is
EDL	02:09:38,816	02:09:41,376	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And how difficult the conditions he faced were because
EDL	02:09:41,888	02:09:44,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obviously if he prevails and wins
EDL	02:09:44,192	02:09:47,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well it's that much greater of a victory to cite to the folks back home
EDL	02:09:48,032	02:09:48,544	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:09:49,056	02:09:55,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When seizures hit in the flank he says the people that he was pursuing charges him from the front again so he's surrounded
EDL	02:09:55,456	02:09:57,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His flight is he that this is a Greek army
EDL	02:09:57,760	02:09:58,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Instead of a Roman army
EDL	02:09:59,296	02:10:00,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's done for this point
EDL	02:10:01,088	02:10:04,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because the Romans could do with the Romans could do
EDL	02:10:04,160	02:10:07,488	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tactical flexibility that was pretty much
EDL	02:10:07,488	02:10:09,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unique in the ancient world
EDL	02:10:09,536	02:10:13,632	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar's able to take one of the three lines of the Roman army the one that's not yet fighting
EDL	02:10:14,144	02:10:14,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	02:10:15,424	02:10:19,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Shift it's facing so it's now facing the enemy
EDL	02:10:19,008	02:10:21,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Benefits of Romans in the flank now they're facing Romans from the front

EDL	02:11:02,016	02:11:03,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Says this about the numbers quote
EDL	02:11:05,344	02:11:09,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the aftermath of the battle Caesar claims that tablets were found in the helvetian camp
EDL	02:11:09,952	02:11:11,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Written in Greek characters
EDL	02:11:11,744	02:11:17,376	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Containing lists of men of military age women boys in the elderly who joined into migration
EDL	02:11:17,888	02:11:19,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They were also

EDL	02:11:22,240	02:11:25,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For a grand total of 368000 people
EDL	02:11:25,824	02:11:28,896	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of whom 92000 were capable of bearing arms
EDL	02:11:29,408	02:11:31,200	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Seizure then record the census
EDL	02:11:31,200	02:11:32,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Taken when the Gauls returned home
EDL	02:11:33,504	02:11:35,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which totaled 110000
EDL	02:11:35,552	02:11:41,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It is difficult to assess the accuracy of these figures and this is the only case in the garlic War we're Caesar worth
EDL	02:11:41,952	02:11:42,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	First of such list
EDL	02:11:43,232	02:11:46,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Gauls did write Celtic in Greek letters
EDL	02:11:46,304	02:11:49,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Numerous inscriptions in Celtic written in Greek characters have been preserved
EDL	02:11:50,912	02:11:57,056	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The figure of 92,000 Warriors is plausible that the total of 368,000 is accepted
EDL	02:11:57,056	02:12:02,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In premodern populations about 1/4 of the population consisted of males of military age
EDL	02:12:02,688	02:12:07,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The total number for all those migrating is also in the realm of possibility
EDL	02:12:07,040	02:12:12,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	110000 survivors representing 1/3 of those who set out is more of a problem
EDL	02:12:12,928	02:12:15,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The loss of more than two-thirds as possible
EDL	02:12:15,744	02:12:17,792	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But he must have had a number of causes
EDL	02:12:17,792	02:12:21,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The migration from beginning to end probably consumed about three months
EDL	02:12:21,888	02:12:24,704	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the final battle in late May early June
EDL	02:12:24,704	02:12:29,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Many especially the sick and the infirm may have perished along the way
EDL	02:12:29,568	02:12:32,384	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And other simply settled along the route of migration
EDL	02:12:32,384	02:12:35,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Once the battle casualties are included which Caesar does not give
EDL	02:12:35,968	02:12:38,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The figure four losses still seems too high
EDL	02:12:38,528	02:12:41,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's no other evidence and at least it's in the realm of possibility
EDL	02:12:42,112	02:12:42,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	02:12:44,160	02:12:46,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How do I say just broke I enjoyed immensely on this
EDL	02:12:48,256	02:12:49,536	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Buddy's point is well taken
EDL	02:12:50,048	02:12:52,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We don't know how many people really were there
EDL	02:12:52,608	02:12:54,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you don't know how many people really came back
EDL	02:12:55,936	02:13:02,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it might have been more of a Trail of Tears type situation of Bataan Death March as we said type situation
EDL	02:13:02,592	02:13:06,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where a lot of people died along the way rather than have Caesar stuff out their lives
EDL	02:13:09,504	02:13:10,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you can be sure
EDL	02:13:11,296	02:13:15,648	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It sent the helvetians were one of the great tribes of Gaul that we're talking about a lot of people
EDL	02:13:15,648	02:13:17,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're not just talking about combatants at all
EDL	02:13:18,464	02:13:22,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The end stages of this battle with Caesar had the Roman legionaries assaulting

EDL	02:13:47,136	02:13:48,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So when the Romans

EDL	02:13:57,888	02:13:59,936	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Roman army does when they get to the wagons
EDL	02:14:00,704	02:14:01,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They kill everybody

EDL	02:14:05,312	02:14:09,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the main things that actually protects lives on the battlefield like this
EDL	02:14:10,176	02:14:12,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is the prospect of Stelling
EDL	02:14:12,224	02:14:14,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The people that you can capture
EDL	02:14:14,784	02:14:21,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The one thing a person on a battlefield facing the battle lost of other people has in their favor and then they the only thing they can work
EDL	02:14:21,184	02:14:23,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Guess I'm I'm worth more alive than dead
EDL	02:14:25,024	02:14:29,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And there's no doubt that lots of slaves were sold after this battle and you can hear your mind a cash register
EDL	02:14:30,656	02:14:37,056	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a ding every time one of those people Soul because one of the reasons seizures there if you recall as he has a horrible death.
EDL	02:14:37,056	02:14:37,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Home
EDL	02:14:38,336	02:14:43,200	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the ways for a great Roman to pay off these debts as with a successful profitable campaign
EDL	02:14:43,712	02:14:47,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of the main things you profit off of is the people you sell after
EDL	02:14:47,040	02:14:47,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Words
EDL	02:14:48,064	02:14:49,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:14:49,088	02:14:51,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The reason seizure came
EDL	02:14:51,392	02:14:53,440	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To this entire area to begin with
EDL	02:14:53,440	02:14:54,464	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I just been dealt with
EDL	02:14:56,000	02:15:00,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	After the battle the helvetians essentially what's left of them come to Caesar and say you know we're in your power
EDL	02:15:00,608	02:15:02,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Will do whatever you want to send them home
EDL	02:15:02,912	02:15:07,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Send them back to where they came from and he feeds them on the way the Rangers are food and everything

EDL	02:15:10,080	02:15:14,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The end result is you lose hundreds of thousands of people to return things to the status quo
EDL	02:15:15,712	02:15:18,016	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So why doesn't Caesar go home now

EDL	02:16:18,944	02:16:22,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then while he's pursuing the helvetian

EDL	02:23:05,472	02:23:10,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In Caesars narrative this guy is sort of the root cause of everything hear me why
EDL	02:23:10,080	02:23:15,200	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is Cesar even having to do all of this in Gaul will because the Germans destabilize the whole situation

EDL	02:24:20,224	02:24:21,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In his commentaries
EDL	02:24:22,016	02:24:25,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The great way to justify going out to the Germans to remind you
EDL	02:24:25,088	02:24:26,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But every now and then they come after us

EDL	02:27:15,328	02:27:16,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The legality

EDL	02:27:30,432	02:27:34,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But that was something that was actually sometimes part of the rules back then
EDL	02:27:35,040	02:27:38,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this German leader will cleverly say over and over again

EDL	02:34:26,176	02:34:29,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At this point why is he putting these sorts of

EDL	02:35:03,808	02:35:09,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the politics of Rome where his involvement in this region risking his life and devoting his entire exist

EDL	02:35:17,376	02:35:18,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the politics of Rome
EDL	02:35:20,192	02:35:24,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he desperately in need of things like money and Conquest

EDL	02:35:25,312	02:35:27,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Honors and he's got to keep
EDL	02:35:27,872	02:35:28,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This
EDL	02:35:28,640	02:35:32,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Military command going because the the moment that his

EDL	02:35:34,016	02:35:38,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's prosecutable by his enemies in their licking their chops back in room waiting to get to him
EDL	02:35:39,904	02:35:40,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the same time
EDL	02:35:41,440	02:35:42,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know
EDL	02:35:42,208	02:35:48,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At least at this point in history he has to assume that this is not a permanent command so he's on a bit of a Time Clock of Caesar real
EDL	02:35:48,608	02:35:53,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Really wants to do these great things he's going to end up doing in golf he's got a limited amount of time to do it
EDL	02:35:53,984	02:35:58,848	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Cassius Dio as one of the people that says that everything Caesars doing here is the equivalent of

EDL	02:36:12,672	02:36:16,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By saying that all Rio Vista sitting the king of the Germans he's a can of account
EDL	02:36:18,304	02:36:19,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That means one of two things either
EDL	02:36:20,608	02:36:24,960	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cassius Dio is a lazy Roman ethnographer and there were plenty
EDL	02:36:25,728	02:36:27,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And doesn't really draw a distinction
EDL	02:36:28,032	02:36:29,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But if he's accurate
EDL	02:36:30,080	02:36:34,176	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then you have to say well why did Caesar call him in German what's the point
EDL	02:36:34,176	02:36:38,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A Caesar doing that what does he gain by creating this new group of people

EDL	02:37:38,176	02:37:40,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Therefore he sent for REO Vista

EDL	02:37:44,064	02:37:46,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ariovistus instead of obeying replied
EDL	02:37:46,880	02:37:48,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this is close to Caesars on description
EDL	02:37:50,464	02:37:54,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is Caesar wishes to tell me anything let him come himself to me

EDL	02:38:24,000	02:38:25,280	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And by that means
EDL	02:38:25,280	02:38:28,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To gain a great and fitting pretext for the war

EDL	02:41:28,576	02:41:30,368	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And get them out in the field against this guy
EDL	02:41:32,416	02:41:38,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now the way the battleships up supposedly is it starts with a bunch of maneuvering this is the very unsexy
EDL	02:41:38,816	02:41:39,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Decide
EDL	02:41:40,096	02:41:41,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A military history

EDL	02:41:49,056	02:41:52,384	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Level Valley where you've had a lot of time for both sides
EDL	02:41:52,384	02:41:53,408	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The setup and then you have
EDL	02:41:53,408	02:41:54,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You are super big encounter
EDL	02:41:55,968	02:41:56,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But truthfully
EDL	02:41:57,248	02:42:00,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In Real History of one of the generals had done his job or her job
EDL	02:42:01,344	02:42:05,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You should have the other side beaten by the time you get to that point
EDL	02:42:06,208	02:42:12,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's sometimes the big maneuvering on the Strategic level that does that but sometimes it's just a little shading here
EDL	02:42:12,864	02:42:15,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the slight Advantage there and they all light up
EDL	02:42:17,216	02:42:18,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Generals throughout history
EDL	02:42:18,496	02:42:20,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Almost neurotic
EDL	02:42:20,288	02:42:22,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Think about figuring out the little elements
EDL	02:42:22,336	02:42:23,616	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How to gain advantage
EDL	02:42:25,920	02:42:29,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And there are quite a few different periods in history where because of the military
EDL	02:42:29,760	02:42:31,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Technology in the limitations
EDL	02:42:31,808	02:42:38,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If both sides didn't actively want to fight a battle sometimes it didn't happen if one side wanted to avoid it
EDL	02:42:38,208	02:42:39,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Often times it was easy to do
EDL	02:42:40,512	02:42:42,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The seventeenth and eighteenth century
EDL	02:42:42,304	02:42:43,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Probably
EDL	02:42:43,072	02:42:46,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like the high-water mark of that a few hundred years ago where
EDL	02:42:46,144	02:42:47,680	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because of the way things were
EDL	02:42:47,680	02:42:49,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Enough once I didn't want to fight a battle that almost never have
EDL	02:42:50,752	02:42:54,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sonus. Caesar and the German Commander
EDL	02:42:54,080	02:42:57,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are both sort of jockeying for position and maneuvering
EDL	02:42:58,176	02:42:59,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of the things about the Romans
EDL	02:42:59,968	02:43:00,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That makes them so
EDL	02:43:00,992	02:43:05,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Again another unsexy side of military history but the Roman soldiers are about 1/2
EDL	02:43:06,112	02:43:07,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Devastating
EDL	02:43:07,392	02:43:07,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Soldier
EDL	02:43:08,416	02:43:10,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And about half construction worker
EDL	02:43:11,232	02:43:13,280	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And these people could set up
EDL	02:43:13,280	02:43:14,560	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fortifications
EDL	02:43:15,328	02:43:16,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In real time
EDL	02:43:17,120	02:43:19,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a way that actually effective
EDL	02:43:19,168	02:43:20,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The battles
EDL	02:43:20,192	02:43:24,544	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Situation of the maneuvering actually takes
EDL	02:43:25,056	02:43:26,592	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The form of both sides
EDL	02:43:27,360	02:43:31,200	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Trying to March around the other encamp on their lines of supply
EDL	02:43:31,200	02:43:31,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cut them off
EDL	02:43:32,992	02:43:39,136	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the Germans did it they would take wagons and what not supposedly with them and sort of put them in a circle like
EDL	02:43:39,648	02:43:41,440	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pioneers in the old west used
EDL	02:43:41,440	02:43:44,000	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of course they have a lot more wagons were talking about a lot
EDL	02:43:44,512	02:43:45,280	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Your structures
EDL	02:43:45,280	02:43:48,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But when the Romans would build a calf even a small sub cap
EDL	02:43:49,376	02:43:51,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They would build it like an Old Fort
EDL	02:43:51,936	02:43:53,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the old American West
EDL	02:43:53,472	02:43:55,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know we were talking about what
EDL	02:43:55,008	02:43:55,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Timber
EDL	02:43:56,032	02:43:57,056	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Garden Tower
EDL	02:43:57,568	02:44:00,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And maybe even artillery in the guard
EDL	02:44:00,128	02:44:01,920	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Towers in the Romans were so good at this
EDL	02:44:02,432	02:44:05,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And often did it every night when they were out in the field
EDL	02:44:05,760	02:44:12,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They had this down to a science and everybody knew exactly where to go and how to do and what are we going to look out the layout was always the same
EDL	02:44:12,160	02:44:13,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So when the Romans
EDL	02:44:13,696	02:44:15,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Camped on your line of supply
EDL	02:44:15,744	02:44:20,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You wake up the next morning and there would be a fort there where there was Open Country the day before
EDL	02:44:22,144	02:44:23,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So then
EDL	02:44:23,168	02:44:27,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	After the initial maneuverings once the Romans have this sport in too good of a position
EDL	02:44:27,264	02:44:33,664	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Germans are launching attacks against the fort and those are beating off and there's a bunch of this kind of preliminary but still pretty
EDL	02:44:33,664	02:44:35,200	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Large-scale skirmishing
EDL	02:44:35,712	02:44:42,112	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Before Caesar maybe some historians think is beginning to have Supply problems himself that a lot more
EDL	02:44:42,112	02:44:43,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are the natives around him here
EDL	02:44:43,904	02:44:48,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he seems to be in danger and needing to fight a battle or get out
EDL	02:44:49,536	02:44:50,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So he says he
EDL	02:44:51,328	02:44:54,912	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Straws the Army up in battle formation and marches it out toward the germ
EDL	02:44:54,912	02:44:56,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On several occasions by
EDL	02:44:57,472	02:44:59,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By this time.
EDL	02:44:59,008	02:45:01,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Roman battle formation by the way
EDL	02:45:01,568	02:45:05,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is 3 big lines deep usually
EDL	02:45:05,152	02:45:07,456	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that's the way he lines up and just so you know
EDL	02:45:07,456	02:45:08,992	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That means a different thing from Rent
EDL	02:45:09,760	02:45:12,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ranks of the number of troops that are lined up
EDL	02:45:12,064	02:45:14,112	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You the one behind the other
EDL	02:45:14,112	02:45:18,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And often times each of these lines is between Genesis not just for Romans for anyone
EDL	02:45:19,488	02:45:21,536	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For to like 16 ranks.
EDL	02:45:21,536	02:45:25,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pike formation maybe 12 or 16 rank the Romans more 4 to 8
EDL	02:45:25,632	02:45:31,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But then you'll be a dead zone if maybe 50 yards 30 yards a hundred yards
EDL	02:45:31,264	02:45:33,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it'll be another line of men lined up in
EDL	02:45:33,824	02:45:37,152	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This would be the Roman second-line and then the Romans would often have a third line
EDL	02:45:38,176	02:45:42,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This seems like common sense when you think about it today but in the ancient world this is very unusual
EDL	02:45:43,296	02:45:44,576	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans have reserved
EDL	02:45:45,344	02:45:48,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And time and again it will save them in these battles because
EDL	02:45:48,672	02:45:55,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They will find out if something's going wrong someplace and guess what we have about 20 to 25% of our total Force
EDL	02:45:55,072	02:45:57,120	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just sitting back there
EDL	02:45:57,120	02:46:00,192	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Throw them into the troubled area and time and again it saves them
EDL	02:46:01,984	02:46:04,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this battle Caesar is
EDL	02:46:04,031	02:46:09,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Very cut-and-dry remember this is not a true history he's writing this is supposed to be sort of
EDL	02:46:09,151	02:46:10,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the format of
EDL	02:46:10,687	02:46:12,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know dispatches from the front
EDL	02:46:12,991	02:46:14,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And sometimes she'll talk about
EDL	02:46:15,039	02:46:20,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know what's going on in the battle at length but you would think with a really important one like this one he go into great detail and he doesn't
EDL	02:46:22,207	02:46:23,743	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He basically says
EDL	02:46:23,743	02:46:25,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the real Clash of arms comes
EDL	02:46:26,559	02:46:31,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This bottle was supposed to have been fought most historians thinking what's now Alsace but no one's sure
EDL	02:46:31,679	02:46:34,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Probably on the West Bank of the Rhine somewhere
EDL	02:46:35,519	02:46:39,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans probably had in the neighborhood of thirty thousand men
EDL	02:46:39,359	02:46:40,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Germans who knows
EDL	02:46:41,663	02:46:42,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Usually Sefa
EDL	02:46:42,687	02:46:46,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm 50 200,000 although you get the occasional outlier
EDL	02:46:46,783	02:46:49,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I love hamster Brooke as you now and he's usually a great
EDL	02:46:49,855	02:46:55,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Neutral arbitrator unless there's Germans involved in which case he's got his Homer glasses on
EDL	02:46:55,487	02:46:56,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He doesn't see things
EDL	02:46:56,767	02:46:59,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As unbiased he thinks the Romans
EDL	02:46:59,839	02:47:01,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Outnumbered the Germans
EDL	02:47:01,375	02:47:04,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's unusual so we'll set him aside there and just assume the Romans
EDL	02:47:04,447	02:47:07,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We're probably somewhat outnumbered perhaps 2 to 1
EDL	02:47:07,775	02:47:09,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the worst case scenario
EDL	02:47:10,847	02:47:16,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that the battle takes place so quickly there's no time for the usual exchange of missiles
EDL	02:47:16,223	02:47:19,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans love to throw those heavy jollands they do a lot of damage
EDL	02:47:19,807	02:47:24,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When you throw them in all at once hundreds of thousands of men throwing these heavy javelins all at once
EDL	02:47:25,183	02:47:30,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the Germans and the Romans end up charging each other too quickly for that and it gets right to a sword slog right away
EDL	02:47:31,839	02:47:34,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that the flank he's on
EDL	02:47:34,143	02:47:37,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Begins to push the German flag opposite them back
EDL	02:47:38,751	02:47:44,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But that the other Roman flanked on the far side of the battlefield is being overwhelmed by the German numbers
EDL	02:47:44,639	02:47:45,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He then says
EDL	02:47:45,919	02:47:49,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That a Roman officer that he names by name
EDL	02:47:49,759	02:47:56,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because he's on Horseback can see the problem from a distance of realize oh somebody better order the third law
EDL	02:47:56,159	02:48:00,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's not doing anything right now in to fix the situation and he does so when he saved the Bible
EDL	02:48:03,071	02:48:05,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cedar by the way name this person as
EDL	02:48:06,143	02:48:11,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The son of the richest guy in Rome Crassus who if you recall is one of the
EDL	02:48:11,519	02:48:14,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Members of the first triumvirate along with Caesar
EDL	02:48:15,103	02:48:17,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Tom P so you see in a way
EDL	02:48:17,663	02:48:19,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar still doesn't forget
EDL	02:48:20,223	02:48:24,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know where his bread is buttered and how to play the wonderful game of
EDL	02:48:24,063	02:48:26,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Politics and you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
EDL	02:48:27,391	02:48:33,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar was allegedly not able to leave Rome at one point because his creditors wouldn't let him out of the city
EDL	02:48:34,047	02:48:36,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Until crashes pay the bill
EDL	02:48:36,607	02:48:41,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well now all of a sudden here in this battle where Caesar doesn't go into depth about much of anything
EDL	02:48:41,983	02:48:45,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He goes out of his way to mention a single individual
EDL	02:48:45,055	02:48:48,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The son of the guy who paid the debts for him and oh by the way
EDL	02:48:48,639	02:48:52,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's basically saying without that guy you know we lost that battle against the German
EDL	02:48:52,735	02:48:54,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a little bit of a
EDL	02:48:54,783	02:48:56,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Honor to the family isn't it
EDL	02:48:57,087	02:48:59,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So maybe paying back a favor or maybe
EDL	02:49:00,671	02:49:06,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Putting crashes in debt for a future one nonetheless Caesars never far from playing the game
EDL	02:49:07,327	02:49:10,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case the game is deadly as you might imagine
EDL	02:49:11,167	02:49:13,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These Germans once again or supposed to have come
EDL	02:49:14,239	02:49:20,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the wagons in the families and the women on the wagons you know where the disheveled hair screaming at the
EDL	02:49:20,639	02:49:22,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Men Please Don't Let Us fall into slavery
EDL	02:49:23,455	02:49:28,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The problem with having all these women and wagons on the battlefield is obviously that at some point
EDL	02:49:28,575	02:49:31,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The battle moves from where it started
EDL	02:49:31,903	02:49:32,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To the wagon
EDL	02:49:32,927	02:49:35,743	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the people in the wagons and once again we have
EDL	02:49:35,743	02:49:36,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A bottle where
EDL	02:49:37,279	02:49:41,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's implied more than laid out for you but that the Romans kill a lot of civilians including
EDL	02:49:42,399	02:49:47,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm some of the relatives of Arya Vistas who somehow gets away but we don't hear any more from him
EDL	02:49:48,287	02:49:49,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Germans will run
EDL	02:49:49,567	02:49:52,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Miles to the Rhine Caesar size
EDL	02:49:52,127	02:49:58,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There will be more Germans that are just about to come over and help as soon as they hear about the big defeat of aurea Vista turn around and go home
EDL	02:50:00,063	02:50:06,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's Caesars doing here from a macro perspective though if you think about it isn't there were a bunch of powers
EDL	02:50:06,975	02:50:13,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That were the power Brokers in this region before Caesar intervened and that would have been last year so think about how quickly every
EDL	02:50:13,375	02:50:14,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things happening
EDL	02:50:14,143	02:50:15,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar has
EDL	02:50:15,423	02:50:19,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Essentially neutered one of them the helvetian one of most powerful tribes
EDL	02:50:19,263	02:50:23,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the count is now a shadow of what it was just months before
EDL	02:50:23,359	02:50:24,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cousin what teacher did do it
EDL	02:50:24,895	02:50:25,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And now this
EDL	02:50:26,943	02:50:28,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Player from out
EDL	02:50:28,223	02:50:30,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Side the Stratego
EDL	02:50:30,015	02:50:31,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or risk
EDL	02:50:31,039	02:50:35,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mat board who come in and intervened and garlic politics is smashed in
EDL	02:50:35,903	02:50:39,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Packing back over the Rhine this thing that Caesar portrays is a border
EDL	02:50:41,791	02:50:43,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's crazy to think about
EDL	02:50:43,327	02:50:45,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is that all of this has happened in the year 58 BCE
EDL	02:50:47,423	02:50:52,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because when you think about the ancient world you think about a world that in many cases moves much more slowly than the modern
EDL	02:50:53,823	02:50:56,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And yet Caesar has a blitzkrieg
EDL	02:50:56,127	02:50:56,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Going on
EDL	02:50:56,895	02:50:57,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mingle
EDL	02:50:58,943	02:51:02,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says and some historians will date three battle some
EDL	02:51:02,015	02:51:04,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some will day two battles depending on whether you consider that
EDL	02:51:04,575	02:51:06,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For slaughtering the helvetians
EDL	02:51:06,623	02:51:10,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When 1/4 of their number were caught on on the far side of the river to be a bottle or not
EDL	02:51:11,231	02:51:12,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But nonetheless in that one
EDL	02:51:12,767	02:51:16,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Really six to eight months because they don't campaign most of the time in the winter
EDL	02:51:16,863	02:51:19,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar. All this damage and changed
EDL	02:51:19,167	02:51:19,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The
EDL	02:51:19,935	02:51:21,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The power structure of this reading
EDL	02:51:21,983	02:51:28,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If he thought it was destabilize before he got involved in that was the excuse for getting involved he's totally destabilize
EDL	02:51:28,383	02:51:28,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now
EDL	02:51:30,431	02:51:31,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But winter is coming
EDL	02:51:31,455	02:51:32,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So what is Cesar do
EDL	02:51:33,247	02:51:38,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well he puts his army and winter quarters and he goes back to the area just north of Rome to keep an eye on Roman pal
EDL	02:51:38,879	02:51:40,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What you think about his next move
EDL	02:51:40,927	02:51:41,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Here's the thing
EDL	02:51:43,231	02:51:46,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You could make a case if you wanted to and some have
EDL	02:51:46,815	02:51:49,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did everything Caesar just accomplished was done
EDL	02:51:49,631	02:51:52,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know in a crisis situation in Hot Pursuit
EDL	02:51:53,727	02:51:59,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Whether it was the migration of the helvetians which is you know as we said earlier it's like if you woke up this morning and found 200,000 people
EDL	02:52:00,383	02:52:01,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You on your border just
EDL	02:52:01,919	02:52:08,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unexpectedly be some sort of a crisis so that's the way Caesar portrays it so if you give him the benefit of the doubt you say will you know he had to react you couldn't go
EDL	02:52:08,319	02:52:10,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ask for votes and Authority
EDL	02:52:10,879	02:52:11,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What part of what you do is that
EDL	02:52:12,415	02:52:14,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Head of the problems you go in there and you
EDL	02:52:14,207	02:52:20,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You roll with the punches so Caesar had to do that and then the Germans and their involvement I mean that was also the same thing mean they were
EDL	02:52:20,607	02:52:22,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Coming over the Border was getting worse you had
EDL	02:52:22,399	02:52:23,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He was a critical situation
EDL	02:52:24,959	02:52:26,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But now you're taking the winter off
EDL	02:52:26,495	02:52:29,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We go from a hot blood situation to Cold Blood
EDL	02:52:29,567	02:52:31,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Will you can think about what you want to do now
EDL	02:52:33,151	02:52:34,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I love the way Tom Holland
EDL	02:52:34,687	02:52:35,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As an author he's great
EDL	02:52:35,711	02:52:37,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Building a sense of suspense in
EDL	02:52:37,759	02:52:39,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he portrays the Gauls
EDL	02:52:39,807	02:52:40,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At this point
EDL	02:52:40,575	02:52:42,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In his book Rubicon
EDL	02:52:42,623	02:52:45,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A sort of waking up together to the fact
EDL	02:52:45,695	02:52:49,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That they're in the process of being conquered it's a strange thing but it's happening so quickly
EDL	02:52:50,303	02:52:52,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And because the garlic tribes are
EDL	02:52:52,863	02:52:54,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a separate from each other
EDL	02:52:55,167	02:53:01,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If they conquered the tribe next to you does that mean you're being conquered will not necessarily and you might
EDL	02:53:01,567	02:53:02,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Might not be too panicked
EDL	02:53:02,847	02:53:08,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But if enough of the big tribe near you are being conquered and if you happen to know just a little of the history
EDL	02:53:08,991	02:53:12,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A Roman Behavior another Celtic areas
EDL	02:53:12,319	02:53:16,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Spain for example or Northern Italy or what's now southern France
EDL	02:53:17,183	02:53:19,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You understand that these Romans have a track record
EDL	02:53:19,999	02:53:24,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They come in they defeat the Celtic people they begin to settle
EDL	02:53:24,095	02:53:30,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And in a generation or to the Celtic people become short-haired Galls in a couple of generations after that they become toga wearing Gaul
EDL	02:53:31,775	02:53:33,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Tom Holland
EDL	02:53:33,055	02:53:34,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Present this case where
EDL	02:53:34,847	02:53:40,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Once Caesar puts his troops in Winter quarters in the middle of God
EDL	02:53:40,735	02:53:42,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It sends a signal to everyone
EDL	02:53:42,783	02:53:43,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I hate waiting
EDL	02:53:44,319	02:53:45,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Easier to stay
EDL	02:53:46,367	02:53:51,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if we're going to prevent a complete takeover as has happened to other Celtic peoples
EDL	02:53:52,511	02:53:55,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's time to get serious about defending this place Tom Holland right

EDL	02:54:17,599	02:54:20,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This was an argument that may have satisfied public opinion back in Rome

EDL	02:55:18,015	02:55:20,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A sure sign of the way
EDL	02:55:20,319	02:55:22,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar was thinking during this time.
EDL	02:55:23,135	02:55:24,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is his excuse

EDL	03:04:09,471	03:04:15,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Yes our army came it cut through the barbarians like butter it was no competition a child could come into the
EDL	03:04:15,871	03:04:18,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans and destroyed the barbarians that's another very good

EDL	03:04:27,903	03:04:29,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In his mind the only thing you know for sure
EDL	03:04:30,207	03:04:32,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is it these battles sound like Slaughters
EDL	03:04:33,535	03:04:36,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And even though Caesar usually tries to throw in it
EDL	03:04:36,351	03:04:38,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Near run Mama Jesse was touch-and-go for a while but then we cry

EDL	03:04:41,471	03:04:44,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the Roman advantages are hard for
EDL	03:04:44,031	03:04:46,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Most modern people certainly for me
EDL	03:04:47,103	03:04:50,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To really understand because there's something about the way were raised in the
EDL	03:04:50,431	03:04:52,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The technological era that we live in
EDL	03:04:52,991	03:04:55,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It whenever you talk about vast
EDL	03:04:55,039	03:04:59,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Differences between military capabilities we assume it's got to be mostly Technologic
EDL	03:04:59,391	03:05:00,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not easy for us
EDL	03:05:01,951	03:05:02,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you say
EDL	03:05:02,975	03:05:06,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One side in this battle had machine guns in the other head bows and arrows
EDL	03:05:06,047	03:05:07,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are modern brain goes oh well that's a sloth
EDL	03:05:08,607	03:05:11,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Write the technological differences going to equal a certain outcome
EDL	03:05:12,959	03:05:13,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But if you tell us
EDL	03:05:14,495	03:05:15,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The two armies
EDL	03:05:15,775	03:05:18,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a 2000 years ago
EDL	03:05:18,079	03:05:21,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We're really different in terms of what they could do to each other and how
EDL	03:05:21,663	03:05:28,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're nasty they were but they're very similar in terms of actual weapons technology it's hard for us to
EDL	03:05:28,063	03:05:28,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Stand
EDL	03:05:28,831	03:05:31,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What it is that makes up the difference is that could account for that
EDL	03:05:32,927	03:05:38,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And of course all the experts you really understand and there are few experts on real Ancient Warfare
EDL	03:05:38,047	03:05:40,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they'll tell you this is what drill and discipline.
EDL	03:05:41,375	03:05:44,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is what equipping basically most of your troops
EDL	03:05:45,215	03:05:47,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With armor and metal helmets does
EDL	03:05:48,031	03:05:51,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we used an example once of Imagine two NFL teams
EDL	03:05:51,103	03:05:55,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Deciding to have a football game at 1 teams not allowed any pads or helmets or anything
EDL	03:05:55,967	03:05:56,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And now imagine that
EDL	03:05:57,247	03:05:59,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Both sides are actually playing with edged weapons and
EDL	03:05:59,551	03:06:00,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's a lot more
EDL	03:06:00,319	03:06:03,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nasty even then pro football you could see where that might
EDL	03:06:03,391	03:06:04,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Be a big advantage
EDL	03:06:04,671	03:06:06,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Also you threw that in
EDL	03:06:06,463	03:06:09,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the drill with I mean if there's a lot that goes into it
EDL	03:06:11,583	03:06:15,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it's not as I said a very good story if you say the Romans came
EDL	03:06:15,423	03:06:17,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And destroyed the Barbarian did it with no trouble at all
EDL	03:06:19,519	03:06:21,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And in my friend's mind that's why you need to keep
EDL	03:06:21,823	03:06:23,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pumping up this next tribe it's easier than
EDL	03:06:23,871	03:06:26,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you thought that was bad this one's even worse because
EDL	03:06:26,687	03:06:31,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It begins to get a little monotonous Caesars not losing any of these battles and he's not even coming close
EDL	03:06:31,807	03:06:33,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Really until
EDL	03:06:34,111	03:06:36,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You end up with one of these tribes doing
EDL	03:06:37,183	03:06:41,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What common sense would dictate a certain point you should do
EDL	03:06:41,535	03:06:42,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which is
EDL	03:06:42,559	03:06:46,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is Caesar's got this in comparably fantastic Army
EDL	03:06:47,167	03:06:49,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if it's eating you alive
EDL	03:06:49,471	03:06:51,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On the battlefield stop facing it
EDL	03:06:52,287	03:06:53,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You don't have to
EDL	03:06:53,567	03:06:54,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right it's not prescribed
EDL	03:06:54,847	03:06:59,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's hard for certain culture sometimes because when you get to these Warrior cultures that have a heroic
EDL	03:07:00,479	03:07:02,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Certified personal ethos
EDL	03:07:02,271	03:07:02,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where
EDL	03:07:03,295	03:07:09,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How you doing battle and bravery and conspicuous bravery right out in front of other people in Fair fights and Duels and
EDL	03:07:09,695	03:07:11,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All that is part of your makeup
EDL	03:07:11,487	03:07:12,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To talk about
EDL	03:07:12,511	03:07:15,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Subterfuge and ambushing and stuff like that
EDL	03:07:16,351	03:07:18,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well it doesn't always match so well
EDL	03:07:18,911	03:07:23,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the Inner Warrior Spirit but believe me necessity is the mother of invention
EDL	03:07:24,031	03:07:26,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And when Caesar goes to take on the various tribes
EDL	03:07:27,359	03:07:30,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the belgae the Bell guy by the way is another way to pronounce it
EDL	03:07:30,687	03:07:37,087	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The first thing that happens is they get these large numbers of people together which they can't feed so Caesar apparently way
EDL	03:07:37,087	03:07:37,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wait them out
EDL	03:07:38,879	03:07:45,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They'll be some skirmishing a little bit of this a little bit of that but it looks like Caesar's plan is to just sit there and absorb all the food he can
EDL	03:07:45,279	03:07:51,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Resume logistical Services while he watches the enemy around him supposedly in the 300,000
EDL	03:07:51,679	03:07:53,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Numerical range
EDL	03:07:53,983	03:07:54,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Begin to Star
EDL	03:07:56,287	03:07:58,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of course I have to hold hands down bruker
EDL	03:07:58,335	03:07:59,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cuz he's the logistical guy
EDL	03:08:00,639	03:08:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Delbrook
EDL	03:08:01,407	03:08:07,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Explain Caesar's into Northern Gaul where the belgia corbel get people live in says
EDL	03:08:09,087	03:08:10,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The belgae
EDL	03:08:10,367	03:08:11,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Also Bell guy
EDL	03:08:11,647	03:08:13,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Had a premonition of their impending Danger
EDL	03:08:14,207	03:08:19,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	United their forces and when Caesar cross their borders moved out against him with a large Allied Army
EDL	03:08:20,351	03:08:23,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That civilization has means of warfare that are lacking to Barbary
EDL	03:08:24,703	03:08:28,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The belgae were no doubt capable of assembling a large army
EDL	03:08:28,287	03:08:30,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But not a holding it together and feeding it
EDL	03:08:30,591	03:08:34,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just as the cimbri and teutones those barbarians from
EDL	03:08:34,175	03:08:35,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar's birth.
EDL	03:08:35,711	03:08:40,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Had to split up on their campaign into Italy and were defeated individually by Marius
EDL	03:08:40,831	03:08:47,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar instead of moving immediately into a decisive battle against an army of the same size as he is her perhaps cancer
EDL	03:08:47,231	03:08:48,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Suitably larger
EDL	03:08:48,255	03:08:50,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Found the means of splitting up the Allied Army
EDL	03:08:51,327	03:08:53,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So that he could then deal with only individual try
EDL	03:08:54,655	03:08:55,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the meantime

EDL	03:08:57,215	03:08:59,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar head organized two new Legions
EDL	03:08:59,519	03:09:01,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Somebody now had a total of 8
EDL	03:09:01,567	03:09:05,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which is auxiliary troops of numidians cretans bow lyrics and garlic cavalry
EDL	03:09:05,919	03:09:09,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His army may have well numbered 50000 to combatants
EDL	03:09:09,247	03:09:12,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And a grand total of 80 thousand to a hundred thousand Souls
EDL	03:09:12,575	03:09:16,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In order to feed such a mess in one place for a rather long time
EDL	03:09:16,415	03:09:19,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One must have a very strong and reliable organization
EDL	03:09:19,487	03:09:22,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Transport suppliers in finance system
EDL	03:09:22,559	03:09:24,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans had such means
EDL	03:09:24,095	03:09:25,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where's the belgae did not
EDL	03:09:26,655	03:09:27,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can any points out that
EDL	03:09:29,215	03:09:31,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wicked ability of the Romans to sort of make

EDL	03:09:36,895	03:09:38,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Deerbrook says quote
EDL	03:09:38,431	03:09:41,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But Caesar had still other means at his disposal
EDL	03:09:41,503	03:09:44,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He set up a camp on the North Bank of the Seine
EDL	03:09:44,575	03:09:45,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	River
EDL	03:09:45,599	03:09:47,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And his army was so well equipped with tools
EDL	03:09:48,159	03:09:51,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's Soldier so well disciplined and so well-trained in their techniques
EDL	03:09:51,999	03:09:55,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It was in the shortest possible time an impregnable Fortress stood there
EDL	03:09:56,607	03:09:57,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	03:09:59,423	03:10:00,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To give you an idea of size
EDL	03:10:00,703	03:10:04,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is in size vary depending on how large the Roman Forest that needed
EDL	03:10:04,543	03:10:05,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To be in the camp
EDL	03:10:05,567	03:10:06,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Happened to me but
EDL	03:10:06,847	03:10:09,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some of these camps could be well over a hundred acres in size
EDL	03:10:11,199	03:10:16,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they always had a ditch and I always had a rampart in the Roman soldiers carry sharpened Stakes when they marched
EDL	03:10:16,575	03:10:19,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Savannah at night they could stick those steaks into the Earth and Rampart so became a
EDL	03:10:20,415	03:10:21,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pincushion around the camp
EDL	03:10:22,975	03:10:28,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Guard towers walls and everyday the camp stayed in the same spot and didn't move it became
EDL	03:10:28,607	03:10:31,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	More sophisticated deeper more defensible more finished
EDL	03:10:34,751	03:10:41,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That you were there long enough Roman 10 switch were laid out on a prescribed Roman Road grid system which included a main

EDL	03:10:42,431	03:10:47,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This little Roman town is what it amounted to these tents would turn into cabins at that

EDL	03:10:49,343	03:10:50,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There be artillery
EDL	03:10:51,135	03:10:53,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they could put it up so fast
EDL	03:10:53,183	03:10:57,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Knows every said earlier I believe the Roman soldiers about half soldier in about half construction worker
EDL	03:10:58,303	03:11:00,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And a construction worker side
EDL	03:11:00,607	03:11:02,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Was more important than you might think
EDL	03:11:03,423	03:11:05,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You fans the Romans know already though it's
EDL	03:11:05,471	03:11:09,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Something that they brought to the table which was unusual there were other armies that could create
EDL	03:11:10,335	03:11:12,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some more obsessive about creating camps to
EDL	03:11:12,639	03:11:15,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Protect themselves for example when on campaign
EDL	03:11:15,711	03:11:20,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the Romans almost use their construction ability in an offensive way it's fabulous
EDL	03:11:21,087	03:11:23,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unless of course you're a call a component in which case

EDL	03:12:05,887	03:12:06,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From these weapons
EDL	03:12:06,911	03:12:12,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And by the way these weapons come in all shapes and sizes and the Very largest of them are rather enormous
EDL	03:12:14,079	03:12:16,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in this case most of the ones were talking about

EDL	03:13:35,487	03:13:39,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says the tribes come together and have a meeting and say
EDL	03:13:39,071	03:13:43,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We got to go home everybody's got to go back to their own home we know we can feed ourselves

EDL	03:14:38,463	03:14:41,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He sent his Cavalry running through
EDL	03:14:41,023	03:14:44,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These crowds of people spearing them shooting them

EDL	03:14:48,191	03:14:49,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And all of these
EDL	03:14:49,215	03:14:50,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Belgic tribes
EDL	03:14:50,751	03:14:56,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ran back to wherever their tribal Homeland was they seem to have decided that they were going to hold up most of the time in these
EDL	03:14:57,407	03:15:00,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hill forts of theirs which by the way if you've never seen one
EDL	03:15:00,735	03:15:03,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Go look at an aerial photo they're awesome
EDL	03:15:04,063	03:15:06,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Basically what these people did was find
EDL	03:15:06,367	03:15:12,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know nature is fortification where nature had crafted a wonderful area to defend and then added in a human

EDL	03:15:13,535	03:15:15,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Kimber hear some stone work there
EDL	03:15:15,839	03:15:18,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what have you but if you have a nice
EDL	03:15:18,143	03:15:19,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	White giant Hill
EDL	03:15:20,447	03:15:26,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you have maybe a nice river that curves around a whole side of it forming a defensive Optical I mean your you got a pretty good start
EDL	03:15:26,847	03:15:30,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A lot of these tribes maybe thought they could hold out in these locations and they were wrong
EDL	03:15:32,479	03:15:35,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Apparently all Caesar had to do was show up
EDL	03:15:35,039	03:15:36,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just some of these
EDL	03:15:36,063	03:15:38,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nasty scary tribes that he talked about
EDL	03:15:39,135	03:15:44,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the second they saw him they gave up One Tribe big nasty tribe tens of thousands of warriors
EDL	03:15:44,767	03:15:47,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says they saw the Roman Siege weapons and when timeout
EDL	03:15:48,095	03:15:49,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you're going to use those I'm out
EDL	03:15:50,655	03:15:53,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So overall by Roman technology there
EDL	03:15:53,215	03:15:55,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is another one of those big nasty tribes
EDL	03:15:55,519	03:15:59,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Didn't even get within 5 miles of their Hill for it and they were coming out to say we're done
EDL	03:16:00,639	03:16:02,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says the last of the big tribes
EDL	03:16:02,943	03:16:06,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It was opposing him where this tribe called the nervii or the nervi I
EDL	03:16:07,551	03:16:09,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Way up in the north right
EDL	03:16:09,855	03:16:11,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Scary nor he said that they
EDL	03:16:12,159	03:16:13,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Took their people there
EDL	03:16:13,695	03:16:15,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wives and their children and their elderly
EDL	03:16:15,999	03:16:22,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their animals and their baggage and possessions and they took him into the deep dark swamps with a Roman couldn't get them
EDL	03:16:23,167	03:16:25,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we're going to resist self course
EDL	03:16:25,983	03:16:28,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar takes the Army into the land of the nervia
EDL	03:16:29,823	03:16:31,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says one day
EDL	03:16:31,359	03:16:34,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know they're deciding where they're going to camp for the night
EDL	03:16:34,431	03:16:35,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We talked about that right
EDL	03:16:35,967	03:16:38,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A little obsessive about the camps but if you were
EDL	03:16:38,271	03:16:43,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As bad at scouting and reconnaissance as the Romans are always joked about being
EDL	03:16:43,391	03:16:48,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of my friends also said that behavior is bad it's gotten to the Romans are you better have a good camp with big walls and
EDL	03:16:49,279	03:16:49,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Towers
EDL	03:16:51,071	03:16:52,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case Caesar
EDL	03:16:52,607	03:16:59,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Has his army arriving in a long column down the road because where we like to talk about field battles all the time with understanding
EDL	03:16:59,007	03:17:04,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Most of the time these armies are on the move and when they're on the Move they're stretched out in a long line like a snake
EDL	03:17:04,127	03:17:05,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All the way into the distance
EDL	03:17:06,175	03:17:07,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Very vulnerable position to be in
EDL	03:17:09,247	03:17:11,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And when the head of the snake arrives
EDL	03:17:11,551	03:17:13,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the campsite for the night
EDL	03:17:13,343	03:17:17,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar tells those Legions that are their first to start building the cat
EDL	03:17:17,695	03:17:19,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The legions at the very
EDL	03:17:19,231	03:17:22,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tale of the snake won't be arriving for some time
EDL	03:17:23,839	03:17:29,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar chooses another one of these Hills that if you've been paying attention and likes all throughout his writings
EDL	03:17:29,215	03:17:30,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He likes an ice Hill
EDL	03:17:30,751	03:17:37,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They can put most of his army on its size-wise he likes a nice gentle slope on one side he loves it if you can have a tray
EDL	03:17:37,151	03:17:39,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Rain feature to Garda Flanagan in this case there's a river
EDL	03:17:40,223	03:17:42,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the bottom of the softly sloping Hill he says
EDL	03:17:42,783	03:17:44,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Only about three feet deep but it's there
EDL	03:17:45,087	03:17:48,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Benny says on the opposite side of the river is a mirror image of his Hill
EDL	03:17:49,439	03:17:53,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It slopes up from the river gently he says there's about two hundred paces
EDL	03:17:53,023	03:17:54,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So think about a couple of football fields
EDL	03:17:55,327	03:17:56,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obama
EDL	03:17:56,095	03:17:58,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sort of Open Country and then there's a wood
EDL	03:17:58,911	03:17:59,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Imma top of the hill
EDL	03:18:01,215	03:18:02,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Little Caesar has the
EDL	03:18:02,495	03:18:04,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Elite Legion put down their packs
EDL	03:18:04,799	03:18:10,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Interpret their military stuff aside get their hammers their nails the timber the shovels and begin making the camp and transform themselves
EDL	03:18:11,455	03:18:12,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Into these amazing
EDL	03:18:12,991	03:18:13,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Construction worker
EDL	03:18:14,527	03:18:16,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Meanwhile he says
EDL	03:18:16,063	03:18:18,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this could be open to
EDL	03:18:18,623	03:18:23,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Question by the way. What's about to happen here will learn Caesar some criticism during his own lifetime
EDL	03:18:24,511	03:18:26,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Enter military experts ever since
EDL	03:18:26,303	03:18:27,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But he says
EDL	03:18:28,095	03:18:34,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I put out my Cavalry in my light troops and had them screening this whole operation right to protect the owner

EDL	03:18:36,031	03:18:40,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know under construction at the moment as more and more of my troops arrived
EDL	03:18:40,383	03:18:41,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From the column
EDL	03:18:42,687	03:18:43,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Eventually Caesar will have
EDL	03:18:44,479	03:18:46,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Six Legions they're building the fort
EDL	03:18:46,783	03:18:48,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With more on the way
EDL	03:18:48,575	03:18:52,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he says my Cavalry is skirmishing with some of the belgae cavalry
EDL	03:18:52,671	03:18:59,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he says and then my baggage comes into view in the distance so the Roman baggage is in the middle of this long
EDL	03:18:59,071	03:19:02,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Columnar comes over the horizon and everyone can see it and he says when that happens
EDL	03:19:03,423	03:19:05,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's the signal for the Ambush to start
EDL	03:19:07,775	03:19:09,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says that there's an army
EDL	03:19:10,079	03:19:12,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I've never VI in the woods
EDL	03:19:13,151	03:19:14,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On the opposite Hill from suzhou
EDL	03:19:14,943	03:19:15,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An army
EDL	03:19:17,247	03:19:18,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is my friend said right
EDL	03:19:18,783	03:19:22,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you're going to be so bad at scouting you miss the army
EDL	03:19:22,367	03:19:26,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of Barbarians in the woods across from where you're building a camp you better have a strong camp
EDL	03:19:27,999	03:19:28,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case
EDL	03:19:29,535	03:19:35,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right around the time seizures Cavalry gets close enough to the woods maybe to figure out what's in there
EDL	03:19:35,167	03:19:37,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's in their charges out of the woods
EDL	03:19:37,727	03:19:41,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar salad at astonishing speed that's by Carolyn Hamm
EDL	03:19:41,311	03:19:43,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Carolyn Hammett has the great line astonishing speed
EDL	03:19:46,431	03:19:52,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Seizure then goes on to say that they brush aside his Cavalry and light infantry screen like an insect basically and they come
EDL	03:19:52,831	03:19:54,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Screaming down the hill
EDL	03:19:55,647	03:19:56,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now
EDL	03:19:56,415	03:19:58,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We have no idea
EDL	03:19:58,719	03:19:59,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How big does hell is
EDL	03:20:01,535	03:20:07,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All we can say is that they scream down that Hill they cross the 3-foot river they start up the next Hill
EDL	03:20:07,935	03:20:11,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Lil Ceaser in six Legions are on not ready for this
EDL	03:20:13,823	03:20:18,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now we talked earlier about why we chose this as a subject I said
EDL	03:20:18,431	03:20:20,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I was fascinated with a tribal people
EDL	03:20:20,991	03:20:23,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the situation that we seen all throughout history
EDL	03:20:24,063	03:20:29,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Trying to resist the encroachment of a more technologically and organizationally Superior
EDL	03:20:29,183	03:20:30,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are more efficient culture
EDL	03:20:30,975	03:20:35,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And I chose this one because unlike the Native American example of the African example
EDL	03:20:35,071	03:20:37,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These people had a chance to win
EDL	03:20:38,655	03:20:40,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now they were never the betting favorites
EDL	03:20:41,471	03:20:42,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the
EDL	03:20:42,239	03:20:46,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Way that they perform so far in battles against the Roman army demonstrates that
EDL	03:20:47,615	03:20:52,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The numbers are so much larger than what the North American Native Americans for example could have put together
EDL	03:20:52,991	03:20:55,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you can see why you got to give these people
EDL	03:20:55,807	03:20:58,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The corner boxing line the punchers chance
EDL	03:21:00,671	03:21:07,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Good luck figuring out how many people there are here if you're going to believe Caesar you're going to get up to number they're like 75
EDL	03:21:07,071	03:21:07,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Thousand
EDL	03:21:09,119	03:21:10,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Those seem absurd
EDL	03:21:10,655	03:21:14,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But there's a lot of Romans there and that's pretty confirmable so it's not going to be too low
EDL	03:21:14,751	03:21:17,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you said 20000
EDL	03:21:17,567	03:21:19,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's going to be
EDL	03:21:19,615	03:21:23,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Four times the largest Native American Force I've ever heard of
EDL	03:21:24,223	03:21:24,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	4 *
EDL	03:21:25,503	03:21:28,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we're talking about a charging Out of the Woods all at once
EDL	03:21:28,831	03:21:35,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	20000 would also be about how many Zulus were at that famous battle in the late 1800s where they wiped out
EDL	03:21:35,231	03:21:37,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A force of 13 or 14
EDL	03:21:38,815	03:21:39,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Soldiers from Britain
EDL	03:21:41,887	03:21:45,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the truth is it's probably larger than that so if you said 35,000
EDL	03:21:46,495	03:21:49,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	35000 man charging out of a Woods
EDL	03:21:50,079	03:21:56,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Within running distance from you and that's how long you have to get your act together before they hit you
EDL	03:21:56,735	03:22:00,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And try to blow you away like a wave blowing through
EDL	03:22:00,831	03:22:02,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A few bathers on the beach
EDL	03:22:04,415	03:22:05,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar goes into overdrive
EDL	03:22:06,975	03:22:07,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At this point
EDL	03:22:08,767	03:22:10,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you begin to see
EDL	03:22:11,071	03:22:14,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know what makes the guy so special he's not Alexander the Great
EDL	03:22:14,655	03:22:17,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Grabbing a spear and leading the Cavalry in charge
EDL	03:22:17,727	03:22:19,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cesar does grab a shield he says
EDL	03:22:20,031	03:22:22,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But he begins to go and demonstrate leadership
EDL	03:22:24,639	03:22:26,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He also says that these veteran troops
EDL	03:22:26,687	03:22:32,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Do a lot for themselves and Caesar had left their officers with him and so all of them would simply throw down there
EDL	03:22:32,319	03:22:34,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Work tools grab a weapon that they could find
EDL	03:22:34,879	03:22:41,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says their shields were still in the leather cases their helmets worn off and around and they just ran to the nearest standard
EDL	03:22:41,279	03:22:44,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They forgot anything about going to their own unit they're just trying to form
EDL	03:22:44,351	03:22:49,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A block of human beings that can resist this on Rush that's coming toward them at full running speed
EDL	03:22:51,519	03:22:54,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm not understand by tribesmen here
EDL	03:22:54,335	03:22:57,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are participating in a huge gamble because they certainly know
EDL	03:22:57,407	03:23:02,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That they are going to be like blown horses by the time they reach the Roman line
EDL	03:23:02,783	03:23:07,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They're taking this gamble that there won't be any Roman lines when they get there yet
EDL	03:23:07,647	03:23:12,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if they're going to be able to attack these Romans while they're still divided and in small
EDL	03:23:12,767	03:23:17,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Lumps that are unconnected to each other in which case they should be able to just blow them away
EDL	03:23:17,887	03:23:19,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the gamble is if they don't
EDL	03:23:19,935	03:23:21,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They're not going to have a whole lot less
EDL	03:23:21,983	03:23:25,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If this turns into any kind of a long-term slog they're doomed
EDL	03:23:26,847	03:23:32,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says he grabs a flag he says a couple of words of encouragement to the unit that he's with
EDL	03:23:32,223	03:23:37,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Before going to the next unit to talk to them about the time he gets to the next unit they're already engaged
EDL	03:23:39,647	03:23:41,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is a moment here
EDL	03:23:41,439	03:23:43,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With these Legions and Caesar with the
EDL	03:23:43,999	03:23:45,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Could easily be overrun
EDL	03:23:46,559	03:23:51,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it allows us to play with some counterfactual we haven't really been able to discuss yet the first counterfactual is
EDL	03:23:52,703	03:23:53,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What is Caesar loses here
EDL	03:23:55,263	03:23:57,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The second counterfactual is
EDL	03:23:57,311	03:23:58,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What if Caesar dies here
EDL	03:24:00,895	03:24:01,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the first case
EDL	03:24:01,919	03:24:03,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we had said earlier that
EDL	03:24:03,455	03:24:04,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Roman expansion into
EDL	03:24:05,503	03:24:06,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tribal
EDL	03:24:06,271	03:24:11,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Territory the rich tribal territory to the north of them seemed inevitable just like manifest destiny
EDL	03:24:12,671	03:24:14,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But maybe the question to ask is how many
EDL	03:24:15,487	03:24:18,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Deaths would it take to make something that seemed inevitable
EDL	03:24:19,327	03:24:20,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not inevitable anymore
EDL	03:24:22,399	03:24:25,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because we can see that only about 65 years after
EDL	03:24:25,727	03:24:26,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This battle
EDL	03:24:27,007	03:24:29,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans will be ambushed by another tribe of people
EDL	03:24:29,311	03:24:34,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	4 tribes of people this time in Germany modern-day Germany and they're probably what we could call German
EDL	03:24:36,735	03:24:38,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They will destroy
EDL	03:24:38,271	03:24:41,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This Roman army a famous battle called the teutoburg evolved
EDL	03:24:42,367	03:24:44,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In 980 I believe it is
EDL	03:24:44,927	03:24:50,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Roman Commander will commit suicide on the battlefield to avoid falling into the hands
EDL	03:24:51,071	03:24:52,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Apus Barbarian opponents
EDL	03:24:53,119	03:24:56,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which if you believe the hype top Roman sources
EDL	03:24:56,959	03:25:03,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is a good thing to do because the Romans conduct is his legendary would be a good way to prevent legendary
EDL	03:25:03,359	03:25:04,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Asian a couple years after that
EDL	03:25:04,895	03:25:05,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Beaten debacle
EDL	03:25:06,431	03:25:09,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To recover what's left of their dead comrades
EDL	03:25:09,759	03:25:14,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they go into the deep dark forest and supposedly they the Allura details of
EDL	03:25:14,367	03:25:16,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A Roman skeletons
EDL	03:25:16,415	03:25:20,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is stapled to the trees and piles of skulls and religious
EDL	03:25:21,535	03:25:22,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Alters with
EDL	03:25:22,559	03:25:28,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're dead Romans and blood everywhere I mean just this horrible tribal nightmarish
EDL	03:25:28,959	03:25:30,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Visitation of all
EDL	03:25:30,495	03:25:33,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Shall we say the native frustration at the situation
EDL	03:25:34,591	03:25:40,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you have the famous story of the Roman Emperor at the time who will beat his head against the wall and supposedly yelled the name of the jet
EDL	03:25:40,991	03:25:44,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	General who killed himself Beres and say there is give me back my Legions
EDL	03:25:45,855	03:25:48,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That was only about 15000 Dead Romans
EDL	03:25:49,439	03:25:53,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And whatever happened there was one of the main components supposedly
EDL	03:25:53,791	03:25:58,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That made the Romans decide you know what we don't need to advance any farther in Germany anymore
EDL	03:25:58,399	03:26:01,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a good place to just set the border and we'll expand elsewhere
EDL	03:26:02,495	03:26:07,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If that really played that large of a role in the Romans decided not to go into Germany any farther
EDL	03:26:08,127	03:26:08,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What is
EDL	03:26:09,151	03:26:10,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar lost
EDL	03:26:10,175	03:26:11,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Twice that many men
EDL	03:26:11,711	03:26:12,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At this bar
EDL	03:26:13,503	03:26:16,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what is twice that many men
EDL	03:26:16,063	03:26:18,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the larger scheme of things what you say
EDL	03:26:18,111	03:26:21,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Chica the natives have ever done anything to short-circuit manifest destiny
EDL	03:26:21,951	03:26:23,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well I don't know what if they killed
EDL	03:26:23,999	03:26:27,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	30000 American soldiers in an afternoon
EDL	03:26:27,583	03:26:28,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I went and did the math
EDL	03:26:29,631	03:26:30,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you know these numbers are
EDL	03:26:31,423	03:26:32,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Debatable
EDL	03:26:32,191	03:26:38,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Too but I went to some common sources and I added up all of the combat deaths that the United States has suffer
EDL	03:26:38,847	03:26:42,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From the wars of Independence when we got our independence in this country
EDL	03:26:42,431	03:26:44,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Up until the first world war start
EDL	03:26:44,735	03:26:49,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then I subtracted the Civil War because those are crazy dance and everybody on both sides dying as in America
EDL	03:26:49,855	03:26:50,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Casualty
EDL	03:26:50,623	03:26:51,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So
EDL	03:26:51,391	03:26:56,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Total us combat deaths excluding the Civil War up to 1917 and it's
EDL	03:26:56,511	03:26:58,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Almost certainly under 30000
EDL	03:27:00,863	03:27:01,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you lost
EDL	03:27:01,887	03:27:07,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All the people you lost from Independence to the first world war minus the Civil War in an afternoon

EDL	03:29:35,487	03:29:37,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And begin to smash into the flank

EDL	03:31:07,647	03:31:11,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And remember when Caesar writes Caesar he's talking about himself in the third person quote
EDL	03:31:13,279	03:31:17,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	After addressing the 10th Legion Caesar had gone to the right wing

EDL	03:31:19,423	03:31:25,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The cohorts of the 12th Legion were packed together so closely that the men were in one another's way and could not fight

EDL	03:31:46,815	03:31:50,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The man's movements were slow and some in the rear
EDL	03:31:50,143	03:31:54,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Feeling themselves abandoned we're retiring from the fight and trying to get out of rain

EDL	03:31:56,031	03:31:59,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The enemy maintained unceasing pressure up the hill in front
EDL	03:31:59,359	03:32:01,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we're also closing in on both flanks
EDL	03:32:01,663	03:32:04,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As the situation was critical and no reserves were available
EDL	03:32:05,503	03:32:08,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cesar snack The Shield from a soldier in the rear
EDL	03:32:08,575	03:32:10,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He had not his own shield with him
EDL	03:32:10,623	03:32:17,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Made his way into the front line address each century and by name and shouted encouragement to the rest

EDL	03:32:30,591	03:32:33,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Apparel in the enemy's assault was slow down a little
EDL	03:32:33,919	03:32:34,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	03:32:36,223	03:32:40,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the legion next door to that was having even worse trouble so Caesar ran over there
EDL	03:32:41,343	03:32:43,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Go to the commanders of that Force 2
EDL	03:32:43,903	03:32:50,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put his soldiers into a square so that they couldn't be out flanking attack from the rear anymore in that stabilize that's
EDL	03:32:50,303	03:32:50,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Situation
EDL	03:32:53,119	03:32:56,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Historian Adrian goldsworthy writes about this moment saying that
EDL	03:32:56,703	03:33:01,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar had stabilized the situation on the right flank but the collapse was still Eminem
EDL	03:33:01,823	03:33:02,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Was just a matter of time
EDL	03:33:03,615	03:33:04,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The
EDL	03:33:04,639	03:33:07,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Celtic force was battering these Romans down
EDL	03:33:08,735	03:33:09,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But two things happen
EDL	03:33:10,527	03:33:13,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But ended up having the same effect on this battle
EDL	03:33:13,855	03:33:20,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As the Romans having a third reserve line has done in the previous battle remember they don't have a reserve line
EDL	03:33:20,255	03:33:21,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They don't have a line
EDL	03:33:21,279	03:33:22,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They're not deployed
EDL	03:33:23,071	03:33:25,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What ends up happening is those Romans that had
EDL	03:33:25,375	03:33:31,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Victorious initially on the left side and gone and capture the Barbarian camp on the opposite Hill or now he
EDL	03:33:31,775	03:33:34,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Able to look down and see the problem that Caesar was facing
EDL	03:33:34,847	03:33:36,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So they began to come down the hill
EDL	03:33:36,639	03:33:38,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To renew the fight themselves Plus
EDL	03:33:38,943	03:33:42,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The legions in the very end of the column
EDL	03:33:42,015	03:33:43,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The tale of the snake
EDL	03:33:44,319	03:33:45,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Have finally
EDL	03:33:45,599	03:33:48,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And I've gotten to the top of the hill and look down and see what's going on
EDL	03:33:49,183	03:33:51,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they now enter The Fray
EDL	03:33:51,231	03:33:57,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So even though Caesar wasn't able to create the traditional Roman 3rd line reserve line to throw in in
EDL	03:33:57,631	03:33:58,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When everything
EDL	03:33:58,399	03:34:00,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We're going to hell in a handbasket
EDL	03:34:00,191	03:34:03,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The circumstances had an effect created one
EDL	03:34:03,775	03:34:09,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An allegiant that came down after capturing the Celtic camp and the ones that came up from the rear of the baggage train

EDL	03:34:22,463	03:34:25,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The arrival of fresh troops is the worst thing that could have
EDL	03:34:27,583	03:34:28,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But Caesar says they were
EDL	03:34:28,607	03:34:29,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tough
EDL	03:34:29,375	03:34:30,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They were ferocious

EDL	03:36:41,471	03:36:44,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the tribes that was coming to help the nervi I never made it to the battle

EDL	03:36:54,783	03:36:56,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How confusing incident involving
EDL	03:36:56,831	03:36:58,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know the deals of a surrender that
EDL	03:36:58,879	03:37:05,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe were misinterpreted none the less bad things happen so Caesar eventually had to storm the town kill a lot of people
EDL	03:37:05,279	03:37:07,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He says he sold 53000

EDL	03:37:10,399	03:37:12,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And point out that he sold them all in one lot

EDL	03:37:19,359	03:37:21,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Say you got 53000 at a bargain price

EDL	03:38:00,319	03:38:04,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Say but no one knows because it's not like we have a financial
EDL	03:38:04,159	03:38:06,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Statement on how Caesars doing each year
EDL	03:38:06,975	03:38:11,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you stopped hearing about seizures terrible Financial crunches now and he's
EDL	03:38:11,839	03:38:13,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He seemed Distributing money more
EDL	03:38:14,399	03:38:20,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's allegedly paying his troops more than the going rate and he's sharing the winnings with them which is pretty normal but if you're doing
EDL	03:38:20,799	03:38:21,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Doing really well
EDL	03:38:21,823	03:38:23,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The winnings can be really good
EDL	03:38:24,639	03:38:25,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And as a side note
EDL	03:38:26,431	03:38:28,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All of you who know the Roman story understand this
EDL	03:38:28,991	03:38:31,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's a process underway here that will play
EDL	03:38:32,063	03:38:36,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know mightily into the destruction of the Roman Republic very soon and that's the
EDL	03:38:37,439	03:38:39,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Allegiance of this Army
EDL	03:38:39,743	03:38:44,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not necessarily being 100% entirely to the Senate and people of Rome
EDL	03:38:45,375	03:38:47,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But increasingly more and more
EDL	03:38:47,679	03:38:48,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To this man
EDL	03:38:49,215	03:38:50,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Julius Caesar
EDL	03:38:51,263	03:38:54,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he's far from the only Roman general this is happening to
EDL	03:38:54,591	03:38:55,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His
EDL	03:38:55,615	03:38:58,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fellow members of the triumvirate are getting into similar situation
EDL	03:39:00,991	03:39:02,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the allegiance of the truth because
EDL	03:39:03,295	03:39:09,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know how they're doing in life is so dependent on that single figure at the head of their particular Army when they were Legion ship
EDL	03:39:09,695	03:39:13,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gifts from the state to a single individual you can see how the recipe for disaster is just
EDL	03:39:14,303	03:39:18,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Will the chain reaction is already started right drums problems go deep into the distance but
EDL	03:39:18,655	03:39:20,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That's a key component that has to happen
EDL	03:39:20,959	03:39:22,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what I always tell people
EDL	03:39:22,751	03:39:23,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I think they see
EDL	03:39:23,775	03:39:25,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Parallels with the United States today
EDL	03:39:26,335	03:39:28,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the Roman Republic is yes there's there are some
EDL	03:39:29,151	03:39:31,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you're missing that key component and it's important
EDL	03:39:32,735	03:39:35,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We don't have armies that are beholding the single
EDL	03:39:35,551	03:39:38,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Military individuals more than they are the state
EDL	03:39:38,111	03:39:43,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Increasingly is this Army and Cesar bond together and share the fruits of their labors they are
EDL	03:39:45,535	03:39:51,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So the question of whether Caesars in debt anymore seems to be that he probably isn't and in fact this little business
EDL	03:39:51,935	03:39:52,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Adventure
EDL	03:39:52,959	03:39:55,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gall is working out pretty well indeed
EDL	03:39:55,775	03:40:01,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So Caesar says after this little battle with the belgae he sends a message to Rome and he says
EDL	03:40:02,687	03:40:03,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And let me find out
EDL	03:40:03,967	03:40:06,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not for the last time in his commentary
EDL	03:40:07,295	03:40:09,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gaul is pacified
EDL	03:40:11,391	03:40:12,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now let me stop
EDL	03:40:12,927	03:40:15,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because if you say not for the last time
EDL	03:40:15,743	03:40:21,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is Gaul really pacify because again you have to wonder what Caesars doing here he may have had a whole lot of reason
EDL	03:40:22,399	03:40:24,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For going back to Rome at this time.
EDL	03:40:24,959	03:40:27,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And telling them pay the war's over and we won
EDL	03:40:28,031	03:40:32,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can see some advisor going to listen to Caesar you have no idea what it's like on the ground in Rome right now we're trying to get
EDL	03:40:32,639	03:40:37,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These people elected to the Senate you would really help if the timing we're going you said we won in Gaul right now
EDL	03:40:38,271	03:40:40,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I guess what I'm saying is I trust Caesar and his intelligence
EDL	03:40:41,343	03:40:42,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Both his
EDL	03:40:42,111	03:40:43,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mental intelligence at his reconnaissance
EDL	03:40:44,415	03:40:45,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Enough to think
EDL	03:40:46,463	03:40:52,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That I doubt whether he thought Gaul really was pacified because let's look at what just happened to your into campaign season
EDL	03:40:52,863	03:40:53,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Less than 2 years
EDL	03:40:54,655	03:40:57,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar conquered a place the size of Texas
EDL	03:40:58,751	03:40:59,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ploutarxos
EDL	03:41:00,287	03:41:02,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	300 tribes
EDL	03:41:03,615	03:41:04,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Really
EDL	03:41:04,383	03:41:07,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you expected to stay subdued
EDL	03:41:08,735	03:41:11,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well if he did expect that he was wrong
EDL	03:41:11,807	03:41:14,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if you didn't well there must have been another reason for
EDL	03:41:14,879	03:41:17,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Telling the people back in Rome that the war was over
EDL	03:41:17,951	03:41:23,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar in a rare obvious Bragg in the commentaries points out that when the Romans heard
EDL	03:41:23,839	03:41:28,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The teacher had just wanted ghaul they proclaimed 15 days of Thanksgiving in the capital
EDL	03:41:29,471	03:41:30,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which Caesar points out
EDL	03:41:31,007	03:41:36,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is a longer. Of time than anyone before him at ever had a Thanksgiving declared in their honor
EDL	03:41:37,919	03:41:38,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So maybe that
EDL	03:41:39,199	03:41:40,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For it right there
EDL	03:41:41,247	03:41:42,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Let's remember
EDL	03:41:42,527	03:41:46,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Why Caesars in Gaul doing all this
EDL	03:41:46,111	03:41:46,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To begin with
EDL	03:41:47,903	03:41:49,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because of how it's looking back home
EDL	03:41:50,207	03:41:53,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	15 days of Thanksgiving an unprecedented amount
EDL	03:41:54,047	03:41:57,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That makes it all worth it right there doesn't depends on what your goals are of course
EDL	03:42:00,447	03:42:03,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now the other thing that needs to be pointed out here is how victory
EDL	03:42:03,775	03:42:04,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Heather Way
EDL	03:42:05,311	03:42:07,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Forgiving everything
EDL	03:42:07,871	03:42:08,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because
EDL	03:42:08,639	03:42:11,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There is an undercurrent in a row my mom
EDL	03:42:11,199	03:42:17,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Prominent individuals admittedly prominent individuals that don't like Caesar anyway and would find something to get him with
EDL	03:42:17,599	03:42:18,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If they could anywhere
EDL	03:42:19,647	03:42:22,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But what seizures doing is grossly illegal on many fronts
EDL	03:42:24,767	03:42:26,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's raised
EDL	03:42:26,047	03:42:26,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Legions
EDL	03:42:27,327	03:42:29,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Out of his own pocket booking without permission
EDL	03:42:31,167	03:42:33,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His opponents in Rome
EDL	03:42:33,215	03:42:36,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I pointed out things that he's done during this campaign
EDL	03:42:36,543	03:42:42,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That are violations of Roman honor and one or two of them will suggest maybe he should be handed over
EDL	03:42:42,943	03:42:46,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To the former Roman enemies as a
EDL	03:42:46,527	03:42:48,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well slippery this way the Romans have done that before
EDL	03:42:49,087	03:42:51,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who are some Roman General on the ground made a deal with
EDL	03:42:51,647	03:42:52,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Another city
EDL	03:42:52,927	03:42:56,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Came back the Roman senate repudiated the deal
EDL	03:42:56,511	03:43:02,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sent the general back to the former opponents in Chains left him outside of in front of the front gate and said sorry he couldn't make a deal
EDL	03:43:02,911	03:43:05,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You like that does against Roman honor but since he did here you can have him do it
EDL	03:43:05,983	03:43:07,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what you want
EDL	03:43:08,287	03:43:08,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Never people
EDL	03:43:09,311	03:43:12,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know of the Cato Camp they were maybe suggestion Caesar deserve treatment
EDL	03:43:12,895	03:43:15,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like that but very few people were listening you know why
EDL	03:43:16,479	03:43:18,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cuz the guy just conquered and area
EDL	03:43:18,783	03:43:21,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Larger than all of Italy itself
EDL	03:43:21,599	03:43:22,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Into campaign season
EDL	03:43:23,903	03:43:25,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can hear the
EDL	03:43:25,183	03:43:31,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Crowd going wrong number one I mean come on when in human history
EDL	03:43:31,327	03:43:34,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Have the populist not celebrated unbelievable Victor
EDL	03:43:34,399	03:43:36,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's almost weird to imagine
EDL	03:43:36,959	03:43:39,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The general public ever doing the opposite
EDL	03:43:41,567	03:43:45,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So what it took for is easier to get these victories legal or illegal
EDL	03:43:45,919	03:43:47,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are totally overshadowed by the result
EDL	03:43:49,247	03:43:53,087	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The result may be an illusion now Caesar says that after
EDL	03:43:53,087	03:43:55,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's done here he goes and starts to look at
EDL	03:43:55,647	03:43:59,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The next big adventure he's going to do is between illegal to go into Italy around where
EDL	03:44:00,511	03:44:01,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know the modern
EDL	03:44:01,535	03:44:07,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Adriatic is he's going to start conference and try to that which had been a plan of his all along but now they call is pacify her
EDL	03:44:07,935	03:44:10,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He can put some time into it nieces while he's there
EDL	03:44:10,495	03:44:12,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gall erupts back into war
EDL	03:44:14,335	03:44:18,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It happened so fast you can't help but wonder if it was ever pacified at all
EDL	03:44:19,199	03:44:23,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And there been some theories floated in a bunch of books I've read lately which I think is facet
EDL	03:44:23,551	03:44:27,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm going to run past you cuz it would make a lot of sense winded and it's the idea
EDL	03:44:28,159	03:44:33,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That may be the reason Gul almost immediately erupts into trouble after Caesar says it
EDL	03:44:33,023	03:44:33,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Pacified
EDL	03:44:33,791	03:44:39,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is it maybe they didn't fully understand what they were agreeing to when they said that they were going to submit to Raw
EDL	03:44:39,935	03:44:42,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Redwoods Rome is treating them as though they have signed a contract
EDL	03:44:43,263	03:44:44,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And if you break the contract
EDL	03:44:45,055	03:44:47,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The ramifications are
EDL	03:44:47,359	03:44:50,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a mafia-style in nature so don't break the contract
EDL	03:44:50,943	03:44:53,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And maybe like a bunch of Native Americans
EDL	03:44:53,759	03:44:58,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For expected to read like a lawyer this treaty and yet they can hardly write their names
EDL	03:44:58,623	03:45:00,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the white man's language
EDL	03:45:00,415	03:45:06,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe these Celtic leaders were essentially taken for a ride their Barbarian lawyer is not as good as the Roman ones
EDL	03:45:07,071	03:45:13,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And maybe as soon as they started living under the real terms of the deal maybe was a little different than they thought of what he just during the Great lie
EDL	03:45:13,471	03:45:18,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's a beast tribes were accustomed to making themselves clients of other Barbarian people
EDL	03:45:19,359	03:45:21,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Very well may have treated them
EDL	03:45:21,663	03:45:26,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a much more laissez-faire hands-off kind of fashion that might have been
EDL	03:45:26,527	03:45:28,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their idea of a client in their world
EDL	03:45:28,575	03:45:34,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But now the Romans were coming in and these are going to send the fence surveyors to your property let's see where the property line is your we're going to
EDL	03:45:34,975	03:45:41,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some former Soldier veterans on part of your property to take your son into the army and oh yeah I'll taxes are going up this year we need extra
EDL	03:45:41,375	03:45:43,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Weed cuz the army star but I mean whatever it might be
EDL	03:45:43,679	03:45:44,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The garlic people are
EDL	03:45:45,471	03:45:47,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Chafing at what it's like to be Roman
EDL	03:45:49,311	03:45:53,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But now I think we get to the Crux question that we started this talk out with
EDL	03:45:53,407	03:45:55,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you know what would you be willing to sacrifice everything
EDL	03:45:56,479	03:45:57,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you are
EDL	03:45:57,503	03:45:58,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Chafing
EDL	03:45:58,527	03:46:02,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Another word I just used to get chafing from Roman domination
EDL	03:46:02,879	03:46:07,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At what point is the chafing bad enough for you to risk having the Romans come back
EDL	03:46:08,255	03:46:10,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Beat you in some sort of field battle
EDL	03:46:11,071	03:46:12,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Kill you
EDL	03:46:12,351	03:46:16,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It would be sick before kill you kill your son's rape your wife send your daughters off to slavery Destroyer
EDL	03:46:17,471	03:46:19,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At what point is chafing bad enough
EDL	03:46:19,775	03:46:22,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then you begin to get into this question of human motivation
EDL	03:46:24,383	03:46:26,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What is it that's worth risking that
EDL	03:46:26,175	03:46:26,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Kind of
EDL	03:46:27,711	03:46:28,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Terrible outcome for
EDL	03:46:31,551	03:46:32,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says it's liberty
EDL	03:46:34,367	03:46:36,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And freedom and Independence and that's
EDL	03:46:36,927	03:46:37,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Weird
EDL	03:46:37,695	03:46:39,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not because those are weird motivations
EDL	03:46:40,511	03:46:42,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Topeka Caesars the guy
EDL	03:46:42,815	03:46:44,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who's going to stamp out these people
EDL	03:46:45,887	03:46:48,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And once again he's giving them aspirations
EDL	03:46:49,215	03:46:54,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That we can sort of relate to that make them sympathetic characters to us in the same way he's put
EDL	03:46:55,359	03:47:00,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're the voice of an almost war crimes prosecutor in the mouth of his German opponent
EDL	03:47:00,223	03:47:01,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ariovistus
EDL	03:47:01,759	03:47:02,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's going to put
EDL	03:47:03,551	03:47:09,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the words of people like Patrick Henry Give me liberty or give me death and all those kind of people into the mouths of these
EDL	03:47:09,951	03:47:10,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is Golic opponents
EDL	03:47:11,487	03:47:13,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who's Liberty he is smashing
EDL	03:47:15,327	03:47:19,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's fascinating and again it's very complicated I don't fully understand it
EDL	03:47:19,167	03:47:22,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I enjoyed Andrew and Rigby's book as I said on the
EDL	03:47:22,239	03:47:23,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On the whole analysis
EDL	03:47:23,775	03:47:29,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But no consensus exist they just analyze the three-dimensional chess game Caesars playing
EDL	03:47:30,687	03:47:32,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And of course the first question we all ask
EDL	03:47:32,479	03:47:33,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Friday's
EDL	03:47:33,247	03:47:39,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If Caesar says that these people are fighting for Liberty and freedom in when he puts words into their speeches and they talk about
EDL	03:47:39,647	03:47:42,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Liberty and freedom what the heck do people Barbarian people
EDL	03:47:43,231	03:47:48,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	2000 years ago mean when they say that or Caesars putting those words into their mouth and their Caesars words
EDL	03:47:48,863	03:47:50,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What does Cesar mean for it to me
EDL	03:47:53,215	03:47:57,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	According to Andrew Rigsby it's just what you think it means maybe only more so
EDL	03:47:57,823	03:48:01,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He writes the word and then gives you the Latin word Caesar actually use he says quote
EDL	03:48:03,455	03:48:09,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Freedom libertas wasn't even more politically charged term for the Roman senate is generally today
EDL	03:48:09,599	03:48:13,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Prettiest deeply rooted in the pervasive social institution of slavery
EDL	03:48:13,951	03:48:20,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Despite the many and varied situations to which it was applied libertas remained a powerful
EDL	03:48:20,351	03:48:23,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Slogan because if it's unambiguously positive primary sense
EDL	03:48:24,447	03:48:25,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Conversely
EDL	03:48:25,471	03:48:27,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Slavery servatis
EDL	03:48:27,519	03:48:33,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Recalled the degradation of slaves seen daily in a society which as we have already noted
EDL	03:48:33,663	03:48:35,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Personal dignity was a fighting matter
EDL	03:48:36,479	03:48:36,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	03:48:38,271	03:48:39,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In other words
EDL	03:48:39,295	03:48:41,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know Caesars basically giving
EDL	03:48:41,599	03:48:43,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An excuse for these rebellions
EDL	03:48:44,415	03:48:45,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To the Gauls
EDL	03:48:45,695	03:48:52,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But he says right away right is it a question of Freedom versus slavery and pliant Romans understand that it would never settle.
EDL	03:48:52,095	03:48:52,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To be slaves
EDL	03:48:52,863	03:48:58,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And that we today look at and go will I can fully see with the Gulzar about because I'd be on their side to
EDL	03:48:59,007	03:49:05,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's a very interesting document and it says a lot about the tenor of the times in the audience he was writing for the he
EDL	03:49:05,407	03:49:07,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He could position the whole story this way
EDL	03:49:07,711	03:49:14,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And still expect you to cheer on his victories when he crushes these freedom-loving calls right to pets really
EDL	03:49:14,111	03:49:14,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What they were
EDL	03:49:16,927	03:49:18,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And just with every
EDL	03:49:18,463	03:49:20,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Story of Revolution by the way
EDL	03:49:20,255	03:49:26,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For every account you hear of the Gauls trying to preserve their own liberty and freedom in a very high-minded Patrick Henry send
EDL	03:49:26,911	03:49:29,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You will read the accounts that get much more greedy
EDL	03:49:29,471	03:49:31,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And describe much more
EDL	03:49:31,263	03:49:37,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Base values to the people who are doing these things in this particular group run by this Aristocrat wants
EDL	03:49:37,663	03:49:43,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	More power within his try but Roman domination uniforms his Ambitions so he's wanting Revolution
EDL	03:49:44,063	03:49:50,463	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When the southern tribe who used to collect all the tolls on this River before the Romans took over but now they favor the Rival tribe
EDL	03:49:50,463	03:49:53,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And so you know receipts are down from the river tolls so we're going to rebell

EDL	03:58:15,551	03:58:16,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The positive comments
EDL	03:58:17,855	03:58:19,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By the way little side note here
EDL	03:58:20,159	03:58:24,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The debate is ongoing whether or not these people in the British Isles
EDL	03:58:24,511	03:58:27,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	During this period should be classified as

EDL	03:58:27,839	03:58:28,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or not
EDL	03:58:29,119	03:58:31,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And again we're not talking in terms of ethnicity is much a
EDL	03:58:31,679	03:58:32,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Culture
EDL	03:58:32,959	03:58:35,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's a little confusing cuz Caesar says
EDL	03:58:35,263	03:58:39,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of these tribes that lived on the now French side of the English Channel
EDL	03:58:39,359	03:58:41,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did some migrating over
EDL	03:58:41,151	03:58:45,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So when Caesar goes to Britain and describes people that sure sound Celtic
EDL	03:58:45,247	03:58:49,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They sound a lot like the people we've been talking about in terms of their dress and their Styles in there
EDL	03:58:49,599	03:58:51,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Attitudes in the religion War.
EDL	03:58:52,415	03:58:58,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You don't know whether or not he's running into that one tribe or whether or not the people all through the rest of it I need the

EDL	03:59:01,119	03:59:03,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm not qualified the way into this ongoing debate
EDL	03:59:03,935	03:59:07,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Apparently Caesar doesn't refer to them specifically as Celts
EDL	03:59:07,519	03:59:13,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the ancient world that used a different name for them and I'm going to use my very kind of get out of jail free card and say that a Celtic
EDL	03:59:13,919	03:59:16,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is anyone who consider themselves to be Celtic I don't know
EDL	03:59:18,015	03:59:20,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Caesars obviously created a problem
EDL	03:59:20,575	03:59:23,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Not a hard one to imagine happening either when he takes a
EDL	03:59:23,647	03:59:25,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Big chunk of his army

EDL	04:02:32,575	04:02:33,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The guy bolts
EDL	04:02:34,623	04:02:41,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Basically showing his true colors Caesar would basically have you understand he's just uncovered and unmask this conspiracy he sends
EDL	04:02:41,023	04:02:43,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just meant to go bring this guy back Dead or Alive they bringing back dead

EDL	04:02:59,199	04:03:05,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because you're some of these tribes have large numbers of people that are of a different political opinion than what them

EDL	04:03:57,311	04:04:02,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the Roman standard policy of how you deal with these troublemakers everywhere you encounter them

EDL	04:08:40,191	04:08:46,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well probably hero in the Gully guys with the bad guy the Roman story have your ex is going to be pursued as if to the end
EDL	04:08:46,591	04:08:47,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	End of the Earth
EDL	04:08:47,359	04:08:49,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar has this ongoing
EDL	04:08:49,407	04:08:54,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know what temp to track him down he finally hasn't getting away and riding off into the sunset with like only for
EDL	04:08:54,527	04:08:57,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bodyguardz is the only amount of people he would trust his life to
EDL	04:08:59,391	04:09:05,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of course it's a good end of the movie it mean that the Geronimo figure here from the Roman point-of-view gets away
EDL	04:09:05,791	04:09:08,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Lives to ride another day off into the sunset whatever
EDL	04:09:09,887	04:09:12,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But unfortunately it's whole tribe can't do that
EDL	04:09:12,959	04:09:14,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar will
EDL	04:09:15,519	04:09:16,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wipe them out of existence
EDL	04:09:18,847	04:09:23,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well that's the way he frames It Anyway historians are not sure if that was really what happened
EDL	04:09:23,711	04:09:29,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's pretty fair to say though that Caesar treats this tribe to tribe the damn your ex was a leading figure in
EDL	04:09:30,623	04:09:34,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As harshly or more harshly than any other entity
EDL	04:09:34,719	04:09:36,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cesar punished in his career
EDL	04:09:40,095	04:09:43,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And so you might think to yourself okay now that these people have seen
EDL	04:09:43,935	04:09:45,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What almost everything is
EDL	04:09:45,471	04:09:47,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is the Romans after this. We'll start going after
EDL	04:09:48,287	04:09:50,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic cultural things that they think are
EDL	04:09:51,359	04:09:52,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Inciting revolt
EDL	04:09:52,895	04:09:56,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or bringing tribes together we mentioned Druids earlier
EDL	04:09:56,223	04:09:57,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's a pan
EDL	04:09:57,759	04:10:02,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tribal nature to these Druids maybe where they come together from multiple tribes
EDL	04:10:02,623	04:10:04,671	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In meetings to debate things and it
EDL	04:10:04,671	04:10:09,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At certain points after this. The Romans will think that the Druids are sold of a hotbed of resistance
EDL	04:10:10,303	04:10:16,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Target then the Romans could be very accommodating to your local Traditions as long as you didn't mess with them
EDL	04:10:16,703	04:10:22,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you cause trouble and they decided that these local Traditions had something to do with it goodbye local traditions
EDL	04:10:23,103	04:10:24,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So this is where
EDL	04:10:24,127	04:10:26,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some who will say that maybe we're not talking about
EDL	04:10:27,199	04:10:32,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An actual genocide here as much as we're talking about a cultural genocide may have a point there
EDL	04:10:33,855	04:10:34,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As we said before
EDL	04:10:34,879	04:10:37,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Genocide question is somewhat
EDL	04:10:37,951	04:10:38,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Clouded by the fact
EDL	04:10:39,487	04:10:42,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the people in this story have a choice
EDL	04:10:42,815	04:10:45,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unlike those involved in the Second World War
EDL	04:10:45,631	04:10:48,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Write the choices submit and stay quiet or die
EDL	04:10:50,495	04:10:52,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How does having a choice like that
EDL	04:10:53,055	04:10:58,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Make this sort of a holocaust if indeed that's the proper term for the Celtic Holocaust
EDL	04:10:58,175	04:11:00,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How does having a choice make it different
EDL	04:11:00,735	04:11:01,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cuz it obviously does
EDL	04:11:02,271	04:11:05,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From something like what the victims of the second world war Holocaust went through
EDL	04:11:07,647	04:11:10,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I would also be remiss if I didn't at least point out
EDL	04:11:10,975	04:11:14,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But this idea of choice may have been in illusion
EDL	04:11:14,559	04:11:15,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For most of the
EDL	04:11:16,095	04:11:16,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Story
EDL	04:11:16,863	04:11:20,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar himself sad and I don't know how well we can believe him
EDL	04:11:20,191	04:11:22,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That they were really only three class
EDL	04:11:23,007	04:11:25,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Do use a modern term in the garlic
EDL	04:11:25,055	04:11:26,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Society
EDL	04:11:26,079	04:11:27,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You had the knights
EDL	04:11:27,871	04:11:31,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're basically the aristocracy in the nobility you had The Druids
EDL	04:11:31,455	04:11:34,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then you had everyone else he said everyone else is basically a Slave
EDL	04:11:36,063	04:11:38,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is probably Roman hyperbole in
EDL	04:11:38,623	04:11:41,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And misinformation what not archaeologists like Barry cunliffe
EDL	04:11:42,719	04:11:45,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And John Collins will point out that there's a lot more
EDL	04:11:45,791	04:11:49,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Nuance to something like that than Caesar points out but
EDL	04:11:49,119	04:11:52,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His point might be well taken how many people if you give the
EDL	04:11:52,703	04:11:53,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Choice of
EDL	04:11:53,983	04:12:00,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know if you just acquiesce to Roman conquest and submit everything will be fine but if you don't you're all going to die
EDL	04:12:00,383	04:12:03,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You sold into slavery how many people get to make that choice in that
EDL	04:12:03,711	04:12:06,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Garlic Society on that decision
EDL	04:12:06,527	04:12:09,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I would submit that it's probably likely and Common Sense
EDL	04:12:10,367	04:12:14,719	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The most of the people in this situation or simply caught up in the gears of History
EDL	04:12:15,231	04:12:17,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like most people in any other piece
EDL	04:12:17,023	04:12:17,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	.
EDL	04:12:19,583	04:12:23,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sometimes it seems like we're all just along for the historical ride
EDL	04:12:23,423	04:12:23,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Does net
EDL	04:12:25,727	04:12:27,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case Caesar will spend

EDL	04:24:24,831	04:24:30,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Measure but we can fix that can a couple Generations will turn them into good romance and the way you can tell it's because look at
EDL	04:24:31,999	04:24:33,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Same values
EDL	04:24:33,791	04:24:34,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I mean
EDL	04:24:34,559	04:24:35,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Yeah if you put these
EDL	04:24:36,607	04:24:38,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Phrases and Concepts
EDL	04:24:38,655	04:24:43,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the mouths of a Roman character in a Roman stage play

EDL	04:24:47,359	04:24:51,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he sort of making the case according to one of these theories are red
EDL	04:24:51,199	04:24:55,295	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Were the Gauls are trainable but the Germans are never
EDL	04:24:55,295	04:24:55,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Going to be house
EDL	04:24:56,831	04:24:59,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Therefore we can incorporate the Gauls and down the road
EDL	04:24:59,903	04:25:01,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know after we break him to the yolk of Empire
EDL	04:25:03,231	04:25:07,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Can teach him up right look at how well those Gauls and short-haired golub been doing now for
EDL	04:25:07,583	04:25:09,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For 50 60 70 years
EDL	04:25:09,375	04:25:15,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know we can we can make these people into good romance and you can tell just look at how their spouting phrases that would make
EDL	04:25:15,775	04:25:17,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Them good Romans today
EDL	04:25:17,567	04:25:19,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It's an interesting idea and it would explain
EDL	04:25:20,639	04:25:21,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	My Caesar makes
EDL	04:25:21,919	04:25:24,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their cause sympathetic as he's crushing it
EDL	04:25:25,759	04:25:29,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It does sound a little bit like he misjudged how serious it was
EDL	04:25:30,367	04:25:35,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When he got word of it back in Rome the situation was starting to mellow out a little bit back there he says
EDL	04:25:35,999	04:25:39,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then he hears about these problems but as one historian pointed out
EDL	04:25:39,327	04:25:44,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know he conquered this area what four five six years ago initially
EDL	04:25:44,447	04:25:47,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he's had problems with it every year headaches
EDL	04:25:47,775	04:25:52,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Brightsparks the way we describe them all these aren't headaches and he doesn't know yet this is more like a stroke
EDL	04:25:53,919	04:25:55,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And all the spark that we talked about
EDL	04:25:55,967	04:25:56,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Earlier
EDL	04:25:56,991	04:25:59,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Finally fan into a general forest fire
EDL	04:26:00,319	04:26:03,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As all of Gaul will go up basically
EDL	04:26:03,647	04:26:06,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In Rebellion including the great friendly tribes of Rome
EDL	04:26:08,511	04:26:10,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it starts with one of those moves
EDL	04:26:10,559	04:26:12,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That a tribe does
EDL	04:26:12,095	04:26:17,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As a way of sort of Dipping their dagger in the assassination victim and saying okay I'm in
EDL	04:26:17,983	04:26:21,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Involves tribe it's always been possible for the Romans it is the one that
EDL	04:26:21,823	04:26:26,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Steps forward allegedly at this Woodland conspiracy is says will strike the first blow
EDL	04:26:26,943	04:26:29,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They go after this hill for town
EDL	04:26:29,759	04:26:31,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	By the Celtic tribe that
EDL	04:26:31,807	04:26:34,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Full of Roman Traders and businessmen
EDL	04:26:34,623	04:26:37,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And after they take the town they Massacre all the Roman
EDL	04:26:39,743	04:26:41,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So essentially saying you the rest
EDL	04:26:41,023	04:26:44,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The tribes okay we agreed to do this we're all in there's no going back for us who's next
EDL	04:26:46,911	04:26:48,959	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the rhythm of the story is interesting
EDL	04:26:49,471	04:26:50,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because
EDL	04:26:50,239	04:26:52,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You will have the tribes
EDL	04:26:52,287	04:26:53,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Join the Rebellion
EDL	04:26:54,335	04:26:56,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know usually in Big Shot
EDL	04:26:56,127	04:26:57,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But even
EDL	04:26:57,663	04:27:04,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You all along the way some big tribal at the last moment change sides and and so slowly but surely the Rebellion games
EDL	04:27:04,063	04:27:04,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Steam
EDL	04:27:06,367	04:27:12,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The massacre that kicks it off that we mentioned earlier the news about spreads like wildfire in the central
EDL	04:27:12,767	04:27:13,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Gauley tribes go up
EDL	04:27:13,791	04:27:17,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In Flames except for the ones most loyal to Rome we are the
EDL	04:27:17,887	04:27:19,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are the big tribe that matter
EDL	04:27:19,679	04:27:20,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They're the ones
EDL	04:27:20,703	04:27:27,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who initially went to Rome and said we need help cuz this Germans been brought it I mean this is the Ally of Ally
EDL	04:27:27,103	04:27:27,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Wise for the Romans
EDL	04:27:28,383	04:27:29,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this region
EDL	04:27:29,407	04:27:31,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So they're the ones that they worry about that's where
EDL	04:27:31,967	04:27:34,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans get all their supply help
EDL	04:27:34,783	04:27:39,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The grain that's where they store their hostages when they take them from other garlic tribit sort of there
EDL	04:27:39,647	04:27:42,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Administrative Center in Gaul these are our good allies and we can trust
EDL	04:27:43,999	04:27:44,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well
EDL	04:27:46,047	04:27:49,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On paper it may look that way but remember what we said earlier
EDL	04:27:49,887	04:27:51,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is garlic tribes are not United
EDL	04:27:52,191	04:27:53,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An even Caesar says there's
EDL	04:27:53,983	04:27:55,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With and rifle
EDL	04:27:55,007	04:27:55,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Faction
EDL	04:27:56,031	04:28:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So think Democrats and Republicans Tories and Labour and whatever you want to say write your
EDL	04:28:01,407	04:28:07,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Your two sides of the coin and maybe just because a tribe is taking a particular course of action it maybe like 51
EDL	04:28:07,807	04:28:10,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Percent of the tribe wants to do it in 49% dozen
EDL	04:28:11,135	04:28:13,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So sometimes it doesn't take a whole lot of change
EDL	04:28:14,719	04:28:17,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To sort of make the scales tipped the other way
EDL	04:28:17,535	04:28:19,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And when the first big tribe
EDL	04:28:19,839	04:28:20,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Galls

EDL	04:36:44,671	04:36:46,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He can control some things now
EDL	04:36:46,975	04:36:51,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With greater Authority than any garlic ruler since Caesar first arrived on the scene
EDL	04:36:51,839	04:36:53,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But there's other things you can't change
EDL	04:36:53,631	04:36:57,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He can start ordering tribes around now so instead of having to beg
EDL	04:36:57,471	04:37:01,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A tribe you normally your enemies with better temporarily fighting with

EDL	04:37:05,151	04:37:06,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you can begin to

EDL	04:37:10,527	04:37:12,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things like Roman Supply
EDL	04:37:13,343	04:37:13,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	04:37:14,367	04:37:20,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Working together and telling One Tribe to go over here in another tried to go over there as part of some larger strategy

EDL	04:38:05,567	04:38:06,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And where they live

EDL	04:38:21,439	04:38:23,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this is the greatest test

EDL	04:38:25,535	04:38:26,559	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That we seen

EDL	04:38:30,143	04:38:35,519	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You are going to have members of rival tribes making decisions that tell you you have to

EDL	04:39:01,631	04:39:02,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Nazis would have
EDL	04:39:05,215	04:39:06,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Create a situation where
EDL	04:39:07,519	04:39:10,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Gauls are now at least on
EDL	04:39:10,335	04:39:12,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Par with Caesar in the ability
EDL	04:39:12,639	04:39:16,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To have a United strategy and this has never before been the case
EDL	04:39:18,271	04:39:21,343	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But just because you have more power than any garlic Warlord

EDL	04:39:33,887	04:39:34,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Doing that sometimes you get

EDL	04:39:37,471	04:39:37,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right
EDL	04:39:38,495	04:39:39,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case
EDL	04:39:39,775	04:39:44,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There will be games that both Caesar and vercingetorix will play with these cities
EDL	04:39:44,127	04:39:45,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is it sort of ironic
EDL	04:39:45,663	04:39:48,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And one of the things they're saying getting rich is known for his telling that

EDL	04:40:01,023	04:40:06,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar will show up on the scene and go Bam Bam and take a couple of towns realfast remaining the Celtic

EDL	04:40:09,727	04:40:10,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Then they will defeat
EDL	04:40:11,263	04:40:16,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some garlic Cavalry in a skirmish sort of reminding the Gauls that they can't face up to Roman

EDL	04:47:20,575	04:47:25,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the various other people's of the Spanish and Portuguese area right of a
EDL	04:47:25,183	04:47:31,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Lusitania and all there because those tribes were so divided and so decentralized you always had to keep
EDL	04:47:31,071	04:47:33,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Going after another tribe it's an interesting Theory
EDL	04:47:34,911	04:47:37,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in this case the fact that there were even cities at all

EDL	04:53:11,551	04:53:12,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I was just so angry

EDL	04:53:32,543	04:53:33,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like resistance

EDL	04:53:40,479	04:53:44,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Suggest and it's not hard to believe that it actually helped American getaways
EDL	04:53:45,599	04:53:48,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because he had been one of the people that said
EDL	04:53:48,159	04:53:49,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We should be burning this town down
EDL	04:53:51,231	04:53:52,511	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then when his
EDL	04:53:52,511	04:53:58,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Advice wasn't chosen because he's not an absolute ruler in any sense of the word he should have chosen almost like an outside

EDL	04:54:05,567	04:54:08,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case he looks like he was in the right all along
EDL	04:54:08,895	04:54:10,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So after their akum
EDL	04:54:10,431	04:54:14,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tagalog Army continues to harass and Shadow Caesars Romans
EDL	04:54:14,527	04:54:18,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Remember Caesars Romans are the only Roman army here
EDL	04:54:18,623	04:54:22,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So there's no other pincer that can come around and do stuff if Caesar want the
EDL	04:54:22,975	04:54:23,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Do something
EDL	04:54:23,999	04:54:27,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In two places at the same time he has to split the Army he's got
EDL	04:54:28,095	04:54:31,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which means if the Gauls could keep Caesar's Army set of occupied somewhere

EDL	04:54:41,919	04:54:42,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's one in particular
EDL	04:54:43,455	04:54:45,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It would transform the situation
EDL	04:54:45,759	04:54:47,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you can get a restricted flip them

EDL	04:55:02,655	04:55:05,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is because that's who's providing Caesars food right now

EDL	04:56:39,423	04:56:43,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And so for a piece of propaganda like these War commentaries
EDL	04:56:43,519	04:56:48,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If you're ever going to shade the truth and try to make yourself look better and spend things this is going to be the play
EDL	04:56:48,895	04:56:49,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Place where you do
EDL	04:56:50,431	04:56:54,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Normally seizure would look at a place like this and think let's starve it out
EDL	04:56:54,527	04:56:58,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But given the supply situation he be more likely with his army to starve
EDL	04:56:58,623	04:57:00,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Before the people in your govea did
EDL	04:57:02,975	04:57:05,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's more seizures a little light on troops at this point
EDL	04:57:06,559	04:57:09,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just one of the moves that some have criticized over the
EDL	04:57:09,119	04:57:09,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Ciara's butt
EDL	04:57:10,143	04:57:13,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	We told you earlier Caesar needs to things done simultaneously
EDL	04:57:13,983	04:57:18,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In different places he doesn't have another Army in Romy can call on hands to split his own
EDL	04:57:18,847	04:57:22,431	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And before this battle The Siege at your go via he does
EDL	04:57:22,943	04:57:25,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And sends out about 40% of his forces
EDL	04:57:25,503	04:57:29,087	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To go handle something involving a couple of other tribes that need a good thrashing
EDL	04:57:30,111	04:57:31,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But it means that you're going to be there not
EDL	04:57:31,647	04:57:32,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There
EDL	04:57:32,671	04:57:34,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So when you start considering
EDL	04:57:34,207	04:57:38,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Oh maybe enclosing an entire mini Mountain
EDL	04:57:38,815	04:57:41,119	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With walls and fences and
EDL	04:57:41,119	04:57:43,679	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Things to cut it off from the outside world
EDL	04:57:43,679	04:57:47,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you look at your six Legions you may be thinking to yourself I really don't have
EDL	04:57:47,263	04:57:48,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Enough people for that
EDL	04:57:48,031	04:57:48,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Second strategy
EDL	04:57:48,799	04:57:49,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right now
EDL	04:57:51,359	04:57:53,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A describing sieges is always differ
EDL	04:57:53,919	04:57:58,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So I'll just use these these rough ideas but basically when Caesar gets there and sees what he's up against
EDL	04:57:58,783	04:58:00,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He starts nibbling
EDL	04:58:00,063	04:58:02,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Terrain features nearby that will help
EDL	04:58:02,111	04:58:03,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He'll nearby
EDL	04:58:03,903	04:58:10,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where he takes that little Hill that the Gauls haven't really defended it'll be harder for the gulf to get water so becomes his little game
EDL	04:58:10,303	04:58:12,095	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of nibbling on terrain features
EDL	04:58:12,863	04:58:17,471	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Building camps doing all this other stuff and then while he's doing it he gets word
EDL	04:58:17,983	04:58:19,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the easy we have flipped
EDL	04:58:20,287	04:58:23,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And at the baggage in his rear is compromised
EDL	04:58:23,615	04:58:26,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the food may not be arriving so he takes a large
EDL	04:58:26,687	04:58:29,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Portion of the legions he's working with a jerk over yet
EDL	04:58:29,759	04:58:34,367	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And goes down to deal with the problem with the supply lines and while he's gone
EDL	04:58:35,135	04:58:41,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Supposedly they're can get erection the Warriors come out of the the heights down the hill and attack this Roman
EDL	04:58:41,535	04:58:42,047	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Camp
EDL	04:58:42,559	04:58:47,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Roman Camp built for like six Legions but now only defended by two
EDL	04:58:47,935	04:58:49,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would you can see would make it difficult
EDL	04:58:50,751	04:58:53,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar gets word of this when he's on his way back
EDL	04:58:53,823	04:58:56,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm dealing with the supply line problems with like four Legions
EDL	04:58:57,407	04:59:01,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And when he gets to the Campisi's that they have managed to beat off the assault with her
EDL	04:59:01,503	04:59:04,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Artillery and all kinds of things but they're if they're in a bad way
EDL	04:59:05,855	04:59:07,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Procedure devices this strategy
EDL	04:59:07,647	04:59:09,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's going to faint an attack
EDL	04:59:09,695	04:59:10,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On one side
EDL	04:59:10,975	04:59:15,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Get all the Celtic warriors to go to that side of the top of the Mesa of the Hill Ford
EDL	04:59:15,839	04:59:19,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then Caesar will attack on the on the far side that's now abandon with some more troops
EDL	04:59:20,447	04:59:21,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So he set this up
EDL	04:59:21,727	04:59:24,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Eventually gets to the point where the Gauls take the bait
EDL	04:59:24,287	04:59:27,871	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They all come to the one side of the Mesa to deal with seizures faint
EDL	04:59:27,871	04:59:29,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar sends his Legions around the
EDL	04:59:29,663	04:59:32,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Supposedly now undefended other side
EDL	04:59:32,223	04:59:34,783	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They start doing real well they get through the
EDL	04:59:34,783	04:59:40,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The main wall they're starting to cut up some of the camp in the women in the children that I mean maybe this is going to win
EDL	04:59:40,671	04:59:45,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then the Celtic warriors that have been drawn off to the other side of the Mesa by The Faint
EDL	04:59:45,791	04:59:46,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Come back
EDL	04:59:47,071	04:59:47,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And math
EDL	04:59:50,655	04:59:54,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There can get a raise himself might have led the cavalry charge
EDL	04:59:55,007	04:59:57,311	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That sent the Romans careening
EDL	04:59:57,823	04:59:59,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Back down the hill
EDL	04:59:59,871	05:00:06,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar will get together a bunch of Legion that are not involved at the bottom somewhere near the bottom of the hill so that his own
EDL	05:00:06,271	05:00:08,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Don't troops can then hide behind them and
EDL	05:00:08,319	05:00:12,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	His new troops that are uninvolved in the combat can ward off the pursuing
EDL	05:00:12,415	05:00:12,927	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celts
EDL	05:00:13,439	05:00:15,231	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cesar Chavez will admit to
EDL	05:00:15,743	05:00:17,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Like 700 dead legionaries
EDL	05:00:17,535	05:00:19,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is between 40 and 50 of these people are century
EDL	05:00:21,631	05:00:23,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's been an interesting debate you can read
EDL	05:00:23,935	05:00:27,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	On whether or not this is the Roman habit of ink
EDL	05:00:27,263	05:00:28,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Encouraging
EDL	05:00:28,543	05:00:34,943	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well conspicuous bravery would be one way of putting it if you wanted to spend it one way reckless endangerment
EDL	05:00:34,943	05:00:36,991	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For personal gain might be another
EDL	05:00:37,503	05:00:40,831	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But Caesar kind of blames that a little bit at the same time
EDL	05:00:41,343	05:00:44,159	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Xi jinping encouraging this kind of audacity
EDL	05:00:44,159	05:00:45,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Forever
EDL	05:00:45,183	05:00:48,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know where these legionary in their centurions are rewarded for
EDL	05:00:48,767	05:00:53,375	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Throwing themselves into the breach and being extra tough and extra aggressive
EDL	05:00:53,375	05:00:58,751	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case Caesar says that one point these Gauls will be throwing these dead Romans
EDL	05:00:59,263	05:01:05,663	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Over the walls head-first and Caesar will name at least one of these dead Romans being
EDL	05:01:05,663	05:01:06,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Thrown over
EDL	05:01:06,687	05:01:07,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The wall by the
EDL	05:01:07,967	05:01:09,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Celtic warriors who killed him by name
EDL	05:01:10,527	05:01:11,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you know the guy
EDL	05:01:12,319	05:01:14,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you're seeing thrown over the walls dead I mean it
EDL	05:01:15,135	05:01:21,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It sounds like it was a nasty situation to some historians have suggested the casualties could be a great deal higher than Caesar was admitting to
EDL	05:01:22,815	05:01:24,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The military setback that
EDL	05:01:24,607	05:01:26,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cesar suppers at your govea
EDL	05:01:27,423	05:01:29,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Combined with the losing
EDL	05:01:30,751	05:01:33,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the Eataly tribe to the Rebellion
EDL	05:01:33,823	05:01:35,615	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Begins to flip yet more try
EDL	05:01:35,615	05:01:37,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tampa science how quickly this is happening
EDL	05:01:38,431	05:01:41,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Everything were talking about he was happening in 52 BCE
EDL	05:01:42,015	05:01:45,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Normally when you think of this. You think of an era of almost glacial
EDL	05:01:46,879	05:01:47,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Operation
EDL	05:01:49,183	05:01:51,743	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Army is advancing or sieges rndc just
EDL	05:01:51,743	05:01:52,255	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Years
EDL	05:01:52,767	05:01:54,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All of this is happening in 50
EDL	05:01:54,303	05:01:55,071	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	B2
EDL	05:01:55,071	05:01:56,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which shows you how
EDL	05:01:56,351	05:01:57,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Quickly events are unfolding
EDL	05:01:59,167	05:02:01,983	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And by the way Caesar was not given conventional dates
EDL	05:02:02,495	05:02:06,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you could say that all this stuff happened in this one year but you don't know when sometimes
EDL	05:02:06,847	05:02:08,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He'll give you an inkling of a Caesar
EDL	05:02:09,151	05:02:09,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Rise you can say what this happen
EDL	05:02:10,431	05:02:11,455	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the winter or this happened
EDL	05:02:11,455	05:02:12,479	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the spring or what have you
EDL	05:02:13,247	05:02:14,271	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But most
EDL	05:02:14,271	05:02:17,599	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Armies I can think of from the ancient. Well up
EDL	05:02:17,599	05:02:19,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Mean to almost the modern era
EDL	05:02:19,903	05:02:22,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would have a hard time dealing with the speed of something going this fast
EDL	05:02:23,487	05:02:25,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I keep trying to imagine
EDL	05:02:25,023	05:02:28,351	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are European armies from the Middle Ages trying to crush this Revolt this
EDL	05:02:28,351	05:02:28,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This quickly
EDL	05:02:29,375	05:02:30,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Part of it of course is wrong
EDL	05:02:30,911	05:02:31,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But the other part is
EDL	05:02:32,703	05:02:35,007	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And what sort of Bad Karma clock
EDL	05:02:35,007	05:02:38,847	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did the Gauls have that this happened that they get one of the great generals
EDL	05:02:38,847	05:02:40,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In all human history
EDL	05:02:40,383	05:02:45,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And a guy at the top of his resume when he's bragging about his god-given qualities is going to put
EDL	05:02:46,015	05:02:48,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Speed and decisiveness of movement
EDL	05:02:49,343	05:02:51,647	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As if the Celts already didn't have enough
EDL	05:02:52,159	05:02:55,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're going against them in this deal between the technology and the
EDL	05:02:55,999	05:03:00,607	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Your lack of centralization all the things we've been talking about they got to get this guy at this time to
EDL	05:03:02,143	05:03:03,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In fact it's worse than just that
EDL	05:03:04,447	05:03:09,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar's political antenna as you might imagine from a guy holding his feels
EDL	05:03:09,055	05:03:12,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In the Rome of the late Republic are exquisite
EDL	05:03:12,895	05:03:16,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And his ability to read the proper way to respond
EDL	05:03:16,223	05:03:18,527	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did these tribes in order to play them
EDL	05:03:18,527	05:03:20,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As much as he can
EDL	05:03:20,575	05:03:22,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a like it musical instrument is crazy
EDL	05:03:23,391	05:03:29,279	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	If some tribe get clemency others get wiped out and you got to know how to play this game to keep most of them in your camper at least
EDL	05:03:29,791	05:03:36,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The 49% of the try maybe that wishes they were in your camp but are currently in the minority you think of
EDL	05:03:36,191	05:03:37,727	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	About guys coming from
EDL	05:03:37,727	05:03:40,543	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tiara Caesar was born in Marius and sulla
EDL	05:03:41,055	05:03:44,383	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They might have been equally successful in destroying these garlic armies
EDL	05:03:45,151	05:03:48,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But I imagine Caesars going to look like a great being
EDL	05:03:48,735	05:03:49,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Softer
EDL	05:03:49,759	05:03:55,391	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When it comes to the genocide of the Holocaust were talking about if it's Marius or sell Edition out the Punisher

EDL	05:07:16,351	05:07:18,655	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Also if they wanted to play hardball say something like

EDL	05:07:42,463	05:07:46,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	300 tribes are states that Caesar subdued I can't believe it's anywhere near that many
EDL	05:07:47,327	05:07:52,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Some of these may have been really really small but let's just say it's a hundred 150 Caesar says he's got like two
EDL	05:07:53,215	05:07:54,239	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That still support him
EDL	05:07:54,751	05:07:58,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Severe can get erect has this big meeting with all the other tribes the Giant

EDL	05:08:00,383	05:08:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And you do Wonder
EDL	05:08:01,919	05:08:03,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is say the Native Americans
EDL	05:08:03,711	05:08:10,111	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or some of these other people who are victims of colonial Conquest ever were able to get all of their people together in one place
EDL	05:08:10,111	05:08:14,975	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who are the representatives of them and also to try to unite and speak with one voice
EDL	05:08:15,743	05:08:17,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is an amazing thing when you think about it
EDL	05:08:17,791	05:08:18,815	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All of Gaul
EDL	05:08:18,815	05:08:19,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With the exception of

EDL	05:08:23,423	05:08:24,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is a historic moment
EDL	05:08:26,495	05:08:28,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's basically cut off
EDL	05:08:28,031	05:08:30,591	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From getting new troops in Italy at this point
EDL	05:08:30,591	05:08:36,735	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And remember the Romans don't use their own Cavalry anymore what do they use while local Allied troops
EDL	05:08:37,247	05:08:39,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who's that lied to the Romans now
EDL	05:08:40,063	05:08:44,415	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So Caesars got an issue where did he get his Cavalry from well this is where we find out
EDL	05:08:45,439	05:08:47,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know those who enjoy
EDL	05:08:47,487	05:08:51,583	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Little teeny tactical things on the battlefield that end up having perhaps
EDL	05:08:51,583	05:08:54,399	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Huge effects on History love this part of the story
EDL	05:08:54,911	05:08:56,447	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But this is where we find out
EDL	05:08:56,447	05:08:59,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The seizures been making friends on the other side of the Rhine
EDL	05:08:59,775	05:09:02,079	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What does German people that you can't House break
EDL	05:09:02,591	05:09:03,359	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can't
EDL	05:09:03,359	05:09:07,967	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can incorporate you can't assimilate but if you need the Cavalry bad enough you can maybe
EDL	05:09:08,479	05:09:09,247	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Work out a deal
EDL	05:09:10,783	05:09:12,063	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar starts bringing
EDL	05:09:12,063	05:09:12,575	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This
EDL	05:09:13,343	05:09:17,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Friendly German Cavalry from some of these tribes Maybe
EDL	05:09:17,183	05:09:21,023	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That were the enemies of the people Caesar was beating up on in Germany
EDL	05:09:21,535	05:09:23,327	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And we hear their appearance and it's
EDL	05:09:23,839	05:09:25,887	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bedeviled take more games
EDL	05:09:27,167	05:09:29,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Most wargaming rules
EDL	05:09:29,215	05:09:33,055	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Twin talking about this German Cavalry in this. Gave it
EDL	05:09:33,055	05:09:33,823	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Special powers
EDL	05:09:34,591	05:09:36,895	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Especially special powers
EDL	05:09:36,895	05:09:38,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	/ Celtic troops
EDL	05:09:38,687	05:09:39,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know why
EDL	05:09:39,711	05:09:41,503	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because the Celtic troops were scared of them
EDL	05:09:43,039	05:09:46,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These are the same kinds of forces remember that Caesar had noticed
EDL	05:09:47,135	05:09:47,903	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And driven off
EDL	05:09:48,415	05:09:51,487	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Many more times their number in garlic Cavalry earlier
EDL	05:09:52,255	05:09:54,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So what's going on you know when we talk about
EDL	05:09:54,815	05:09:55,839	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Intimidation
EDL	05:09:56,351	05:09:58,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	For all these qualities that are
EDL	05:09:58,143	05:09:59,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hard to quantify
EDL	05:09:59,935	05:10:06,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What do you get when you take 400 German Cavalry which is not enough to make a big difference anywhere in these
EDL	05:10:06,335	05:10:07,103	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Size battles
EDL	05:10:07,103	05:10:08,127	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they dominate
EDL	05:10:09,407	05:10:11,711	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What kind of Superman are we talking about here
EDL	05:10:12,223	05:10:16,319	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And people have wondered ever since now we can go into the unquantifiable things but they are of course
EDL	05:10:16,831	05:10:17,855	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unquantifiable
EDL	05:10:18,367	05:10:21,695	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You could talk about the fact that these Germans had a way
EDL	05:10:21,695	05:10:25,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of utilizing infantry with the Cavalry so they have
EDL	05:10:25,535	05:10:29,631	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One light infantrymen to go with one Calvary men and they were supposed to operate together
EDL	05:10:29,631	05:10:31,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And the light infantrymen supposedly
EDL	05:10:31,423	05:10:36,799	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hold on to the manes of these horses they rode into battle and it would almost act like a night with his squire
EDL	05:10:37,567	05:10:38,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And at this
EDL	05:10:38,335	05:10:42,175	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Combined Arms Mobile infantry formation with
EDL	05:10:42,175	05:10:43,199	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Unique and

EDL	05:14:45,375	05:14:46,143	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And decides
EDL	05:14:46,911	05:14:47,935	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well this is something you have
EDL	05:14:47,935	05:14:48,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How to put under seat
EDL	05:14:48,703	05:14:49,215	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Obvious
EDL	05:14:50,495	05:14:51,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But how do you
EDL	05:14:51,263	05:14:51,775	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put a
EDL	05:14:53,055	05:14:57,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Place this large Under Siege this is a huge Endeavor if you really want to go there but
EDL	05:14:58,175	05:15:00,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As we've said all along the Romans are
EDL	05:15:00,735	05:15:02,015	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I want a great secret web
EDL	05:15:02,527	05:15:03,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is the fact that there
EDL	05:15:03,551	05:15:06,879	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Legionaries are about half construction worker half Soldier
EDL	05:15:08,671	05:15:10,207	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Astoria Michael M stage rights
EDL	05:15:10,719	05:15:13,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar looking at Elysian deciding what to do quote
EDL	05:15:14,559	05:15:19,167	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Since a direct assault was precluded the only alternative was to capture the town by sea
EDL	05:15:19,679	05:15:22,495	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which required the construction of massive fortification
EDL	05:15:23,007	05:15:25,567	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	One of the Striking aspects of the garlic War
EDL	05:15:25,567	05:15:29,919	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is the engineering skill the Romans displayed in constructing Seas fortifications
EDL	05:15:30,431	05:15:35,039	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This expertise was part of a wider development in the use of fortification by the Romans
EDL	05:15:35,039	05:15:39,135	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They were used extensively not only in Siege is but also on the battlefield
EDL	05:15:39,647	05:15:44,767	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Romans constructed a continuous Siege wall over 10 miles in length to close off Elysium
EDL	05:15:45,279	05:15:45,791	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And quote
EDL	05:15:47,583	05:15:48,863	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well that just for starters
EDL	05:15:49,375	05:15:55,263	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But basically once Vera can get a Rick Steves what's going on here and the scope of what Caesars about to do
EDL	05:15:55,263	05:16:01,407	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He launches a Cavalry attack down that one gentle slope of the peninsula of this Plateau is occupying
EDL	05:16:01,919	05:16:05,759	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And gets into a dust-up with both Caesars legionaries
EDL	05:16:05,759	05:16:10,623	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	An Caesar's German Cavalry and once again the German Cavalry make the difference
EDL	05:16:10,623	05:16:13,183	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they pursue along with the Romans
EDL	05:16:13,183	05:16:18,303	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	These garlic Calvary members who Caesar says get caught up kind of in their own defenses and they start
EDL	05:16:18,303	05:16:23,423	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Clogging up around the narrow parts and they get just massacred in crowds of people
EDL	05:16:23,423	05:16:24,191	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He just crushed
EDL	05:16:24,191	05:16:24,703	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The death
EDL	05:16:26,495	05:16:28,287	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So Caesar says that this
EDL	05:16:28,799	05:16:30,335	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tells beer can get a Rex
EDL	05:16:30,335	05:16:33,151	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But he's not going to be able to break this Siege himself
EDL	05:16:33,151	05:16:34,687	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And also as this
EDL	05:16:35,199	05:16:39,807	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Fortification starts to become complete what are you going to do with Calvary anyway
EDL	05:16:39,807	05:16:45,951	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The teacher said he sends his Cavalry away send all the Cavalry back to their home try because this is an army that is a
EDL	05:16:45,951	05:16:49,535	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Consolidation of a bunch of Allied tribes now right almost everyone
EDL	05:16:50,047	05:16:54,911	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So you send the Cavalry back to their own tribe and Cesar said he tells them to bring a relief Army
EDL	05:16:55,423	05:17:00,031	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put together rising of the tribes and come here and save us we've got Caesar pin down right here
EDL	05:17:01,055	05:17:04,639	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As I can get away to sending this Cavalry all back to their home tribes
EDL	05:17:05,151	05:17:08,223	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar again putting the words in his mouth has him saying
EDL	05:17:08,223	05:17:11,551	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You know don't leave me here don't forget who fought for your Liberty
EDL	05:17:12,063	05:17:17,439	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then something to the effect of oh yeah and I have 80000 of your countrymen with me you would want to see them die either would you
EDL	05:17:18,463	05:17:19,999	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would you bring us two numbers here

EDL	05:33:34,336	05:33:40,224	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That Western area the gentle slope of the plateau so all the real fighting especially the wide-open Cavalry stuff happen

EDL	05:33:46,624	05:33:52,768	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Starving people who've already seen those people from the town starve him between the two armies you not throw up a cheer season
EDL	05:33:53,792	05:33:56,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And let's remember why we say Caesar says
EDL	05:33:57,376	05:33:59,424	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Why we're so reliant on
EDL	05:33:59,424	05:33:59,936	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Vim
EDL	05:34:00,448	05:34:02,752	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He's the only eyewitness from this battle
EDL	05:34:02,752	05:34:04,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Do we have any account from
EDL	05:34:05,056	05:34:09,408	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And anyone else's account of this battle off and uses him as a source
EDL	05:34:10,432	05:34:12,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So he's both invaluable
EDL	05:34:12,480	05:34:15,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And at the same time obviously biased as hell although
EDL	05:34:16,064	05:34:17,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Anyone you got
EDL	05:34:17,344	05:34:18,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Open this bottle who wrote about his
EDL	05:34:19,392	05:34:19,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	How to be pretty
EDL	05:34:21,440	05:34:27,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In this case there when Caesar plays up the fear a lot of times when seizures playing up the fear of the dangerousness of a situation
EDL	05:34:28,352	05:34:34,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You can perhaps suggest that you doing it to magnify his own greatness but this looks legitimately dangerous here
EDL	05:34:35,264	05:34:38,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This looks like a moment in history as we said
EDL	05:34:38,336	05:34:40,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Where the tribal people kind of have a shot
EDL	05:34:41,152	05:34:45,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	120000 hundred thirty thousand Warriors gives you a shot
EDL	05:34:47,296	05:34:53,696	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So when they're can get a rich and his people see this relief Army Caesar says they come running down from their positions
EDL	05:34:53,696	05:34:57,792	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Towards that trench that separates them from the Romans and they begin filling it in
EDL	05:34:58,304	05:35:00,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In other words preparing to do
EDL	05:35:00,096	05:35:06,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their job in this whole attack which is to attack the Roman from the other side when the big relief Army smashes Against the Wind
EDL	05:35:06,496	05:35:07,008	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the front
EDL	05:35:07,776	05:35:10,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Teacher says he has all those people take up the positions
EDL	05:35:12,128	05:35:17,248	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then he sends his Cavalry down into this plane to engage the garlic Cavalry that's down there
EDL	05:35:17,760	05:35:18,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Now
EDL	05:35:18,784	05:35:24,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Who knows about these numbers estimates are Caesar had about six thousand Cavalry wide mixing things
EDL	05:35:24,928	05:35:26,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Still have some garlic Calvary
EDL	05:35:26,976	05:35:27,488	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Spanish
EDL	05:35:28,000	05:35:30,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Community and we know we had some Germans
EDL	05:35:31,584	05:35:32,352	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Gauls
EDL	05:35:32,864	05:35:34,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well and Gauls and
EDL	05:35:34,656	05:35:41,056	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They fight and Skirmish all afternoon apparently and the gulls are getting the better of it when Caesar says
EDL	05:35:41,056	05:35:46,176	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	All of a sudden and not for the last time these German Cavalry once again turn the tide
EDL	05:35:47,968	05:35:51,040	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Kill a bunch of the Gauls chasing off win the day
EDL	05:35:51,808	05:35:55,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And he says that there can get Alex and his people who are
EDL	05:35:55,392	05:36:01,792	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	You're standing by having field in the trench waiting to attack dejectedly head back uphill toward the town
EDL	05:36:01,792	05:36:02,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	After they see that
EDL	05:36:02,816	05:36:06,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This relief Army isn't going to be giving them any relief today
EDL	05:36:07,936	05:36:08,704	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So then you get
EDL	05:36:09,216	05:36:09,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The next day
EDL	05:36:10,752	05:36:15,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And something happens that seemed to validate some of those earlier points we were making
EDL	05:36:15,104	05:36:18,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But in the later books of seizures as Ender Rigsby point.
EDL	05:36:19,200	05:36:20,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He begins to
EDL	05:36:20,480	05:36:26,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Point out that these people are growing and they're changing and they're their prolonged contact and fighting with the Romans
EDL	05:36:26,880	05:36:27,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Just making them more dangerous
EDL	05:36:28,672	05:36:30,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Maybe said earlier this is the reason sometimes
EDL	05:36:31,232	05:36:34,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Used to explain why the Germans will
EDL	05:36:34,304	05:36:40,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Sack Rome in 410 AD right prolonged contact with the Romans made them Roman enough so that they could do that
EDL	05:36:40,448	05:36:42,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Will seizures kind of alleging is this
EDL	05:36:42,240	05:36:43,776	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	No commentary his goes on
EDL	05:36:44,288	05:36:46,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did the Celts are going that way
EDL	05:36:46,592	05:36:50,688	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they need to be dealt with now before they get any better because they spend
EDL	05:36:50,688	05:36:52,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The next day during the day
EDL	05:36:53,248	05:36:59,392	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Calmly and coolly and logically and diligently the Romans might notice cuz they was the

EDL	05:37:01,696	05:37:05,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I'm liking to avoid hard labor but they're cutting down trees
EDL	05:37:05,792	05:37:07,072	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they're making ladders
EDL	05:37:08,096	05:37:10,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Play commotion putting together bundles of

EDL	05:37:10,912	05:37:17,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Play when they run toward these Roman trenches they can all throw their bundle into the trench and eventually the bundles Philip the French and you can run

EDL	05:37:58,528	05:37:59,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Throws it

EDL	05:38:58,688	05:38:59,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well you can see how it'd be
EDL	05:39:00,480	05:39:01,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A bigger problem he says he's

EDL	05:39:23,520	05:39:28,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But Caesar makes it out to be a near run thing and they are beating off this attack
EDL	05:39:28,640	05:39:31,712	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Well like something out of one of those old westerns

EDL	05:40:05,504	05:40:06,784	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that even with all the
EDL	05:40:06,784	05:40:10,624	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Traps and everything they got set up these Gauls are throwing down there
EDL	05:40:10,624	05:40:17,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Bundles of sticks and they got their ladders in the end it's a near run thing at several different places and then the dawn breaks

EDL	05:40:21,376	05:40:27,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And this melting of the Gauls back to their Camp is portrayed as some historians as the failure of the assault
EDL	05:40:27,264	05:40:28,544	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Call but other historians
EDL	05:40:28,544	05:40:31,104	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Suggested that first battle they fought the
EDL	05:40:31,104	05:40:33,920	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The calvary one that the Germans once again turn the tide at
EDL	05:40:34,432	05:40:40,064	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I made it impossible for these Celtic infantryman to operate in this big field during daylight so
EDL	05:40:40,064	05:40:41,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Whatever the reasoning
EDL	05:40:41,856	05:40:44,928	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The relief Army loses its second battle against
EDL	05:40:44,928	05:40:49,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar and the first assault that it makes against the fortifications
EDL	05:40:49,024	05:40:50,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of the Romans
EDL	05:40:50,304	05:40:51,328	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tails as well
EDL	05:40:52,352	05:40:53,376	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And Caesar says
EDL	05:40:53,888	05:40:57,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That part of the problem here is that Vera can get a Rick's and the troops
EDL	05:40:58,240	05:41:02,336	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Besieged in the hill Fort never got their act together in time to help
EDL	05:41:02,848	05:41:08,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Dead by the time the relief Force melts back toward the camp at morning there can't get a rich hasn't launched his attack yet
EDL	05:41:10,016	05:41:11,552	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So that's a traditional garlic
EDL	05:41:11,552	05:41:13,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Coordination problem it's not surprising
EDL	05:41:13,856	05:41:19,232	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Although there can get her to done a pretty good job avoiding those kind of traditional garlic mistake so maybe it's
EDL	05:41:19,232	05:41:19,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Surprising in that
EDL	05:41:21,536	05:41:26,912	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that the garlic leadership which remember is made up of a ton of different tribes under
EDL	05:41:26,912	05:41:32,800	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Several major WarChiefs from different tribes as a Native American fan I can't help but think of some of
EDL	05:41:32,800	05:41:36,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The the Chiefs that I've always thought most highly of working together obviously
EDL	05:41:37,152	05:41:39,968	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Different working together in some giant effort like this
EDL	05:41:40,480	05:41:43,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But they have a conference to try to figure out what's going wrong
EDL	05:41:43,296	05:41:45,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Cuz we've lost two battles in 2 or 3 days
EDL	05:41:46,624	05:41:49,440	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They were upset about the reconnaissance pointing out maybe the
EDL	05:41:49,440	05:41:50,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Yeah we should have lost so many people
EDL	05:41:50,976	05:41:52,000	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Both of those traps
EDL	05:41:52,000	05:41:53,280	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That we didn't know about
EDL	05:41:53,280	05:41:55,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then they interview the locals who are
EDL	05:41:55,584	05:41:56,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	After all
EDL	05:41:56,608	05:41:57,888	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Garlic themselves
EDL	05:41:58,400	05:42:02,240	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	About the local lay of the land is there some weak spot in the Roman forum
EDL	05:42:02,240	05:42:04,032	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Vacations turns out there is
EDL	05:42:04,544	05:42:07,872	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	A hill that Cesar couldn't incorporate into his defenses
EDL	05:42:08,384	05:42:09,920	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Celts find out about it
EDL	05:42:10,432	05:42:16,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says 60,000 of them under one of these WarChiefs you got to love it when 60000 is a detached
EDL	05:42:16,832	05:42:17,600	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Attachment of you
EDL	05:42:17,600	05:42:20,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Your forces on whatever the real number might be
EDL	05:42:20,160	05:42:21,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	60 thousand of them sneak
EDL	05:42:22,464	05:42:23,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Over to this week spot
EDL	05:42:24,512	05:42:26,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And then when they launched
EDL	05:42:26,304	05:42:28,608	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Their attack there will be corresponding at
EDL	05:42:28,608	05:42:30,144	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Tax launched elsewhere to help
EDL	05:42:31,168	05:42:31,936	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Interesting
EDL	05:42:31,936	05:42:35,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To wondering whether the people of the time understood what this is
EDL	05:42:35,776	05:42:37,312	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is the actual
EDL	05:42:37,824	05:42:39,360	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In a spin of the roulette wheel
EDL	05:42:40,128	05:42:46,272	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right now I mean this is the encounter that will decide and Caesar will say this he says during the fighting to his men
EDL	05:42:46,784	05:42:49,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This is the encounter and they will come down Caesar says to a moment
EDL	05:42:50,368	05:42:55,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It will decide the course of the war that he's been fighting for the better part of a decade
EDL	05:42:56,256	05:42:58,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And given what we know now
EDL	05:42:58,304	05:43:02,400	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Decide the state of garlic Liberty for the next five centuries
EDL	05:43:04,448	05:43:06,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar says that it is about noon
EDL	05:43:07,008	05:43:08,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Did the surprise attack
EDL	05:43:08,800	05:43:10,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Is launched against
EDL	05:43:10,080	05:43:12,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The weak part of the Roman fortification
EDL	05:43:12,128	05:43:18,528	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And they say it's the week part because instead of being able to be situated on top of a hill with a good view all around this one party
EDL	05:43:18,528	05:43:20,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Are the camp had to be situated below the crest
EDL	05:43:21,344	05:43:23,904	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But that means you don't know and can't see what's on the
EDL	05:43:23,904	05:43:25,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The opposite side of the crest of reverse slope
EDL	05:43:26,464	05:43:31,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And in this case if you believe Cesar 60,000 handpicked tribal warriors were
EDL	05:43:31,584	05:43:34,656	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And around noon they come Galloping over that slope
EDL	05:43:35,168	05:43:37,216	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Heading towards a part of the camp
EDL	05:43:37,216	05:43:41,824	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Remember Caesars troops are numerous but they're strung out over the entire length of
EDL	05:43:41,824	05:43:44,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This 14 mile circumference or whatever it is
EDL	05:43:44,128	05:43:48,736	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	There's about two Legions maybe eight ten thousand people right here close by
EDL	05:43:49,248	05:43:54,880	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With 60,000 sounds crazy so we'll say 30,000 screaming Warriors coming down that hill at them
EDL	05:43:56,416	05:43:57,184	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	As we mentioned
EDL	05:43:57,696	05:44:00,256	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This isn't all Caesar have to deal with because of course
EDL	05:44:00,768	05:44:02,304	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	They launched a strike
EDL	05:44:02,304	05:44:03,840	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	From the main area
EDL	05:44:03,840	05:44:08,704	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	This great big plane that all the battles been fought on the main Roman defenses well those Kelly
EDL	05:44:08,704	05:44:10,496	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Come out to play again to
EDL	05:44:10,496	05:44:14,080	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Historians are divided on whether or not this is a real Attack
EDL	05:44:14,080	05:44:16,128	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Intended to produce results of its own
EDL	05:44:16,640	05:44:18,432	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Or whether it's purely a diversion
EDL	05:44:18,432	05:44:24,320	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	But you can't just send a bunch of legionaries from there now to go bolster the week area cuz they're busy
EDL	05:44:24,320	05:44:25,344	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And
EDL	05:44:25,344	05:44:29,952	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Because this is the climactic battle you would expect that their can get erect up in the Hill Ford
EDL	05:44:30,464	05:44:31,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	With his lean
EDL	05:44:31,744	05:44:33,536	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Hungry besiege troops
EDL	05:44:34,048	05:44:36,096	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Would also launch an attack to help to
EDL	05:44:36,096	05:44:41,472	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So they come down off the hill and they do the same and then they begin to concentrate
EDL	05:44:41,472	05:44:43,520	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Right near that same
EDL	05:44:43,520	05:44:44,544	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Weak spot
EDL	05:44:44,544	05:44:50,176	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	That the 60,000 pick the guys from outside are concentrating on this is now the Crux of the battle
EDL	05:44:50,688	05:44:57,088	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	So seizure goes to a place where he can see really well at his job as he sees it and he emphasizes this instead
EDL	05:44:57,088	05:45:02,976	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Being the heroine commander on the ground wielding a sword and leading his men like King Arthur or Alexander
EDL	05:45:02,976	05:45:06,816	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Caesar's job is to hold on to the precious reserves and Dole them out
EDL	05:45:06,816	05:45:12,960	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	To wherever they're needed most and he does this but what's going to happen when he runs out of Reserve
EDL	05:45:13,472	05:45:16,288	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	What's going to happen when you have a threatened part of the line
EDL	05:45:16,288	05:45:20,640	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And no more legionary to send there to bolster it cuz you'll do this several times in the Bible
EDL	05:45:22,176	05:45:27,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Finally the situation of the weak spot in the fortification is so bad it's in danger of being overrun
EDL	05:45:27,808	05:45:29,856	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Which everyone seems to think would mean the battle
EDL	05:45:30,880	05:45:32,160	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The Caesar has to go in South
EDL	05:45:33,440	05:45:37,024	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The last thing he does before he runs to that spot of the line though
EDL	05:45:37,024	05:45:39,584	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it turns out to be crucial wouldn't you know
EDL	05:45:39,584	05:45:44,448	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	It'll take a few Legions that he scraped together with some Cavalry including our German friends
EDL	05:45:44,448	05:45:49,568	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Put them under the command of someone says ride outside the fortifications and whip around
EDL	05:45:50,080	05:45:56,480	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And try to get behind the enemy that were fighting in that area and see what you can do basically and then seizure
EDL	05:45:56,480	05:45:57,760	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Grab some more Legions
EDL	05:45:57,760	05:45:59,808	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	I guess that's the bottom of the barrel
EDL	05:45:59,808	05:46:00,832	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And heads beer in South
EDL	05:46:03,136	05:46:06,720	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Arrived to the threatened part of the line and you instantly have this
EDL	05:46:07,232	05:46:10,048	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Feeling that he's just walked into the Alamo
EDL	05:46:10,048	05:46:12,864	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	When it's totally Under Siege annies Davy Crockett
EDL	05:46:12,864	05:46:17,984	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	He didn't have to be at a place where he might die and I'm in a few moments but now he's walked into it
EDL	05:46:17,984	05:46:19,264	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	Of his own free will

EDL	05:49:46,624	05:49:50,208	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	At the Romans lost more than 10,000 which is a lot by Roman Standard
EDL	05:49:50,720	05:49:51,744	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	The counts lost way more

EDL	05:50:11,456	05:50:15,296	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it's indicative of how hard fought this battle was

EDL	05:52:35,072	05:52:37,376	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	In that same position in the movie
EDL	05:52:37,888	05:52:39,168	| dchha60_The_Celtic_Holocaust |	And it works just as well
