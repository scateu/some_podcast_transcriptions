1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
December 7th 1941

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
A date which will live in infamy

3
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Call nist time and place

4
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall

5
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know

6
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Weather

7
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Number

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,240
It's hardcore history

9
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
I remember a conversation I had

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
Quite a long time ago now

11
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
I was an author of A

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
The author had written a book about how John F Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald just like the government always

13
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Set it happened

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
And I've been asking him a bunch of questions about

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Conspiracies

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
This or that aspect of the

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
Kennedy assassination in only one of his answers

18
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
It really stands out of my mind now because it

19
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Teams

20
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
In irrelevant on so many different

21
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Confront

22
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
And one of the answers on why

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
It was so hard for some people to accept what this guy with reporting us

24
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Truth

25
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
He said was because people are inherently

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Very uncomfortable

27
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
With the ID

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
That a single nobody

29
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Can have such an effect on all of our lives

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
It's more comforting

31
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
He said to believe

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
The powerful

33
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
Groups of people or conspiracies are actually running things

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Even if you think

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Those powerful groups are nefarious

36
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
It's somehow comforting to think that

37
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Somebody's in charge

38
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
It's not all just random

39
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,832
The mother plane couldn't just drop from the sky and land on your house tomorrow

40
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
I thought about this when I was thinking about

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
Someone if somebody to ask you a question who was the most important

42
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Figure in the past

43
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Hundred years

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
In terms of

45
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
Why the world has gone the way it did

46
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah you would think of all these famous people whose names almost anyone who's a halfway educated would recognize

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
And it was interesting as you could

48
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Conceivably

49
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
You put the name down of somebody who was historically

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Speaking

51
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
When nobody

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
Lee Harvey Oswald

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
On the pages of the history books

54
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
Besides the Kennedy assassination is a nobody

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
Didn't do anything

56
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,240
But that event was huge right if he actually killed John F Kennedy the way the narrative says Lee Harvey Oswald change the world

57
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
You change the president instant

58
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Play right I mean how many of us have the

59
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Potential

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
To change who the president of the United States is

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
That lone gunmen did if he was indeed the lone gunmen

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
The person who may be most responsive

63
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,184
For the modern world this entire world including the 9/11 attacks

64
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,024
You know many commentators how they shape the modern world right

65
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
We live in an era of terrorism or the age of terrorism you'll hear them say

66
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Without them seem to really understand that the age of terrorism supposedly Spark by the 9/11 attacks in the

67
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Very very very early 21st century

68
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Or themselves

69
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Manifestations

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Oven actor

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Terrorism

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
The launch Destin

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
10 to the 20th

74
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
We actually live in an age of terrorism

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Some of the people like

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Like to say

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
We've been living in it for more than

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
I think you could make

79
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Did the most important individual in the last

80
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Century

81
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Is Gabrielle au Prince

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
And Gabrielle Oprah

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Is a name

84
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Very few

85
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Recognize

86
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
How can a person

87
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,687
I'm so little achievement you know on the world stage

88
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
Be perhaps credited with creating the entire world around us I mean if

89
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
If Gavrilo Princip doesn't live is there

90
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
A 9/11 attack ever

91
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
And if that was all he did when he be important

92
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
He's a lot more than that

93
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Every other principle is the reason there was a second

94
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
World War

95
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Gabrielle princep

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Is the reason it was a fur

97
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
And to be fair to princess

98
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
If you could have gone to him and shown him the ram of

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Vacations of

100
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
What that one day

101
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Would you do the world

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
I think he'd be horrified he wasn't trying

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
Go to unleash

104
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
A global World War

105
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
He just became

106
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
The latest example

107
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Of someone pulling the trigger

108
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,583
In a giant historical game of Russian Roulette

109
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Trigger that have been pulled several times already with nothing

110
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Who would have thought

111
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
At the time that princess

112
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Pulled it that would be the time

113
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Set the

114
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
A metaphorical

115
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
Revolve

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Pointed at the

117
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Skull of the old world

118
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Shot a bullet

119
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Sprain

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Perhaps

121
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Princep annies

122
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Pisgah Patriots

123
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Thought that

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
Sometimes when you're trying to create a new world

125
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Utterly

126
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Destroy the old one

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
And the people in that old world

128
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
We're not naive

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
If about the potential for

130
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Someone like a prince up to do what they did I mean

131
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Otto von Bismarck one of the greatest

132
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,383
Diplomats of nineteenth-century Europe perhaps the greatest Diplomat Germany ever produced

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Famously said that there was going to be some giant

134
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Global

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
Like it was going to probably break out because of some damn fool event in the Balkans

136
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Gavrilo princip shot

137
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
In the city of Sarajevo

138
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Smack

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Dab

140
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
A place that Otto von Bismarck

141
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,191
Famously said was not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian Grenadier

142
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Cost a hell of a lot

143
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
The mat

144
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
And prints it becomes yet another exam

145
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
Proven to us that

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
Sometimes when it comes to something like terrorism

147
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
In this area by the way when we try desperately

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,439
Weapons of mass destruction out of the terrorist hands because we're afraid to be able to kill more people with such weapons

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
We forget that sometimes

150
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
It's not about how many people you kill sometimes it's about

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Who they are

152
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
And often

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
It's not the terrorist

154
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Act the changes the world

155
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
It's the response of the victim

156
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Teleties

157
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Gavrilo princip

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Kill Tupac

159
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
He did so in a way

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
That almost makes you believe

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
And truthfully

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
I'm not much of a faith believer

163
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
But one of the things I like about histories Howard

164
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Forces me to challenge

165
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
Some of my own preconceptions

166
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
And I'm certainly make me think about other possibilities

167
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
I've always thought for example

168
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
History unfolds for chaotic reason

169
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:43,103
It's somewhat random that millions of people going about their lives in their own ways

170
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
With Trends and forces acting upon them and people in important positions making decisions and all this together created

171
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
Dynamic is completely unpredictable as I said somewhat chaotic and random

172
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Unfolds into the future

173
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
I think my logical side of the brain appreciate

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
That's what a Viewpoint the problem is is that sometimes

175
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
History

176
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Confronts us with events

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Where the logical part of at least my brain wants to flip side

178
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,823
And wants to logically defend what I consider to be the moral logical point of view

179
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
In this case

180
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,455
The logical part of my brain with sometime shift and try to defend something like

181
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Fate

182
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Destiny

183
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Or predetermination

184
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
Those to me are the two ends of the scale Chaos on one side and Randomness on one side

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Faith

186
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,095
Can predestination on the other and there's this weird Twilight Zone with a to sort of intersect

187
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
And that event that happened in late June 1914

188
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
He's one of the best examples you'll find from history where

189
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,175
The Logical side of your brain stand a pretty good chance of flipping and trying to defend the illogical position

190
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
But this is somehow

191
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Predestined

192
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
I mean look me

193
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Challenge you

194
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
With a similar kind of analogy

195
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Take the John F Kennedy assassination

196
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,071
And imagine that in addition to Lee Harvey Oswald up at the Texas School Book Depository

197
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
U of A

198
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
Another assassin on the grassy knoll it says sometimes been

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Suggested

200
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
And that

201
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
In this JFK assassination attempt Oswald misses

202
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
And the bullet strikes

203
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,503
The ground may be injured from passers-by and everybody realizes an assassination attempt is happening

204
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
And the Secret Service get on the car and they speed away

205
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,647
Past the grassy knoll past the other assassin who never get the shot

206
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
President Kennedy

207
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
And President Kennedy's gone

208
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
And no one knows what to do no one's quite sure what happens and then

209
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
In a later on

210
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
All of a sudden

211
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,055
Well the assassin on the grassy Knolls probably trying to just figure out okay maybe what do I do now

212
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
The car with the president and his wife

213
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
Show up right down the road again passed the Texas School Book Depository right to the grassy knoll

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Call work precedes to stall

215
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Unstop

216
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
What are the odds of that

217
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Kind of cookie huh history

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Can be that way

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
On June 28 1914

220
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Gabriella princep and from

221
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
6 to some sources say 20

222
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Assassins if

223
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
If you believe

224
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Some of the people who claimed you taken part in these

225
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Assassination attempts

226
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
Show up in Sarajevo with murder on their mind

227
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
They want to kill

228
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
The

229
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
The governing figure in Syria

230
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,279
The person who is sort of the Prince Charles plays the same role Prince Charles plays

231
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
In the British Monarchy right now

232
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
In the monarchy

233
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
Other country that are the overlord

234
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Words in Sarajevo country that doesn't exist anymore

235
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Called Austria-Hungary

236
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,591
And Austria-Hungary is led by really old

237
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,455
Very well-loved guy named franz-josef who's going to die soon because he's very old

238
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
And the person who will take over when Franz Joseph dies

239
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
Is this guy coming on a visit to Sarajevo

240
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,439
The Prince Charles of his country although unlike Prince Charles whose role is

241
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Completely ceremonial

242
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
This guy will actually have some real power when he gets the throne

243
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
After some

244
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
You're now when you look back on it looks like a stupid reason

245
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
This guy whose name is Archduke Franz Ferdinand

246
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,079
And decided to go to Sarajevo on watch military maneuvers

247
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,687
Which happened to coincide with the anniversary of the most emotionally important

248
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Heart-wrenching

249
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
The battlefield lost in all serve history

250
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
The battle of cowshed

251
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
On my way back from

252
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Hundreds of hundreds of years

253
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Before this time

254
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Serb nationalist

255
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,095
And the serbs are very very patriotic even today even more so back in 1914

256
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Look at this as a slap in the face

257
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,543
Too damn Sarajevo is Slavic and should be part of at least a pan-slavic country

258
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Or maybe part of Serbia

259
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,175
Harbin Balkan Wars for the last decade

260
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,551
In a concern with many of these naturalistic questions who should only use areas and it's been in the hands of the Ottoman Turks

261
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,879
The Slavs definitely feel shouldn't have been running the place

262
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,231
And it was transferred to the hands of the austro-hungarian Empire which disturb nationalists

263
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Still don't feel should be running the play

264
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Place

265
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
And now if the Archduke

266
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Was coming on the anniversary of this historic defeat

267
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,751
You know from the Serb nationalist Viewpoint to rub their nose in the fact

268
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
The Sarajevo is still held by a big non-slavic Empire

269
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
They're going to make

270
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Franz Ferdinand

271
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Pay for that

272
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,831
And in a remarkably similar situation to the Kennedy assassination

273
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Ferdinand's

274
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
Route for his motorcade is published ahead of time

275
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,327
He's going to be arriving and going down the main boulevards in an open car

276
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
With his wife

277
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Sitting next to him

278
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
These multiple of sass

279
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Line themselves up at

280
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
Various intervals along the parade route

281
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
And plan to kill the Archduke as soon as they can

282
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
The archduke's car is either going too fast

283
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
Or there are too many other serves in the crowd nearby the first few assassins so the first few assassins don't try to make a run at him

284
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Eventually passes one guy

285
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Who runs out from the crowd with a bomb

286
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Really more of a hand

287
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Good way to describe it today

288
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Any flings his hand grenade of the archduke's open car

289
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,447
Very athletic maneuver the Archduke sees it

290
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Ducks behind the door of the car

291
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,847
The hand grenade thing bounces off the car hits the concrete on the street

292
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
And the fuse doesn't detonate until the next car in the motorcade

293
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Has passed over it

294
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
It explodes

295
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,671
Some 20 people are badly hurt in the blood on the street the whole thing chaos the crowd scatters I mean obviously

296
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Leader of the parade is over

297
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,303
The would-be Assassin shoves a cyanide pill into his mouth

298
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
And runs down

299
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Into the side of the

300
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Street and jumps in the river

301
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,983
A cyanide pill is defective and only makes him vomit

302
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
And the rivers only about

303
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Is deep so they capture him very quickly

304
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Run him off to be

305
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,199
And basically looks like the whole day's been a failure

306
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,343
The other assassins at least some of them are supposed to have seen the archduke's car speeding off I mean there you go

307
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
There goes the day

308
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
The motorcade

309
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,255
Goes in a couple of different directions some people are taken to the hospital

310
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
The Archduke and his wife

311
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
You know go to the town hall to Lodge a complaint

312
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
They're going to make a speech anyway but now they have

313
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
An earful to give the local officials

314
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Come to your town and this is the reception we get

315
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
That kind of thing

316
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
And it looks at least

317
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
From this point like

318
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
End of the heir to the throne of

319
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
Austria-Hungary just dodged a bullet literally

320
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,439
There's some Talk Amongst the local officials about maybe figuring out a way to provide some increase security

321
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
But it doesn't seem to get very far because within an hour

322
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
After the first attack the Archduke and his wife and their small motorcade is

323
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
You know off to the hospital

324
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Supposedly

325
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
In a following an unplanned route for security reasons

326
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
There doesn't seem to be a lot of extra

327
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
The police protection up we're told that a

328
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,759
An aristocrat counts France on her Rock was on the running board

329
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Of the archduke's car so maybe a little life

330
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Action

331
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
Turns out though that the driver and one of those you know

332
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Strip that affect the entire history of the world turns out the driver of the archduke's car did not realize they were not taking the

333
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Chino parade route

334
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
And makes a wrong turn

335
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
And ends up nearest street corner

336
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
Where one of the Assassins gavrilo princip maybe the guy on the grassy knoll with JFK as station Tim's

337
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
Self in the hope that you might get a chance

338
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
You know maybe

339
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
Just be in the right place when the Archduke

340
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Had to come by again

341
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Perhaps on his way out of town

342
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
The Archduke driver makes a wrong turn

343
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
He's told by somebody in the motorcade that he's made a wrong turn and he has to backup he stops the car in preparation

344
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Before backing up

345
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Right

346
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Eyewear

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Gavrilo princip

348
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
Friendship is on that street

349
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Are worthy

350
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Motorcade

351
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,359
Car takes a wrong turn and then stops while backing up

352
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
These

353
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Is Target from

354
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Less than an hour before

355
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Near feet

356
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Immobile

357
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
I'm slightly below him

358
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
In an open car

359
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
And he whips out his pistol

360
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And shoots him

361
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
And his wife

362
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
What are the odds

363
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Happening

364
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
It's considered to be

365
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
One of the most Wild

366
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Coincidences

367
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
In all human history

368
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,967
How many times do assassins in a failed assassination attempt

369
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Get a second chance to go after their target

370
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,927
And we sometimes forget because it's such a Monumental historical moment

371
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
But this is still a terrorist.

372
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
And it was quite

373
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Upsetting

374
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
How to get a witness or Lyft

375
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Part of what makes

376
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
These things seem so unreal

377
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
Is it we only have grainy black-and-white footage

378
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,151
Even the events before that you can go see movies where you can see the Archduke and his wife

379
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
Getting ready to go into the motorcade and you get an idea of what they look like and it's all kind of moving a little too fast the way those old-fashioned movies

380
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
You were never look real

381
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
But you can go when you can see

382
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
See pictures

383
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Because they have saved

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
The tunic that the Archduke was wearing that day

385
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
And you can see In Living Color

386
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
Did this was a bright light blue tunic and the

387
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,007
Feathers on the helmet he was wearing a bright green I mean it must have been the most colorful site imaginable but after Prince of fire the most

388
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
Colorful side imaginable became a lot more gory

389
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Because there's a tear in the tunic

390
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
Where the bullet exited

391
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
The archduke's neck

392
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,111
And the tunic is covered in what is unmistakably even a hundred years later blood

393
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
And blood has always been one of those things

394
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Where When You See It In Living Color

395
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
There's nothing like

396
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
I tend to believe human beings are

397
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
The program

398
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
To react to that specific color

399
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
You're always

400
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
The difference

401
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Between seeing

402
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Blood in black and white and blood in colors

403
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
There's nothing

404
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
The person who was closest to the whole thing

405
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Was count von harrach

406
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Who was

407
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
On the running board

408
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,855
Not doing that great of a job apparently at security

409
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
And he says as soon as the

410
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Shots were fired

411
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
They reversed the car

412
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
He later testified

413
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
This

414
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Quote

415
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
Does a car quickly reversed

416
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,727
Athena stream of blood spurted from His Highness his mouth onto my right cheek

417
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
As I was pulling out my handkerchief to wipe the blood away from his mouth

418
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
The Duchess cried out to him

419
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
For God's sake

420
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
What has happened to you

421
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,015
I thought she slid off the seat and lay on the floor of the car with her face between his knees

422
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
I had no idea that she too was hit

423
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
And thought that she had simply fainted with fright

424
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
Then I heard his Imperial highness say

425
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Sophie

426
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Sophie don't die

427
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
Stay alive for the children

428
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,631
I thought I sees the Archduke by the color of his uniform to stop his head drooping forward

429
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
And asked him if he was in great pain

430
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Answer me quite distinctly

431
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
It is nothing

432
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:28,895
His face began to twist somewhat but he went on repeating six or seven times Evermore faintly is he gradually lost,

433
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
Consciousness it's nothing

434
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:36,063
Then came a brief pause followed by a convulsive rattle in his throat caused by the loss of blood

435
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
This Feast on arrival at the governor's residence

436
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,975
The two unconscious bodies were carried into the building where their death was soon establish

437
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
And quote

438
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
And as a way to sort of prove

439
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
The old

440
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Old adage that

441
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
One man's terrorist

442
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Is another man's freedom

443
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Fighter is true

444
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
You have only two notes

445
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
That amongst serbs today

446
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
Many will consider gavrilo princip

447
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Heroic

448
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Someone who

449
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
In a fire the first shots that started the chain of events that

450
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,255
While it will be horrible in both world wars for the Serbian people

451
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Eventually lead to well

452
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Now

453
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,911
A time when those countries exist without

454
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
You know having to be

455
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Just simply app

456
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,287
Province and some other major superpowers

457
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Territory

458
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Disturbs

459
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
This guy was a hero and to his compatriots

460
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
Who are realized they were like

461
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Desperados at the time

462
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
They all realized

463
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
That they would be immortalized

464
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
2

465
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Natural circumstance

466
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
By the way where this plot

467
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Was hatched

468
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
Are worthy of a spy novel

469
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
And it's hard to believe it hasn't been romanticized to some degree but nevertheless if you ever do

470
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,799
The definitive big-screen dramatization of World War 1 the whole story

471
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
I think you want to start your movie off

472
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
Without seeing the inside that

473
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Belgrade Cafe

474
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
Obscure place kind of run-down

475
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
Lead only by candlelight

476
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,903
With a group of 19 and 20 year old guys at a table

477
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
I wish I could remind myself how yummy

478
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,096
Not old enough to legally drink alcohol in the United States is how old these people are

479
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
And then we're told by people who were there

480
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:31,776
That what happened is one of their number comes in the door sits down at the table with them and has a package with

481
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,616
And he opens up the package and inside is only one thing

482
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
A newspaper

483
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
No note

484
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Still not signed by anybody know

485
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
Directions just a newspaper clipping in the clipping in ounces

486
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
The imminent visit of the Archduke

487
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Franz Ferdinand

488
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Sarajevo

489
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
One of the people

490
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
Who was at that table and lived

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,400
To grow older and write about his experiences after he had time to Indigo from terrorists

492
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
2 Patriot a guy named borgio

493
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,544
Junk ditch and if I mispronounce that by the way let's just get used to that

494
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
This is going to be perhaps the most

495
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:12,480
Linguistically an extension Willy challenging show I've ever done and I'm sure to Mango many beautiful

496
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
First and foremost

497
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,600
French so my apologies to all of you in advance I'm sorry

498
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
I have limitations and you're going to

Board subject each wrote years later

501
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
This about that moment in history that will turn out to be so very important in a way that you can't imagine anyone at the

502
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Didn't know they were pulling

503
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
The trigger again in that Russian roulette game and they certainly didn't know that if they were that was the time they were going to be a bullet in the chain

504

Jeff tetreault

505
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Can after the fact

Quote

507
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,552
A tiny clipping from a newspaper

508
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,624
Mailed without comment from a secret band of Terror

509
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Christian Zagreb

510
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:58,048
He capital of Croatia to their comrades in Belgrade was the torch which set the world afire with war

511
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
4 in 1914

512
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
That bit of paper

513
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Old proud Empires

514
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
He gave birth to new Free Nation

515
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
I was one of the members of the terrorist band in Belgrade

516
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,360
Which received it and in those days

517
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
I and my companions were regarded as desperate criminals

518
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
The price was on our head

519
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Today my little band is seen in a different light

520
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Has Pioneer Patriot

521
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,464
It is recognized that our secret plans hatched in an obscure Cafe in the capital of old Serbia

522
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,352
Have led to the independence of the new Yugoslavia the United Nations set free from Austrian domination

523
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
Ever since that time

524
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
People have been wondering

525
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,848
How connected that group was to outside entities

526
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Now they just a bunch of

527
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
In a small little

528
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
Self organized Terror groups put together by a bunch of young kids were they working for a larger entity

529
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,928
Today we would ask whether or not they were an example of state-sponsored terrorism

530
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
Was there a power

531
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Behind this group arrival power

532
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,192
I mean into understand how big of a deal this could be in a Europe that was already kind of unsteady and stressed

533
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
In terms of

534
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Stability

535
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
Imagine the United States president

536
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Uno president

537
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
Be controversial down the road

538
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
Is assassinate

539
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
We have all the shock

540
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
Anger and desire for Retribution that comes with that

541
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
And I'm very shortly after an assassin is captured

542
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,768
We figure out that assassin is working with the intelligence service

543
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Are most antagonistic enemy

544
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
You think for a second

545
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
How America would have reacted

546
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
If Lee Harvey Oswald

547
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,544
I've been a Hitman for Moscow

548
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
And that came to light

549
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Which by the way

550
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Is not

551
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
That outrageous a thing to consider

552
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
When you look at Oswald's ties to the Soviet Union and Cuba

553
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,952
Think about how the American people would have reacted regardless of what the facts were

554
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Were is they thought that was the

555
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
McKay's

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
And it's interesting to note

557
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,704
But that's only a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis a year after World War 3 is potentially dodged

558
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
What do you think the leaders of the United States after Kennedy's assassinated

559
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,152
Are worried about in terms of worst-case scenarios

560
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
Do you think it might have occurred to them

561
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
Men who buy the early 1960s had grown up during

562
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,720
And any immediate years after the first world war do you think they might have been seeing in their Mind's Eye

563
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
History repeating itself

564
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
A world leader

565
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,608
Killed by a gunman

566
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
In an open car

567
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
With his wife sitting next to him

568
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
In public

569
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Bye

570
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,128
A young person may be working for a foreign government

571
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:59,552
And then having the world spiral out of control despite what the major players may have one

572
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,416
Do you think the people around Kennedy might have worried a little about how that might have turned out

573
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Because

574
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,048
Those guys in that Cafe very well may have been working for the Serbian intelligence service

575
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
There's been a lot written about this

576
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
No one knows for sure

577
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,544
They certainly have ties to group that the United States today

578
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,384
Yeah we were ranking groups from 1914 would probably call terrorist

579
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Groups like

580
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Young Bosnia

581
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
And another one called the black hand

582
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
And these groups had Tae sometime to the Serbian intelligence service so you can believe the historian or the investigator you wanted

583
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
I believe it's a hot-button issue

584
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Nonetheless

585
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:43,328
It isn't so important what really happened just like it isn't so important whether or not Oswald was were

586
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Working for the Soviet Union

587
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
What's important is

588
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
What are the people on the ground affected by this

589
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Think was happening

590
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:56,128
The US public thought Oswald was a hitman for Moscow what happens then the austrians thought

591
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
The killing of their heir to the throne was in

592
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
Act of state-sponsored terrorism

593
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
And if it wasn't

594
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
They were going to make the case that it was anyway

595
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
There's really no doubt that the austro-hungarian empire

596
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,632
Wanted to deal with the Serbian problem that have been bedeviling it for sometime once and for all

597
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
And to be honest it's hard to blame

598
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
In the serbians and a slob

599
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
Will counter with the idea that the austro-hungarian did not possess this territory for very long Bosnia-Herzegovina

600
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,016
And places like Sarajevo had not been austro-hungarian furlong

601
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Time

602
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Nevertheless

603
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,880
You try to think of what nations stayed on the planet

604
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,792
Could put up with the nation over there border fermenting revolution in their country and eventually kill

605
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Are public figures I mean imagine

606
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
If you're an American

607
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
This happening in the United States

608
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Imagine

609
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
Shea Mexico

610
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Creating instability in

611
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,408
Unrest and fomenting subversion and revolution in places like Southern Texas

612
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
That's something you mix

613
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
And Southern Arizona Southern California and then eventually these

614
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,880
Are revolutionaries that have been egged on by the Mexican intelligence service

615
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Chile major US public figure

616
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
How long do you think United States who put up

617
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
The reason to become so important though

618
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,448
Is because of all the many controversies in the story

619
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
One of the most enduring and important

620
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
Is whose fault

621
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
Everything that's about to happen is

622
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,248
And if this is a civil lawsuit trying to figure out who's responsible for damages

623
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
Is a key part of this story

624
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
And the austro-hungarian empire

625
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
Is in a position to decide to go or not to go to war that seemed to put them in the driver's seat response

626
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Disability

627
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
There are austrians though

628
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Living at the time

629
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
Basically say

630
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
What choice did they have

631
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Take this Austrian

632
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
Writing after the wars a perfect example

633
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
He talks about

634
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,528
Archduke Franz Ferdinand is one of the best friends the Slavs ever had and then effect

635
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,368
Ferdinand actually was counseling his government

636
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,000
To treat the Serbian problem or lightly because he was worried about it sparking a general War

637
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
When he was killed

638
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
It was seen as

639
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,192
An extra perfidious act because the Slavic folks had

640
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Chilled

641
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
A person who had been

642
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
In one of their better friends in the Austrian government

643
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
The Austrian

644
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
Try telling you about a second ago after the first world war wrote this

645
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Best quote

646
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,600
When the news of the murder of Archduke Francis Ferdinand arrived in Munich

647
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
I happen to be sitting at home

648
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
And heard of it only vaguely

649
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
I was at first

650
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,048
She's with worried that the bullets may have been shot from the pistols of German stew

651
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,704
Who won of indignation of The Heirs apparent continuous work of slob ization wanted to free the German people

652
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
Open this internal enemies

653
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
What's a consequence of this would have been was easy to imagine

654
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
A new wave of persecution

655
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,968
Which now would have been Justified and explained in the eyes of the whole world

656
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,576
But when soon afterward I heard the name of the supposed assassins

657
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,648
And moreover where did they have been identified as serbs

658
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:24,256
A light shutter began to run through me at this Vengeance of inscrutable destiny

659
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
The greatest friend of the Slavs

660
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
Had fallen beneath the bullets of Slavic fanatics

661
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
Anyone he says

662
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
With constant occasion in the last year's to observe the relation of Austria to Serbia could not for a moment being.

663
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,688
The stone had been set rolling whose course could no longer be arrested

664
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
Those who today he writes

665
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Shower the Vietnamese government with reproaches

666
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,392
On the form and content of this Ultimatum It issued

667
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
Do it in just

668
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:58,304
No other power in the world could have acted differently in the same situation and the same position

669
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:03,168
At herself eastern border austria possessed an inexorable and mortal enemy

670
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,752
Who was shorter and shorter intervals kept challenging the monarchy

671
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,128
And would never have left off until the moment favorable for the shattering of the Empire had a ride

672
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
And quote

673
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
I actually agree with that

674
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
And it makes me uncomfortable

675
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Because the Austrian writing that

676
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Statement

677
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
After the first World War

678
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,184
Is the man most responsible for beginning II

679
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
I don't fit in

680
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,584
The one line that I think Hitler Aryan though

681
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
What is line that this Stone has been set

682
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,192
Rolling nothing could arrest

683
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,104
Because something could have arrested it because somebody had been arresting it there's a reason that the austro-hungarian heading attack the serbs are red

684
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,944
And the reason was that the serbs had a very powerful friend

685
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
The Russian

686
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Who consider themselves

687
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
The traditional Protectors of the sloth

688
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
And the serbs were not alone

689
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,000
Most of the powers of Europe had at least one and usually more

690
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,536
Powerful friends and allies

691
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,864
This was the era in European history

692
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
And it's often used

693
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:12,800
As an example of one of the main reasons this whole story unfolds the way it does this is the era of a very complex way

694
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Alliances

695
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
That binds European countries to each other

696
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
It's perhaps the most

697
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Enduring work

698
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,576
Of Otto von Bismarck we mentioned earlier the 19th century German diplomat

699
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,672
Is Mark played a very large role in the foundation of modern Germany

700
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,792
But he also played a huge role in creating a system of alliances that both expanded

701
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
You know Germany's possibilities

702
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,144
About the same time preserving

703
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
A general peace in Europe

704
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,848
There were Wars between Napoleon in the first world war that no doubt about that and some of them were directly the fault

705
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
The Bismarck

706
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
But there wasn't a general European conf

707
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
Involving all the major powers

708
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
And let's not

709
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
Forget that this is an era

710
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
That we would today call a multipolar world

711
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
Which is hard for us to understand and then era

712
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
One or two superpower

713
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
Europe during this time. Had at least

714
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
5

715
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
First-rate power state

716
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Britain

717
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
France

718
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Germany

719
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Russia

720
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
The austro-hungarian empire

721
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Many people throw in turkey and Italy to which would make seven

722
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
These states all were bound to each other

723
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
With complex Alliance System

724
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
And complex is

725
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
The way Bismarck wanted

726
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
Bismarck had set it up so that

727
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
Basically no matter what happened he was in the driver's seat

728
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
And this work

729
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,656
Unbelievably well especially for German interest before European interest as a hole for a long time

730
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
But by the time 1914 rolls around

731
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,592
This genius who create the system that's so complex only he knew how to run a

732
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
I take a whole courses on

733
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:59,296
Biz Markie and diplomacy from Professor who spent their whole life studying and they don't know why he did some of the things

734
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
He did

735
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
While he was running it

736
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
It was fantastic

737
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,464
By the time 1914 rolls around

738
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
He hasn't been running it for sometime

739
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
He'd been fired

740
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
Buy the leader of Germany

741
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,520
And now this complex machine that the genius of Bismarck had created and run with being run by people

742
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Who couldn't

743
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
It'll carry his jock strap is what we

744
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Used to say

745
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
It was inevitable that something like that

746
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Breakdown

747
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
The reason that

748
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
The austro-hungarians

749
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
Didn't just March into Serbia

750
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah the minute they found out that the storms were responsible for killing their heir-to-the-throne is it they knew that would mean War

751
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Is Russia

752
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,328
And that is something that the austro-hungarians

753
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
We're not prepared

754
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
At least not without checking

755
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
With their main friend on the world stage

756
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
And finding out you know what they would do in that situation

757
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Their main friend on the world stage

758
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
What's the German Empire

759
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,992
The German Empires attitude is very interest

760
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,600
The first thing I have to keep reminding myself about the German Empire during this era

761
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
Is that at relatively young it's a new country on my

762
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
It's only founded in 1871

763
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
I like 40 years before this error

764
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
It wasn't just a new country

765
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,520
The minute it was proclaimed and that's how it happened you didn't Proclaim England you didn't Proclaim France but your money is a Modern Nation

766
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,360
It was like a day where people signed papers and okay the next day hasn't tomorrow

767
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
Germany exist

768
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,736
And the minute existed it was the most powerful land power in Europe

769
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
With a larger

770
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,392
Population in France traditionally the greatest land power in Europe

771
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Bucket list time.

772
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
And a larger after birth rate

773
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
And more industry

774
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,608
And how destabilizing would it be in our world today

775
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
If a couple of different nations of moderate power signed a piece of paper tomorrow that United them into one country and that one

776
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,336
On now combined country was the most powerful country in the world

777
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
Even if it was just the most powerful land power

778
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:06,784
Are the most powerful C power you can see how bunch of Nations that really didn't deserve a lot of the perks

779
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
That's a super great Nations claim for themselves

780
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,440
Mine all of a sudden do that once they turn themselves into a super Nation

781
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,024
In 1871 with the creation of Germany the kaiserreich

782
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
You have

783
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
An instant great power on the world stage

784
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
It was Prussia

785
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
On steroids

786
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
With a population like eight times as much and the rest of Germany with demilitarized on the Prussian model with the

787
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Depression King

788
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
That's a very destabilizing thing

789
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
And when that country begins to demand

790
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,880
Some of the perks at the other great Powers have you know of their own France

791
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,256
Great Britain they got all these colonies all these are the things little Holland to them looks

792
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
Like they've got places all over the world what's going on

793
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
What are the factor of just having

794
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Been there for a while

795
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
You were around during the Age of Exploration and you had a bunch of ships out that you were getting colonies Germany didn't come around until most of the

796
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
The good stuff was taken

797
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
What's the cause of instability

798
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Germany worried about being encircled

799
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
Towers all around them that didn't wish them well

800
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
Is there any Niall Ferguson

801
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,976
In anything that I really thought was was quite wonderful because here in the west those of us who fought

802
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
The German Empire

803
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,400
Famously said that they had this order paranoia about being encircled are always worried about being encircled will look at them on a map

804
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,032
Airborne in circle during Central you're a big enemy Powers all around the Niall Ferguson said

805
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
They weren't

806
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
Paranoid about being encircled that were being encircled

807
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
They were worried about an upcoming War

808
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
And up until

809
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
Otto von Bismarck goes away he neutralized Russia that was like one of the main things in his diplomatic Alliance System keep the rush

810
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Washing tapi

811
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,536
He said in a five superpower World make sure your country's 103

812
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,840
Rights was always three against two

813
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,400
Russia was always to be kept on your good side

814
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,192
When he is fat and

815
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,032
Basically the foreign policy begins to be heavily influenced by the German

816
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Kaiser

817
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
The emperor Kaiser means Caesar

818
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Imagine

819
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
You're calling your emperor Caesar

820
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
In 1914

821
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
In any case the Kaiser

822
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
What a strange guy

823
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
He sacks

824
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
Bismarck because Bismarck kind of talking down to him and it's kind of running the show when he's an old guy by then and he's much revered and you know how do you agree

825
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
Grow into your own man with that guy hanging over your shoulder so he's fired them

826
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,216
And he allows that machine to make vinyl mistakes Bismarck never would have made with that diplomatic machine vital mistake number one

827
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
He lost the Russian

828
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
He intentionally drove them away basically

829
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
Right into the hands of the French

830
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
The historic German enemy

831
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,368
The one that they had beaten in the franco-prussian war in 1878 Z71 that allowed them to proclaim the German Empire

832
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
Which they did in the French Palace of Versailles

833
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Which is what about

834
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
Rub your nose in it

835
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
My kind of thing

836
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
The Germans and the French

837
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,352
Assume they'd fight each other again someday

838
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
Now the French were aligned with the Russians

839
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,496
And now the German fears of encirclement had become a reality

840
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,592
The Germans have been trying to plan for what they're going to do with a war

841
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
You know against an enemy

842
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
To their West

843
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,736
And another enemy to their East the same time

844
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
Write how do you do that

845
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,600
And now the situation in Austria boils over

846
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
And the Austrian say to the Germans

847
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,256
If we going to do a war with Serbia Russia is going to attack us if Russia attacks us

848
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Where do you stand

849
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,424
In the Kaiser this is controversial but traditionally the kinds of her supposed to have told the austrians

850
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
To go for it

851
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Get Serbia done now

852
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
And some historians again this is all very

853
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
Controversial everybody has a different opinion

854
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,224
But basically the idea seems to be that the Kaiser believed

855
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
If it was done quickly enough

856
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,416
The serbians could be crushed before the situation spiraled out of control in Europe because even as

857
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:02,560
Moderately intelligent will put will give him some credit that the Kaiser was he knew that Europe was a powder keg

858
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
And the key thing that had to be avoided

859
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Was this

860
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
Process

861
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
Almost a machine

862
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,800
The cranking up of a doomsday device

863
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:19,200
But everybody who'd actually been present when the thinkers who dealt with the doomsday device explain what the doomsday device did

864
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,272
Understood that once the trigger on this thing was pulled

865
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
It was going to be really hard to turn it off

866
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,952
So the austrians to conquer the serbians before the Russians flip the doomsday device

867
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Switch

868
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
It would all be okay

869
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
Again lot of controversy

870
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
That's because this

871
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,936
Is again another one of those places where the war guilt question hinges

872
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Did Germany tell Austria

873
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
To go Crush Serbia

874
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
And who cares if the Russians attack everybody

875
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:51,456
But of course the problem wasn't that it would just involve the Russians attacking everybody

876
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,040
Because of that complex web of alliances we talked about earlier

877
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
Other countries were going to get dragged into the console

878
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,464
This was something that was well understood by the intelligent heads of Europe

879
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Take for example

880
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,584
The British prime minister during this time. Herbert Asquith

881
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Asquith

882
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
Wrote a letter privately

883
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Come down

884
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
To the history book

885
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
Right after Serbia receive the ultimatum from Austria

886
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
It's so important

887
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
And

888
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Asquith

889
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
It's quote

890
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:25,504
Austria has sent a bullying and humiliating ultimatum to Serbia

891
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Who cannot possibly comply with

892
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
And then demanded an answer within 48 hours

893
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Failing which

894
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
She will March

895
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,024
This means almost inevitably that Russia will come to the scene in defense of Serbia

896
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
Any Defiance of Austria

897
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
And if so

898
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,936
It's difficult for Germany and France to refrain from lending a hand to one side or the other

899
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,264
So that we are in measurable or imaginable distance

900
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm a real Armageddon

901
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,640
Happily there seems to be no reason why we should be anything more than spectators

902
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
And quote

903
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Let's learn.

904
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
Obviously to be wishful thinking on the British prime minister's part

905
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:05,951
But historians like Niall Ferguson who write revisionist works like the pity of War has suggested that if the British had stayed out we have a better

906
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Better world today

907
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,279
For all sorts of reasons he knocks off

908
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:15,935
Many of the biggest events of the 20th century the most horrible saying this never happens that never happened that never happens if Britain stays out of the war

909
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,543
Britain can stay out of the work if they don't have a heart Alliance

910
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,615
With anyone they're not caught up in that web of alliances

911
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
Not too much to have an understand

912
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
An understanding with enough wiggle room

913
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,855
So that there was a lot of talk and Britain about do we or don't we get involved in this whole thing

914
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
This whole thing

915
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,487
What's something that hadn't happened in a hundred years in Europe

916
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
A general European War

917
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,911
It hadn't happened since Napoleon since Waterloo

918
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
And that war was so terrible

919
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,847
Matches that were the entire Napoleonic wars in the wars of the French Revolution era

920
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,223
Mike 1789-1815 so awful in terms of military destruction

921
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
That a lesson had been talked

922
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
To do in a crowned heads of Europe in the lesson was

923
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
War is not as much of a game and he

924
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
It's no longer

925
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,607
Are these small private armies that we move around our European chessboard and oh I lost to you so you can have this province in the

926
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
Next time I'll beat you and I'll take that Province back you know

927
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Nobody was trying to top

928
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Weather

929
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
He was

930
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
If anything gentlemanly Warfare

931
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
There's never been such a thing

932
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
It's been called in the history books

933
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Limited War

934
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
Restricted War

935
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,783
It was an Italian historian named Ferraro

936
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
1933

937
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Who talked about how

938
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
You know that era of warfare was the kind of warfare where

939
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:48,607
NFL leaders and countries can actually have fun going to war or something you just sort of did like pheasant hunting at least in the

940
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Reminder some of these

941
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,191
Ferrara right quote

942
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,311
Restricted Warfare was one of the loftiest achievements of the 18th century

943
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:03,967
HIPAA longs to a class of Hothouse plants which can only thrive in an aristocratic and qualitative

944
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
Civilization

945
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
We are no longer capable of it

946
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
It's one of the Fine Things We have lost as a result of the French Revolution

947
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
And quote

948
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,975
The French Revolution

949
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
Was when

950
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
The Warfare God

951
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,631
At least in the minds of the Europeans of this era

952
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
You really serious

953
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
You want a war then we're going to go to war

954
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
The crowned heads of Europe

955
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,103
Attack France after France went all revolutionary

956
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
You have to understand how much of a shot

957
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,711
That was historian Gwynne Dyer

958
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,295
As a great way of describing and he says to understand the shock of the crowned heads of Europe

959
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,831
When the most Royal

960
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Of European countries

961
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
The French

962
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
Were overthrown by leftist revolutionaries

963
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
He said you have to imagine if Maui

964
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
Toppled the US government today

965
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:57,727
Now is support being a free hardcore communist group imagine them toppling today's US government and beginning to govern

966
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,287
Because that's how the crowned heads of Europe felt about

967
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,847
The French Revolution and how destabilizing it was seen

968
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Inevitably

969
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:10,271
The royalty of Europe which is almost all of your classes with this new Republic in France

970
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
Coalesces into an alliance and everybody attacks France

971
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,695
They do so with their private mercenary armies

972
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
And they run into the entire

973
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
French

974
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Population

975
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
A people in arms

976
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
Because France started by losing you have to imagine a state where the entire underpinnings of the state of being broken down in clue

977
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Hutong especially the army

978
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,735
And then all me Prussia Russia Austria and Great Britain all these powers in Europe attack France at the same time

979
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
And you're stuck with

980
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,647
I mean like a bit of your army leftover the artillery stayed with the people so the old French artillery was good

981
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,999
What you've got this mishmash of an army with officers you don't have any authority of crazy

982
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
And France is about to be defeated and then as only you know totalitarian type regimes can do

983
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:04,031
They basically tell the people of France that the war is now everything

984
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:08,383
Our entire Focus the entire Society exists only

985
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
To win this war

986
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
The decree of the

987
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
The French national Convention

988
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
In 1793 said quote

989
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,695
From This Moment until that in which our enemies shall have been driven from the territory of the Republic

990
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
All Frenchmen are permanently requisition for service in the army

991
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
The young men shall fight

992
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,399
The married man show Forge weapons and transport supplies

993
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,983
The women will make tents and clothes and serving hospitals

994
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
The public building shall be turned into barracks

995
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,103
The public squares into munition Factory

996
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,199
All firearms of suitable caliber should be turned over to the Troops

997
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,759
The interior will be police with shotguns

998
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
And Cold Steel

999
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
All saddle horses Shelby sees for the cavalry

1000
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
All draft horses not employed in cultivation

1001
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
Will draw the artillery and Supply wagon

1002
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
And quote

1003
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
In other words

1004
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,191
The entire Society was mobilized for the war effort this was not something that the other countries did in fact

1005
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Most of the royal

1006
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
The leaders of Europe

1007
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:12,127
Could think of nothing more scary than arming and training your population

1008
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,711
Often times that use their professional militaries

1009
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:22,111
To put down Rebellion by their population the last thing they wanted to do was give them guns and train them how to use it right training how to

1010
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Cedar Street fire

1011
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
Wasn't going to happen

1012
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,535
The French had a different kind of society one that was supposed to be run by the very

1013
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,607
You know lowborn people everybody was in this together

1014
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,191
And you combine the willingness to throw human life

1015
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:42,591
You know out there on the battlefield in almost endless numbers you didn't have to pay these people either you can just say I'm sorry

1016
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
Are you out of work right now you're going to the front end.

1017
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
Steal some chickens from some Farmer on the way

1018
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
This was crazy

1019
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,599
And all of a sudden the French were able to expand

1020
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Live

1021
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,975
It was on a scale that was unprecedented and to create armies that were enormous

1022
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Mean look

1023
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,095
Alexander the Great probably the greatest conqueror in all world history

1024
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
Alexander conquered

1025
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,031
A very large chunk of the known world and a decent-sized chunk of the unknown world at the time

1026
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
With an army that numbered

1027
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Anywhere from 40

1028
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
290 thousand men

1029
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Okay

1030
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
He was obviously a genius in the way he did it

1031
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
But imagine if

1032
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,343
Alexander could have used a historical xerox machine

1033
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Duplicate

1034
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,671
That world-conquering arm

1035
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
So that now he's got to

1036
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,047
40 to 90,000 man armies roughly comparable to

1037
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
Imagine he does it again

1038
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
And then duplicated again

1039
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
Did you that enough time to where you got

1040
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,639
142 1.3 1.5 million men

1041
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,943
Maybe eventually closer to 3 million men

1042
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
And now you've given Alexander the Great

1043
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
20th century Army

1044
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
A twentieth-century army

1045
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,439
Is many many armies from the past

1046
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,559
The French Revolution is when they really start

1047
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
When you start

1048
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Putting

1049
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
So many troops into the field

1050
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,959
But it doesn't matter that there

1051
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
Practically incompetent

1052
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,615
That their lives are wasted that they're turned into cannon fodder as Napoleon who will inherit this

1053
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
You know People's Army

1054
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:26,015
That Wilkin script every man they want to come script as long as they need them will say

1055
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
Troops are born to be killed

1056
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,927
When is Napoleon famously said to the Austrian diplomat

1057
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
Count Metternich

1058
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
You cannot stop me

1059
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
I spend thirty thousand lives a month

1060
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
If any of the major Powers except maybe Russia

1061
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
In Europe at this time

1062
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,799
Lost thirty thousand men in a month would be considered quite a blow

1063
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,639
Napoleon lost 30000 men a month as a matter of course

1064
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
Because he had a new kind of arm

1065
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
Are people in arms

1066
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
And in order to beat him

1067
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,695
The other countries of Europe had to do the same thing

1068
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,559
As the German field Marshal blueshirt old depression

1069
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Government

1070
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,191
After the prussians have been defeated by Napoleon give me a national Army

1071
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,239
Give me what he has

1072
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
And when he got it

1073
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:26,175
You know which depression aristocracy didn't want to do for the same reason that the European leaders everywhere didn't want to do it and I want to put the people in arms

1074
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,783
But when they did they were able to Triple the size of bluchers Army and he took that Army and fought Napoleon

1075
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
The creation of a nation in arms

1076
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
What's the first step in creating the Modern War Machine

1077
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,535
Because now all of a sudden life was cheap

1078
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Not only was wife

1079
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Cheap

1080
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
But the modern nation-state

1081
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Was now deep enough

1082
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,055
To be able to truly take a punch

1083
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,175
This is what sets the modern military is often the modern States off from the ones

1084
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
In ancient time

1085
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
In ancient times very few

1086
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
States

1087
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
Could take a punch you know to use a boxing term

1088
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,975
Many of them could dish it out and you take a state like the achaemenid Persian she was the one who fought the Spartans at Thermopylae and all that

1089
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,583
The Persians could dish out really good blows but they couldn't take very many good

1090
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,447
Most nations in the past could that's why if you look at a book you know the greatest battles in history

1091
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
If it's beyond you know about 150 years ago

1092
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
Sometimes the great battle is the only

1093
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:30,943
The wars are won or lost on one big battle cuz the nation-states couldn't take too many punches they couldn't

1094
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
Re raise armies the state just couldn't support

1095
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Once

1096
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,623
France turn the entire nation into the war effort

1097
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:43,743
Nations can take punches better ending in the path of the Mongols and the Chinese could take some punches

1098
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,327
The Roman Empire could take punches that's what set those

1099
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
Nation states in the past

1100
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Apart from most of their enemies

1101
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,495
Right that they had more staying power they had modern staying power

1102
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,055
The French Revolution teaches all these states

1103
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,895
To have modern staying power the only problem with modern staying power

1104
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,199
Is the killing can go on longer

1105
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
In boxing

1106
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,039
They always feel like in early knockout is more merciful

1107
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,879
Been a long match because in a long match you take a lot more punishment

1108
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,511
Pulling a funny way if everything could be decided in one big horrific battle you know what the start of a war

1109
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,095
That is a lot less costly over time than a four or a

1110
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
5 year long conf

1111
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Like we're both sides

1112
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
Grind each other down to the nub

1113
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
The Napoleonic Wars

1114
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359
Created multiple States in Europe capable of fighting

1115
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
Until they were ground down to the nub

1116
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:38,015
Which meant a lot more damage and destruction before these wars came to walk

1117
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
The modern nation-state provided the support

1118
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
That the military

1119
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
It involved in tire

1120
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
He pulls in arms needed to keep

1121
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,815
The struggle going

1122
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,703
You know for long periods of time one half of the equation necessary to create the Modern War Machine

1123
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,311
As military historian Gwynne Dyer rights right after he talks about the human cost

1124
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
The Beast

1125
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,383
Along Napoleonic Wars he says quote

1126
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
Almost as important

1127
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,527
Is the fact that European Society did not break down under the strain

1128
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
There was hardship

1129
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,087
But no starvation

1130
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,647
And the warring Powers were able to keep at it

1131
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
And keep your people at

1132
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,743
Year after year with no end in sight

1133
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
Do Europeans pay to develop the wealth

1134
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
The organizational techniques

1135
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,935
And the methods of motivation needed to fight Mass Wars

1136
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,311
With a degree of popular participation that no other civilized society had ever even approach

1137
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
All that was lacking he writes

1138
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,943
To transform Mass Warfare into Total War

1139
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
What's the technology

1140
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,087
But the Industrial Revolution was already almost a generation old in 1814

1141
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,903
And soon it would begin to fill the last remaining Gap

1142
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
And quote

1143
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
What was missing

1144
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,863
To make this new deadly machine that the Napoleonic wars in the French Revolution created

1145
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
What's the technology

1146
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
To increase the deadliness

1147
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,495
By exponential amount

1148
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
And that was already something that was happened

1149
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:10,943
The 18 hundreds are in error in military history with a killing power of machines Skyrim

1150
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
And machines have been an important

1151
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,551
Part of Battlefield

1152
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,415
Since before there were cities in human societies to Field Mass armies at all

1153
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,951
Think of the bow and arrow

1154
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
That's a Neolithic

1155
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
Stick weapon that's a stone age machine

1156
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
That made man a more efficient killer

1157
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Both in hunting

1158
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
But on the battle

1159
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Field as well

1160
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
Are the tiny 1800 roll around

1161
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,055
The Machine's killing power Skyrim

1162
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
But

1163
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,943
Because there is no major war

1164
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,295
Involving all the great powers between Napoleon the first World War

1165
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
The actual demonstration of how this

1166
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Stuff can be used

1167
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
Is lacking

1168
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,511
And the military powers of the world

1169
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,839
Try to examine the conflicts that do happen

1170
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:04,191
To see if they can learn any lessons about what the next war is likely to be like

1171
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:09,055
There were European observers for example of the American Civil War

1172
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
To try to see

1173
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
You know what you could learn from that

1174
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,223
The Korean War breaks out in the 1850s between Russia

1175
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,503
And Britain and France

1176
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,343
There's a war obviously between the United States

1177
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
And Spain

1178
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
Del Valle Cuba in the Philippines

1179
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,487
You're right around the turn of the century going into the 99

1180
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:33,631
Probably most importantly there's a war between Japan and Russia in 1905

1181
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,703
Where some of the use of these

1182
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:43,103
Any new weapons that win fused together create the modern war machine where some of that was abs

1183
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Reservable

1184
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
The one thing that seems to be

1185
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
The key element

1186
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,295
As far as European planners can figure it out though

1187
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,575
Is something

1188
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,623
The Harkens back to a phrase

1189
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,439
From a confederate general in the US Civil War

1190
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Akita dwarf

1191
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,279
Westin get their first tooth

1192
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
With the most

1193
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
End

1194
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,167
The idea now of these Mass Army

1195
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
That your pen created

1196
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:14,847
Was that you needed to be able to raise them and get them to the battlefield

1197
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
Before the other side

1198
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Beat you to it

1199
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
The timetable for mobilization

1200
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Becomes

1201
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Force

1202
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
But none of the major European powers

1203
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,415
Seem to be anything but a slave to

1204
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,463
What's the Assassin's bullet

1205
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
In Sarajevo

1206
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Cut down the aisle

1207
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Austrian Archduke

1208
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,631
When the Archduke is killed by

1209
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Princep

1210
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,983
He does the equivalent of pulling a pin on a hand grenade

1211
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
Imagine trying to hold

1212
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
Negotiations to ward off an explosion with a guy who's already pulled the pin on the grenade right

1213
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Limited amount of time

1214
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
To convince them of anything

1215
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
Winston Churchill during his life

1216
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Famously said

1217
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
That Jaja

1218
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
Was better than war war

1219
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,487
You need to go see a shins always better than War

1220
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:09,887
But the persons already pulled the pin on the hand grenade you have a very short window of opportunity

1221
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,191
To avoid the inevitable end that's where you're at

1222
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
Finds itself

1223
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,751
After the Archduke was murdered

1224
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,591
Everybody's worried about the same thing too there's an old

1225
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Praise the

1226
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Peace movement

1227
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Using the lights

1228
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,967
1960s early 1970s where they would say

1229
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
What if they gave a war

1230
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
And nobody came

1231
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,671
The military planners in Europe at this time. Are worried about something a little bit different

1232
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,463
War breaks out

1233
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,535
Enema days the hostilities commence

1234
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
Only one side's got their armies

1235
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
Even if it takes you

1236
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,959
30 days to get your

1237
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,079
Reservists in uniform to the mustering point to the battlefield before they're ready to fight

1238
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:54,175
How big of a deal is it if it only takes your opponent 15 days

1239
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
Do the same thing

1240
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
This puts a huge

1241
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
Crunch

1242
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,879
You're TimeWise on everybody in the story

1243
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,231
And constrain the ability to negotiate your way out of the situation everybody feels like

1244
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,327
Okay the first person that flips the mobilization switch we all go

1245
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,119
Cuz nobody wants to fall behind

1246
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:18,239
The Germans have constrained themselves even more time Lies by the way that they have

1247
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,031
Found the solution

1248
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,871
To their terrible dilemma of how do you fight a two-front war

1249
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:29,503
And once you violate bismarck's dictum of going to keep the Russians on your side

1250
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
And then the Russians and the French Ally with each other and War breaks out you're going to be fighting the French in the west and the Russians in the east at the same time

1251
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
And in the intervening decades

1252
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:45,887
The Fantastic German general staff and figured out a way to not just survive that situation

1253
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
Win that war

1254
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
But it involved

1255
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Exquisite time

1256
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,311
Which further constrained

1257
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,639
D-mart negotiation room you had before the grenade went off

1258
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:02,783
The timing involved taking advantage of the fact that everyone thought the Russians were going to take forever to mobile

1259
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
The Russians were seen as a giant someone

1260
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
Clumsy Colossus

1261
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,487
Less organized than the Germans in the French and people like that

1262
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:17,631
And so by the time the Russians could get their act together and get their monster is armies in the field ready to fight

1263
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
Germany already would have defeated France

1264
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Entire plan for action

1265
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,895
Involve throwing almost all their weight against the French immediately and then turning after French

1266
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:33,247
Forces were defeated and throwing those forces against the now ready to fight Russia

1267
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
The destitute

1268
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Things to draw

1269
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
1

1270
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:43,231
It meant the Russians could have no Advanced I'm mobilizing you couldn't let them mobilize for

1271
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:48,863
Three or four days while you waited to negotiate putting the pin back in a grenade you know that kind of time

1272
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,167
You were going to screw up your entire plan for

1273
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
Winning the war if you did that

1274
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
The other thing that it meant

1275
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
Is it if you went to war with Russia

1276
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
You had to attack France

1277
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:05,247
You had to assume that the French would come in at some time and the only thing you had a plan to deal with which to attack the French first so if you go

1278
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Going to war with Russia you get to it

1279
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Cancel part of the bargain

1280
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
It was even more

1281
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
What concern than that

1282
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
It involved

1283
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Attacking countries

1284
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Besides for

1285
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,047
Countries who had no

1286
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
Disagreement with it all

1287
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
Neutral country

1288
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,423
It just happened to be in the way

1289
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
The Germans

1290
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
I come up with a plan

1291
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
To deal with Aaron Circle

1292
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,175
What is involve launching essentially a World War

1293
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
In their own defense

1294
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
The other thing that prints up did

1295
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,183
What's provide an opportunity for a lot of these leaders who thought war was coming anyway

1296
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,767
To decide that now was better than later

1297
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,095
And this is another interesting side of the conflict but if

1298
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,399
You're part of these many military staff

1299
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,447
Absolutely sure war is coming

1300
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,055
And you can read accounts from every major military the time.

1301
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,871
Numbers of their military planners thought war was inevitable

1302
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,199
The question is if it's going to be inevitable

1303
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
Is it better to fight it now than later

1304
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:14,367
The Germans were under the impression that the Russians were on their way to superpower

1305
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,439
Power status which if you look at what happened in the 20th century

1306
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
Is exactly how it turned out

1307
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,559
The Germans felt that by 1917

1308
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:28,959
That was going to be a reality the Russians were completing major military reforms major transportation reforms they were taking advantage of

1309
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,751
Huge French bank loans

1310
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:36,383
To do this stop the Germans figured if War comes in three years we're going to be in a much worse situation than we are now

1311
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,431
So if it's here we might as well do it now

1312
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
We have an advantage now we won't have later

1313
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
The French felt

1314
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:50,207
Similarly about the Germans of the Germans felt about the Russians they were looking at the German birth rate and just going

1315
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
We're going to be smart

1316
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
They're looking at the growth in Industry I'm in the Germans were

1317
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
On a tear

1318
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
Soft war came in

1319
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,215
Five or six or seven years

1320
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
The French were just going to be worse off

1321
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,151
So they figured the same thing as going to come let it come now

1322
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
And amidst

1323
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,039
These interesting

1324
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,367
Conflicts of interest in worries about timing and all this stuff

1325
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
The world

1326
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
These words heading

1327
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,999
And tried to pull back from the brink

1328
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,303
But instead of having

1329
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,447
You know the greatest Statesman Europe can produce during this time. Some of these countries are saddled with people

1330
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
Who are like

1331
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,799
Millstone's around the neck of peace

1332
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
People like

1333
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
Kaiser Wilhelm II

1334
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
The Emperor of Germany

1335
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,807
And Leadership is such an interesting side of this

1336
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
Conflict

1337
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Because

1338
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,231
I firmly believe have you had a guy of Otto von bismarck's caliber

1339
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,815
Your position of authority in Germany when the first world war is

1340
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,351
On the verge of happening

1341
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
But they could put the pin back in a grenade

1342
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
Peanut

1343
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Gavrilo princip metaphor

1344
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,543
People in Sarajevo

1345
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
And all it would have required

1346
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,871
Would have been some real

1347
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
Diplomatic

1348
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Quality

1349
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,527
Brilliance would have been great but I don't even think you needed that just some

1350
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:22,367
Some high-quality workmanship what's the Germans who produced time and again

1351
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
The problem was in this time.

1352
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,975
They're stuck with a ruler

1353
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,023
Who could not have gotten the job

1354
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,351
If married had been one of the requirements

1355
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
You not having it handed to

1356
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Kaiser Wilhelm II

1357
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Was not a great leap

1358
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,055
He represents the

1359
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,871
Elmo's wonderful example you can easily think of

1360
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,919
Of what a roll of the dice

1361
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,455
Hereditary monarchy

1362
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
He is

1363
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,319
How sometimes you get a great role and you end up with a gifted ruler and then

1364
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,135
It almost seems wonderful that they've got so much

1365
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Power in their hands right because

1366
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:01,279
If someone really knows what to do with it and does good things with it you kind of stay to yourself

1367
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,071
I'm glad they have the power to do this good thing

1368
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:08,191
That's a bit of a roll of the dice isn't it as often as you get one of those people you get somebody who's

1369
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,751
Evil or cruel or insane

1370
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,591
Some people throughout history of world very badly on the dice

1371
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
Artemis

1372
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
But it creates good hardcore history

1373
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
Tina Frost

1374
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
The ancient elamites used to roll

1375
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:25,087
Whatever the number is it comes up and you get yet another insane ruler in your

1376
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Dynasties

1377
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,647
Made for fun

1378
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
Reading but I wouldn't want to live under it

1379
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
In Germany

1380
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,303
This current leader this current Kaiser Kaiser

1381
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,119
Just like Czar in Russia where they have an autocratic

1382
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
Guy to

1383
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,959
Both of those stem from the word Caesar

1384
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,031
Which right there in the 20th century sound anachronist

1385
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:50,943
That's part of this old world that existed forever and King and Emperor doesn't sound anachronistic

1386
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,063
At any time in history before 1914 going back to like Mesopotamia does it

1387
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,855
Just sounds weird in the 20th

1388
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:02,975
Show you how old this world is that is marching into the 20th century

1389
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:08,351
Three of the major powers in this conflict are ruled by Emperors Kings or czars

1390
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,191
They don't have total power with Lazaro

1391
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
I was really

1392
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,519
All the Kaiser's had his chipped away

1393
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:20,639
Over couple Generations you have to share some power with a German legislature which has political parties and they

1394
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:27,039
Handle budgets and Taxation with the Kaiser still has a ton of power war and foreign policy and political appointments and all that

1395
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
He's just as below average guy

1396
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:35,743
The funny part about the Kaiser is that the best thing that ever happened to his reputation was at off Hitler

1397
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,327
Because when you look into propaganda and you read

1398
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
The stuff written about the Kaiser before Hitler comes along

1399
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,239
And the Kaiser is treated as this evil character

1400
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:53,407
You know this militaristic want to take over the world blood falling off of the band that you see in the political cartoon

1401
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:59,295
And now the attitude that people have towards him is that he's almost silly

1402
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,111
Or that he's full of

1403
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,719
I know you just wrapped with inferiority complex and she's almost to be pitied he's

1404
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
A little mentally doll but there isn't that malevolent evil sort of thing and I think part of the reason why is

1405
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:18,751
When you have Hitler to compare someone to all of a sudden you see that the Kaiser was just sort of a

1406
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,335
Are marginally bad role on the monarchy dice

1407
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
For what it's worth

1408
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:29,759
He was tied into all the other great monarchies in Europe one of the funny twist in the story

1409
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,551
And it actually provides

1410
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
You know something of importance because

1411
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,927
In Europe at this time the royal families had relatives

1412
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,255
Other royal families in Europe in their families

1413
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:45,887
And his family still communicated with each other which provides like a diplomatic back-channel

1414
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
Woody's rulers can actually in a sidestep traditional diplomacy and just write the family member that rules

1415
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,567
The other country for example

1416
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
Queen Victoria

1417
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,407
I may be the most famous Queen in British

1418
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,967
History may be the most important rules for ever

1419
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,551
I presided over Britain during the height of Britain's power when she's

1420
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,159
Controlling most of the world in the Sun proverbially never set on the British Empire

1421
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
Queen Victoria's grandchildren

1422
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
I mean well

1423
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Kaiser Wilhelm

1424
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,607
He's Queen Victoria's

1425
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,959
Grandchild he's the first cousin of the king of England King George

1426
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
Right

1427
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
Not just that

1428
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
What does Czar of Russia

1429
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,079
Is married

1430
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
To another

1431
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,663
Queen Victoria's grandchildren

1432
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
Azhar Azhar son-in-law

1433
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
It's also wilhelm's

1434
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,295
Cousin and when you know he gets upset

1435
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,927
We want to talk to the Russians about something people often you'll sit down and pain a quick note to cousin Nikki

1436
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
That would be Czar Nicholas II

1437
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Now

1438
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
The Czar in Russia is another

1439
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,655
Average to low average role on the monarchy

1440
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Dice

1441
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:58,079
It's perhaps telling and some historians have made it out to be that you end up with such mediocre leadership in such a power

1442
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
Powerful countries during this time.

1443
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,175
It might account for why

1444
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
You know these

1445
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:09,343
International incident with the war previously didn't but now are because the leadership sucks

1446
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,183
I mean in terms of what you could expect at these people were merit-based leaders

1447
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,743
You can say what you want about a Stalin

1448
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:21,119
Or Hitler or even a Mussolini who's been portrayed again in the west like some sort of clown

1449
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,191
But all of those people were formidable individuals

1450
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,799
Rose through the ranks at some level and same thing with American politicians

1451
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:35,199
How many garlic Franklin Roosevelt you can say what you want about him but that's a formidable human being with qualities that allow them to sort of rice

1452
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:38,271
Rise to the top that requires a merit-based

1453
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
Something

1454
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,903
Being born into the hohenzollern family as the oldest son done require any

1455
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,695
That's the luck of the draw

1456
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,023
If the job of Kaiser been merit-based

1457
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,095
Kaiser Wilhelm II window gotten anywhere near it

1458
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
And yeah he's the guy

1459
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:58,751
Most responsible for putting the pin back in a grenade Wars going to be avoided here and

1460
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:03,871
He famously said after he sacked Bismarck and then sacked another guy said I'm I am my own chance

1461
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
Meaning I'm

1462
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
I'm going to run all this myself

1463
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:12,319
What you do when not only are they subpar and intelligence and Brilliance and all that

1464
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:17,695
Because there's some part that they can't see that there's some part of they don't even take advice well

1465
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:23,839
At one point in the story The Kaiser will ask one of his military leaders to do something that is ridiculous

1466
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,399
Stupid lose the war stupid

1467
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:31,263
And the military leader will say it cannot be done in the Kaiser will embarrass him and say something

1468
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,359
To the effect of your uncle who was also a field Marshal to give me a different answer

1469
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
In other words he would have done

1470
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,943
What I wanted him to do even if it was

1471
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,711
Stupid

1472
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,623
The guys are just to show you how it is too so you understand royalty and you remember you had to go yeah that's what royalties like

1473
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,695
This a military leader I just called a guy named Von moltke

1474
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:54,047
We'll have to change the way that the German war game system work

1475
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
For the first World War

1476
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,679
And he will have to put his foot down and take a career risky move

1477
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,031
Until the Kaiser that no longer can they keep up with the tradition

1478
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,383
Whatever side the Kaiser is commanding in the German national war games has to win

1479
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
Think about that

1480
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Per second

1481
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,015
Before Field Marshal Von moltke puts his foot down

1482
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,623
Whatever side the Kaiser is commanding in these War Games he's National maneuvers

1483
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,927
National Security importance

1484
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
Whatever side the geysers commanding wins

1485
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Automatically

1486
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
Pokestats

1487
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:32,703
Goofy and the Kaiser's a little goofy he's got this one arm that was damaged during his birth

1488
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,799
Which was withered and had no strength he couldn't cut his own food for example

1489
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,895
Which is so embarrassing to a guy who's already got an inferiority complex

1490
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:47,295
He goes to England to spend time with his cousin and they don't really care for him too much the British royal family is kind of turned off

1491
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,647
By William and all William wants his kind of their love and approval and to be like them

1492
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,463
What's funny is in this sort of weird

1493
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Almost

1494
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,327
Like tragic playwright kind of way

1495
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:05,983
The Kaiser sort of embodies the inferiority complex that his country has at this time to there are Newcomb

1496
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,799
Country on the stage and they think they're being treated like trash

1497
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591
They're mad they're there

1498
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,663
Chauvinistic that's how the British in the French and Dutch people see the images

1499
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,687
These upstart

1500
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,991
In a push that weight around kind of people

1501
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:22,367
But as many asteroids are pointed out there's no nation in the world that's up and coming it doesn't start to act like

1502
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,975
And when they do the Nations that already have it all don't like it I mean how to

1503
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
How does the United States kind of feel about

1504
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
China today is sort of elbowing its way into the

1505
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
You know

1506
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,679
Power structure here I mean we all understand they deserve it

1507
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:39,519
You look at their economic look at all the signs they they're their up-and-coming but

1508
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:44,383
Nobody necessarily feels like that person pushing their way in to get their own spaces

1509
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,175
Anything other than a bit of an upstart

1510
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,991
During this time period the United States placed a similar role

1511
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:55,903
There's some elbow in their way in the world power whether the people that are already there like it or not make some room here we come

1512
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,279
That's how the German Empire was there wasn't a feeling of inferiority and Kaiser Wilhelm held that's what

1513
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,303
Attitude in Spanish

1514
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
But if you read this

1515
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,911
Stop at the time she portrayed in this military

1516
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,215
The term is most often used

1517
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,799
German Empire that will be blamed for everything that's happened

1518
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
Okay military

1519
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:20,991
The entire latter part of the 1800 people focus on militarism

1520
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,575
I'm in the building of these amazingly technologically deadly armaments

1521
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
And the race for power and it just seemed like the world was arming itself to the teeth it was just going to explode and it was these military

1522
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
Responsible

1523
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
The people who look at

1524
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,887
Nazi Germany and who are I know people who are in thrall

1525
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,543
By the very marked in the Precision Marching In the uniforms in this whole sort of militaristic fat

1526
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:48,895
Attitude that the Nazis portrayed and I was trying to tell them that the Nazis didn't invent this

1527
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,455
The Nazis were revitalizing

1528
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,503
Regular German

1529
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
Marshall attitude

1530
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,623
Set the knights militarism if you don't like it it's Marshal if you do like it

1531
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
That's what Hitler in his

1532
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Tomorrow we're doing

1533
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Bringing back

1534
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
Traditional

1535
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,279
Prussian Marshal

1536
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Practicing

1537
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
That goose-stepping robotics

1538
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,263
Unbelievably efficient Precision Drilling and all that those are prussians quality to go back to Frederick the Great

1539
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:21,407
And it freaked out a lot of Slavic countries in Europe look at this and they just they look danger they look mean they look

1540
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
Chauvinistic they look like they wanted to take over your country and then they were building this giant Navy now all of a sudden out of nowhere chair

1541
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Challenging Britain

1542
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,927
Because the Kaiser had read that same book that Theodore Roosevelt read

1543
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,583
Did anybody do more damage than Alfred Thayer Mahan we decided to write a book on nail history cuz

1544
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,911
The Kaiser like Roosevelt Reddit was enthralled with it made all his

1545
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,263
Admirals read it and then decided he was going to build this Fleet to compete with Britain so that they

1546
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
It wouldn't take him for granted

1547
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103
Fascinating character

1548
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,663
A perfect example of what can happen

1549
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
With the role of the monarchy

1550
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
Of course all the governments in Europe

1551
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
Dead matter

1552
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Are not all

1553
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
Monarchies

1554
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,671
Autocratic governments are on the

1555
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:09,535
Famous government of France and Britain for example France is a republic Again by this time

1556
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,607
Having tried out royalty again after Napoleon

1557
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,399
Decided that they like the Republic

1558
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
Idea better and there are Republic

1559
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,263
Britton might as well be by this time.

1560
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:22,591
They still have the king in the royalty and all that but they don't have any power.

1561
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,431
Whether they were during this time. The way the royal family is now

1562
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
Maybe more gravitas

1563
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
Maybe more

1564
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,087
Able to shift public opinion one way or the other than the more

1565
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,879
Cynical generation today looks at

1566
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,159
Current royal family

1567
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,743
But at the time that's about the extent of their political Authority

1568
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Parliament

1569
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607
Legislature of Britain has the power then like they have the power now

1570
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,399
But that created dynamic

1571
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,215
With a French in the British have to worry about things that

1572
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:55,615
Another country is on the other side of the Ledger or Russian don't have to worry about they have to worry about the political situation

1573
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,919
Have to worry about their political opponents

1574
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:02,527
Using the war situation as a in a political issue

1575
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,367
He Great Britain there's quite a bit of division over this whole thing

1576
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:10,463
And during this time. Between when the Archduke assassinated

1577
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,511
Which happens on June 28th 1914

1578
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:19,423
And when the austro-hungarian government issues that famous ultimatum The List of Demands to Serbia which happens on July

1579
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
There's a big dead zone in there

1580
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:28,383
Not really a dead zone if you were reading the morning papers every morning in that. There be War scares and comments hearing

1581
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,455
There be something new everyday to keep you focused on the crisis

1582
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,735
But historically

1583
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,551
Not much happens what was going on with behind-the-scenes

1584
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
Town of diplomacy

1585
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,159
I'm one of the main Avenues of diplomacy

1586
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
Were the French trying to get the British

1587
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
You know into some sort of hard agreement for what they're going to do if this war breaks out in 5 minutes cuz I don't have a heart agreement

1588
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
Britishness would have a soft agreement

1589
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:58,335
Instead of a signed on the dotted line contract and a handshake deal and I start to get a little bit worried about the

1590
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
Deal

1591
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
I'm getting worried

1592
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,223
Even if the government in charge in London right now

1593
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,343
Will come through on the handshake deal who's to say they're going to be able to keep political power

1594
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
Their opponents be used as War issue

1595
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,535
Note to topple the government take control of the government then say to Francis we only have a handshake deal I'm sorry the new government will not

1596
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
Comply

1597
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:25,727
We're not getting involved in this War neutral we have the splendid isolation and the Navy will protect us cuz remember

1598
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
For folks looking at map of Great Britain

1599
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:34,175
Eva giant moat around their country and the greatest Navy in the world to protect it they have the option of staying out of this thing

1600
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
If they want to

1601
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,247
French don't have that luxury

1602
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,599
They're on the invasion list they're on the dinner menu for Imperial Germany

1603
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,671
And they're looking for people to provide some help

1604
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,743
They got the Russian but the Russians are a long way away

1605
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
But not being on

1606
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,631
The dinner menu for the Imperial German

1607
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,655
Military

1608
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,727
Mint at the British situation was fundamentally different

1609
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
They couldn't see

1610
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,663
A real positive outcome for them if they get involved in this whole Affair I mean

1611
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
There are things the French can gain

1612
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:13,343
I got a couple of lost territory they lost to Germany in the war of 1870 1871 they'd like to get those back

1613
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:17,951
In a best-case scenario you know this conflict breaks out they will get them back

1614
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:21,279
The British don't have anything that wonderfully positive to look forward to

1615
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,351
Yes they might alleviate the threat of this German Fleet

1616
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Dubai 1912

1617
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,031
It was already felt that the British had proven that the Germans could not compete with him in the building of ships

1618
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,615
Not if they wanted to have a Greatland Army at the same time

1619
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,175
And so that's kind of out of the way by this point

1620
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,223
So no big game there

1621
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:46,111
And maybe you protect France from falling cuz if France Falls you get the situation you had in the second world

1622
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:50,207
War in 1940 where all the sudden you have the Germans staring across the

1623
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
In the English Channel from you

1624
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,559
And then all of a sudden that mote doesn't look that why does it

1625
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,631
But that's not a lot of positive stuff

1626
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:01,215
To go into the first global conflict in a hundred years for

1627
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,799
Do the British this looks like a massive disruption of lyrics

1628
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
Extremely profitable business ventures

1629
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
They've been snapping up books

1630
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:15,551
Like the great illusion written by Norman angle wherever historian points out how influential this book was

1631
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:19,391
Or angle is trying to explain to the people in that time.

1632
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:22,463
Did this war that continually gets threatened like

1633
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
The Russian Roulette

1634
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
Trigger being pulled

1635
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
Is never going to happen it can't happen

1636
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
The world has become too interdependent

1637
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
In that time.

1638
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,751
There's too much globalization this is the early. We're all that starts where you at

1639
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:41,407
Telegraph providing instant communication in the railroads of the shipping lines and trade had never been higher wealth and never

1640
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Grandeur

1641
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,223
And Europe was at the height of its

1642
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,063
In a financial power and Britain was at the height of everybody's Financial power

1643
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
Why would you mess

1644
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,671
Would that economic situation guys like angle were saying

1645
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:57,279
That would happen is it was so profitable to Simply do business as usual

1646
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,095
That there was nothing worth going to war over

1647
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,959
What angle was saying is that anything you would gain by launching a war

1648
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:10,591
Would be dwarfed by what you would lose by destroying the system that was allowing everyone to make so much money

1649
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
There's an old line

1650
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
That when Goods don't cross borders

1651
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Armies will

1652
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:22,367
Well this is the opposite situation their goods are Crossing Borders like crazy so guys like angle tell you

1653
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:26,719
Filipino because of that formula they believe in that formula you can't have a war

1654
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,535
I'm pretty sure starting to find out

1655
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
You know what is this

1656
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:36,191
Dead Zone. From the end of the archduke's assassination of the ultimatum by Serbia with a pretty sure starting to find out is it

1657
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,727
Angle is at least

1658
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,007
Partially wrong

1659
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,615
He may be right that you will destroy a whole system that's making everybody rich

1660
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
He seems to be wrong

1661
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,943
In thinking

1662
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,783
That the powers-that-be will avoid a war because of that

1663
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,159
In the British government is having a hard time

1664
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,975
Selling their people on the idea that this is good for Britain

1665
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,583
July 23rd

1666
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Finally

1667
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:10,239
The long-awaited response from the austro-hungarian government to the killing of their heir to the throne

1668
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
They send an ultimatum

1669
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
The to the government of sir

1670
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,712
The ultimatum is one of those documents you can look at throughout history that is obviously designed to be

1671
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
The demands would have Bissell

1672
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
Serbian song

1673
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
No sovereign state could agree to this

1674
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,000
And they're only given 48 hours to respond to all these different points the rejection of any one of which means war

1675
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,328
But the day before the 48-hour deadline Runs Out

1676
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,680
Disturb government sends a message to the Czar of Russia asking for help

1677
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
And a rope quote

1678
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
We cannot defend ourselves

1679
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,104
Therefore we pray your majesty to send help as soon as possible

1680
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,712
Your majesty is given many proofs of your previous Goodwill and we confidently hope

1681
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,784
The disappear will find an echo in your generous love heart

1682
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
And quote

1683
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,368
The serbs

1684
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,928
Send a response back to the austro-hungarians

1685
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,208
It's not good enough

1686
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,488
The austro-hungarian

1687
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:07,584
Declare war on July 28th exactly one month after the assassination

1688
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,144
And they're shelling Belgrade in like 5

1689
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
The Russians

1690
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,264
Declaring mobilization

1691
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
In response

1692
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,128
This is the moment when the first

1693
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Outside power

1694
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
Returns on their Doomsday

1695
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,272
Easy when the austro-hungarians in the serbians mobile

1696
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:31,904
It doesn't freak anyone else out because they're going to fight a little war against each other and they have to mobilize to do that

1697
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,000
It's when the first outside power tied to these Alliance System

1698
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:41,120
Flix On Their doomsday device that everyone else is going to feel the pressure to do the same thing

1699
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
Germany the most pressure

1700
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
Because they're the ones

1701
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,568
With the very short window of opportunity I think

1702
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
The designer of the military plans

1703
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:56,736
Couch sleeping had figured out it was about 900 950

1704
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Hours

1705
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
That they had

1706
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
Just smashed

1707
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,696
Potential of France you didn't have to be mopped up but she had to be smashed within 950 or so hours

1708
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:10,304
Before the Russians would start to come in from the East with their armies now mobilized

1709
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,704
If you screwed that up they could be in Berlin having coffee and cigarettes and poking the Kaiser with a stick in a can

1710
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,728
Age by the time

1711
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,032
You know the Germans figured out what was going on

1712
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,592
The minute the Russians mobilize

1713
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,408
You have this crisis because the Russians have

1714
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,296
The flexibility if they want to just sending those people home in the month mobilization doesn't mean War to them

1715
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,088
But it does to the German

1716
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:40,000
Because they've got to start their plans and every day they don't that 950 or so our way

1717
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
Shrinking

1718
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
This is the point in the story

1719
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,144
With the military plans

1720
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:50,752
Begin to take over the political process in a way that makes it impossible

1721
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:56,384
For the politicians in the diplomats to do what they need to do to potentially stop this conflict they need time

1722
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
Anytime

1723
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,576
On the 26th of July the government of Britain cause a peace conference is for the major powers that they can hash this out talk it out

1724
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Nobody's got

1725
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
Once the Russians with the mobilization switch

1726
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,464
The Germans are under pressure

1727
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,000
The tell the Russians

1728
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
To stop

1729
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,840
The Russians say we're only doing this

1730
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,632
Against Austria-Hungary this isn't meant

1731
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:24,032
You know against you doesn't matter the Germans have a problem now and they begin going to everyone else and saying are you in are you in the

1732
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Go to the French

1733
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
The French

1734
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:32,736
Are you in this conflict it's about to come out cuz we're going to go to war with the Russians if they don't demobilize what are you going to do

1735
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,808
The Friendship we're going to act in accordance with our interest

1736
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,344
On a germicide will listen

1737
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,464
If you want to stay out of this war all you have to do is hand us the keys to all your Force

1738
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,256
What's on our fortified border

1739
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:50,144
Until the war in the East is over that does a pledge of your good behavior will consider you out of this war

1740
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,032
That is impossible for the French government to do as the demands on Serbia War for the serbians to do

1741
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,432
French can't do that hand over your National Security keys to your most antagonistic historic enemy

1742
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,712
I don't think so

1743
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
And the Germans must have known that

1744
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:09,344
They knew they couldn't keep France out of this conflict which is why they had these

1745
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,416
The Fantastic military plans to defeat two powers

1746
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,256
The country they were really hoping to keep out of the conflict with Great Britain

1747
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,584
Only kept negotiating with Britain saying

1748
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:26,752
You don't have any deal here we're cousins were both Anglo-Saxons were the same race you know the French are your historic enemies are you really going to work

1749
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
With them

1750
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,824
On the 30th

1751
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,128
Of July the British prime minister

1752
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
Wrote in his diary

1753
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
Quote

1754
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,808
The European situation is at least one degree worse than it was yesterday

1755
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:46,208
And it has not been improved by a rather Shameless attempt on the part of Germany to buy our neutrality during the war

1756
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,280
My promises that she will not annexed French territory

1757
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,560
Except colonies

1758
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,352
Or Holland or Belgium

1759
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:56,704
There's something very crude he writes and childlike about German diplomacy

1760
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,776
Meanwhile the French are beginning to press in the opposite sense

1761
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,336
Have the Russians have been doing for some time

1762
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,128
The city he means London

1763
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,944
Which is in a terrible state of depression and paralysis

1764
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,760
It's for the time being all against English intervention

1765
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,064
I think the prospect very black today

1766
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
And quote

1767
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
But something will happen

1768
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:19,232
That will change the mood in Britain

1769
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
Something that will help to create

1770
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,120
A good guy bad guy narrative in this war

1771
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,776
You know I told you earlier one of the key issues because this war so important to the rest of the 20th century and 21st century history

1772
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,312
Is whose fault at all

1773
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,640
And the British were very concerned during this time.

1774
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,944
The day be if they intervene

1775
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,480
Intervening on the right side

1776
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,552
Who's the bad guy it's going to depend on what happen

1777
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,160
That's again where the German war plans put them in a situation

1778
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:54,816
We're for the war plan to succeed you have to create strategic problems that are going to cost you the war the biggest thing

1779
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,632
The Germans need to do here is keep the British out of this war

1780
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,448
But the war plans involve a requirement

1781
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,496
That will bring the British into the war

1782
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,288
The Germans can't attack

1783
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,824
French along their mutual border

1784
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,128
The borders full of forts

1785
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
It's the most

1786
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,736
One of those fortified borders throughout world history ever since Roman times

1787
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,552
It's the same area but a hundred and twenty mile front

1788
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:19,648
That will become the Maginot Line after this warned before the second World War

1789
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:26,304
During this time. There are fantastically technologically sophisticated forts all through the hundred

1790
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,352
20 mile border between Germany and France

1791
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,656
With interlocking fields

1792
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Fire

1793
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
Enlarged garrisons

1794
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:39,616
It's not that the Germans can't defeat that they did in 1870 1871 that was the root of invasion back then

1795
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,688
The problem is the German can't defeat them

1796
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,272
Within that 950 or so our window

1797
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,856
By the time the Germans smash their way through those forts

1798
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,392
The Russians are in Berlin

1799
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,952
Pencil easy and everywhere else right

1800
01:26:55,232 --> 01:27:01,376
There's only one thing the Germans can see their way to doing as part of this plan to win the two front war and that's just smash into France in

1801
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,912
In the part of France that undefended

1802
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,984
But the reason the part of France is undefended or less

1803
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,008
Defended than this

1804
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,360
Fortified border is left offended is because it isn't on the border with Germany

1805
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,920
On the border with a bunch of neutral States

1806
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,456
These are going to have

1807
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
How to be the highway

1808
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:20,576
The German Army uses to get from Germany to France

1809
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:25,184
The only problem is is that those highways neutrality is guaranteed by the British government

1810
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
And has been for 75 years

1811
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:33,888
What is about to happen as a result of the stipulations of those German war plan

1812
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,448
Is potentially

1813
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
The greatest mistake

1814
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
Ever met

1815
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,056
I mean I put it on my top ten

1816
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,896
Greatest mistakes ever made a German I have to believe

1817
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:49,248
I have a hard time figuring out what is a greater mistake

1818
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,808
For the entire history of your nation as a unified

1819
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
Hill Country

1820
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
71

1821
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,160
Hard time finding something you

1822
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
You could label

1823
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:02,560
As a greater mistake than this one because so many of the other candidates you might put as your greatest mistake

1824
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,120
Only happened because of this mistake before it

1825
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,704
The invasion of Belgium is a disaster for Germany on Sony

1826
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
And that's what we're talking

1827
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
Originally

1828
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,312
And way back in like the

1829
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,360
Late 1800 early 1900

1830
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,408
Holland had also been on the list

1831
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
The country to be used as a highway for the German Army but

1832
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,576
Since that time in is the war plans were refined it was just narrow down to just Belgium

1833
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:29,440
And the Germans were sort of naively hoping that the belgians would just step aside

1834
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:33,792
Like lying there are me up on both sides of the street and watch the Germans March through

1835
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,424
The British and the prussians unihorse were the forefathers of these German

1836
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:43,776
We're two of the signatories of something called the Treaty of London in 1839

1837
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,800
The pledged

1838
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,848
To defend Belgium neutrality

1839
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:52,480
In a wonderfully tragic ironic sort of connection to by the way

1840
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:58,880
The role Belgium is going to play leading to the first world war is very similar to the role Poland played leading a

1841
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Chapter II

1842
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,512
In both cases those countries were the reason Britain got dragged into the conflict

1843
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,816
Before the second world war Britain had

1844
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,096
I tried to

1845
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
Stop Hitler

1846
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,168
Seemingly endless ambition

1847
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,752
By putting a roadblock in his way and guaranteeing the independence of Poland

1848
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:21,152
Hitler ignore that guarantee went into Poland and Britain in the war in the first world war the same thing is happening with bells

1849
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:26,528
The German planners can see no way to win this war without violating Belgium's neutrality as we said

1850
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,832
This is what makes it the greatest mistake though

1851
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,112
Potentially halt German history

1852
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:34,464
Violating Belgium ends up taking a Britain that one historian says

1853
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,072
As recently as two days before they declare war on Germany

1854
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,120
Is leaning toward neutrality

1855
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,192
That's amazing to take my 2 days before they enter the war

1856
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,520
The government is leaning toward neutrality what changed that

1857
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
The invasion of Belgium

1858
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,896
The invasion of Belgium does to

1859
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,920
Terrible things

1860
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
Looking at this from Germany

1861
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Point of view

1862
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,760
The first thing is a changes

1863
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,344
British political and public opinion almost overnight

1864
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
On a dime

1865
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,208
As the British prime minister Herbert Asquith

1866
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,232
Put it here

1867
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,536
Of course wants to get more involved

1868
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
This looming War

1869
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,864
More cuz of the handshake deal with Francie said that the

1870
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,912
Ultimatum the Germans give to the belgians

1871
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Simplify

1872
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,848
All of a sudden the people who are trying to convince the rest of Britain that they have a dog in this Continental War looming up

1873
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,664
Have some real ammunition the first thing is assigned

1874
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,200
Treaty with the Belgian

1875
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,992
That's not a handshake

1876
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,016
Deal that's in ink

1877
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
And it's longstanding

1878
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
As is the National Security concern the Britain has had for a very long time of keeping the channel ports in Belgium

1879
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,768
Out of the hands of some dangerous hostile power

1880
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,328
That's right most of Britain's history that dangerous

1881
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
Hostile power was France

1882
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,424
Other calling the Kaiser the new Napoleon

1883
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,240
And if he goes into Belgium he's going to have those Channel

1884
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Airports

1885
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,312
So what have been

1886
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,616
A more sort of highbrow

1887
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
Argument

1888
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
That didn't really you know

1889
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Appeal to the goddess

1890
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,480
Is changing because of Belgium

1891
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:05,600
The most important appeal to the gut though the Belgium has is the propaganda

1892
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
Slash PR site

1893
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,720
Belgium is what destroyed

1894
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
Germany's reputation in terms of global public app

1895
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,680
I mean they're always been people who called Germany this evil malevolent militaristic country and what have you

1896
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,008
Put on the world stage as soon as the Germans invade Belgium

1897
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,896
They participate in the most aggressive act so far by any of the major powers in this cup

1898
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,432
Austro-hungarian

1899
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,504
Assault against Serbia maybe before this was the most

1900
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
Egregious but that was seen as having some sort of

1901
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
Interconnection doivent I mean the Serbian government had maybe been involved in this assassination it was something to do with one another

1902
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,256
Elgin was an innocent

1903
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024
I Stan

1904
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,608
It looks like a shooting War breaks out between a couple of

1905
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:55,008
Gangsters on the street and the first thing one of the gangsters does it turn to the side and kills an innocent bystander because they're staying

1906
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Standing in their way

1907
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,592
That's a little like what this is portrayed as by

1908
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,640
Italy allied propaganda service

1909
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:03,968
Which make the most use of this Belgium thing you can imagine

1910
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,016
So much so that it didn't send

1911
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
People like

1912
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
Hitler

1913
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,600
Who will write later in mine comp

1914
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,904
Nowhere else

1915
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,440
Did the Germans

1916
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:17,280
In a fall so far behind the British in the French and later The Americans

1917
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,840
Then they did in the in the realm of propaganda

1918
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,424
Hitler says the huge mistake of Germany in

1919
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,520
Austria-Hungary propaganda was to portray the enemy as comical

1920
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,312
And he said that

1921
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,872
British in the French the Americans understand

1922
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,408
Did the enemy needs to be

1923
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:39,808
Seen as a violent dangerous and bloodthirsty as bad not comical because he said the

1924
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:43,392
Problem portraying them as comical as you run up against them in their tough

1925
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,744
And that seemed to shatter all the propaganda it's better to say that these evil

1926
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,840
You know the nine Riders of Mordor are approaching he says and then

1927
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:54,400
You know you really get your back into a cause like that

1928
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,192
And that's how the allies

1929
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
Which is what

1930
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,240
Britain France

1931
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,312
And many other countries the United States later included will be

1932
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,384
Call Means War there initially called the triple entendre

1933
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
The other side the

1934
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,944
Alliance with

1935
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,784
Germany Austria-Hungary later turkey into other countries will be called the central power

1936
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,856
That's what's the triple entendre against the Central Powers

1937
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,160
Or the Allies against the Central Powers

1938
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
In the Central Powers

1939
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,256
Will be portrayed just as Hitler said

1940
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,328
As these rapers and pillagers and looters

1941
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,376
And it will be in Belgium

1942
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:29,984
That the Germans will provide their opponents with the raw materials

1943
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,800
Do not have to exaggerate too much at all

1944
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,360
To portray them as the modern-day version

1945
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,128
Origin of the Han

1946
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,432
Now

1947
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,200
On August

1948
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
First

1949
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
1914

1950
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
This

1951
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,880
Small war between the austro-hungarians

1952
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,904
And the serbs

1953
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
Jets

1954
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Bigger

1955
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,000
Because that's when

1956
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,816
The German ultimatum given to the Russians

1957
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,888
Telling them to stop their mobilization or else Runs Out

1958
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,448
Historian David Stevenson says

1959
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,032
But this is a clear sign that the Russians know what's coming

1960
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,056
And they're okay with

1961
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:10,176
They know that if they don't stand down they'll have war with Germany and they don't stand down

1962
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
So he says

1963
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
One way or another you have to

1964
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:16,064
Infer that the Russians were ready for this an okay with it

1965
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,136
It's on August 1st the Germans declare war

1966
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,160
The Russian

1967
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,232
That day Italy says they're out

1968
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,816
They had a nominal alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary

1969
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,680
But they choose to use an out clause which may or may not be valid depending on who you're talkin

1970
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,800
Saying that this appears to be an aggressive war and their Alliance only covers defensible

1971
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
So they're out

1972
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
They declare that they are neutral on this

1973
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
New conflict

1974
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
It's just starting

1975
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
The next day

1976
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,480
In the West

1977
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Germany invades

1978
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
The new truck

1979
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,552
Country of Luxembourg

1980
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
Tiny little neutral country Luxembourg

1981
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:53,184
And at the same time issues this ultimatum to the belgians

1982
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,744
Same listen we just need to use your country to get

1983
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
To France

1984
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:02,912
Are we mean you no harm I'll just let us March through if we break anything will pay for it later we don't have any designs on your country long-term

1985
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,960
In response to this

1986
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:08,800
The belgians have a heroic moment where the king of Belgium

1987
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:14,432
You know I'm in the major officials all get together and basically all agree that they're not going to stand down

1988
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,016
The attitude they seem to have his we're screwed either way

1989
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:24,416
We might as well go out of this gloriously and they decide to mobilize their tiny little army and fight in at the same time

1990
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:28,256
Issue the calls to the other guarantors of their neutrality saying

1991
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:34,656
They waited until the moment the Germans by the way stepped in everybody's worried somebody's going to pull a fast

1992
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:41,056
But like the French or were the Germans going to try to fake them into going into Belgium first

1993
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:47,456
Because they think the Germans are coming in the Germans could say we weren't the first people to violate Belgium everybody wants to stay on the goods

1994
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
Sign in terms of War responsibilities

1995
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,064
The French are so worried about falling into a trap like that

1996
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,136
They pull the unprecedented move of all time

1997
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,672
And on the eve of War

1998
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:00,512
Hold their military forces six miles back

1999
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
From the border

2000
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072
Remember that's not just

2001
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
Forward positioning

2002
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
Those are troops who picked the spots that they were in because there were important strategic spot important passes in River

2003
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,336
Crossings and other things that have been built up with fortifications for years

2004
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,152
And the French government is so freaked out about

2005
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,176
Possibly

2006
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:23,552
Being blamed for starting this in the Germans not being blamed for starting that they pull their forces back

2007
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
The French generals are not pleased about this

2008
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,440
What the move is intended to also make sure that the British

2009
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,232
People and the peace

2010
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,536
Faction in Britain have no excuse to say well

2011
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,840
The French violated Belgian neutrality Forester

2012
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,888
Shots were fired by the French first

2013
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,752
So the Germans are positioned into this thing where they have a time limit on this deal

2014
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,544
They can't sit around and wait around

2015
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,360
Belgium have to be violated for the plan to work

2016
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,432
They can't get the French or the British to violate Belgium first

2017
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,784
They tell the belgians going to let him through the Belgian say no

2018
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
And on

2019
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,344
August 3rd

2020
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,880
Germany declares war

2021
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
Conference

2022
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
MLG

2023
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,768
Not think about that folks

2024
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,048
A week ago

2025
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
Europe was peaceful

2026
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,888
Now it's on the

2027
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:15,264
Slide to General War within another week the entire continents going to be flaming out at each other

2028
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
In a crazy to go from

2029
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,152
Tony P's to Total War in less than 2 weeks

2030
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,712
HG Wells

2031
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:29,600
Writing a year or two after the conflict and so he's right in the middle of the moment he even says you can't quite

2032
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,648
And you can't write about it now

2033
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,696
Without the passions in the feelings

2034
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
You're totally

2035
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,256
Screwing up your impression thing

2036
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,328
What he does talk about how weird the mood was

2037
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:43,936
Because all this was happening so fast he was talking about the British public cuz that's where he lived

2038
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,776
And how there was almost this disconnect between the fact

2039
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,568
The entire world has changed

2040
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,384
But it's happening so fast we haven't changed with it yet

2041
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,664
Any rights quote

2042
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:59,808
All Europe still remembers the strange atmosphere those eventful Sunny August days

2043
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,856
The end of the Armed peace

2044
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,184
For nearly half a century the Western world have been trained

2045
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
And it seems safe

2046
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:12,352
Only a few middle-aged and aging people in France and had any practical experience of warfare

2047
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,168
The newspaper spoke of a world catastrophe

2048
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:20,288
But that conveyed very little meaning to those For Whom the world that always seem secure or indeed

2049
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:24,384
Almost incapable of thinking of it as anything otherwise than secure

2050
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:31,040
In Britain particularly for some weeks the peacetime routine continued in a slightly dazed fashion

2051
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:36,416
He was like a man still walking about the world unaware that he is contracted a fatal disease

2052
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:39,744
Which will alter every routine and Habit in his life

2053
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,792
People went on with their summer holiday

2054
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,864
Shops reassure their customers with the announcement

2055
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,144
Business as usual

2056
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,960
There was much talk and excitement in the newspapers came

2057
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,264
What is the talking excitement of spectators

2058
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,592
You have no Vivid sense of participation in the catastrophe

2059
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,640
It was presently to involve the mall

2060
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
And quote

2061
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,248
It's easy to understand to

2062
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,832
Why the British public really weren't ready for this in fact

2063
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,112
None of the British

2064
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
Really red

2065
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,184
I hadn't been mentally prep

2066
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,976
For the idea that this was coming

2067
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,304
For all sorts of political reasons the British government

2068
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,072
Couldn't

2069
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
Declare itself out

2070
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,960
To draw a line in the sand and tell the Germans Wilson if you invade Belgium at all

2071
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
No ifs ands or buts

2072
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:28,128
The British prime minister didn't have that power for all he knew the peace faction in this government would topple is government it

2073
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,688
A statement like that were made in

2074
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,712
Both the French

2075
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,760
And the Germans for a very long time

2076
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,576
Before this conflict breaks out but especially in the fever

2077
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,856
In the last month

2078
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:44,256
Are trying to get some sort of word from Great Britain what the policy is what are you going to do with the last minute of French or sure the British are going to

2079
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
Abandon them

2080
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,584
The French foreign minister will

2081
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,656
Sit down and discussed at one point and say they're going to Desert us

2082
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:56,032
When someone in the British media ask him what he's doing cuz I'm going to wait to see if Britain still has any honor

2083
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,616
The British are waiting

2084
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
For something to happen in Belgium

2085
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,432
And somewhere the Belgium

2086
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,064
They don't want to do anything until their actual neutrality is violated so they wait until the Germans arrive

2087
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,600
When the advance

2088
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,136
Cavalry Patrol

2089
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
Actually some guys on bikes

2090
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Patelin de Belgium

2091
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,512
And give notices to the locals

2092
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,536
We're sorry that we

2093
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,560
Do this

2094
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,912
And everything be fine just don't cause any trouble don't blow up any Bridges

2095
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,728
Don't sabotaging railways

2096
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,752
Don't.

2097
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:30,336
Destroy any tunnels anything we might need to get from here to there

2098
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,920
Leave all that in place or those will be considered hostile Acts

2099
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:38,272
As soon as it becomes apparent that Germans are on Belgian soil

2100
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,856
The king of Belgium basically ordered that all those things be done

2101
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,696
Let me contact the other guarantors of Belgian neutrality and says

2102
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,488
The Germans are here

2103
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,512
We need your help

2104
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,840
That's when the British draw up the official sort of

2105
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,864
Ultimatum which

2106
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,520
People have criticized them for me they say if you'd only given that ultimatum before the Germans had gone into Belgium

2107
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,592
Might have had more options once they're in Belgium for them to

2108
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:08,992
Get out of Belgium cuz the British told them he was really like a tail between their legs kind of situation in this is happened in history many time

2109
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,832
In other situations where people have said if you had just said

2110
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:17,440
What you were going to do before the enemy did what they did might have been a different outcome

2111
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,512
In this case once the Germans are in Belgium

2112
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,792
The British

2113
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,352
Ambassador to Germany guy name

2114
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
Sir edward goschen

2115
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,936
Delivers the British ultimatum

2116
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:33,568
To Germany he delivers it into the hands of the German Minister a guy named Gottlieb on llego

2117
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:37,408
And the German Chancellor gained Theobald Von bethmann-hollweg

2118
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,992
And Goshen knew that this was a historic meeting

2119
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,368
And you wrote down what happened and he said the Germans when they received this ultimatum from him

2120
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
Freak

2121
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
Out

2122
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,464
You wrote that the meeting was

2123
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,000
Fraught with Menace

2124
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Quote

2125
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,072
I found the chancellor very agitated

2126
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,424
His Excellency at once began her Reign which lasted for about 20 minutes

2127
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,472
He said that the step taken by

2128
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,288
The British government was terrible to a degree

2129
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,312
Just forward

2130
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,592
Neutrality

2131
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,664
A word which in Wartime it so often been disregarded

2132
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
Just for a scrap of paper

2133
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:16,832
Great Britain was going to make war on a kindred Nation who desire nothing better than to be friends with her

2134
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:21,440
All his efforts in that direction have been rendered useless by this last terrible step

2135
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,464
And the policy

2136
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:28,352
To which as I knew he had devoted himself since his accession to office had tumbled down like a house of cards

2137
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,656
What we had done was unthinkable

2138
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,936
In the minds of the German

2139
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:36,800
It was like striking a man from behind while he was fighting for his life against to assailant

2140
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:40,896
Heal Great Britain responsible for all the terrible events that might happen

2141
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,944
I protested strongly against that stay

2142
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:47,296
And said that in the same way that he and everybody a go with me to understand

2143
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:51,904
Did for strategical reasons it was a matter of life and death to Germany to advance through Belgium

2144
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,952
And violate the ladder neutrality

2145
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,024
So I would wish him to understand that it was so to speak

2146
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,584
A matter of life and death for the honor of Great Britain

2147
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,704
But you should keep her solemn engagements to do our utmost to defend Belgium's neutrality if attacked

2148
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,520
That's all them compact simply had to be kept

2149
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:12,128
Or what confidence could anyone have an engagement given by Great Britain in the future

2150
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,920
The chancellor said

2151
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:17,248
But at what price will that compact have been kept

2152
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,552
Has the British government thought of that

2153
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600
And quote

2154
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,160
And this is an interesting key point

2155
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,696
Because

2156
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,744
I've often wondered if you could take

2157
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:31,840
The principals who were the decision makers in this in a conflict

2158
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
Into the future

2159
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,960
I show them some history books and show them what happened even the winners

2160
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,776
Do you think they would have found a way to avert

2161
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,824
And what ended up happening because

2162
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,616
It was more horrible than any of

2163
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
Vision

2164
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
The German field Marshal

2165
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:50,272
In charge of the military Affairs this time van mulkay famously said that

2166
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,112
This was the struggle that would decide the course of history for the next

2167
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
Hundred years

2168
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,696
Absolutely right

2169
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,768
But he known that this would mean

2170
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:05,632
The Germany would be on the losing end of two world wars in the 20th century

2171
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,448
When you think he would have done to me look at

2172
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,264
The situation now and imagine Germany without

2173
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,336
Having lost those two world wars and how different they might be today

2174
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,408
German historian

2175
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,736
Who consider this roll of the iron dice

2176
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,040
Is going to war here is often referred to

2177
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:26,880
As one of the great irresponsible Gamble's in all German history

2178
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,744
And maybe the key element in the whole affair

2179
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:35,328
Was Britain's decision to involve itself in the conflict

2180
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,680
Because one can make a very good case that if Britain stands aside

2181
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Germany wins

2182
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,752
How to start

2183
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
Instead

2184
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
They have perhaps

2185
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
The greatest

2186
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,896
Overall superpower

2187
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,944
In the early 20th century world

2188
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,224
Lining up on the

2189
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Other side

2190
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,624
To be truthful the Germans weren't really afraid of

2191
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,392
The British army

2192
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,952
And that's a small

2193
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:07,584
Colonial force that by German standards is relatively insignificant or so they think

2194
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:11,424
I mean Bismarck and famously said when an adviser had warned him

2195
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:17,312
If you go to war with Britain they could use that wonderful Naval power tool and their entire Army on our coastline

2196
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,872
And Bismarck famously said if they do that

2197
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
I shall have them

2198
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,712
And he just send the police force

2199
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,272
How to Corral the British army that's how

2200
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,088
Worried they were about this tiny little forced

2201
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
Their army dwarf

2202
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
But they were

2203
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
Keenly aware

2204
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,976
If Britain had the greatest Navy

2205
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,000
By far

2206
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
In the world

2207
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,328
They were the greatest Financial power

2208
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,352
Power in the world

2209
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,656
They controlled a huge

2210
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
Chunk of the world

2211
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,472
Britain and France together

2212
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:51,872
Owned about 70% of the world at this time. When you talk about other colonies and everything else and that's all

2213
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
Stop that they can draw on

2214
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,944
How to fight the war

2215
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,552
What's more that wonderful Navy of Great Britain's can shut down German shipping

2216
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,856
You know in a moment to the stroke of a pen

2217
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,904
Prince p*** sex

2218
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Secretary

2219
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
Sir Edward Grey

2220
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:09,024
On August 3rd 1914 when tensions have reached

2221
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
A knife-edge

2222
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,352
Fever pitch moment

2223
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,144
Will look out the window

2224
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
And see the

2225
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:19,776
Lamplighters of London lighting the lamps for the evening as was customary at the time

2226
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:23,616
Any turn to someone else at the window and famously said

2227
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,920
The lamps are going out all over you

2228
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,712
We shall not see them lit

2229
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,320
The Germans are given the famous ultimatum

2230
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
And

2231
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,392
It's set to expire

2232
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,672
At midnight

2233
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,208
On August 4th

2234
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,000
German time

2235
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,792
Which is 11 p.m.

2236
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
British time

2237
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,376
Lloyd George one of the ministers

2238
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,424
Says that they were sitting around a table

2239
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704
Just before

2240
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,032
Had a stroke of eleven watching the clock tick away

2241
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:55,872
And he said that is Big Ben's chime start chiming

2242
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:59,712
The 11-hour signifying that the deadline is about to expire

2243
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,760
He says every ring of the Bells

2244
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
Sounded like

2245
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,832
June

2246
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:08,160
And then when it expires Britain declares war

2247
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,440
Germany

2248
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
That's worth asking it this

2249
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,840
What the people who ingest

2250
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,424
You entered upon this course of action thought was going to happen

2251
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,216
Human Lloyd George

2252
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:25,056
Here's the Chimes of Big Ben sounding and thinks they sound like Doom

2253
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:28,640
What is Lloyd George mean when he says Doom

2254
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,432
This is a

2255
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
Conflict

2256
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:37,856
I'm the sort that your pad not had for a hundred years and a lot of changed in the Hundred Year this is like a jump

2257
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,136
Off of a cliff

2258
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:43,744
In the dark for Europe and no one knows how long the drop is going to be

2259
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:48,352
I need been exposed to a lot of thinking out there by guys like Norman angle we mentioned earlier

2260
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,400
We're saying no one's going to jump

2261
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:57,824
Jumping would be suicidal everybody died the Golden Goose will be killed globalization be destroyed no one will do it and now

2262
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
We had just done it

2263
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,152
What did people think that meant

2264
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,456
Well as we said earlier

2265
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,504
The first world war has so much written about

2266
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,784
You can cherry-pick

2267
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,112
This or that source and create any sort of impression you want

2268
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:16,000
What it really looks like though if you some up you know I've read a bunch of stuff on this and into me what it looks like

2269
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,072
Is that there was a small View

2270
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,864
Amongst some people

2271
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Then understood the real

2272
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:27,520
And they turn out to be the Cassandra's in the story of the ones who actually prophesize

2273
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,824
Accurately what's going to happen

2274
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,944
Most of these people didn't have a clue I think Lloyd George when he hears Big Ben sound in Doom

2275
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,248
Is worried about Britain's financial sector

2276
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,320
And he had every reason to be by the way because

2277
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:45,952
A few days before when Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia the markets around the world

2278
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
You know go crazy

2279
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:53,888
And in London the financial capital of the world Lloyd George's hearing from all the bankers and all the investors and all these people that this is

2280
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,912
Loquacious

2281
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:59,264
It will destroy Britain physically which sounds like the worst thing in the world

2282
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:03,360
Until you fast-forward the time machine for years and see what's really going to happen

2283
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,944
Where you would have paid good money to only have the financial system

2284
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,992
Here's the thing though

2285
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,808
There were people who turned out to be right

2286
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,600
About how momentous

2287
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,928
The sleep off this cliff and how long the drop was going to be

2288
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,464
Who turned out to be right

2289
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,000
And we're kind of hoping for

2290
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,048
Take for example

2291
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:25,632
The guy who along with Karl Marx helped create modern communism

2292
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:28,448
Friedrich Engels who in 1887

2293
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:32,288
Wrote about this coming conflict and how terrible it was going to be

2294
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,056
Of course

2295
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:38,944
You know in his mind hoping for an overthrow of all the existing regime to be replaced by communism

2296
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,272
That was sort of the silver lining in this coming Armageddon

2297
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,808
Angles Road quote

2298
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,112
I see a World War

2299
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:48,928
I've never before seen extension and intensity

2300
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:55,584
If the system of mutual outbidding in Armament carry to the extreme finally Bears its natural fruits

2301
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,656
8 to 10 million soldiers will Slaughter each other

2302
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:03,264
And strip your bear is no swarm of locusts has ever done before

2303
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,872
The devastations of the Thirty Years War condensed into three or four years

2304
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,664
And spread all over the continent

2305
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,456
Epidemic

2306
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:16,064
General barbarization of armies and masses provoked by sheer desperation

2307
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,112
Utter chaos in our trade

2308
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,672
Industry and commerce ending in general bankrupt

2309
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:27,328
Collapse of the old states and their traditional wisdom in such a way that the Crown's role in the gut

2310
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,144
Better by the Dozen then they'll be nobody to pick them up

2311
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:35,520
Absolute impossibility differ see how all this will end and who will be the victors in that struggle

2312
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,824
Only one result absolutely certain

2313
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:42,944
General exhaustion and a creation of circumstances for the final victory of the working

2314
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
And quote

2315
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,624
Something is your silver lining if you happen to be a communist revolutionary and you want to see the overthrow of government

2316
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,440
I didn't want Zentangles will get what he wants at least

2317
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,720
In one country

2318
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,280
But he's not the only person that receives this

2319
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:00,608
Some of the best military minds of the time see at 2

2320
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:04,448
We told you about the field Marshal in charge of Germany's war effort

2321
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,496
The Man known as Von moltke

2322
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,776
But he is a

2323
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Pale

2324
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,592
Shadow of his uncle

2325
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,664
The Man known as the Elder Von moltke

2326
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,016
Who commanded Prussian forces in the franco-prussian war of 1870 1871

2327
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,344
By this time. He's retired and he's on the speaking circuit

2328
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,952
In 1906 he speaks to the German legislature and he warns them

2329
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,744
What are modern Wars going to be like

2330
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Quote

2331
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,352
The age of cabinet war is behind us

2332
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,656
All we have now is people's War

2333
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:40,544
Gentleman if the war that has been hanging over our heads now for more than 10 years like the Sword of Damocles

2334
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,080
If this war breaks out

2335
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,640
Fenestration and it's and will be unforeseeable

2336
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:49,760
The greatest powers of Europe oranges never before will be going into battle with each other

2337
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:54,880
Not one of them can be crushed so completely in one or two campaigns that he will admit defeat

2338
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:57,952
But it will be compelled to conclude peace under hard terms

2339
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:01,792
And it will not come back even if it is a year later to renew the struggle

2340
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
Gentleman

2341
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:05,888
It may be a war 7 years or 30 years duration

2342
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,448
And woe to him who sets Europe alight

2343
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,264
Who first put the fuse to the powder keg

2344
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,056
And quote

2345
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:17,408
This long drop in the dark

2346
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,224
Is going to set up the first

2347
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:22,016
If you want to use the boxing analogy

2348
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,832
The first heavyweight championship

2349
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:28,672
Fight the world has seen since Napoleon's day a hundred years before

2350
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,720
Indians room you had a lot of

2351
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,512
In a one-sided Khan

2352
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:36,352
Casino a champion like Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson fighting

2353
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,632
A person you've never heard

2354
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,192
Or you'll have something like

2355
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,008
The wars between the United States and Spain

2356
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
Over Cuba in the Philippines which is a rising soon-to-be first-class power against a declining soon-to-be third-class power

2357
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:52,480
Ortiz great Colonial conflicts were

2358
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,552
A nation like Britain will go in and crush the dervishes

2359
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,576
It's worth a Zulu

2360
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,112
With the occasional setback

2361
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
Back of course

2362
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:04,000
Anyone use Proto machine guns against these natives armed with Spears

2363
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:08,864
One of these Proto machine guns really a Gatling gun with call the Maxim gun and there was a famous

2364
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,656
Colonial era poem

2365
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,960
It said whatever happens we have got

2366
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:14,240
The Maxim gun

2367
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
And they have not

2368
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,824
In this upcoming War

2369
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
Both sides

2370
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:25,248
Will have the Maxim gun in fact much more deadly modern versions of the Maxim gun that we call machine guns today

2371
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:29,344
No one had ever seen a war where both sides had machine guns

2372
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:33,952
The franco-prussian war saw the French trying to use these Gatling guns these early

2373
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:37,536
Machine guns as best they could but no one really had any clue what to do with them

2374
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,096
That all changed by 1914

2375
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:42,656
We were seeing the most professional armies

2376
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:47,008
Perhaps of the world that ever seen and certainly the largest that the world has ever seen

2377
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,544
Getting ready to Clash

2378
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:52,128
In a conflict that was going to be like jumping off a cliff

2379
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,920
Open the dark nobody could foresee

2380
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,712
The end of this

2381
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,504
One thing was for sure

2382
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,808
The Army for Germany

2383
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,112
That is about to enter Belgium

2384
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
He's probably

2385
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,672
The greatest army

2386
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,464
That the world had seen

2387
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,488
Up until that

2388
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,352
And I say that with everyone knowing what a big

2389
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
Big fan I am

2390
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Demongo

2391
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Military

2392
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,960
Science and History

2393
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,728
3 in their army

2394
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:18,752
They're wonderful

2395
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,288
But they get worse

2396
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,824
Black people understand how

2397
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,616
Incredibly dominant the manga

2398
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,456
The army of Germany during this time. The kaiserreich

2399
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,016
This is like the Rodney

2400
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,808
They don't get any respect

2401
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:39,232
And yet they are maybe I mean you create your top 10 list of the greatest army throughout all history

2402
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,256
Map of the kaiserreich

2403
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,560
I'm not sure I put the German armed

2404
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:50,752
Part of the reason we don't know more about that first world war German armies because the second world war German Army like so many things

2405
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
In that second

2406
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Conflict overshadowing

2407
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,336
In many ways

2408
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,360
TV remote

2409
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,152
In the second world war is flashing

2410
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,944
Then the first world

2411
01:54:59,456 --> 01:54:59,968
German army

2412
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,016
You know once again to get

2413
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
The Box insurance

2414
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,064
Richard the veermok

2415
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,112
Is a big heavy hitter knockout

2416
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:12,768
Best and they go around and it's gym boom it's over in one round sometimes and you stand up and it's thrilling an incredible but you know what

2417
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:16,352
Someone hit them back and or or beats them up a little it's a different game

2418
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,400
I want you start wearing them down

2419
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:22,752
Play you can continue to wear them. Because they're not strong fundamentally at the core

2420
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,544
They have a great punch

2421
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,824
But the rest

2422
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,384
Sort of an uneven Foundation

2423
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
That was really

2424
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,456
Where the strength

2425
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,224
The first World War

2426
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,832
It may not have been as flashy with those giant Knockouts and all that but they

2427
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,368
Had a better chin and they

2428
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:42,464
Were they rested on firm foundations it was a fantastic Army

2429
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,280
And no one remembers it

2430
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,560
Today and what's funny is

2431
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,608
Once again it just becomes

2432
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,912
Another thing that Adolf Hitler

2433
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:51,680
I was wrong about

2434
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,448
When he wrote

2435
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
Quote

2436
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,520
Thousands of years may pass

2437
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,592
But never will it be possible to speak of heroism

2438
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:01,408
Without mentioning the German army in the world war

2439
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:03,456
Then from the veil of the past

2440
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,784
The iron front of the gray steel helmet will emerge

2441
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,832
Unwavering and unflinching

2442
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:12,416
Ramada Monument as long as there are Germans alive

2443
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:15,232
They will remember that these men were sons of their Nation

2444
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,328
It's a fantastic

2445
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
And

2446
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,656
Part of what makes it so great

2447
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:27,264
Is this natural efficiency that is stereotypically German

2448
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:33,664
Is applied to military science during a time. We're military science really does become so

2449
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:34,688
Has become

2450
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,480
The age of the Bean Counter

2451
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,760
Efficiency

2452
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,040
When it comes to

2453
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:43,136
Putting an Army in the field that's what the Napoleonic era create

2454
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:47,744
Will you get this first part of the war machine ability to create these Mass armies

2455
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,536
Imagine a guy like

2456
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,840
Alexander the Great who I love to mention all the time

2457
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,632
Imagine Julius Caesar 2

2458
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:56,448
Guys who probably never commanded more than 80

2459
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:03,872
And who staffs you know we're capable and they could deal with it and they were very efficient logistically and everything for their time.

2460
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,408
But they were dealing with

2461
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,200
80000 men

2462
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,248
In this era

2463
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,784
You're dealing with

2464
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:13,600
12 to 15 times that

2465
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,672
What would Alexander the Great of done trying to

2466
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,976
In a control one and a half million men

2467
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:21,280
It's an exercise in

2468
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:22,816
Hiremath

2469
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:23,840
To try to do that

2470
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:25,376
And when you hear

2471
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,912
About how the Germans have

2472
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:29,216
Paired minutely for this day that

2473
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,520
For so long have been called the day they are taught

2474
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:35,360
I'm this attack into Belgium and 2/1 friends and everything

2475
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,640
You get an idea of

2476
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:40,224
How much actual bean-counting in planning is involve now

2477
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,296
In order to maintain these armies it would have been impossible

2478
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,576
150 years

2479
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
Before because

2480
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,696
This capability didn't exist if it's a function of modern civilization

2481
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
And the era of the 20th century

2482
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:55,840
How to get an idea of size you have to think about the division

2483
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:56,864
Do the basic

2484
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:59,168
In a unit that these military's kind of Opera

2485
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:06,080
Goes back to Napoleonic time two divisions are still use of course in military today and if you want to think about 15,000

2486
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,384
Man in the division as a kind of a rough side

2487
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,664
Actually fluctuates

2488
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,224
Put Justin 15000mah

2489
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,784
A 15000 man division

2490
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,576
He's probably more troops

2491
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:19,648
The night of the Normans or the Saxons at the Battle of Hastings

2492
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,928
The pivotal 1060

2493
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,464
Six battle that decided the fate of

2494
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,256
Time in England

2495
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,024
The time

2496
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:29,120
Each division is is equivalent to a rather nice sized

2497
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,400
Early medieval Army

2498
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,728
The German Army at the beginning of the war has more than AT&T

2499
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,312
Imagine trying to control 80 Norman Army

2500
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:43,712
And it's not just about getting each division where it needs to go it's about sinking what they do together

2501
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,736
And when you start

2502
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:47,296
Organizing divisions into Coors and Coors in the army

2503
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:52,672
Chinese armies have to support each other they have to travel on different roads and then converge at certain points

2504
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:57,792
And you have to think of the incredible math is involved in these March, then it's hard to get your mind around

2505
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:03,424
These units are so large and these roads so narrow that when the head of the column starts walking

2506
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,240
They've gone like 29 miles

2507
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:09,056
Before the end of the column can start walking

2508
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:13,664
Trying to plan to have food ready for these guys when they stop marching I mean it's

2509
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,712
The logistics of this is incredible

2510
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,528
And it's the main reason why you couldn't do this

2511
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:21,856
You know ages and ages ago you just couldn't support

2512
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,184
In addition all these armies are fabulously trained

2513
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:29,792
The Germans are incredibly trained in terms of having even their reservist

2514
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:30,560
On the

2515
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:32,608
Practice field in Germany

2516
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:36,192
Doing live-fire exercises preparing for this day

2517
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,008
Is Barbara tuchman writes about

2518
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,824
And it starts with mobilization and you get an idea of how

2519
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,592
Play endeavor

2520
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,384
Every step is in the German army

2521
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,152
Quote

2522
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:47,712
Once the mobilization button was pushed

2523
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:54,112
The whole vast machinery for calling up equipping and transporting 2 million men began turning

2524
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:57,184
Reservists went to their designated depots

2525
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,488
We should uniforms equipment NR

2526
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,024
Formed into company

2527
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,560
Can companies in a battalion

2528
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,352
We're joined by cavalry

2529
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,120
Cyclist

2530
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,144
Artillery

2531
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,168
Medical unit

2532
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:07,936
Cookware

2533
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,216
Blacksmith wagon

2534
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,496
Stephen postlewait

2535
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:16,384
Moved according to prepared Railway timetables to concentration points near the frontier

2536
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,176
Where they would be formed into division

2537
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,712
Divisions in decor

2538
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:21,248
Concours into Army

2539
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,528
He's ready to advance in fight

2540
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,832
1 Army Corps alone she writes

2541
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:28,160
Out of the total of 40 in the German forces

2542
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:31,744
Required 170 Railway cars for officers

2543
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,536
965

2544
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:34,304
For Infantry

2545
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:37,376
2964 cavalry

2546
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:39,680
1915

2547
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:41,472
Artillery and Supply wagons

2548
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:45,568
6010 in all group in 140 trains

2549
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,872
And an equal number again for their supplies

2550
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:50,432
From the moment the order was given she writes

2551
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,480
Everything was to move it fixed

2552
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,808
* according to a schedule precise down to the number of

2553
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:59,392
Train axles that would pass over a given Bridge within a given time

2554
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,672
And quote

2555
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:05,024
When you realize how minutely plan

2556
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,608
And how you know punctual this whole thing must

2557
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:14,496
Be in order to function you can see why delay is of even a few hours will throw your whole time table off

2558
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:21,152
You're right before this whole conflict breaks out and I mentioned it earlier the Kaiser will turn to Von moltke and he's panicking at the last minute

2559
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:23,712
The great Supreme War leaders not so tough when

2560
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:26,528
It all looks like it's coming down unfortunately for him

2561
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:32,928
Or fortunately for him the staff that works under him are tough-as-nails again another thing is German Army this.

2562
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
Route to the table

2563
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:37,024
Which to be honest the second one did most of the time 2

2564
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,560
It's fantastic leadership

2565
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:44,960
Anna Kaiser one-point things to war with Britain has offices great we can turn the armies around you know just send him to Russia instead of

2566
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:49,824
I'm worrying about France and England it all and then most gas to stop and say you do not improvise

2567
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,616
The deployment of Millions

2568
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,176
I think the exact language

2569
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:57,760
The deployment of millions cannot be improvised but you get the point

2570
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:58,528
This was a

2571
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,576
An efficient plan

2572
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:04,416
To deploy the largest number of people that have never been sent

2573
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
In a single area

2574
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,512
For a single purpose probably in all human history

2575
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:10,560
You think about

2576
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,096
Napoleon's greatest

2577
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:15,936
Outrageous gamble right to invade Russia

2578
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:20,544
Utilizing an army composed of many many many different European people

2579
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:21,824
And he had to scrape

2580
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:27,456
Germany in every place out to get enough people to send into Russia with something that was called the Grand Army

2581
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:29,504
You know in the early 1800s

2582
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,320
This is crazy in debrecen maybe

2583
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,392
750000 men into Russia

2584
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:40,000
The Germans were going to invade Belgium with more than twice that in and out

2585
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,536
Flanking maneuver

2586
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:47,680
That's not even the Army that's holding the front that's just a big wide swinging gate that's going to smash on top of the head of France

2587
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,984
How do you control

2588
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:55,872
That many people how do you even get them from one place to another we kind of seem to think in our head that they can just

2589
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,408
Marcia Cross

2590
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:02,528
You know mountainsides and country lanes and through fields and pastures and sometimes they do

2591
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,320
But most of the time

2592
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,880
They get two places the same way most of us do

2593
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,672
They utilize the road system

2594
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,000
Think about what the road system in Belgium

2595
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,536
Tiny little

2596
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:17,632
Mostly rural Belgium is going to be like with this massive

2597
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,400
Greatest

2598
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:21,216
Sized Army probably ever put together

2599
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:24,544
Trying to March through it all in a short period of time

2600
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,592
There were Witnesses

2601
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,640
Of course to this actually happening

2602
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,688
One of the fun ones

2603
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,968
To read for me

2604
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,760
Is Richard Harding Davis

2605
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:36,832
Because Davis is one of those guys he's in America

2606
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:39,904
He also is basically the war correspondent

2607
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:43,488
One of the main ones of his era and he wrote about the deployment of

2608
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:49,888
American forces in Cuba you know what the turn of the century and all this kind of stuff and he's he's really Aurora Americana

2609
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:52,192
Kind of guy you know America is the best at everything

2610
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,472
And that's what a feeling

2611
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:56,032
But he was there in Belgium

2612
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,080
As the German Army comes through

2613
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:04,736
And you can I mean I'm going to read you this extensively because you can hear in his writing his jaw is on

2614
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:05,504
On the floor

2615
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:09,856
And here's someone who doesn't think anybody does anything better than America

2616
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,392
And he's getting a lesson

2617
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,720
And what the best army in the world looks

2618
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,256
Remember

2619
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,536
This kind of

2620
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:22,656
Force at this kind of level in potency hasn't been on display in anyone's living memory

2621
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:27,264
You're getting a view of a Nation at War like you would in Napoleonic times

2622
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:33,152
But marked and equipped and organized and supported by a modern 20th century State this was

2623
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,176
Why you would be

2624
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:34,944
Beginning to see

2625
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,736
Tiny little glimmer

2626
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,016
I'm with a leap in the dark

2627
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,040
What's going to entail

2628
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,088
Is going to entail fighting Army

2629
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,624
Like this one

2630
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,672
Richard Harding Davis

2631
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,256
The entrance of the German Army into Brussels

2632
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,792
Has lost a human koala

2633
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:53,632
It was lost as soon as the three soldiers who led the army

2634
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,936
Bicycle into the boulevard do Regen

2635
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,984
And ask the way to the Gare Du Nord

2636
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,008
When they passed

2637
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,544
The human note passed with

2638
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,336
What came after them

2639
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:08,224
And 24 hours later is still coming is not men marching but a force of nature

2640
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
Like a tidal wave

2641
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:10,528
Annapolis

2642
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,576
4 River flooding its back

2643
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:18,720
At this minute it is rolling through Brussels have a swollen Waters of the coming of valleys went through Johnstown

2644
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:22,304
At the site of the first few regiments of the enemy he writes

2645
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,096
We were thrilled with interest

2646
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:29,728
After 3 hours they had passed in one on Broken Steel grey column we were bored

2647
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:32,032
But when our after hour pass

2648
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,568
And it was no halt

2649
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,848
No breathing time

2650
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:37,152
No Open Spaces in the ranks

2651
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:39,200
The thing became uncanny

2652
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,224
Inhuman

2653
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,528
You return to watch it fascinated

2654
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:47,136
It held the mystery and Menace of fog rolling towards you across the sea

2655
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,160
And quote

2656
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,720
He then goes on to describe the uniform

2657
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,000
Which

2658
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,560
Pretty much the same color the second world war German unit

2659
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,096
Feldgrau

2660
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:59,680
Proper way to pronounce it but basically it's just a gray

2661
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:01,728
But during this time.

2662
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:06,848
Most Nations had only relatively recently gone away from Gaudi colorful clothing

2663
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:11,712
You know bright red Scarlet for British troops is only recently given away to khaki

2664
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:16,064
And the French army still war stop that look like they belong in Napoleon's Army

2665
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,112
Right they're going to wear red pants

2666
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,416
And Blue Jackets

2667
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:26,816
And they're going to carry Savers near Calvary going to have Brent plates and horsehair helmet I mean it spooky stuff most military's remove

2668
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:27,584
Moving away from me

2669
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,376
The Germans

2670
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:32,448
Use of gray Harding thinks is the most

2671
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:35,264
Fantastic use of camouflage she's ever seen

2672
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:38,080
The British khaki is often compared

2673
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,384
To a canary that's gotten Dusty

2674
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:44,224
Davis goes on and on about how the minute these

2675
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,552
German soldiers get a hundred yards from you can't see him anymore

2676
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:53,952
He said he was watching some German Cavalry ride by he could see the horses but he couldn't see the guys on them because they just sort of blend with

2677
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:56,000
The fog and the Mist in the Twilight

2678
02:06:56,256 --> 02:07:00,608
In the early morning hours in that color that goes on and on about how great that is it how scientific

2679
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:02,656
He goes on

2680
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:07,520
Yesterday Major General von jarotski the German military governor of Brussels

2681
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:09,312
Ushered Burgermaster Max

2682
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:11,872
Set the German Army would not occupy the city

2683
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,152
But would pass through it

2684
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:14,432
It is still past

2685
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:17,504
I have followed in campaigns six armies

2686
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,344
But accepting not even our own the Japanese or the British

2687
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:23,904
I have not seen one so thoroughly equipped

2688
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:26,208
I'm not speaking of the fighting qualities of ner

2689
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:28,768
Only of the equipment in organization

2690
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:34,656
The German Army moved into this city as smoothly and it's compact Lee headed the Empire State Express

2691
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:38,240
There were no halts no open places no stragglers

2692
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:42,080
This Army he writes has been on active service for 3 weeks

2693
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:46,432
And so far there is not apparently a chin strap or a horseshoe missing

2694
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:50,272
It came in with the smoke pouring from cook stoves on wheels

2695
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:55,136
N&n our had set up post office wagon from Witch Mountain Messengers galloped

2696
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:57,696
How long the line of columns Distributing letters

2697
02:07:57,952 --> 02:08:00,512
Which soldiers posted picture postcard

2698
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,584
The Infantry he writes came in files of 5

2699
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,632
200 men to each company

2700
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,936
The Lancers in Columns of 4

2701
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:13,824
With no dependents missing the quick firing guns and field pieces were one hour at a time in passing

2702
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,664
Each gun with that ammunition wagon taking 20 seconds in which to pass

2703
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:21,248
The men of the Infantry saying Fatherland my Fatherland

2704
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:24,576
Between each line of song they took three steps

2705
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:29,440
At times two thousand men were singing together in absolute Rhythm and beat

2706
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:34,560
When the melody gave way the silence was broken only by the stamp of iron-shod boots

2707
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:36,352
And then again the song Rose

2708
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:37,888
When the singing ceased

2709
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:39,680
The bands played marches

2710
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:41,984
They were followed by the rumble of Siege guns

2711
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,520
The creaking of Wheels

2712
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:48,640
End of chains clanking against the cobblestones on the sharp bell-like voices of the bugle

2713
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:55,296
For 7 hours the Army path in such solid columns that not want Smita taxi cab or trolley car pass

2714
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,064
Through the city

2715
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,368
Like a river of steelhead float

2716
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,648
Gray and ghostlike

2717
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,184
Then as dusk

2718
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,768
Caymanas thousands of horses hooves and thousands of iron boots

2719
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,560
Continued to Trend forward

2720
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:09,376
Tiny spark from the cobblestone

2721
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:12,448
But the horses in men who beat out the Sparks were invisible

2722
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,288
@midnight pack wagons and seeds guns were still passing

2723
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:20,896
At 7 this morning I was awakened by the Tramp of men in bands playing jauntily

2724
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:27,296
Whether they marched all night or not I do not know but now for 26 hours to gray army has rumbled by

2725
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:29,088
With the mystery of fog

2726
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,136
In the pertinacity of a steamroller

2727
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,416
And quote

2728
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,976
That was a long quote

2729
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
But that's

2730
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
That's

2731
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,792
The German army

2732
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
The kaiserreich

2733
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:41,888
Campaign the German Army in the Second World War

2734
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,680
Is that country's best attempt

2735
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,704
To recreate

2736
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:45,984
Matt

2737
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,080
No I've always believed

2738
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,408
That the very ferocity in the

2739
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:56,224
Scariness of this kaiserreich German army

2740
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:00,064
Work against it at the beginning of the war in a way that heard it

2741
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,600
Throughout the entire

2742
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:06,208
History of the war and I think long afterwards helped establish this German reputation

2743
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,256
As sort of the bad guys

2744
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:14,144
Because this Army was so intimidating so scary everything from the Precision drill to the

2745
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,984
Equipment to how well-organized they were to the logistics

2746
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,752
To the leadership

2747
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:22,592
To the intimidating elements built into it I mean they had a wonderful

2748
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,640
A unit called the deaths

2749
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,176
Head massage

2750
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,712
What you goes back to

2751
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,504
Napoleonic Wars

2752
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,528
Earlier actually

2753
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:35,648
And they wear the old-fashioned huszar's for helmets in 1914

2754
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:39,488
1810 the fur helmet of the Stars

2755
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:41,536
And on the fur helmet is a skull

2756
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:47,168
Reminds you a little bit of ESS forces in the second world war but it shows you that all of this

2757
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,192
Predated

2758
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:54,592
You know what the Nazi did the Nazis were just updating a lot of classic German traditions in a lot of cases perverting them and staining them

2759
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:57,664
Blackness and everything but the death head hussar famous

2760
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:00,224
An intimidating as they're meant to be

2761
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,272
But then you take that

2762
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,576
Nasty ferocious intimidating Army

2763
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:09,440
It looks like I could take on anyone in the world and the first time you see him in action they're taking on

2764
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,720
God bless him

2765
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,000
The belgians

2766
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:17,120
A tiny little neutral Nation that's less than a hundred years old and has never fought a war

2767
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,144
In fact

2768
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,680
Is so small

2769
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:24,544
Surrounded by great powers that they rationally figured out a long time ago

2770
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,616
It doesn't matter how much effort they put into defense

2771
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:28,896
They can't win

2772
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:35,808
Are the belgians totally unprepared for Warfare lose only a little bit faster than the belgians obsessively

2773
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,088
Prepared for Warfare

2774
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:45,024
They put their trust in these International agreement they had with people who were going to guarantee their security which is how this whole things happening anyway

2775
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
What right

2776
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,864
But they did build some defense

2777
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,656
Maybe as a

2778
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:51,680
Sign that

2779
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:54,240
You know we can't kill you but we can hurt you

2780
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:56,032
And the defenses are really cool

2781
02:11:57,056 --> 02:12:01,152
Because it's really right in that. And in human history where fortification

2782
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:01,920
Sports

2783
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:02,944
Reach

2784
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,224
Sort of their high water

2785
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,552
And we still billed for today but it's nothing like it was

2786
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,344
Pretty much from the beginning of

2787
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:11,648
In human history until

2788
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:14,208
What about the time we're talking about here

2789
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:16,512
Because then you could base an entire defense strategy

2790
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Nowadays

2791
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:21,376
We have these special positions where you guard them with a fork but if anybody

2792
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:23,424
Decided they're going to start launching missiles in

2793
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,704
Bombs and I mean it doesn't matter

2794
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:27,776
That's something we learn

2795
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:29,568
Very soon in this story

2796
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:32,384
2018 ATS when these Belgian forts are built

2797
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:39,296
This is the. Where it looks like modern tech is going to make these things like space hate Star Wars

2798
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,576
When was planetary defenses

2799
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,368
They build these wonderful

2800
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:44,160
Subterranean fort

2801
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,208
Barbara tuchman said like castles

2802
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,744
Sonic Underground

2803
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:50,560
And will do as you I'm reminded of the old

2804
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:54,144
Godzilla films in the Monster Zero films where you have some planet

2805
02:12:54,400 --> 02:13:00,544
Anybody have a gun that would just Rise Up from the planet's surface shoot and then go back down underground and

2806
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,336
That's what happened in these boards

2807
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,128
I have to remind myself

2808
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:07,712
How cool that is this is like steampunk stuff because

2809
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:09,760
When they're building Esports for Belgium

2810
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:16,416
It's the same time that the United States and Mexico are trying to Corral Geronimo and a bunch of Apaches in the American South

2811
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:20,000
Well that's going on the belgians are building underground forts

2812
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:26,144
When you can see some of the stuff on video if you look at the Maginot Line which comes of generation after this obviously

2813
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:27,936
What is the same kind of thing

2814
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:31,776
You know you look at it from above ground you can barely tell there's a fort there

2815
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:38,176
When in fact underground in a massive concrete and in a little railroads underneath moving guns and ammunition

2816
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:40,224
Cool stuff in the way the Belgian

2817
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,272
Designer who was one of the best in the world

2818
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:48,160
Built this system he took advantage of the natural River and a slight rise in the hill and everything in there he built

2819
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,440
Six big forts

2820
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:53,280
With six small fortune between and they all cover each other's

2821
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:55,328
Fields of fire with your gun so

2822
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,864
You know what Ford a

2823
02:13:57,376 --> 02:14:01,984
Can reach with their guns Fort be can reach where there's two so they overlap so there's never a place

2824
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,520
In the distance anyway

2825
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,312
Where the guns can't reach the enemy

2826
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:09,920
Any between Esports the belgians have it so that they're going to put guys in trenches

2827
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,456
Between every four

2828
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:16,576
Are people they're supported by the guns at this wonderful system and then you throw more troops out

2829
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:21,952
You know 500 yards a thousand yards ahead to keep enemy artillery away when you have this

2830
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:26,048
System where maybe you can't win a war against someone like the Germans

2831
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,328
But you can

2832
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:31,168
Give him a bloody nose and maybe say see you if you really don't want to do this

2833
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:34,240
The Germans aren't sure about that when they come into Belgium

2834
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:38,592
That kind of thinking the Belgian Army is either just going to stand aside like I said earlier

2835
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:43,456
Or maybe you know a few shots up in the air we protected our honor now we're going to stand aside

2836
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:47,552
And the first sign that the Germans are wrong about this is that the bridges are blown up

2837
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344
The tunnels

2838
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,112
Are blonde

2839
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,648
The railroads

2840
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:52,416
Are blown up

2841
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:57,536
That Madden's the Germans cuz they're on this tight schedule right

2842
02:14:58,304 --> 02:14:59,584
So now they have to deal

2843
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:02,400
With at least Transportation nightmare

2844
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:07,776
On this road system it was already going to be clogged terribly and there's your first nightmare in the German straight across

2845
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,336
Some of these rivers on the frontier in pontoons

2846
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,128
And the Belgian start shooting at them

2847
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,944
So the Germans

2848
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,224
Put into action

2849
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,248
A

2850
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:22,368
Group that they have designed specifically to take these 14 this is the part of the story where we are

2851
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:26,720
When war is declared you have a 72 hours with everybody trying to get their heads around this idea

2852
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,512
And at the same time

2853
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:34,912
They flipped all these switches for mobilization the doomsday device I called it work they're calling up all these forces and everybody

2854
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:41,056
Stop here and everybody's are scrambling and what they assume is a race to the front lines which they don't want to lose

2855
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,616
Remember what they gave award only

2856
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,896
One side game

2857
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,688
Gene Wilder

2858
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:49,760
While everybody is concentrating its called their forces

2859
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:52,064
The Germans have like 30000 guys

2860
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:56,160
It was set up in advance to go out basically in the pregame

2861
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,952
First World War I guess you could say

2862
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:02,304
And take out the sport if they have to because these forts are blocking the roads

2863
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:08,960
You cannot get to that Belgian Road system that you need to get from Germany to France if you don't take the forts around a place like

2864
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,728
Leah Ashe

2865
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:10,496
Renee Moore

2866
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:17,920
And so 30,000 men have been training for years for just this job like I said earlier the day was called deer tag the day

2867
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:24,576
This has been planned for for a long time and the Germans have essentially a special unit of $30,000

2868
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:28,416
Kaiser job it is to take out the sports at the belgians don't stand aside and surrender them

2869
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:30,208
The belgians don't stand aside and

2870
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:33,024
And in fact

2871
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,328
The belgians are going to

2872
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:37,120
First

2873
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,400
Great lesson

2874
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,680
Of the war

2875
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:40,960
About what

2876
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:41,728
Change

2877
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,264
Since the last time

2878
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:44,544
Outer space.

2879
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:45,824
How much

2880
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,360
Bee killing power

2881
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:52,992
That machines afforded mankind on the battlefield how much that had changed

2882
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,016
The angel

2883
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,040
Equation of War

2884
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:58,624
Machines been taken over for a long time becoming more and more important

2885
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:01,184
This is the war where

2886
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,208
They take over

2887
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:02,976
Completely

2888
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:08,608
And man Supremacy on the battlefield even though the other ones who run the machines

2889
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,400
Will always be now

2890
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:11,680
Secondary

2891
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
Compared to the killing power

2892
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,008
And mechanization

2893
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,800
They can be brought to bear

2894
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,592
You know by modern society

2895
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,128
Technology

2896
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:22,432
Was devastating when used against

2897
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,224
Bulls and

2898
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,528
Nations that couldn't compete militarily

2899
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:30,112
The belgians are going to show what a tiny little army of

2900
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,136
Chocolate Soldier

2901
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,416
But the Germans

2902
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:33,440
Thought they were going to face

2903
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:37,792
What time is it alarm your chocolate soldiers can do to the greatest army in the world

2904
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:39,328
Because of the

2905
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,120
Deadliness

2906
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,144
So the weapons at hand

2907
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:47,520
I want the interestings with sub themes of this whole upcoming conflict

2908
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:49,824
Is how long it takes

2909
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:54,688
Some people to absorb the lessons that are being taught in this conflict

2910
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:59,552
Lesson number one is how deadly the weapons are and how you have to account for that

2911
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:02,624
Some of the generals military thinkers understood this going into the

2912
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:08,256
Because they paid close attention to that 1905 War I told you about the russo-japanese war

2913
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,280
Which by the way

2914
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:12,864
American president Teddy Roosevelt won a Nobel Prize

2915
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,144
For helping to broker the peace

2916
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:14,912
That

2917
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:21,568
But that taught lessons about what happens when two sides armed with machine guns and two sides are on with modern art

2918
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:22,848
All that face off

2919
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:28,224
But the lessons were not the kind of lesson some people wanted to learn I mean if you were a Cavalry

2920
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:28,992
Commander

2921
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:29,760
Example

2922
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:34,368
Your arm of the military is already not looked upon as Berry Survivor

2923
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:38,208
The Warriors all since Napoleon have kind of shown that listen

2924
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:40,000
Calories dies on the

2925
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:46,912
The only thing the Cavalry commander still have going in their favor is there aren't really automobiles yet there will be by the time this war is over

2926
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:53,312
But there are novelty still be used in strange Innovative situations what militaries of the world don't have tons of automobiles

2927
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:57,152
You know running is not mechanize like the second world war everybody's using horses

2928
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:00,224
Even if they die on the battlefield

2929
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:04,832
You like sheaves of wheat being sized down you have nothing to replace that Mobility with

2930
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:11,488
Spanish Cavalry commander don't want to hear that it's even worse than it used to be wow wait till the modern artillery and machine guns get ahold of your cat

2931
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,560
I don't want to hear that so they talk about the results as being

2932
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,584
On representative

2933
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,888
Commanders were very mm

2934
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,936
Involved in the idea of

2935
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:22,496
Power of the band that's in the charge in the offensive

2936
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:27,872
For example the entire French outlook on war right now is connected to this idea that you attack

2937
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,664
I'm going to go check with the band

2938
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:31,456
Doesn't really mean you're going to

2939
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:35,296
Maybe get into hand-to-hand combat with an aggressive style of warfare is what you want

2940
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:41,184
If you've been preaching that not your country's doctor in your entire military is organized around the culture of the offencive

2941
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:46,048
And cran which is the French word I guess for like guts and skin it's all about guts

2942
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:49,888
Nobody wants to hear that machine guns just rip guts out that the only thing they carried

2943
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,424
God damn it doesn't work to have

2944
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,216
Bayonet charges in

2945
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:55,008
Ridiculous offenses well

2946
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,032
The French would say

2947
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,568
Yeah so what doesn't work

2948
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,616
Are the Russians of the Japanese

2949
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:02,176
Will work for the fraction that's why we have a great military

2950
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:05,504
I mean there's all kinds of ways to rationalize but you don't want to learn

2951
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:10,112
Many of the militaries of the world are organized like Napoleonic time

2952
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,416
They don't want to hear

2953
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:15,232
That is a completely wrong way to be organized

2954
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,000
French

2955
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:20,864
Calvary heading off to War as I said earlier but you have to Imagine This

2956
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:27,264
If you want to see what Napoleon's soldiers look like go look at pictures of the French Cavalry 1914.

2957
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,800
Going off to war with

2958
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:35,200
Metal breastplates and horsehair helmets and you would have to be an expert to look at a picture of them in 1940

2959
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:40,320
And a picture of Napoleon's Cavalry in 1814 and find the differences

2960
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:44,416
The officers are going to go to war and white gloves

2961
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:45,952
They're going to have swords

2962
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:50,048
They're going to stand up and troops are going to March into combat

2963
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,584
In like billiard

2964
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,632
Ball formations or

2965
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:57,728
In a bowling pin formations drill formations from the battlefield

2966
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:04,128
None of the people who consider this to be an integral part of military culture want to learn that the rules have changed

2967
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:06,688
A1905 they got one lesson

2968
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:08,736
In 1914 everybody get another

2969
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:11,296
And the Germans get theirs when they try to take these for

2970
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,368
On August 5th 1914

2971
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:16,416
The Germans attack

2972
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,184
4

2973
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,464
Of these Belgian for

2974
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,024
Now

2975
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:26,656
Between the Fords the Belgian to put the put some infantry and there are a couple of machine guns around and whatnot of the Germans

2976
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:33,056
You know they're in a bit of a rush here they don't have time to sit there and starve things out this 30,000 man forth with artillery have to go in there and

2977
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,080
Power this through so

2978
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:35,616
The armies behind them

2979
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:38,944
Continue there in a few just salt through Belgium on France

2980
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,480
A charge

2981
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
These

2982
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,528
Yuan transfer

2983
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:45,088
The Belgian Slaughter

2984
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,648
Slaughter them

2985
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:51,744
Mounds of bodies

2986
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,792
And the belgians can't figure out

2987
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:57,120
The best way to deal with it because the Mounds of bodies

2988
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:04,544
Because the mountains of bodies become places German troops can hide behind and shoot from behind and launch attacks from behind

2989
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,944
And the belgians are trying to figure out if Kate do we shoot through these bodies and create can you can you create a hole through bodies if you

2990
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,480
Shoot through the machine gun long neck

2991
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:17,088
What do we send out people to risk their lives to create holes in the body that we can shoot through

2992
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:19,392
Barbara tuchman

2993
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:21,440
As a passage in her before she quotes

2994
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:26,304
The commander of the Belgian forces that were resisting the German assault

2995
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,352
By general von emmich and his

2996
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,376
Special brigades

2997
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:30,912
Top gun rights quote

2998
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:37,312
On August 5th Emmitsburg AIDS open the attack on the four easternmost Sports of the edge

2999
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:41,408
With a cannonade by field artillery followed by an infantry assault

3000
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,968
The light shelves made no impression on the phone

3001
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:48,064
And the Belgian guns poured a hail of fire on the German troops

3002
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:49,600
Slaughtering their front rack

3003
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:56,256
Company after company came on making for the spaces in between the forks where the Belgian entrenchment had not been

3004
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,024
Completed

3005
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,840
At some point where they broke through the German

3006
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:03,424
Stormed up the slopes where the guns could not be depressed to reach them

3007
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,984
And were mowed down by the forts machine gun

3008
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:09,312
The dead piled up in ridges a yard High

3009
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:13,408
Afford Marshawn belgians seeing the German lines waiver

3010
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:15,712
Charged with the bayonet and threw them back

3011
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:18,784
Again and again the Germans return to the assault

3012
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:20,576
Spending live like bullet

3013
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:23,648
What's in the knowledge of printable Reserve to make up for the losses

3014
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,440
A quote to Belgian

3015
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,720
Officer who was there

3016
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:32,352
Quote they made no attempt at deploying a Belgian officer described it later

3017
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:35,680
But came on line after line almost shoulder-to-shoulder

3018
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:37,216
Until we shot them down

3019
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:43,616
The Fallen were heaped on top of each other than awful barricade of dead and wounded that threatened to match Target

3020
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,408
And causes trouble

3021
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:49,248
So how did the barricade become that we didn't know whether to fire through it

3022
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:53,344
Where to go out in clear openings with our hands but would you believe it

3023
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:57,696
This veritable wall of dead and dying enabled those wonderful Germans

3024
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,976
To creep closer

3025
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:01,280
And actually charged up the embankment

3026
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:05,888
They got no farther than halfway though because our machine guns and rifles swept them back

3027
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:11,008
Of course we had our losses but they were slight compared to the Carnage we inflicted on our enemies

3028
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:12,800
And quote

3029
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:15,872
It's interesting to note isn't

3030
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:20,224
That Belgian officers respect for those wonderful Germans is he

3031
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:20,992
He called them

3032
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:22,528
Exhibiting

3033
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:27,904
The military virtues of Valor that were so celebrated during this period where

3034
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,696
The romance of warfare

3035
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:32,768
You know what you'd always been strong and human culture was probably at a

3036
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:33,536
Tight

3037
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,072
The

3038
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:38,400
19th century the romance was incredible

3039
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:44,032
This is the era where that romance runs into reality in a way that you just can't pretend

3040
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:45,056
I mean guys like

3041
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:49,664
In William Tecumseh Sherman the Civil War General for the US famously said that war is hell

3042
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:51,968
And it's glory is all moonshine

3043
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:56,576
I didn't really see into the mass of the population is one is Dory have pointed out

3044
02:24:56,832 --> 02:25:02,976
They weren't publishing a whole lot of combat photos and really nasty terrible stuff for the folks back home

3045
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:04,512
Anytime during these.

3046
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:07,072
So there wasn't a lot of stuff to really

3047
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:09,888
Counteract the Romantic ideas of War

3048
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:13,728
This is the conflict where you can't hide it any

3049
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:15,776
And even though

3050
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:22,176
This Belgian officer looks at this German assault on his food is something akin to The Charge of the Light Brigade

3051
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:22,944
The famous

3052
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:27,296
Doom charge of that British Cavalry during the Korean War

3053
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:29,600
But here's the thing that this war is going to teach

3054
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:36,000
If you watch The Charge of the Light Brigade you think it's magnificent and brave a doomed sort of attack

3055
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,792
On the part of incredibly

3056
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:39,328
In courageous men

3057
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:41,888
What happens if after the charge fails

3058
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,424
They send another one

3059
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,448
And the same results.

3060
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,240
And then they send another one in the same

3061
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:48,800
And then I do it again and again

3062
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,848
At what point does this wonderful

3063
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,640
Doomed romantic

3064
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:55,200
In a celebration of the courage of the military

3065
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,224
Heart

3066
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:58,272
Become something obscene

3067
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,088
This war is going to take us

3068
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:04,672
And it's going to pound the point home

3069
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:05,696
So you're sick of

3070
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,560
After the failure of that German attack on the Belgian Defence

3071
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:13,888
The Germans regroup to attack again that same night

3072
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:14,656
August 5th

3073
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:16,704
And waiting for the sun to go down

3074
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:21,568
And Witnesses who were with the troops describe them as nervous

3075
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:25,920
And anxious and gloomy about the prospects of assaulting

3076
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,712
In these defenses again

3077
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:29,504
What's more doing it at night

3078
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,320
Throughout most of human history night assault

3079
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:34,112
If you were lucky

3080
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:39,744
Had Torchlight illumination it was always a huge gamble very disorienting you couldn't see anything

3081
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,536
That was going to change

3082
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:42,816
War

3083
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:49,216
And it was going to be a facet of 20th century Warfare that we may never see repeated again now that night vision have become about

3084
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
Battlefield staple

3085
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:51,776
There's no reason to light up

3086
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,800
The battlefield

3087
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:55,872
Infected one side like Vision in the other doesn't you don't want it live

3088
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,408
In this.

3089
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:59,712
These Germans were going to go into conflict

3090
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:03,296
Where the nighttime Darkness could be banished by technology

3091
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:06,880
You at search lights in these forts Inuit Searchlight

3092
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,672
German side sometimes you had

3093
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:15,328
Shell that you can shoot up into the air that would illuminate the night sky and you have to imagine Bunches of those shelves going off

3094
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:19,680
You know it's at separate intervals when they overlap so they're getting brighter and darker and

3095
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,472
You know the look of it reminds you of like a

3096
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,752
Flashbulb

3097
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:26,592
Flashlights with strobe light fluorescent lumination

3098
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:32,992
And it just cats a go sleep all over the whole Battlefield so that every time you get that burst of light you see

3099
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:33,760
1000

3100
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:36,320
People like ants moving along the battlefield

3101
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:42,720
And you have artillery going off and I'm just think about how weird and disorienting being in the middle of a modern battle

3102
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:44,768
Battlefield would be in the daytime

3103
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:46,048
And I'll take away the light

3104
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:47,584
Freaky

3105
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:54,496
And that's where the German soldiers are about to face and they're understandably nervous they expected some sort of romantic

3106
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:57,824
Kind of War even if it was dangerous you had a chance for heroism

3107
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:00,640
And a chance to die for your country I mean this is it

3108
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:04,992
Generation that is absolutely confused with the ideas of nationalism in the

3109
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:09,088
Dying for your country is a huge glorious thing that you should look forward to

3110
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,136
And now they're saying wait a minute

3111
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:15,488
How glorious is it to be one of many people mowed down by machine guns

3112
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,768
You just sort of

3113
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:17,536
Randomly

3114
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:20,608
They don't want to go on the assault again

3115
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:23,936
And this attack starts to bog down after it starts

3116
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:26,496
Now there's an officer

3117
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:33,152
Who is roaming around the battlefield who normally is in Berlin with the high general staff of the drum

3118
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:33,920
Military

3119
02:28:34,432 --> 02:28:36,480
The Germans encourage their staff members

3120
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:42,880
To get out in the field sometimes and see what's going on in this guy had a particular interest in this battle because he was one of the people who play

3121
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:43,648
I have it

3122
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:50,304
For years he's been planning this bottle he took his vacations from Germany to Belgium just to look around where the battle

3123
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,328
I was going to be fought

3124
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,096
And now

3125
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:53,632
Cynthia had a vested interest in

3126
02:28:53,888 --> 02:29:00,032
Hoping his plans were carried out correctly he's wandering around the battlefield at night looking for what the holdup is and find

3127
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:04,640
Doubt that the general commanding a certain part of the attack is dead killed by Machine Gun fire

3128
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:06,688
So this guy this stop officer

3129
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:07,712
Who

3130
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:10,784
Historians have described as absolutely

3131
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,576
Devoid of fear

3132
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,112
Big man

3133
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,160
Grabs the unit

3134
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:17,440
Of the Dead General

3135
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,976
Five or six thousand men

3136
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,000
In the dark

3137
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:22,048
And start leading them toward the objective

3138
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,608
Now you got all these Sports

3139
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:31,008
More than 400 guns from the four two than the guns on the German side it just got to be this unbelievable chaotic mess in the

3140
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:34,592
The dark and this one General has grab this unit in his

3141
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:36,128
And is heading toward

3142
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,152
The city

3143
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:41,760
Aaliyah it's which is protected by the circle of forthright with men in between all the 4th

3144
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:46,880
He finds a spot that undefended leave this unit pasta for

3145
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:48,416
Into the city

3146
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:50,464
On this Gamble

3147
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:55,328
Maybe the city won't be defended or maybe if I walk in there with 6000 guys will just lay down their weapon

3148
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:58,912
Now the Germans don't have a lot to celebrate

3149
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,520
In their military history in the second world war because the cause was so nasty

3150
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:04,544
Doesn't matter

3151
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:10,944
You know how many good things their troops did in terms of military history the military side of the causes so corrupted tanks everything

3152
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:13,760
The Germans can take some justifiable Pride

3153
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:17,088
In the adventure story of this guy because

3154
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:19,136
First ewoks in the city

3155
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:25,280
And everybody just want to surrender to him there and then he goes up to the Citadel the main defense in the center of the city

3156
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:29,888
With his sword hilt he pounds on the door demanding the surrender

3157
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,936
And they open up the door

3158
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:32,960
And they surrender

3159
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:35,776
Yikes

3160
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,336
Talk about boldness

3161
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:40,128
Talk about gambling

3162
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:42,944
This is a basically unknown

3163
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:44,224
German officer

3164
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:50,368
Who because of the name he's making for himself will be in a position that some historians will call

3165
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:52,928
The military dictator of Germany

3166
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,208
Within 4 years

3167
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:56,000
Name is Eric looten

3168
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:04,448
Ludendorff actions that night remind us once again that even though is I've sent several times the machines are kind of taken over the dominant

3169
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:06,240
Role in warfighting

3170
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,008
Artillery

3171
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,312
All the thinking machines

3172
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:11,360
You can't discount the humidifier

3173
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:15,200
In fact the human factors probably the dominant Factor

3174
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:15,968
Amongst

3175
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:19,040
Adversaries that are somewhat evenly matched

3176
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:22,368
Me know about a military genius is going to save Belgium

3177
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,392
From Germany

3178
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:26,464
Differences between the potential of the two sides

3179
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,744
Just too great

3180
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,024
Between

3181
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:34,400
Relatively equal there only moderately unequal Powers leadership could be the determining Factor

3182
02:31:34,912 --> 02:31:41,056
And the boldness shown by ludendorff that night is a precursor to what we can expect from him later on and what the rush

3183
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:43,360
Actions can expect from him very very soon

3184
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:45,664
Now ludendorff

3185
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:51,296
Dario dacious capture the city of the eyes doesn't solve the problems the Germans have because all those sports are still a

3186
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:54,112
Taking the city I'm taking the forts

3187
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:55,392
And they're still there

3188
02:31:55,648 --> 02:32:00,000
Ready to shoot up German March columns if those if they're not taken before the big March starts

3189
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:02,816
So ludendorff calls for his

3190
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:04,096
No Ace in the Hole

3191
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:07,680
As I said the Germans have been planning for this attack for a very long time

3192
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:10,240
They knew that the belgians might resist

3193
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:12,544
And they knew what they did they had to have

3194
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:17,664
A weapon that was greater than anything the people who built these forts ever envision

3195
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,480
In the 1880s although

3196
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:22,272
Some of these for today to the 1890s

3197
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,552
In that era

3198
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:27,392
The forts were basically guaranteed to the Belgian government

3199
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:31,488
To be invulnerable to any Canon then known in the world

3200
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:37,120
What's the Cannons that were then known in the world are no longer the maximum size cannons available in the world

3201
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:38,656
Those belong to the

3202
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:39,424
German

3203
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,728
And no one even knew it

3204
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:44,288
Until they first showed up on the scene

3205
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:47,616
And they become an even better demonstration

3206
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:52,992
Then the machine gun fire mowing down those boards Germans charging the Belgian defenses

3207
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:55,552
That the Weaponry was simply

3208
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,856
Doomsday device like

3209
02:32:58,368 --> 02:33:00,160
If you imagine it magnified

3210
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:00,928
Thousands

3211
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:01,696
The times

3212
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:05,280
The weapons that are on the way from

3213
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:06,048
Germany

3214
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:07,072
To Belch

3215
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:08,096
Reduce these

3216
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:11,168
Are the best example I can think

3217
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:13,728
To show how much is chain

3218
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,288
Since the last time the great Powers fought each

3219
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:20,384
Nowhere

3220
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,456
Is that moron displaying evident than in artillery

3221
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:29,600
Which a hundred years ago during Napoleon's time was already what Napoleon thought decided by

3222
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:32,160
And he was a guy who made his bones

3223
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:38,560
Any artillery he rose through the ranks as an artillery officer he's known for its use on the battlefield here's a guy that

3224
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:42,400
That could shock people with the killing power of well-used artillery

3225
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:43,936
And his big guns

3226
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,216
We're firing

3227
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:46,496
12 lb Cannonball

3228
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,312
Compound key

3229
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:54,432
The gun itself way in about

3230
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:55,968
1200 lb

3231
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:56,992
The same gun

3232
02:33:57,248 --> 02:33:59,040
Essentially in one case.

3233
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:01,344
Both sides of the US Civil War

3234
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:03,392
1200 lb Cannon

3235
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:08,000
The largest of the guns that are on the way from Berlin

3236
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:09,536
To Belgium

3237
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:11,584
The largest of them ways

3238
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,864
300000

3239
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:16,192
1200 lb

3240
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:17,984
300000

3241
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,640
The shells that Napoleon's 12 Pounders fired

3242
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:25,408
Or between

3243
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:26,176
9 + 12

3244
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:31,040
The shell that the largest of these guns

3245
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:33,856
A 420 mm motor fires

3246
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,904
That she'll weighs 2000

3247
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:41,536
The Napoleonic Cannon it was so deadly at the time that it was shocking

3248
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:44,608
Add an effective range of about 2000 yards

3249
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:47,936
The largest of these guns on the way from Berlin

3250
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:51,264
Which aren't even designed some of them for range at all

3251
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:55,104
The largest of these is a Siege Cannon so it doesn't even have to Firebird

3252
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:55,872
Far

3253
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:57,664
Has seven times the rain

3254
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,944
That French Cannon

3255
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,224
The was designed in

3256
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:01,760
Far

3257
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,320
This is an entirely new kind

3258
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:09,440
And the people who actually see this gun after it's assembled

3259
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:10,976
Are slackjaw

3260
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:14,048
And assembled it must be

3261
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:18,400
Because think about how hard it would be trying to transport

3262
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:23,008
Any of these large guns especially the largest of them now

3263
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,824
Now turn the clock back

3264
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:32,480
21914 style technology where automobiles aren't even very old there are

3265
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,760
Relatively new product

3266
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:36,064
Tractors are even newer

3267
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:40,160
Railways don't go everywhere you need them to and these guns weigh a ton

3268
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:46,816
Guns that are this large usually can only be put on ships that's how you get them replaced

3269
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:49,376
Two places are essentially Naval guns in size

3270
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:56,288
We're talking about a gun that is just over a 16-inch gun that's traditionally a naval gun later on you'll have real guns that are

3271
02:35:56,544 --> 02:36:00,384
That large to same problem though how do you get them from place to place they're so big they're so heavy

3272
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:03,456
The largest Battleship guns

3273
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:08,832
You never deployed were the Yamato Japanese super battleships and there's were 18.1

3274
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:09,600
Inches

3275
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,904
The famous American battleships

3276
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:12,672
The last

3277
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:15,488
Defective ones we built the Iowa class in Missouri

3278
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:17,024
They had 16-inch guns

3279
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,816
Imagine those guns

3280
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:20,608
Trying to be transporting

3281
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:21,888
Opel crossland

3282
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,936
Getting him to where you need them to go

3283
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,240
The guns on the way

3284
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,776
To reduce these forts

3285
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,824
Or that kind of size

3286
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:33,408
The largest of them 16-inch guns

3287
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:40,064
Takes forever and it's an amazing engineering feat just to get these guns to where they need to be

3288
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,624
And then when they get there

3289
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:46,720
The crew for these largest guns and it's like a couple hundred guys

3290
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:49,536
Have to lay cement the cement have to dry

3291
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:52,352
The gun have to be assembled and put together

3292
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:56,192
Then when they want to fire this thing this gives you an idea of the monsters

3293
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:56,960
You were talking about

3294
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:58,752
The gun crew

3295
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:00,032
How'd it go

3296
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:03,104
Three football fields away 300 yards away

3297
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:07,200
And fire the thing electronically and they were still so close

3298
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:12,320
But they had to put cotton wadding over their eyes their nose and their ears

3299
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:15,648
And they had to fire this thing while their mouth was open

3300
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:19,232
Are they blow out their eardrums and potentially worse than that

3301
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:23,328
Imagine with this weapon.

3302
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,704
The shell is fired in a 4000 foot Arc

3303
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,264
It takes a full minute

3304
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:32,800
To get from the gun

3305
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:36,384
To the Target. You fire and then there's the 60-second wait

3306
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:37,920
Until the explosion happen

3307
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:42,272
Unlike Napoleon's time we have cool shells that

3308
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:47,904
Can be delayed action fused and armor-piercing so that when you fire meth Esports

3309
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:54,304
They hit the top of the fourth that's the kind of art they had they don't fire flat something they fire we kept in the air and then it drops

3310
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,584
It's right on top of the sports

3311
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:57,120
A shoulder

3312
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,912
Pierce's armor concrete

3313
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:01,472
And then once it reaches its maximum depth

3314
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:02,496
Benedict play

3315
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:06,848
Wonderful World of Science and Engineering

3316
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:11,712
Is going to take over the battlefields of this upcoming conflict in a way that has never happened before

3317
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:13,760
And this weapon to me most

3318
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:16,320
Symbolizes in this early part of the war

3319
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:18,624
You know your example of here's your wake up

3320
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:20,416
Here's your Darth Vader

3321
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:22,720
Here's what 20th century War

3322
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:25,792
The gun arrives

3323
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:30,144
Along with some cousins were slightly smaller from the also great

3324
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:31,424
Armaments works

3325
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,472
Skoda in Australia

3326
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:34,240
Hungarian

3327
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,264
Territory then

3328
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:41,664
And the weapons created by Krupp and skoda start selling these Sports and they start going down and start going down

3329
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:44,736
Now

3330
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:48,320
Both of you have listened to many of my shows no I'm not a huge John Keegan fan

3331
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,112
But as a historian I think

3332
02:38:50,624 --> 02:38:53,696
He's best on his World War 1 and World War 2 history

3333
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,256
And he wrote about this guns arrival

3334
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:57,024
Outside the fort

3335
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:57,792
I said quote

3336
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:03,168
After it was emplaced the bombardment began

3337
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,984
The crew wearing head padding

3338
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,008
Lay prone

3339
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:10,336
300 yards away while the gun was fired electronically

3340
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:11,872
Quoting somebody

3341
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:12,896
To see now quote

3342
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:18,784
60 seconds ticked by the time needed for the shelter Traverse its 4000m trajectory

3343
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:22,880
And everyone listened into the telephone report of our battery Commander

3344
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:29,280
Who had his observation post 1500 M from the bombardment fort and could watch it close range

3345
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:30,304
Column of smoke

3346
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,120
Earth and fire that climbed into the heavens

3347
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:34,912
She continues quote

3348
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,448
The first of the shells

3349
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:41,056
Delay fuse to explode only after penetration of the 4th protective skin

3350
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:41,824
Fell short

3351
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,616
6 minutes later

3352
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:44,896
The next was fired

3353
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:51,040
Then five more each of them walked up towards the target as the elevation was corrected

3354
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:54,880
The Relentless approaching football of the detonations

3355
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:58,976
The paralyzed Defenders of the devastation to come

3356
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:00,000
B8

3357
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,024
Struck home

3358
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:03,328
Then the guns fell silent for the night

3359
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:07,936
But the next morning joined by the other which is completed the journey from Essen

3360
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:09,728
The bombardment reopened

3361
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:13,824
The range have been found and soon the 2000 pound shells were quote

3362
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:16,128
Stripping away armor plate

3363
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:17,920
And blocks of concrete

3364
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,456
Cracking arches

3365
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:22,784
Sun poisoning the air with heavy brown fumes

3366
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:24,576
And quote and

3367
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:27,136
Keegan then goes on to say

3368
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:30,976
And I'm not going to murder the poor French names of these boards but at 12:30

3369
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:35,840
1 Ford is a recce says and is physically incapacitated in surrenders

3370
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:38,912
They've been shipped fire to another fordwich surrenders

3371
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:40,192
5 hours later

3372
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,728
1/3

3373
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:48,128
Explode when it's magazine is hit by one of these shells completely destroying the whole thing that will happen to a cup

3374
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:53,760
Couple of these forts by the way and when they find those the Germans were first on the scene say

3375
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:55,296
But they look like quote

3376
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,856
A miniature Alpine landscape

3377
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:01,952
With debris strewn about like pebbles in a mountain stream

3378
02:41:02,208 --> 02:41:05,024
Heavy artillery and ammunition have been thrown everywhere

3379
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:07,584
A Cuba Le have been blown from its place

3380
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:12,704
And it falling on its Dome and it now looks like a monster is tortoise lying on its shell

3381
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:15,520
SD Sports began to

3382
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,288
The fall

3383
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:20,384
The artillery then closed in on the four that had the general commanding

3384
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:21,920
This whole affair

3385
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:23,712
And he himself

3386
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:26,528
What what it was like to be under Fire

3387
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:29,856
Buy weapons that no one had ever seen the like of it

3388
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:30,624
Human history

3389
02:41:31,136 --> 02:41:31,648
Quote

3390
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:36,000
A shell wreck to the arcade under which the general staff were Sheltering

3391
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:42,400
All light was extinguished by the force of the explosion and the officers ran the risk of asphyxiation by the horrible

3392
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:43,936
Gas is emitted from the shell

3393
02:41:44,448 --> 02:41:45,728
When the firing ceased

3394
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:49,312
I ventured out on a tour of inspection on the external slopes

3395
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:51,360
Which I found it been reduced to Rubble

3396
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:53,152
A few minutes later

3397
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:53,920
He writes

3398
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:55,968
The bombardment was resume

3399
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:59,552
It seemed as though all the German batteries were firing Salvo

3400
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:03,648
Nobody will ever be able to form an adequate idea of what the reality

3401
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:05,696
I've only learned since

3402
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:11,840
They win the big Siege Motors entered into the action they hurled against us shells weighing 1000 kilos

3403
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:15,424
The explosive force of which surpassed anything known hitherto

3404
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,216
Their approach was to be heard

3405
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:18,752
In an acute buzzing

3406
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:23,872
And then they burst with a thunderous Roar raising clouds of missiles stones and dust

3407
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:29,504
After some time passed amid these Horrors I wish to return to my observation tower

3408
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:33,600
But I'd hardly Advanced a few feet into the gallery when a great blast

3409
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:36,416
Passed by and I was thrown violently to the ground

3410
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:37,952
I managed to get up

3411
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:39,488
And continued on my way

3412
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:45,888
Only to be stopped by a choking cloud of poisonous gas he was a mixture of the gas from an explosion and the smoke of a

3413
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:47,168
Fire in the troops quarters

3414
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:48,448
We were driven back

3415
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,728
Have suffocated

3416
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:53,824
Looking out of a peephole I saw to my horror that the fort had fallen

3417
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:57,152
Slopes encounter slopes being a chaos of rubbish

3418
02:42:57,408 --> 02:43:01,760
About huge tongues of flame we're shooting forth from the throat of the Fortress

3419
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:04,064
My first and last thought he writes

3420
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,112
What's the try to save the remnant of the Garrison

3421
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:11,488
I rushed out to give orders that's awesome soldiers whom I mistook for Belgian gendarme

3422
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,792
I called them and then fell again

3423
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:17,120
Poisonous gases seem to grip my throat is in a vice

3424
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:18,400
And quote

3425
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:23,776
He woke up to one of his aides and the German officer giving him water

3426
02:43:24,544 --> 02:43:25,056
Those

3427
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:26,336
Soldiers he thought

3428
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:28,384
Or Belgian were German

3429
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,920
They were the first to enter the 4th

3430
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,968
After a shell detonated

3431
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:34,528
In the magazine in the entire fort

3432
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:36,320
The chine explosion

3433
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,624
These are enormous

3434
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
Metal

3435
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:41,184
Seal

3436
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:42,720
Concrete

3437
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:44,512
1/4

3438
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:46,560
These guns were pulverized

3439
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:49,888
Forts that were built to withstand

3440
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:53,472
The Guns of just a generation before and doing so with

3441
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:56,544
That's a demonstration

3442
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:58,592
How much things have changed

3443
02:43:59,104 --> 02:44:00,640
Just since the 1880s

3444
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:04,480
And think of how much things have changed from Napoleon's time to the 8th

3445
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,320
This was a nineteenth-century world

3446
02:44:08,832 --> 02:44:09,600
Discovering the

3447
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:10,368
Horrors

3448
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:11,904
20th century Warfare

3449
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:13,440
And they were going to have

3450
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:14,464
How to learn

3451
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:16,512
How to deal with this new reality

3452
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:17,792
1

3453
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:18,560
Horrific

3454
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:20,096
Bloody lesson at a time

3455
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,400
The lesson of liege

3456
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,936
Is it the arrow

3457
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:24,960
Of

3458
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:26,752
Debasing your defenses

3459
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:27,776
1/4

3460
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:28,800
Is over

3461
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:32,128
This is a lesson

3462
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,712
That will not be learned and will be taught again

3463
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:36,736
In France

3464
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:38,016
In May

3465
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:39,296
1940

3466
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:42,368
It's also my opinion

3467
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:45,440
That the Germans are being taught a lesson

3468
02:44:45,696 --> 02:44:49,280
Even as the story's going down in the guns are pulverizing

3469
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:50,304
The fortune Belgium

3470
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:53,120
The German should be picking up on what

3471
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:55,680
Current events are trying to teach them

3472
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:57,472
They will never

3473
02:44:59,008 --> 02:44:59,520
And they will repay

3474
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:00,544
Repeat these mistakes

3475
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:02,848
They're making in Belgium again

3476
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:03,872
In the second

3477
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,688
It's safe to say I

3478
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:09,248
Damage Done to

3479
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:11,040
Did the German reputation

3480
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:11,808
Global

3481
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:14,112
Because of what's going on in Belgium

3482
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:18,976
Won't go away till at least the 1950s and I think you could make a very deep

3483
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:23,328
And it involves

3484
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:25,632
German treatment of neutral country

3485
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:28,192
And non-combatants

3486
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:28,960
Wherever they

3487
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:33,312
And you know I should watch this story unfold

3488
02:45:34,592 --> 02:45:35,872
It's clear that

3489
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:38,688
In some respect the Germans just don't get it

3490
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:43,552
And you would think they would this is a country that and it's funny now they've lost its reputation

3491
02:45:44,064 --> 02:45:44,576
The two world

3492
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:45,856
Are involved in both

3493
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:48,672
But they used to be considered an absolute

3494
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:49,440
Hot day

3495
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:50,976
Of human culture

3496
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:53,536
The Cutting Edge

3497
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:54,304
Art

3498
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,328
And science

3499
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:56,864
And literature and

3500
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:57,632
Thought

3501
02:45:57,888 --> 02:46:01,216
Philosophy I mean all these things that the Germans really private

3502
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:02,496
Music

3503
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:05,055
Incredible people that

3504
02:46:05,567 --> 02:46:07,871
Guys like HG Wells were intimidated

3505
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:10,687
I couldn't help admire them but was intimidated by how

3506
02:46:11,199 --> 02:46:11,967
How ahead of

3507
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:15,295
Things they seem to be Asian to be in all these areas

3508
02:46:15,807 --> 02:46:16,319
How

3509
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:17,599
Strangely ironic

3510
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:20,415
People that are so advanced in those areas

3511
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:26,047
Could have so many blind spots in areas that one would think are related to the higher cultural

3512
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:27,839
Do the people

3513
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:30,655
For producing such cutting-edge hire culture

3514
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,191
How did they miss

3515
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:35,519
Something that's likely to be as damaging

3516
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:37,311
To your International reputation

3517
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:41,151
Asthma history now calls the rape of Belgium

3518
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:45,247
The rape of Belgium I should point out a little bit

3519
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:47,807
Is a propagandist

3520
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:48,575
Fantasy

3521
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:49,855
I mean it made it into crack

3522
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:51,135
Give me a movie the rape of

3523
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:51,903
Belgium

3524
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:54,207
Go see the Rape of Nanking

3525
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:56,511
Your history books and then you will see something

3526
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:57,791
The propagandists

3527
02:46:58,047 --> 02:46:59,839
Did not need to magnify at all

3528
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:03,679
To create a world-class historical

3529
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:06,239
Atrocity killing fish

3530
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:08,543
Belgium want that

3531
02:47:09,823 --> 02:47:10,591
But it was something

3532
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,639
And that something would

3533
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:16,223
Would come back to haunt the Germans in ways that they almost seem ignorant

3534
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:18,271
Begin recording Hitler earlier

3535
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:19,039
Propaganda

3536
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:21,087
Hitler sees it after the war

3537
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:22,623
Did the Germans were just

3538
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:23,647
Blind Side

3539
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:25,183
Buy 20th century

3540
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:30,047
Global Communications in the ability to manipulate World opinion

3541
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:32,863
By taking things that were real facts

3542
02:47:33,631 --> 02:47:35,935
And blowing them up two levels that just

3543
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:39,519
Incensed whole society including neutral countries

3544
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:44,383
The Germans don't understand that the way they are conducting themselves in Belgium

3545
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:46,943
Is affecting public opinion

3546
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:48,735
In places like the United States

3547
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:52,831
Which have large German American populations by the way with your cheering

3548
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:59,231
You know the the Feats of arms and how the German military shown themselves to be so dominant American papers are not 100%

3549
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:03,327
Against the Germans at this point in some places American papers are in regions that are

3550
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:05,119
Dominated by German American

3551
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:07,423
They can't explain away what

3552
02:48:07,679 --> 02:48:08,191
Happening

3553
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:09,215
In Belgium

3554
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:13,311
And what starts the day the invasion of Belgium happen

3555
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:16,895
German start killing Belgian citizen

3556
02:48:18,431 --> 02:48:19,455
When they do so

3557
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,551
As part of what is now understood to be

3558
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:24,575
A

3559
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:26,111
Policy of frightful

3560
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:27,903
I'm not sure that's the

3561
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:29,183
Perfect translation

3562
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:29,951
Another term

3563
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:32,511
But the Germans intended to

3564
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:33,791
Instead example

3565
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:34,815
Of people

3566
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:37,631
The did things that the Germans have said you shouldn't do

3567
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:41,983
They said you shouldn't blow up Bridges if they find you blowing up Bridges

3568
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:45,311
They're going to punish you and I do not give probation

3569
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:50,431
They will hang you they will shoot you if they catch you trying to blow up a bridge

3570
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,223
The Germans take that

3571
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:53,759
Even farther though

3572
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:56,831
If you're near a village where a bridge gets blown up

3573
02:48:57,599 --> 02:49:00,927
The Village might pay the price the Germans believed in Collective punishment

3574
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:04,511
They also believed in taking hostages for good behavior

3575
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:07,839
And when people did stopped anyway they kill the hostages

3576
02:49:09,887 --> 02:49:11,423
This has been one of the most

3577
02:49:11,935 --> 02:49:12,959
Contentious

3578
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:13,727
Hearts of

3579
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:17,567
You know new scholarship all the time on the question of

3580
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:19,103
Atrocities in Belgium

3581
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:20,127
Because

3582
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:22,687
You know during the war it is this huge

3583
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:25,759
And those of you by the way you've lived long enough to have seen

3584
02:49:26,015 --> 02:49:27,807
The same Dynamic at work wear

3585
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:31,391
Real atrocities happened I remember the first Gulf War the stories of

3586
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:37,023
You Know It Rocky soldiers taking Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and throwing them on the floor then stealing the incubator

3587
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:43,423
All these stories are normal because real atrocities are going on but then they're magnified because the man

3588
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:48,031
Magnification Works to the benefit of the enemies of the people the propagandas working against

3589
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:50,335
The Germans went in and did a bunch of things

3590
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,639
In Belgium that make him look bad

3591
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:58,783
Because they were bad and then the foreign media like the British were fantastic at this get ahold of those stories

3592
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:02,623
And turn them into the worst things you can ever think of

3593
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:05,439
The Germans

3594
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:07,487
Only began to get this

3595
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:11,583
You know a few people at a time I mean later on much later on

3596
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:13,631
Dekeyser son at gyno NASDAQ

3597
02:50:13,887 --> 02:50:14,399
Crown Prince

3598
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:17,471
Would say that Belgium is when the Germans

3599
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,239
Lost

3600
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:20,287
First great battle of the war

3601
02:50:21,055 --> 02:50:21,823
But they didn't

3602
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:22,847
Lose it

3603
02:50:23,103 --> 02:50:25,151
On the battlefield they crushed the Belgian

3604
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:26,687
They lost it

3605
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:28,223
In the realm of global

3606
02:50:28,735 --> 02:50:29,247
Pinyin

3607
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:31,039
Because of their behavior

3608
02:50:31,551 --> 02:50:36,159
Behavior that the Germans will use all throughout this war and again in the Second World War

3609
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:39,743
This tendency to ignore neutral

3610
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:41,535
As we said earlier

3611
02:50:42,047 --> 02:50:43,071
The German diplomat

3612
02:50:43,327 --> 02:50:45,887
You told you going to go to war over

3613
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:49,471
Piece of paper neutrality is often violated in war

3614
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:51,263
That's kind of how they thought

3615
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:53,823
They also thought

3616
02:50:54,591 --> 02:50:55,615
You treat non-combat

3617
02:50:56,383 --> 02:50:56,895
Harshly

3618
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:01,759
Soften that a little it's worth noting that

3619
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:04,063
The Germans treat their own people this

3620
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:06,111
They are a Stern

3621
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:07,135
Rather strict

3622
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:10,207
Some would say severe Society especially

3623
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:12,255
You know depression has elements of it

3624
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:15,071
And they expect in obedience and discipline

3625
02:51:15,327 --> 02:51:20,703
Conformity to the rules and that's what they expected their own people and then they go into Belgium and when people violate the rules

3626
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:22,239
They get treated harshly

3627
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:26,335
Your message has failed to foresee maybe with cultural blinders

3628
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:28,639
The people that come from much less

3629
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:30,431
Severe traditions

3630
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:31,711
Would maybe

3631
02:51:31,967 --> 02:51:32,479
In a play

3632
02:51:32,735 --> 02:51:33,759
That quality up

3633
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:36,063
As something uniquely German

3634
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:36,831
And nasty

3635
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:41,951
Not just that it should be pointed out that a lot of different people

3636
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:46,303
You know in the world at this time we're having problems dealing with your regular fighting

3637
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:47,583
This was a big deal at the time

3638
02:51:47,839 --> 02:51:48,607
Irregular fighting

3639
02:51:48,863 --> 02:51:49,375
Of course is when

3640
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:53,727
In a regular people take up arms and start shooting at your soldier like gorillas

3641
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,799
Vietnam the US fought

3642
02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:58,079
Viet Cong Guerrilla

3643
02:51:58,335 --> 02:51:58,847
Very difficult

3644
02:51:59,871 --> 02:52:01,663
Causes all kinds of props atrocity

3645
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:02,431
Tend to happen

3646
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:08,319
Are the British and just dealt with this not altogether successfully in South Africa were at Ross

3647
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:09,343
Issues happened

3648
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:15,999
French were dealing with it in Asia North Africa the Russians were dealing with in Central Asia the Japanese were dealing with in China and

3649
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:16,767
Korea

3650
02:52:17,535 --> 02:52:19,583
This is a problem a lot of countries were having

3651
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:23,167
The Germans were very worried about what we're called free shooters

3652
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,703
Today we would call them snipers

3653
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:27,775
Because in the war of 1870 they had a lot of Prague

3654
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:30,079
Who's winning the Belgium

3655
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,103
Any place

3656
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:34,943
Thought snipers were there people paid the price left right and Center

3657
02:52:35,199 --> 02:52:36,735
The Whole Town's would be

3658
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:38,527
Executed if a sniper was

3659
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:40,319
And here's the worst part

3660
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:44,671
Snipers may not have even been loose some historians say these are a bunch of

3661
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:47,231
Gun-shy soldiers who've never faced

3662
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:49,023
You live fire

3663
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:50,815
Where someone was shooting at them

3664
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:55,935
They may hear some German soldiers gun go off from the other side of town and start killing civilians

3665
02:52:56,191 --> 02:52:57,983
It's a very controversial issue

3666
02:52:59,007 --> 02:53:00,031
Some historians

3667
02:53:00,543 --> 02:53:03,871
Still foam at the mouth about a John Keegan strikes me as somebody who's

3668
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:06,431
Who feels this absolute need to defend this idea

3669
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:07,455
German

3670
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:08,479
You know

3671
02:53:08,735 --> 02:53:09,503
Demolitionist

3672
02:53:11,295 --> 02:53:12,063
I have a couple of

3673
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:15,135
Pieces I like the author Lynn McDonald

3674
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:17,951
Wrote about this I thought you did a very balanced job

3675
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:20,255
And so did Niall Ferguson and Ferguson

3676
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:25,887
What I love about Ferguson says that he goes and finds like the original thing that happened and then how it got blown out

3677
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:26,655
Portion

3678
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:27,935
But nonetheless

3679
02:53:28,191 --> 02:53:30,239
All these people emphasize the same thing

3680
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:31,519
Visa process

3681
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:33,567
Japanese people died the German

3682
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:35,103
Practice Collective punishment

3683
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:36,895
And all these awful things that most

3684
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:37,919
Most of us

3685
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,455
Revival today

3686
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:44,063
And then they paid an extra price for it by providing the basic seeds

3687
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:49,439
It would grow into enemy propaganda that would turn the Germans into jangus Khan basic

3688
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:51,999
Which is exactly what Lynn McDonald's

3689
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:53,535
Compared to when she writes quote

3690
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:57,887
In the United Kingdom Germany zahner had already been tried

3691
02:53:58,143 --> 02:53:59,167
And found guilty

3692
02:53:59,423 --> 02:54:00,959
Germany's name was mud

3693
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:07,359
And now that she had condemned herself out of her own mouth no rumor of beastial outrage was too vile to be blue

3694
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:10,431
They emanated mainly from the refugees

3695
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:12,991
Who would flood have terrified out of their wits

3696
02:54:13,247 --> 02:54:15,039
From the towns and Villages of Belgium

3697
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:17,855
They were the first hand accounts from people who had escaped

3698
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:20,671
From the Flames of and then we're two hundred hostages

3699
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:24,511
Gunshot wounds where 400 were gunned down in Bayonetta 2

3700
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:26,559
And from the inhabitants of did not

3701
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:30,399
Who would arouse the ire of the Germans by destroying the vital Bridge

3702
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:36,543
The Germans Revenge was to round up more than 600 men women and children and shoot them In Cold Blood

3703
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:38,079
The youngest age

3704
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:40,127
Three weeks died in his mother's arms

3705
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:46,783
These stories were true and the Germans made no attempt to keep them secret they were after all intended to war

3706
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:50,879
Inevitably as they traveled they spawned fictions in their way

3707
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:51,903
Of rape

3708
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,183
McCobb chilling

3709
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:54,207
Mutilation

3710
02:54:54,463 --> 02:54:57,535
Abreast in hands sliced off by Sabres

3711
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,071
Crucifixion

3712
02:54:59,327 --> 02:55:04,447
A baby's dipped into boiling water or Swan for sport against brick walls

3713
02:55:04,959 --> 02:55:07,007
There were even Whispers of cannibalism

3714
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:11,103
Springs of Truth swelled and grew into a crop of rumors

3715
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:17,503
How about a speakable billineys unsurpassed since the hordes of djingis Khan had rampaged and pillaged across

3716
02:55:17,759 --> 02:55:18,271
Asia

3717
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:20,831
In France and Britain the newspapers were full of

3718
02:55:21,343 --> 02:55:22,623
Public opinion Hardin

3719
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:25,695
It was no longer merely a just War

3720
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:29,279
It was positively righteous and people were out for blood

3721
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:31,071
And quote

3722
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:34,143
I don't think the Germans have recovered from that image

3723
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:35,679
Even now have they

3724
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,215
You talk about

3725
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:38,495
A mist

3726
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:41,055
What is the Germans had treated

3727
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:42,591
Neutral countries

3728
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:45,151
And non-combatants with more respect

3729
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:47,967
How different might their reputation be today

3730
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:52,575
What if they learn from Belgium in 1914 in reacted differently

3731
02:55:52,831 --> 02:55:54,111
In 1939

3732
02:55:55,391 --> 02:56:01,535
One thing's for sure this whole idea of frightfulness in order to cow you know the people that you had just subjected to

3733
02:56:01,791 --> 02:56:03,583
To the boots of your soldier taking workout

3734
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:05,119
Bad policy

3735
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:07,679
Foundations

3736
02:56:07,935 --> 02:56:09,727
And the underpinnings of that idea

3737
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:13,055
You just didn't work in the people in charge it we're guys like fun Monica

3738
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:14,079
Who said

3739
02:56:14,335 --> 02:56:16,127
Into his Austrian counterpart

3740
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:19,199
Yeah you know it's brutal are advancing to Belgium's brutal

3741
02:56:19,455 --> 02:56:22,783
But what are you going to do you know we're fighting to save our lives basic

3742
02:56:23,039 --> 02:56:24,063
This is life-or-death

3743
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:27,391
Going to be a little brutal for a while and guys like fun molta

3744
02:56:27,647 --> 02:56:30,463
He was one of these logical Insanity Guys somebody asked him once

3745
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:34,559
What the most humane way to carry out War

3746
02:56:35,327 --> 02:56:36,607
And he famously said

3747
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:37,631
Make it quick

3748
02:56:38,143 --> 02:56:42,495
Brutal as you want make it quick it's a robotic analogy Von moltke was basically saying knock them out

3749
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:49,151
Quick Knockouts that the nicest you can be even if it's horribly brutal to make The Knockout as quick as it is

3750
02:56:49,407 --> 02:56:51,967
Sabon milk in this case is basically saying yeah.

3751
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:54,015
It's terrible but

3752
02:56:54,271 --> 02:56:56,063
And in the end this is going to save lives

3753
02:56:57,343 --> 02:57:01,439
Can I use you hang a few of these saboteurs you shoot a few of these people that

3754
02:57:01,695 --> 02:57:05,791
Snipe at your troops and then they stopped doing it you don't have to burn whole Villages down see how that works

3755
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:09,375
Niall Ferguson when he addresses the

3756
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:10,143
This issue

3757
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:11,679
Is basically sword

3758
02:57:12,191 --> 02:57:13,727
Telling us to not be so naive

3759
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:20,639
We've all lived through and where the 21st century now we had a long time to absorb the ideas of 20th Cent

3760
02:57:20,895 --> 02:57:24,991
Century propaganda and how it's a legitimate aspect of warm one of the things you do

3761
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:28,063
Is perhaps paint your adversary in the worst possible

3762
02:57:28,575 --> 02:57:29,087
You can again

3763
02:57:29,343 --> 02:57:30,623
Something that the Germans weren't

3764
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:34,207
White getting when the 20th century was brand new

3765
02:57:34,463 --> 02:57:35,999
Did they would get much better in the second one

3766
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:39,583
Ferguson and his book tells a story

3767
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:41,119
Where he talks about

3768
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:46,495
You know the ways in which this propaganda were used when he talks about how the British newspapers

3769
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:51,359
Would take photos sometimes from stories and had nothing to do with this war in one case

3770
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,383
Stories

3771
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:55,455
With the head photos from Russian pogroms against Jews

3772
02:57:55,711 --> 02:57:58,271
What happened before the war and then just

3773
02:57:58,527 --> 02:58:01,343
You know captioning the photo with something

3774
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:07,487
Says it's from this warm and no one had any idea show a bunch of dead civilians and say this is what the Germans are doing

3775
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:09,023
Ferguson riots quote

3776
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:14,655
But pre-war photographs of Russian pogroms genuinely were reprinted to

3777
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:15,423
In quotes

3778
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:16,447
Illustrate

3779
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:19,007
Stories of German behavior in Belgium

3780
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:22,079
The Sunday Chronicle he writes was one of many British paper

3781
02:58:22,591 --> 02:58:23,103
With your leg

3782
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:28,735
But the Germans had cut off the hands of Belgian children while the former scaremonger William liqueur

3783
02:58:28,991 --> 02:58:35,135
Related with eldest guys relish the quote wild orgies in Blood and debauchery and

3784
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:37,951
Quote in which the Germans allegedly indulge

3785
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:39,231
Including the quote

3786
02:58:39,487 --> 02:58:42,559
Ruthless violation in killing of defenseless women

3787
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:45,631
Girls and children of tender age and quote

3788
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:47,679
Ferguson continued quote

3789
02:58:47,935 --> 02:58:53,055
Other writers had great fun imagining 16 year old girls being quote forced to drink

3790
02:58:53,311 --> 02:58:59,455
And quote and then quote violated successively and quote on the lawn before having their breasts

3791
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:00,991
Quote pierced with bayonet

3792
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:01,759
And quote

3793
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:05,599
The Bayonetta baby Ferguson says was another favorite image

3794
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:08,671
J h Morgan even threw in the charge of

3795
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:11,487
Quote sodomy of little children and quote

3796
02:59:11,999 --> 02:59:14,815
But even Ferguson is forced to deal with the reality

3797
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:15,839
The situation

3798
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:19,423
That this stuff wasn't manufactured out of whole cloth

3799
02:59:19,679 --> 02:59:21,215
And it being a Belgium

3800
02:59:21,471 --> 02:59:25,567
In the in a line of German Advance during this time.

3801
02:59:25,823 --> 02:59:30,687
What's a very dangerous position to perhaps find yourself in and perhaps of no fault of your own

3802
02:59:31,455 --> 02:59:32,223
Ferguson riots quote

3803
02:59:34,015 --> 02:59:40,159
All the on Tom's press wildly exaggerated what went on in Belgium there is no question that the German army

3804
02:59:40,415 --> 02:59:43,487
Did commit atrocities there in 1914

3805
02:59:43,743 --> 02:59:47,583
According to evidence from the Diaries of German soldiers and other reliable sources

3806
02:59:47,839 --> 02:59:50,655
All the advancing German armies executed civilian

3807
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:52,703
Including women and priest

3808
02:59:53,215 --> 02:59:59,359
Altogether about 5,500 Belgian civilians were deliberately killed by the German Army most of them in the leg

3809
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:05,503
11 Day. From the 18th to the 28th of August 1914 and at least another five hundred in France

3810
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:09,087
The Germans also use civilians as human Shields

3811
03:00:09,343 --> 03:00:11,391
And raised numerous villages to the ground

3812
03:00:11,647 --> 03:00:14,463
In one case an 18 year old girl was Bayonetta 2 death

3813
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:17,535
There were also numerous rapes in occupied France

3814
03:00:18,047 --> 03:00:18,559
And

3815
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:20,607
John Keegan

3816
03:00:20,863 --> 03:00:21,631
Who obviously

3817
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:22,911
Feels very strongly about

3818
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:25,215
About this goes out of his way to point out

3819
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:27,007
That these are not

3820
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:28,031
Minnesota

3821
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:29,567
Ramshackle affairs

3822
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:32,895
That these involve lots of troops sometimes that these

3823
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:38,271
Executioner not done by special execution squads as will be the case in the second world war sometimes

3824
03:00:38,527 --> 03:00:41,087
But by regular units of the German Army he writes quote

3825
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:46,463
The victims included children and women as well as men and the killings were systemic

3826
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:53,119
Etta means the hostages were masked in the Square shut down by execution Squad and survivors bayonet

3827
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:55,167
The execution squads were not

3828
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:57,727
As worthy action groups of Hitler's Holocaust

3829
03:00:57,983 --> 03:01:01,311
Specially recruited Killers but ordinary German soldiers

3830
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:07,455
Indeed those who murdered at and then we're the reservists of the most distinguished regiments of the Prussian Army

3831
03:01:07,711 --> 03:01:09,247
The guard regiment resume.

3832
03:01:09,759 --> 03:01:10,271
And quote

3833
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:13,343
And the belgians would have

3834
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:15,647
Every right you would think

3835
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:18,719
When you to wonder as their living through this

3836
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:19,999
Weather protectors

3837
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:22,815
And they signed these agreements

3838
03:01:23,071 --> 03:01:23,583
It said

3839
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:28,191
That their independence was guaranteed by the greatest powers of the age where are those people right now

3840
03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:33,567
Now when the belgians need them all days to hear the German Army marching through and burning things and perhaps shooting people you know

3841
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:36,639
The answer is there on the way

3842
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:37,919
The British

3843
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:42,015
Are in the process right as we are in the story Landing troops on the continent

3844
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:43,295
To Aid

3845
03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:44,575
The French War

3846
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:46,111
Finishing the last

3847
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:49,439
Bits of the necessary ingredients so they can launch an offensive

3848
03:01:49,951 --> 03:01:54,047
The Russians are shocking Everybody by putting together enough units to at least

3849
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:54,815
Attack

3850
03:01:55,071 --> 03:01:57,119
Eastern Germany and remind the German that you

3851
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:59,679
Eastern border undefended

3852
03:01:59,935 --> 03:02:00,703
Everything again

3853
03:02:01,471 --> 03:02:02,239
We're still here

3854
03:02:03,775 --> 03:02:05,055
And the austro-hungarian

3855
03:02:05,567 --> 03:02:06,847
Are about to find out

3856
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:09,407
Exactly why the serbs have such a

3857
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:11,455
Ferocious military reputation

3858
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:12,991
All this is going to happen

3859
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:15,039
Pretty much simultaneously

3860
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:17,343
And it's going to be the first

3861
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,367
Real

3862
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:20,159
Consequential experiment

3863
03:02:20,671 --> 03:02:25,279
To test a hypothesis a sort of celestial if you want or Cosmic hypothesis

3864
03:02:25,791 --> 03:02:27,839
Concerning the question of whether or not

3865
03:02:28,607 --> 03:02:29,375
And if you do it in

3866
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:31,679
You can beat the violin

3867
03:02:32,447 --> 03:02:32,959
Out of a

3868
03:02:33,471 --> 03:02:34,239
Society

3869
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:35,775
Culture

3870
03:02:37,055 --> 03:02:37,567
People work

3871
03:02:38,335 --> 03:02:38,847
Given the

3872
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:40,127
Globalization

3873
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:41,663
And at this time.

3874
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,199
Alsace-lorraine maybe world

3875
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:46,271
And the answer is

3876
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:49,343
But it depends on how hard you beat them

3877
03:02:51,135 --> 03:02:53,183
No one's been beating very hard yet in this

3878
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:54,719
Story The belgians are

3879
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:55,999
But an appetizer

3880
03:02:56,511 --> 03:02:58,047
What modern warfare is going to be like

3881
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:00,351
Modern Warfare between the Great

3882
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:01,375
Hours on the planet

3883
03:03:01,631 --> 03:03:03,167
At the first experiment in this

3884
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,983
Hypothesis of beating the violence out of societies

3885
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:07,519
Is on the way

3886
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:10,591
If war is an addiction to the human species

3887
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:13,663
What's about to happen is the first

3888
03:03:13,919 --> 03:03:14,431
Dos

3889
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:15,455
Of shock therapy

3890
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:17,247
To see if we can beat

3891
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:24,927

With the most

3902
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,535
I think that's

3903
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:03,839
The phrase that made me cringe

3904
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:07,167
During the editing process listening to the show you just heard

3905
03:04:07,935 --> 03:04:09,215
Because I could almost here

3906
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:14,079
510 15001 how many average Civil War box American Civil War box we have listening

3907
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:19,455
But that's going to be a sore point with them and I can tell when I listen to a during everything I'm just going to do I really want

3908
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:20,223
All those emails

3909
03:04:20,991 --> 03:04:22,271
I didn't attribute that quote

3910
03:04:22,527 --> 03:04:23,039
2NE1

3911
03:04:23,295 --> 03:04:25,855
I just sent a Confederate Cavalry commander but it was

3912
03:04:26,111 --> 03:04:29,695
Supposedly allegedly legendarily said by a guy named Nathan bed

3913
03:04:30,975 --> 03:04:35,839
A controversial figure even today but that's not unusual among Confederate generals and it's not

3914
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:37,631
Even unheard of among

3915
03:04:37,887 --> 03:04:39,167
Union Northern Jet

3916
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:42,495
Forces may be in a Class by Himself

3917
03:04:43,007 --> 03:04:49,151
But he's not controversial when it comes to acknowledging his military genius he's one of the best American Jenner

3918
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:50,431
Emerald in this hole.

3919
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:53,247
In US history and he's an Innovative Calvary

3920
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:56,575
He knows and is already absorbed the lesson

3921
03:04:57,087 --> 03:05:02,207
The most European Cavalry commanders even in the first world war when it breaks out that they haven't

3922
03:05:03,487 --> 03:05:07,839
Forest realizes that you can't use Cavalry the way it's traditionally been used

3923
03:05:08,095 --> 03:05:09,631
In a through its entire history

3924
03:05:09,887 --> 03:05:10,911
Free up until that point it's just

3925
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:13,215
Do vulnerable now the weapons have destroyed

3926
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:15,263
A lot of what Cavalry could do

3927
03:05:15,519 --> 03:05:16,031
The forest

3928
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:17,567
Strip down

3929
03:05:17,823 --> 03:05:21,919
The job of Cavalry to the bare minimum what is it do that nothing else can do and

3930
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:22,943
Moves people

3931
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:24,735
Faster than anything else can do

3932
03:05:24,991 --> 03:05:25,759
So we used it for that

3933
03:05:27,039 --> 03:05:28,319
Essentially had an elite

3934
03:05:28,575 --> 03:05:30,111
Unit of mounted Infantry

3935
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:34,463
And he would transport these people to vulnerable and important spots

3936
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:36,255
Tactically important areas

3937
03:05:36,511 --> 03:05:38,303
Dismount amusem is infant breathing

3938
03:05:38,559 --> 03:05:41,631
Use horses to skedaddle out of there before Superior Force could

3939
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:42,399
Catch you

3940
03:05:43,679 --> 03:05:47,263
The three modern way to use Cavalry and really the only way

3941
03:05:47,519 --> 03:05:50,335
Did he could survive on a modern battlefield of course the battlefield

3942
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:53,663
Did Nathan Bedford Forrest was trying to keep his Cavalry live on

3943
03:05:53,919 --> 03:05:56,735
Nowhere near as deadly for anyone horses especially

3944
03:05:56,991 --> 03:05:58,271
At the battlefields would be in 9

3945
03:05:58,527 --> 03:05:59,039
1914

3946
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:03,391
Those battlefields are on the way the appetizers over the main course is about to

3947
03:06:03,647 --> 03:06:04,159
Begin

3948
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:06,463
This greatest army in the world

3949
03:06:06,975 --> 03:06:11,583
Is about to run into what is probably the second greatest army in the world

3950
03:06:12,095 --> 03:06:13,375
Frances and

3951
03:06:14,143 --> 03:06:14,655
The

3952
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:17,727
Probably in terms of

3953
03:06:17,983 --> 03:06:19,519
Bang for their buck

3954
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:22,335
Most elite military force

3955
03:06:22,591 --> 03:06:26,943
Furious military force in the world all these Germans marching on France great

3956
03:06:27,199 --> 03:06:30,271
Train troops who never been in combat except against belgians

3957
03:06:30,527 --> 03:06:33,343
They going to run into a British colonial Force that's tiny

3958
03:06:33,855 --> 03:06:34,367
But that has

3959
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:38,463
So much experience that there's almost no room for any more

3960
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:39,999
Unit owners

3961
03:06:40,255 --> 03:06:40,767
Freddy's

3962
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:44,607
Units cuz they fought in so many parts of the world so long and so often

3963
03:06:44,863 --> 03:06:46,911
They're not coming to this war

3964
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:48,447
You have to learn on the job

3965
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:54,079
They've already done this job many times they're going to be the only truly really experienced troops in this convo

3966
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:55,871
Which will make them

3967
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:58,431
To get back to our boxing metaphors

3968
03:06:58,687 --> 03:07:00,223
Able to punch above their weight

3969
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:04,063
They're going to give a lot better than their small numbers

3970
03:07:04,575 --> 03:07:05,855
Probably indicate they would

3971
03:07:06,367 --> 03:07:08,671
But can anything stop this German Steamroller

3972
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:10,463
You know

3973
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:13,023
I've often been asked by people how large

3974
03:07:13,535 --> 03:07:14,815
The army that

3975
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:17,631
Defended Imperial Rome was

3976
03:07:19,423 --> 03:07:20,191
And at its height

3977
03:07:20,959 --> 03:07:24,287
High number you usually see 750000 men

3978
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:28,639
The entire Roman Empire that's not one army with the entire Roman Empire

3979
03:07:28,895 --> 03:07:31,455
Your total number of soldiers throughout the entire

3980
03:07:31,711 --> 03:07:34,271
Borders and interior the places

3981
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:36,319
Maybe 750,000 guys

3982
03:07:37,087 --> 03:07:41,439
750000 guys is also the upper limit number as we said in the show that Napoleon

3983
03:07:41,695 --> 03:07:43,231
May have used in his famous

3984
03:07:43,487 --> 03:07:43,999
And

3985
03:07:44,511 --> 03:07:46,047
Forlorn invasion of Russia

3986
03:07:46,559 --> 03:07:47,071
So that's okay

3987
03:07:47,327 --> 03:07:48,095
Pretty big number

3988
03:07:48,863 --> 03:07:53,215
Just understand what's bearing down on the small British forces landed on the continent

3989
03:07:53,471 --> 03:07:54,495
And this French Force

3990
03:07:54,751 --> 03:07:57,311
Who's waiting to find out what modern warfare is really like

3991
03:07:58,591 --> 03:08:02,175
The low number is 750000 German

3992
03:08:02,687 --> 03:08:04,991
Just simply marching through Belgium

3993
03:08:05,503 --> 03:08:06,527
The high numbers one point

3994
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:07,295
5 mil

3995
03:08:08,063 --> 03:08:10,111
And that doesn't even count the troops facing

3996
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:15,487
The French along the traditional fortified hundred and twenty mile border that's normally The Invasion

3997
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:17,791
You have the equivalent

3998
03:08:18,303 --> 03:08:19,327
Of the entire

3999
03:08:19,583 --> 03:08:20,863
Armed power

4000
03:08:21,375 --> 03:08:22,399
Of the Roman Empire

4001
03:08:22,911 --> 03:08:23,423
Attitude

4002
03:08:23,679 --> 03:08:24,191
Height

4003
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:26,495
Using the Belgian Road system

4004
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:28,799
The fall on Northeastern France

4005
03:08:29,567 --> 03:08:30,591
That's an amazing blog

4006
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:33,407
What happens when

4007
03:08:34,175 --> 03:08:35,967
The irresistible Force

4008
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:38,527
Anna runs into the immovable object

4009
03:08:39,295 --> 03:08:40,831
We'll find out if either one of those

4010
03:08:41,343 --> 03:08:41,855
Title

4011
03:08:42,623 --> 03:08:43,647
Turned out to be true

4012
03:08:44,415 --> 03:08:45,183
Impart to

4013
03:08:45,695 --> 03:08:46,719
A blueprint for Armageddon

4014
03:08:52,095 --> 03:08:53,631
Okay one last note

4015
03:08:54,143 --> 03:08:55,679
Added much later by the way

4016
03:08:56,191 --> 03:08:57,215
To let you know

4017
03:08:57,471 --> 03:09:01,055
Did the program you just heard is not identical to the version we originally

4018
03:09:02,591 --> 03:09:05,919
We did something with this program we've never done before cuz it's crazy hard for

4019
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:06,687
What to do

4020
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:13,087
And went back and actually sacrificed work on the next Hardcore History show to get into this one in and clear up one thing and

4021
03:09:13,343 --> 03:09:13,855
And fix another

4022
03:09:14,111 --> 03:09:16,415
To improve Clarity and accuracy actually

4023
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:17,695
And hopefully

4024
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:22,047
We have a better program out of it new and improved version 2.0 whatever you want to say

4025
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:28,703
I wish I could do that with every program although as has been pointed out to me I'd still be working on show number 1 to get it quite right

4026
03:09:28,959 --> 03:09:29,983
If you folks if they would let me
