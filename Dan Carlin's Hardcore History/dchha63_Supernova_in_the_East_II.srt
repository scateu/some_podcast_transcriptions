A supernova in the east

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
East

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,248
Its history

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,368
It's hardcore history

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Why is Adolf Hitler and the Nazi

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Broadcast

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
News

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
And updates

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
Of what they were doing

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
As part of the final solution while it was going on

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
Why didn't they announce to the world

26
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
Go to the Joseph Goebbels propaganda Ministry

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
We set up these industrial killing facilities but we'll work people to death first

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
If they're strong

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,624
Unexplained listen last month we killed a hundred thousand more these people and we won't stop till they're all gone

30
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Why did they do that

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Why didn't

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Stalin

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Get up there

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
Yelling shake his finger and threatened

35
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,984
The gulags and then explain what the gulag archipelago the whole system was

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Starving to death working to death

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Are they really education campaign

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
All you have to do is leave the country and come back for us to be suspicious enough that you've been corrupted to send you away I mean why did he get

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
Thursday this is what's going to happen to you if you don't stay in line

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
No one admitted it right

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Why didn't the

42
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Khmer Rouge take photographs as they wiped out the intellectual class of Cambodia

43
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Because they thought people with glasses

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Were intellectuals in the intellectuals were

45
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Threat to their

46
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
New world that they were

47
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
We're creating where he was going to go live back on the landing

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
Why are there photos of that go check out

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Killing Fields you know what you'll find

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Artwork

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Why didn't they

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,880
Take photos full color block them up and put them all around the town and send some to the foreign media out

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
What's 2

54
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,048
That's what an Assyrian king would have done back in the Iron Age

55
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
A guy likes inaka rib

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
Going to level a place like Babylon and then he's going to make sure everyone knows about it in detail

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,432
A good historian of that era will point out that a lot of what the Assyrians card

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Into stone

59
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
Including another version of photos right artwork with comment

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Terry and statement by the king

61
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
A lot of that stuff was

62
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
A quart

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Style after

64
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Another words it was

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Whatever one would expect

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
Why you still see Egyptian fashions in the New Kingdom that look

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
You really familiar like

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Egyptian fashion from the Old Kingdom

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
There's a style that becomes the style you use

70
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
But what does it say about you if V style you use

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Is to announce the atrocities that you commit

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
And

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,064
As close as possible replicate them on the walls of your waiting room

74
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
In the embassies

75
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
While people wait to talk to the Assyrian ruler having senaka rib destroyed Babylon and wrote about it here is

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
The scribes record

77
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
The words of Sinatra being

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Again this is a court style also

79
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
What a style

80
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,944
Sennacherib said of his leveling of one of the great cities maybe the greatest city of all time

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
If you started a top 100 list

82
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Babylon

83
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
And he leveled Babylon

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Pain in the six

85
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Hundred

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
BCE by the way

87
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Quote

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,280
Like the oncoming of a storm I broke loose and overwhelmed Like a Hurricane

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
With their corpses I filled the city Square

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
The city and its houses from its foundations to it stop

91
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
I destroyed

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
I devastated I burned with fire

93
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
The wall and outer wall temples and gods

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
Temple towers of brick in earth as many as there were

95
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
I raised and dump them into the garage shoe canal

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Through the midst of that City I dug canals

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,135
I flooded it site with water and the Very foundations thereof I destroy

98
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,719
I made its destruction more complete than that by a flood

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
But in days to come on the side of that City and its temples in its Gods might not be remembered I completely blotted

100
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
Send it out with floods of water and made it like a meadow

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
And quote

102
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
All those later Kings

103
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Probably trying to emulate

104
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Badass of the mall I should Nasser Paul II

105
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
From Del couple centuries before that time

106
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
Turn the Lights you got to appreciate the Assyrians for owning it

107
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
And using it their foreign policy was based on scaring the hell out of

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
People

109
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,327
They want you to rebellon the best way to do that was to punish anyone who did Ravel

110
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Horrible

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
Now that was more the style of the times in the Iron Age though one could see that not play

112
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,895
Find particularly well in the twentieth century but then let's ask why

113
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
If you were to make a list of all the

114
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,623
Genocides in attempted genocides atrocities war crimes and all these things

115
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Fall broadly under that heading and involve enough people

116
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
How to make a list

117
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Of the 20th and 21st centuries

118
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
How many of the

119
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Let's just call them

120
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Accused perpetrators of these acts

121
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Admit to it

122
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Own it

123
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
And if they do how many of them do so in an unqualified way because sometimes the evidence

124
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Just so overwhelming

125
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
But even in denial is can't

126
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Figure out how to wiggle out of

127
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Of the facts

128
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
So they start rational

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Say what the numbers are inflated

130
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
Or there's mitigating circumstance

131
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Does or what have you

132
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
And here's what makes life so complicated

133
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Sometimes they're right

134
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:34,751
If you look at the history of the twentieth century you will know that we start off relatively quickly with

135
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Some of them were

136
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Famous

137
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,431
Genocides are attempted genocide or alleged attempted genocide in history and we keep going from there

138
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
We have spent

139
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
More than a hundred years now is a global Society trying to

140
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
Codify rules and laws and courts of adjudication and systems in organizations

141
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
To help

142
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Create

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Rules about

144
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Atrocities in war and genocide in killings

145
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Crimes against humanity

146
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
You could create a timeline

147
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
Good start you start before the Hague convention some things like that but

148
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,711
What you go all the way through you know V the League of Nations creation you can get to the

149
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
United Nations creation you can get to the

150
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,135
Nuremberg and Tokyo trials there's there's all these sorts of things and now we have this

151
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Xtensive body and many of these Global organizations created

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,863
In large part in reaction to horrible atrocities and genocides in things that must never happen again

153
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
And yet let me ask you what you think would happen

154
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
If it happened again

155
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Indeed

156
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
Spent an enormous amount of time and human effort on a fantastic cause right

157
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,967
Let's never have a final solution for example happen again

158
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
What happened tomorrow

159
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Of course if this is going to be some sort of analogy

160
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
We have to imagine it happens

161
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Powerful state

162
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Cabins in Albania

163
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
They'll be no problem the bombing will start the oil soon afterwards in the bean in Beijing

164
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
If it involves if this

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Crime against humanity involves an important ethnic group that's in many countries are that many countries have an interest in this

166
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Jewish jokes are an example of that then it's going to be different kind of situation if we're talking about a people that almost nobody

167
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
You really knows about in some Faraway place

168
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
And they're being persecuted by a powerful State the ramifications of confronting and it would not be like Albania

169
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Be committing to some major stuff

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
Do you think we do anything different today if Holocaust number to start tomorrow

171
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
If it's China or Russia apologies to both those Nations but in their league

172
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Powerful choices if I'm not going to choose my own state

173
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,663
Did they start killing a million or two million of some unpopular minority there that most of us in the rest of the world don't know a lot about

174
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
I don't have a whole lot of dog in that fight

175
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
How well are all these wonderful organization

176
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
We have created over

177
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
More than a hundred years

178
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,743
How well is this mechanism going to click into place and function to stop something like that

179
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,119
The people at the time get quite a bit of blame for not doing more to stop

180
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Holocaust or

181
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
Atrocities that happened all throughout the second world war on

182
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Many major fronts

183
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
But I think we sometimes forget how

184
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
How hard it is to do that we have many more mechanism

185
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
And

186
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
Tools at our disposal created

187
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367
In many cases specifically for this purpose that I still think and remember I'm not a

188
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,255
I'm not cautiously optimistic personality-wise I'm cautiously pessimistic and that all hardcore cynical and pessimistic

189
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
But I'm mildly both

190
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
I think if the state is powerful enough

191
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
We could have

192
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,263
You know the weaker version of the final solution happen over the next year

193
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
And the world kind of sit around and look at each other most of the time going you know that's awesome sanctions maybe I mean what should we do

194
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
I bring that up because we're coming to a part in the story

195
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
Where it's let's call it a milestone or a potential Milestone on that time line that begins maybe you could

196
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
In the twentieth century keep going to now

197
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
Concerning these kinds of events and I mean look at your newspaper today

198
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
We still haven't figured out how to deal with this we just had some problems in the Middle East where everybody was going and how do we influence this humanitarian

199
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Crisis

200
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
We had it when the former Yugoslavia broke up you had a genocide in Rwanda going on and everybody looking at each other thinking to themselves

201
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
What do we need to do here

202
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Meanwhile you know the killings are everyday

203
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
And everybody sort of deliberating and everybody's got to

204
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Considerate of Their Own

205
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,279
Personal country strategic interest and no realpolitik questions at all understandable

206
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
But it boils down to the same thing

207
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
If this is 1943 and this is how we're behaving

208
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
More Jewish people than Gypsies and homosexuals in Polish people and Priests are dying everyday

209
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
And yet what

210
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
A responsible speed

211
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,271
And what's a responsible level of fourth we can expect nation-states to employees situations like this

212
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
So as we

213
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
Ask ourselves that question and realize that the people in the in the pre Second World War era had less in the way of

214
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Have tools and less in the way of structure

215
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:17,887
And probably less in the way of Leverage I mean we talked a nuclear weapons now which changed the game completely

216
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
And they're confronted with a similar sort of situation and by the way this is one we still deal with today and it is still

217
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Controversial

218
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
And that's why I brought up the point about

219
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Denial

220
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,479
Or minimization or rationalization when it comes to questions of

221
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Atrocity

222
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
When last we spoke we were talking about the Battle of Shanghai

223
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,511
A little-known battle by the way in the west but it's participants like to point out

224
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
By the time it's done and it went on like 3 months something like that

225
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751
You have as many dead on the Chinese side as either side kind of a little less I think but but

226
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
The Battle of Verdun in the first world war a historically nasty battle that went on longer

227
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
The strategy of the battle of Shanghai was influenced by global public opinion or a desire to influence

228
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Global public

229
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Opinion

230
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese wanted to prove that the Chinese to put up a fight against the Japanese and they wanted to

231
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Send a message to the world

232
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,655
It were here we can resist if you want to help us it's a worthwhile investment and it's awful and you should help us

233
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,775
There were photographs making it to the global media stories accounts from Westin Shanghai head

234
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Quite a lot of westerners in it

235
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
And so the

236
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
Chinese through in all their best unit

237
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Stuff that they had

238
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
Stockpile for a long time in other words they were going to shoot off

239
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,439
All of their fireworks at once to make the biggest thing they could make and see if they could attract Global attention while they did so

240
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,047
The upside of this is they did the downside of this is when it's gone it's gone

241
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
I want the Japanese after several months of fighting

242
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,239
Launch an amphibious Invasion and open up another front on the city of Shanghai

243
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
That's the store

244
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
In terms of resist

245
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Chinese resistance

246
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Collapses they suffered a Brazilian casualties

247
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
They're out of stuff and they

248
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Stream box

249
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,623
Sort of routing and trying to get their act together towards the capitol At Nanking

250
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
The Japanese are closed

251
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
On their heels

252
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
And as they chase them

253
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
An atrocity begins to occur now let me back up here be

254
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Because

255
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
I was fascinated and yet I got pulled down the rabbit hole reading about the various

256
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Interview on what history calls

257
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
Some people called the Rape of Nanking other people called the name King incident the Dan king of prosody

258
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
And the reason there are all these different

259
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Name is because

260
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Diversity of in fact

261
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
It's about as controversial as all those other genocides war crimes and atrocities

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
But you will see on your list if you made a timeline as I said from the start of the 20th century

263
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
Go to the people accused of the crime

264
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Admit it

265
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Branson to talk about

266
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
You'll find a percentage always at will

267
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,639
But most people reflexively get defensive

268
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Let's understand this is a human thing

269
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
And let's understand just how widespread it is

270
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Every now and then regularly

271
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
You will see a news story

272
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Involving the Japanese

273
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Education system

274
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
The story is always the same

275
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
The Japanese textbooks

276
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Specifically the history textbook

277
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
Arnott

278
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Are whitewashing is the way someone will be

279
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Whitewashing downplaying

280
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Covering up

281
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Japanese atrocities during

282
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
Its aggressive. In the second world war pre Second World War era

283
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,015
Often times these complaints will come from people who suffered at the hands of Japanese aggression

284
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
China

285
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
The Philippines

286
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,695
The entire area around Malaysia I mean there's a bunch of places that were in the Japanese orbit for a

287
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,511
And those are often the people that get angry

288
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
When

289
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Japanese atrocities are downplayed

290
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
The people that are sometimes the most angry

291
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
AR

292
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,031
The Americans who fought in that War veterans from

293
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Australia

294
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Canada

295
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Great Britain

296
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
All these people want the Japanese to confront what they did

297
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Here's the way I want to portrayed in human terms

298
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
We have similar

299
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,975
Textbook issues here in the United States and many other countries do to and they often revolve around history

300
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
For middle schoolers

301
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Junior High School in high schoolers

302
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
The arguments are over how your own countries

303
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Bad periods are portrayed

304
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
And in the United States we often have these

305
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Controversies because

306
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
The

307
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,271
Nasty things that happened in the past are downplayed or sometimes exercise altogether

308
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,879
And the more patriotic good things are played up now the Japanese will often

309
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
Come back with a similar sort of response

310
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
How to make a political by both of the right-wing

311
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,119
Extra Patriot size of both countries actually have similar views about what they want portrayed in their textbooks

312
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
They want their people portrayed

313
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Positively

314
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
Creating a sense of citizenship pride in your heritage

315
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
All that kind of stuff in appreciation for the things that make you happy

316
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
People special

317
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,759
And yet I do find it so ironic that if you went to the people in my country

318
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,831
You feel that way and ask them about Japanese textbooks

319
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,415
They would definitely want the Japanese in most cases to have to confront

320
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Are these sorts of things right with the

321
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Real Patriots in the United States are pretty

322
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
Aware of of Japanese conduct in the second world war against our troops and others and they want that shown

323
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
But if you then tried to put the shoe on the other foot and say okay in our own history books when we talkin about the Vietnam War

324
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
How much

325
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
Full color photography

326
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,735
And eyewitness account should we devote to something like the me Lai massacre

327
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Most of you don't know about the me Lai massacre

328
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Shame

329
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
1968 Vietnam War

330
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
American soldiers went into a

331
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Hamlet or Village

332
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
And when they came out

333
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
302 550

334
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
The villagers men women and chill

335
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Children were dead

336
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
The rapes occurred amoebas

337
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Very very nasty

338
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Very disillusioning

339
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
Infratech icon

340
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Speak from experience from

341
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
In the end

342
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Ten years after his Americans confronted the fact

343
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
That we were actually just like

344
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Everyone else

345
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
We were not this special Lone Ranger coming to save the world in a couple of world wars rebuild it afterwards with the marsh

346
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
Plan defended during the Cold War I mean we were all those things too

347
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
But if you had said to American

348
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,423
People in the 30s or 40s that Americans would do a melee type thing

349
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,751
Anything we find it hard to believe I think with men in combat

350
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Although you know I've only read it so

351
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
So take this one

352
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
But I think what they would say is

353
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
That in certain situations

354
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Things can become very unpredictable

355
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
And when there is a lack

356
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,367
Strong leadership in those situations

357
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
They can become deadly

358
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,487
I'd like to draw a distinction between two kinds

359
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
Atrocities

360
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
You saw both kinds in the second world war by the

361
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
The way

362
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
And trying to link the two of them

363
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,567
Not only Twisted some of the post-war war crimes trials into knots

364
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
But affects us even today

365
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,223
The difference between a top-down atrocity

366
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,831
Of the sort for example that Hitler and the Nazis were doing with the final solution

367
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
The kind in Assyrian King

368
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,231
Would do for a Babylonian Final Solution a top-down order

369
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,863
And if you're the guy in the ground you're killing people and executing people and committing an atrocity because you ordered two

370
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,703
Or the kind that happens

371
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
Of the sort for example that the

372
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,567
Ancient Roman / Latin historian

373
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,919
Tacitus says happened during a Roman Civil War the city called cremona

374
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
This was a scandal so he wrote about it and he's almost eight

375
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Contemporary

376
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
And the story basically goes

377
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
It is a story about troops

378
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
When they get their blood loss

379
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Stop

380
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
And it reminds us that

381
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,863
You know people can be venal to enlarge group that can come out even

382
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
In a more pronounced the way what made from Moana so terrible

383
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,591
Is it's a stacking of the city which is what the destruction of Babylon was and what the destruction of the city of Nanjing is

384
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Going to be

385
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
That would be named King

386
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
Back in the second World War

387
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
The sacking of a city

388
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
And tacitus says

389
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
That these soldiers

390
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Wanted to sack the city

391
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
Did they were worried that the city would surrender and if it surrendered to their Commander the Roman general will then he

392
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Got The Spoils of the army

393
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Tacitus says

394
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
And he was a veteran

395
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
By the way

396
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
Really wanted the city to not surrender so they could loot it

397
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
The city did Sir

398
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,847
It was a Roman city by the way and the citizens in it

399
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Where Roman

400
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,735
The Roman army outside the city still wanted to loot the city

401
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
So they did

402
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
For several days

403
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
The account is one of the really wicked

404
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
Accounts in the ancient world

405
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
And it's funny though

406
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Because

407
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
If you took out the

408
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Particulars

409
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
It would probably work

410
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
As a

411
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Reasonable description of

412
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
10000

413
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
Sackings of cities

414
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
In human history

415
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
Tacitus wrote

416
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
Destruction of cremona

417
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
A Roman city by Roman soldiers after surrendering

418
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
He just quote

419
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
40000 armed men forced their way into the city

420
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Neither rank nor years

421
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
Save the victims from an indiscriminate orgy

422
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
In which rape alternated with murder and murder with rape

423
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,007
Greybeards and frail old women who had no value is loot wear dragged off to raise a laugh

424
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
But any full grown girl are good-looking lad who cross their path

425
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,943
Was pulled this way and that in a violent tug of war between the would-be captors

426
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
A single Lueder trailing a horde of money or Temple offerings of massive gold was often cut to Pieces by others

427
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Stronger

428
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,792
In their hands they held firebrands which ones they got their spoil away they wantonly flung into empty houses and

429
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Rifle temples

430
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,216
There was a diversity of wild desires different conceptions of what was lawful and nothing bard

431
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Kimono last

432
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
4 days

433
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
And quote

434
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
We would be mistaken

435
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,504
Thinking that this is something particularly Roman or particularly ancient

436
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
There's something that goes on

437
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,416
In certain situations and you can reliably see it again and again

438
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
In

439
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
December

440
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
1937

441
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
You see it in Nanking

442
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,240
Nanking though is so much

443
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Much harder

444
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
To deal with

445
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
Then something like

446
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Gate from Moana

447
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,664
Or the Iron Age destruction of Babylon because

448
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
It's still a white-hot it's incandescence

449
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
In terms of

450
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
How passionate and upset and how

451
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Visceral the argument over

452
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
Can get people get death threats

453
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Regularly

454
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
What are the books like

455
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
For the subject

456
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
Post all of the research

457
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
On the website for the shows

458
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Encourage you to buy these

459
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,544
If you like this stuff some of the Nanking stuff is positively Kennedy assassination asked

460
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
In terms of the minutiae.

461
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Detail a big Point spinoff and revolver

462
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
A lot of people love that stuff in and reading it

463
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
I one of them grapes

464
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
Nanking atrocity 1937-38

465
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Complicating the picture

466
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
Has different Scholars writing each chapter from a wide

467
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
Arranger people and one of the things that the Japanese editor of the book said in the introduction is that several of the contributors

468
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
It had their lives threat

469
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
Some of them face-to-face for

470
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824
Their writings research

471
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Teaching and lectures

472
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
Don't have a whole lot of people

473
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
Threatening to bash your head in

474
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
Reviews on rimowa

475
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Do you know

476
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
I'll give you an example of

477
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Problem

478
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
History fan faces trying to talk about this

479
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
If you wanted to make a graph of

480
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,168
Of opinions on what the death toll is in Nanjing in December

481
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
And onward for months

482
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,056
On one side of the spectrum you have the Japanese people who fall into the

483
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Plastic

484
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Are known as the

485
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Deniers

486
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
To consider everything

487
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
We're going to talk about here.

488
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
To be an illusion

489
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Caused by

490
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Combination of

491
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
Contemporary wartime propaganda

492
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,720
And a lot of marxist stuff especially by leftist Japanese marks his teachers were

493
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,024
Polluting the minds of their own children I mean

494
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,656
It's a super Patriot Point of View with a tinge of conspiracy that would probably resonate in a budget

495
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Countries

496
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
With the same group

497
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
They're probably all

498
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Actually

499
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
We said in

500
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
The earlier conversation that like

501
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
The Jewish folks that this

502
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
Phrase was originally applied to

503
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
The Japanese really intense there like everybody else

504
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
Only more so we're just like anybody

505
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,952
And I think you see it in the passions here to when people get subs

506
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Upset about

507
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,096
You know besmirching the reputation of the Imperial Japanese Army and the country

508
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,496
Patriots will do especially if they don't think it's deserted the people

509
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
On one side of the spectrum here

510
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Will claim that

511
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Maybe 45 people

512
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Died

513
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,224
In this Nanking thing in those may have been Justified one way or

514
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,112
Now on the far opposite end of the scale in the Spectrum

515
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
You have Chinese history

516
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
Chinese official government lie

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
They've actually cargain number their number

518
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Into a rock

519
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
I saw a picture of

520
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
It's a little like you know proverbially

521
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Carving it into stone

522
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
And the attempts to create it's pretty clear

523
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
A number that has the same sort of intellectual residents with

524
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
The global population that the six

525
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
Million number has for the

526
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Holocaust

527
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,064
Everybody knows 6000000 okay where you come up with that number

528
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Nobody knows

529
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,744
What you come up with a nice round number and eventually people go yellow Holocaust

530
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
The Chinese are trying to do

531
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
This

532
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
With the Nanking at Ross

533
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
And the number that they settled on his 300 thousand

534
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Dad

535
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,128
And there are Chinese historians and let's acknowledge your maybe not operating with

536
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Complete freedom in terms of

537
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Historical

538
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Whatever it takes

539
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
But there a Chinese history as it will bump that number up

540
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Considerably

541
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,392
The 350000 range is not on her

542
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Kuykendahl

543
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
If you want to go to Crazy Town

544
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,560
Find the very end of the spectrum with the largest number you've ever seen my fiance enlarge

545
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
$500

546
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
So happy

547
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Not credible but that

548
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
45 is not credible either on the other

549
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
On that scale

550
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Are a bunch of different

551
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
Gradients of people

552
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
And their views on this subject that's why it's really difficult to talk about because

553
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,528
It's not just an it didn't happen yes it did thing it's

554
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
Will Surety but it only happened here or yes it did but it only happen to these people it's just the lawyer Lee break

555
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
Down over the geographical boundary

556
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,792
Where someone who dies in this

557
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
No quadrant

558
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
How to say

559
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Nanking atrocity casualty

560
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
As someone who dies outside that quadrant doesn't mean it gets silly light

561
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
God the Chinese historians point out

562
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,360
And supposedly this is why China didn't make a huge deal

563
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200
Specifically over the Nanking situation in the first few decades after

564
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
The war

565
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
Was because this was more par for the course then not

566
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
And part of the way you get some of these really large number account

567
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
Is the Chinese historian sometimes include

568
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,096
These soldiers from the Battle of Shanghai who died

569
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
In part because the Japanese troops who took their surrender or who captured them or who found them

570
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Wounded on the battlefield

571
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Executed them there

572
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
This is another part of the

573
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Gradient in the

574
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
Discussion right who do you count

575
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
If you were talking about Soldier

576
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Do they count in the atrocity

577
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,416
Will what if you kill them after they surrendered as I said

578
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
A bunch of different people have different

579
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Opinions along the Spectre

580
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Now if you're looking for a mid-range to try to

581
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
Get sort of a little ballast on this question

582
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
A lot of the mainstream

583
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:57,312
Historians will range from like a hundred thousand to 250,000 dead and that is a huge number

584
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
No matter which it is

585
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,480
The other question that always comes up in a case like this in this is connected

586
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
To the Nazi situation in Europe

587
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Buddy's

588
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Who's response

589
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Where does the responsibility lie

590
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Because

591
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,512
You will often hear these situations and sometimes it's valid

592
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
Compared to the sacking of cremona where you have troops

593
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
Your loss of institutional control maybe on the part of the leaders

594
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Or

595
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
Callous disregard for the plight of people you know that your lower level troops were just spoiling whatever it might be

596
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
Some people make the case that all of this

597
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,224
Is premeditated might as well have been naughty stuff

598
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
And once again we could divide it into

599
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Separating soul

600
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Civilians

601
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
But there's an interesting little bridge between the two

602
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
And that's

603
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Soldiers who dress up

604
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Acivill

605
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Now before we get into this

606
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
Entitled to know

607
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
How I come to my thinking

608
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
King and if anything might on

609
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Tumi

610
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,408
My normal approach is to put myself in other people's viewpoints

611
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
To try to see their perspective

612
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272
But trying to see the perspective

613
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,136
Of the side that thinks there's 45 or a hundred or two hundred deaths here in there

614
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Explain away a bullet

615
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Feels like trying to

616
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Ba

617
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Defender of a holocaust

618
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
Denier it's a really did

619
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
For me to put myself

620
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,472
I think you should point it out if I had to have a very hard time

621
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Putting myself even

622
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
If you were in debating class me so you have to take this person

623
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Forgiven Defender

624
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
I am usually

625
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Open-minded enough

626
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
2

627
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,600
Keep a lot of Doubt open though depending on the other circumstances involved for example

628
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
If this was a very unusual inside

629
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,864
In the second sino-japanese war or the second World War I think I'd be inclined to say listen wartime propaganda I mean those

630
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
People might have a point

631
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
The problem is

632
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Is that

633
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,824
The Japanese Army and Navy to a degree with the Army certainly

634
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
Is a repeat offender

635
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
In this war

636
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
But this I know

637
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
Japanese 1 and II world

638
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:16,320
The Second World War

639
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,160
Depend a lot of people when I was a kid I always started it with the invasion of Poland

640
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,256
But since then there's a lot of opinion has shifted in such a really 1937 this

641
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
The Japanese are in the world

642
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
World War II

643
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
The other

644
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Powers just

645
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Armenia

646
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Chinese and Japanese

647
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Starting the Second World War

648
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
And in this case

649
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
The Japanese will behave toward the Chinese

650
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
Atrociously

651
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,896
And you have to really write off a ton of avid

652
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
Including your own

653
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,248
Soldiers and commanders Diaries

654
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
If you want to explain it away

655
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
You also have to deal

656
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
With the

657
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
Your remembrances of combat veterans

658
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
From pretty much every Power

659
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
That fought the Japanese in the Second World War

660
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Where atrocious Behavior

661
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
And a certain brutal level of conduct

662
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
Was always remark

663
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,968
And that's after you factor out racism and hatred of the enemy who killed your buddies and all that other stuff

664
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
There's a ton of evidence

665
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:22,368
And the questions over wide what's going on here been ongoing

666
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Any sort of

667
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
In a smaller way parallel the ones going on after the second world war with the Nazis where you have things like the Milgram experiment

668
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
These are the things where people were trying to figure out listen

669
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
How do you get people to turn off their moral

670
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
We all be naughty

671
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Trying to figure out

672
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
Motivations and how you do that I mean in the

673
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
Second world war in afterwards and let's remember

674
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
The Japanese public new

675
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Very little

676
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Love this stuff

677
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:52,320
Although some of the stuff that they did know and sort of celebrate is once again a little weird by Western standards for example

678
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,904
There's a famous incident Nanking where two soldiers

679
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
We're having supposedly this is in the Japanese news media

680
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Contest

681
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
A Chinese head chopping contest

682
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
And the

683
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,752
Talley was being kept score regularly in the newspaper you know this this guy is up to 75 now

684
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,312
He heads today by the other guy he takes the lead

685
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
And it was always used as evidence of

686
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:21,760
You know you're looking for a sign that this brutality happen will my good if they were celebrating in Japan's newspapers

687
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Turns out most

688
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Mange

689
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Excuse me but you know what I mean

690
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
Historians of Ivan reading suggests that that

691
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
Never happen

692
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
And that it was a figment

693
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Of the presses desire to whip up an interesting story that got people reading which

694
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Did

695
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
It does of course beg the question

696
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
About an audience who thought that that was worth

697
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
But there have been

698
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Speculations

699
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:51,456
Forever and the early ones during the war we're always going to racist in culture with this is how the Japanese are

700
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Since then there's been a lot of interesting ones including one from Japan and just to give you an idea one of them will talk about the brutality

701
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,416
In the Japanese Army wear of

702
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Apparently

703
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
Being punched in the face

704
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:07,072
Hard with a closed fist by your Superior was not uncommon

705
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
And there's plenty of

706
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
Reports about

707
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
People having

708
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,448
To commit executions

709
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Woody

710
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
Killing of pows as part of a sort of blood in you

711
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
What's a very old-fashioned idea

712
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
Once again a lot of the things that Japanese were going to be in trouble for in the Second World War

713
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
Are things that people didn't even

714
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Bat an eyelash

715
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
500 years ago

716
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,928
500 years ago they would have known that ever happened outside of a very close geographical area

717
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
That's another thing that's different about Nan

718
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
There's telegraph's there

719
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
There's embassies there's westerners

720
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
There is

721
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Us and British

722
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,216
Boats

723
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Chips

724
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
In the Yangtze River

725
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
The real world outside this area

726
00:33:54,176 --> 00:34:00,320
Is going to hear about what's happening inside Nanking and they're going to hear about it while it's going on

727
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
It's a Thoroughly Modern situation

728
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
That we have seen over and over

729
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Senseware

730
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
There will be some terrible atrocity

731
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Crisis

732
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
Humanitarian disaster genocide

733
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,960
War crime going on somewhere in the world and unfolding in real time

734
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
And all the great powers are kind of under the gun at that point

735
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,616
When everybody says my goodness something has to be done or more people will die

736
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:28,992
But the world global geopolitical Powers rarely react

737
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
At speed on these kind of things

738
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,112
But it's been a little bit of an unsolvable problem

739
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,952
You see it in Nanjing for sure because what's going to happen there will unfold over a

740
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
A period of weeks

741
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
The world will be put into a moral quandary

742
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
3 / what to do

743
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,264
So picking up the story after the battle of Shanghai

744
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,080
The Chinese forces Retreat toward the cap

745
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Nanjing

746
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
Nanking

747
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,224
840 hundred fifty miles west of Shanghai

748
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,832
And during the retreat the Japanese lead elements are trying to surround the Chinese

749
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
This is a

750
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,672
A flight with the Japanese in Hot Pursuit

751
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
There are also civilians along the path there are aircraft

752
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Strafing and bombing the roads

753
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
You get this sense of

754
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,448
Chaos and Bedlam and claustrophobia and panic and

755
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
You know I've seen them

756
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,336
You seen war footage since that time that you really get a sense

757
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
And the camera gives you a very good sense

758
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,968
A combination of things that must have been working on these people to

759
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,296
The fluidity of the situation right everything is moving quickly

760
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
And you're in the middle of it

761
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:43,232
And also a complete lack of knowledge about what's going on outside your field of vision or whatever the person next to

762
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
You can say

763
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
The combination of those two things

764
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Is panic inducing

765
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,704
So imagine the sort of a bedlam

766
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
Aziz

767
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,568
Is this line of humanity pursued by the Japanese

768
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Runs toward Nanking

769
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,016
The Japanese arrived close on their heels and mostly surround the city and on December 9th

770
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:10,368
They're outside this walled city of Nanking it looks like a sort of a European medieval

771
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Evil city

772
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Demanding it surrender

773
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,864
There is a Chinese General in command of a hastily thrown together but relatively you know it's China large

774
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Number of soldiers

775
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Are some of them green

776
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Some of them old and reservists

777
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,056
Some of them from the battle that just was over in Shanghai and there

778
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,920
Not fair they don't have their weapons there may be defeatist I mean it's a it's a

779
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
It's a bit of a Motley Crew but they're going to defend the city

780
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Seoul for 4 days

781
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,600
They hold out before that general orders a retreat

782
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
He leaves the government

783
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
Leaves and you have now a city

784
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,072
With hundreds of thousands of people including refugees that's being bombed

785
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,448
And no governmental services or anyone in charge of the Japanese have yet to take over

786
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,776
And it's one of the great stories by the way

787
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Of this

788
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Cities

789
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,688
Plight and that's that there were a group of westerners

790
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,528
In the city most most of the western ran away as soon as the Japanese Army came

791
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,856
But a bunch of different people businessmen and others humanitarias doctors

792
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Stayed

793
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
And they weren't

794
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,488
There to take care of all these people but when that

795
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
Fell into their lap

796
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
They stepped up to do it

797
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
There's a little ironic

798
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,680
Twist to the story two and they recently made a movie

799
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
Out of basically I almost playing on that

800
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,592
Twist and it's that the guy that was sort of elected by this you add hot group

801
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
To be the leader

802
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
What's a Nazi

803
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,272
An Ardent Nazi is the sources described him a businessman John rabe

804
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,184
And part of the reason he gets the gig is because the Japanese government and the Nazi German government have been moving closer together

805
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:54,304
And maybe he has a little bit more pole with the Japanese are just about to take over the city then maybe a British

806
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
For American or

807
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:01,216
I give her the Danish guy maybe they don't have as much pulso this guy gets the gig

808
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,520
And the movie I saw the tagline you know

809
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,152
Of the preview and I think it said something like you can be saved 250,000 live

810
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
And you see scenes of him

811
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:17,600
With huddle Chinese refugees and he hides them from aircraft under a giant swastika flag so they're sort of that

812
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,720
That playing with the idea that here you have the evil Nazis and yet there's a good person mixed in

813
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Juxtaposition

814
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
You can hang whole movie

815
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Iman

816
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:31,424
I don't know about 250000 lives in terms of the number

817
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,520
I do know that this is 20 or 30 people there's women in the group

818
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,336
Eye doctors ministers business men

819
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
And they save it

820
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Enough people

821
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
And it's in large part

822
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Because of the documents that they sent

823
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
Or the information that they kept track of

824
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
Do we have a lot of these account

825
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,328
And when I wanted to spend 3 hours on it I was going to go through all of the letters let me encourage you to

826
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
You get another book if

827
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
You're interested in one of the few I've ever read

828
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,776
This should be dry as a bone but it's actually in its own way terrifying because it's it's

829
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
Chronological

830
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Primary source

831
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,920
The cables in the telegram and the letters and the

832
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,760
Please from these people John Robin all these people who make up

833
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,856
The Nanking International safety zone

834
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,440
Pope says it's called and you can read everyday

835
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
These letters getting more

836
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,816
Beseeching more terrified more outraged

837
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
As the situation descends into

838
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Monsters chaos

839
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
On December 13th the Japanese and turn and

840
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,920
There's a letter from John Rabe saying thank you so much for not

841
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:52,064
Selling our little International safety zone that we created which by the way is nothing more than a part of the city blocked off

842
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,392
And on the sides of the streets were the borders they put international Flags

843
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:01,792
I think it was December 1st at the Nanking mayor before fleeing the city tells all the civilians to run into the safety zone

844
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
You'll be safe there

845
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,400
Which allows the Japanese to then say that anybody who's not in the safety zone is

846
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,704
Ipso facto a bad guy

847
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
And what begins to happen right away

848
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,104
Is the Japanese start searching for Chinese soldiers

849
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,152
Because there is as we said a lot of

850
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,808
Another part of the atrocity here is if you are a Defender basically

851
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
The Japanese Army in this

852
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,976
Case do you count the killing of Chinese soldiers as a war crime in officially there's no question but

853
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,840
That allows some people to divert you and say what we admit that these people who died Were Soldiers

854
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
But I denied the civilian side

855
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
In this case what happens is there's a river with the Yangtze that runs behind

856
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
Nanking if you look at it it's it it

857
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:50,688
In order for Chinese troops to get out of Nanking and get away from the oncoming Japanese they would have to cross the river

858
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
Going to go over to the more Chinese side and keep going

859
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:59,648
Normally not a problem but of course you know they were trying to create a defensive Zone before the Japanese invaded blowing up

860
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
The bridges and everything that would allow

861
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:06,048
The Chinese to get away too and now they have to so there are these heroin stories

862
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Of Chinese troops just

863
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
At the riverbank waiting a thousands and thousands of people waiting for one little boat that can carry three people look like a canoe

864
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Across the river

865
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,360
And the Japanese are on the way and if there's one group of people that knows

866
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,712
That the Japanese are not taking Chinese prisoners of Chinese soldiers

867
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
So distance of

868
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Panic is

869
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Palpable

870
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
And I'll let me turn to some of the sources now

871
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
And I have a wide mix

872
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Of them

873
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,768
And my apologies I said I'd like to do three hours and

874
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,072
I'd like to just read the document

875
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
To you because there are several there like police blotter reports where they're trying to tell the Japanese Commander at this hour

876
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:51,872
This woman was raped over here and the Japanese soldier spilled her sugar I mean it's literally like police reports but it's it's

877
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
All I can think of what I was reading it

878
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
Is how unusual it was to have something like this

879
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
And if you could have had a similar document it would apply equally well to the sack of Carthage by the Romans you know it ain't

880
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
I mean

881
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
This is a modern day

882
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Account

883
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,607
Of something you just don't get a whole lot of but that's happened a lot of times in history

884
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Seems woefully out of

885
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
Place in time though

886
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Here's the way

887
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,311
Fujiwara Acura contributor to

888
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
The Nanking atrocity complicating the picture

889
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:29,247
Said that the attack on Nanking was out of control from the start

890
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
With all sorts of units that were

891
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
Glory hungry and wanted to be the first inside the city and

892
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:39,999
There's a sense of out-of-control troops such as the Battle of cremona would that psychology going on

893
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
So here we get another gradient

894
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
In the

895
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Responsibility spectrum that we've been talkin

896
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Do you blame

897

Japan for what's about to happen here no it was a bunch of out-of-control troops in some ways it was

About

900
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,967
The Japanese units finding out

901
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,319
On December 13th that the Chinese were retreating and leaving and trying to get away

902
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
Japanese units learned of this Retreat on the morning of the 13th

903
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,071
Skirmishes broke out in many areas of small groups of Chinese troops outside the city

904
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Now lacking a chain of command

905
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
Desperately try to slip past advancing Japanese forces

906
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
Then the surrendering big

907
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,871
Most of the Chinese troops still inside Nanking rushed to escape Helter Skelter

908
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Through the pot chain gate

909
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
Which led to the shock Juan Warfare

910
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,527
I'm shocked when they hope to cross the Yangtze by boat

From the Diaries

923
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
From December 13th 1937

924
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:18,047
Of two Japanese commanders 16th division commander and 30th Brigade Commander

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,375
These are primary source.

Quote

930
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
We see prisoners everywhere

931
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
So many that there's no way we can deal with them

932
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
The general policy is

933
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Accept no prisoners

934
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,295
So we ended up having to take care of them lot Stock and Barrel

935
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,831
But they came in hordes

936
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
And units of thousands or five thousand

937
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
So we couldn't even disarm them

938
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,535
Later I heard that the Sasaki unit alone dispose of about 1500

939
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,399
A company Commander guarding typing gate took care of another 1300

940
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:59,007
Another 7000 8000 clustered at the Chino gate are still surrendering

941
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,103
We need a really huge ditch to handle those 7000 8000

942
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
But we can't find one

943
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
So someone suggested this plan

944
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Now quoting someone else's plan

945
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,111
Divide them up into groups of a hundred to two hundred and then lured them to some suitable spot for finishing off

946
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
And quote

947
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
30th Brigade Commander major-general Sasaki

Lychee

949
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,791
Wrote in his diary on the 13th of December quote

950
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,167
The number of abandoned enemy bodies in our area today with 10000 plus thousands more

951
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:33,567
If we include those Chinese whose Escape rafts for boats on the Yangtze were sunk by fire from our armored car

952
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
Cars Plus pows killed by our units

953
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
Our Detachment alone must have taken care of over 20,000 we finished the mop up and secured are rear area in about

954
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
2 p.m.

955
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,623
What regrouping we advance to the hoping gate

956
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
Later the enemy surrendered in the thousand

957
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,279
Frenzy troops rebuffing efforts by superiors to restrain them

958
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,095
Finished off those pows one after another

959
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,423
Even if they aren't soldiers for example Medics are priests

960
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Men would yell

961
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
Kill the whole damn lot

962
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,615
After recalling the past 10 days of bloody fighting image so many buddies that shed so much blood

963
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
And quote

964
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
So right there you see

965
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
Another one of those lines but some people take which is

966
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
The

967
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,647
Superior tried to restrain them but their buddies were killed and they were

968
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,463
Understandably upset enough to commit atrocities

969
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
There's also a ton of evidence.

970
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,607
That there was a take-no-prisoners policy

971
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,423
Historian Herbert P Bix

972
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
In his book on Hirohito is

973
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,031
Pulitzer prize-winning book on Hirohito

974
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Writes this

975
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Quote

976
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,407
There were no orders to rape in quotes

977
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Nanking

978
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
Norton Imperial headquarters ever order the total extermination of the enemy as the ultimate goal of the Nanking encirclement cam

979
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Pain

980
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:52,671
Standing orders to take no prisoners did exist however

981
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
And once Nanking fell

982
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
Japanese soldiers began to execute and Max

983
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,119
Military prisoners of war and unarmed deserters who had surrendered

984
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,727
They also went on an unprecedented an unplanned Rampage of arson

985
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Pillage murder and rape

986
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:12,895
The resulting Slaughter continued in the city and it's six of Jason rural Villages for 3 months

987
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,551
And far exceeded earlier atrocities committed during the Battle of Shanghai and along the Escape Routes to Nanking

988
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:26,207
General Nakajima 16th division in just its first day in the capital killed approximately 30000

989
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
Chinese prisoners of war and fleeing soldiers

990
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
And quote

991
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:35,935
There were charges that these orders to kill all prisoners come from the highest up on the scene

992
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,287
Which by the 13th I believe is the Emperor hirohito's uncle

993
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
There will be an execution or two after the war

994
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:50,527
For what goes on in this city but trying to figure out who's responsible for it has been an ongoing

995
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Part of the debate

996
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
How high up the food chain do you blame them

997
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,951
What it really seems to be is this combination of two things

998
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
A

999
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
Ordered War crime from

1000
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
The Western perspective the killing of surrendering

1001
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
Or captured pows cuz after all

1002
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,215
You go look at the Soviet Union

1003
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:15,359
And the number of prisoners that fell into German hands after the June 1941 Invasion there and you'll never have these giant

1004
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Castle Schloss

1005
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
These cauldron battles and they

1006
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,735
Capture 250000 people at a time

1007
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:27,135
Any of these photographs of huge crowds of people are long column stretching off into the distance kicking up tons of Dustin

1008
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:32,767
I'm trying to figure out how do we how do we barbwire these people in a pan and keep them and then how do we feed him

1009
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Didn't see any of that

1010
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
In

1011
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
This part of the war

1012
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Between China and Japan

1013
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Cuz they're not taken prisoner

1014
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
And nobody knows that better than the Chinese

1015
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Troops

1016
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,335
So

1017
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,663
This sense of panic that's going on in the city

1018
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,711
I was trying to think of an analogy

1019
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
It's a little like

1020
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:59,647
You're getting a hundred thousand or more people in the soccer stadium and then having somebody tell you over the public-address speaker

1021
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,719
That the doors out have been barred

1022
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,047
An armed gunman are coming in to kill all

1023
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,863
Hundred or hundred fifty thousand people in the stadium

1024
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
And what is the mood like that

1025
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Well

1026
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
If it's

1027
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
Panic-stricken that would be understandable

1028
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
And this is when

1029
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,127
Incidence begin happening in the story

1030
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
Dipa come

1031
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Hinge moment

1032
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,319
We were talking about communicable diseases or an epidemic this is when it jumps species

1033
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
From

1034
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Nearly affecting

1035
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
The soldiers

1036
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
And now affecting

1037
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
The civilian

1038
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,863
Because in their panic and quite understandably so

1039
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,959
A lot of these Chinese troops an undetermined number these Chinese troops

1040
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
I going to throw off their uniforms and throw their weapons away

1041
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
Addressing any civilian clothing they can find

1042
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,223
They may be added in this by the population because after all

1043
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
This is a Chinese City

1044
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
And these are Chinese troops

1045
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
But the Japanese start

1046
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Looking

1047
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
4

1048
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,719
Chinese troops that have thrown away their uniforms in address to civilians

1049
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
And they start

1050
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
Taking people out of crowds

1051
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
Many of whom are civilians and executing them

1052
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
And then you have

1053
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
The part of the story

1054
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
It just takes this to unbelievable

1055
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
Crazy levels which is what starts to happen

1056
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,407
The civilians and this is where it looks like from Moana

1057
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Because

1058
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,063
You have and it starts if you read the primary source material it starts on the 13th and you start to get these

1059
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,879
These requests can you please put more

1060
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,719
Military police officers out on the street because the soldiers are out

1061
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
How to control

1062
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,815
The main thing they're out of control with although there's a lot of looting

1063
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Is rape

1064
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Bandits

1065
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
Crazy to read as I said I want to do 3 hours on this and just go

1066
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
Go from one police blotter account to another because it gives you a real-time anyway sense of what's going on all over

1067
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,687
For the Nanking International safety zone

1068
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,527
Where they were getting more than a thousand reports of rape tonight as one

1069
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Of the

1070
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
Humanitarians working there said the Japanese have turned the international safety zone into a public house meaning a whorehouse

1071
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,023
And they were often

1072
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Chilling

1073
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,583
The women that they rape kits

1074
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
It's worth

1075
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
Giving an account

1076
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
From the victor

1077
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
The Chinese sign

1078
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,823
And in one of the books that I have nanking 1937 memory and healing

1079
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
They have a Chinese story who's giving

1080
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,735
What is the recognized Chinese view of this thing and he pulls no punches

1081
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
He wants you to know

1082
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
How nasty

1083
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
You.

1084
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:43,231
And a person who says they're only 45 people who died in this whole incident would call the Chinese a liar or their government a bunch of people

1085
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,047
Just wanted to hold this over Japan's head but here's

1086
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
What Chinese historian

1087
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,119
Sunshine away

1088
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Shed Happens

1089
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Quote

1090
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,567
In general the massacre itself can be divided into two types of killings

1091
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,871
Mass killings and sporadic killing

1092
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,015
Incidence of mass killing range for the murder of 10 to 20 to the slaughter of tens of thousands of people

1093
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,599
With the greatest number in anyone into the reaching more than 50,000

1094
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,951
Sporadic killing included varying numbers of 328 people

1095
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:18,303
Among the mass killings in addition to those who died by the sword and firing squad

1096
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Others were burned

1097
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
Buried alive or drown

1098
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,727
Several after being soaked with gasoline we're set on fire by gunshot

1099
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:32,127
Causing the wounded person to lie covered in Flames rolling and writhing on the ground until finally dying a miserable death

1100
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,223
Individual sporadic acts of torture and killing included

1101
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Gutting

1102
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
Slicing

1103
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
Piercing alive

1104
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
And dog biting

1105
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,927
Summer even burned with acid and then left burning all over

1106
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
Others were tortured to death

1107
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,559
Do Japanese Lieutenant amuse themselves by having a killing contest

1108
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,119
The first one to reach a hundred killed one the

1109
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
Game

1110
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,191
Then they raise the limit to 150

1111
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
In addition to killing

1112
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,055
The Nanking massacre also involved rape

1113
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Arson

1114
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
Theft and other violent crimes

1115
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,223
The Japanese troops to attack Nanking rape tens of thousands of Chinese women

1116
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,759
Many of whom were then murdered

1117
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
And quote

1118
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
Anytime I find my

1119
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Thinking

1120
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
That those numbers

1121
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
The Chinese

1122
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Historians

1123
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
Way too large

1124
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,399
I recall that according to tacitus the Roman legionaries completely

1125
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,191
Picked cremona clean

1126
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
4 days

1127
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Nanjing is going to

1128
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Continue

1129
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
4 months

1130
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
How much evil

1131
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Do

1132
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
In Italian frame like that

1133
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
Admittedly

1134
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
They're not

1135
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,807
Ripping Nanking apart with

1136
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,927
Quite the efficiency or capacity of the Romans were ripping cremona

1137
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Apart

1138
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
But if you've got months to do it

1139
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
I imagine

1140
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Pretty thorough

1141
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Now if you say that

1142
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
That we have spent

1143
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
Too much time

1144
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Focusing on a single mattress

1145
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
When we talkin about

1146
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
I'm fixing to go on to 1945

1147
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
I would agree with

1148
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Except that we're not going to stay

1149
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,407
A lot of time

1150
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,247
Necessarily on all the atrocities

1151
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
Between now and the end of the war that deserve

1152
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
What's more

1153
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,647
You look at the raw death

1154
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Totals

1155
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
The Chinese

1156
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,767
Between 1937 and 1945 alone

1157
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
And if you include the indirect

1158
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,167
Causes of death because of the war things like family disease your numbers get

1159
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
To the 15

1160
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
And 20 million people level

1161
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,079
You want to go just with directly

1162
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
Caused by violence

1163
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,455
It gets down to maybe 12 million in a lot of sources 12 million

1164
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
In 2/3 of which by the way

1165
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
Are civilian

1166
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Where are their stories

1167
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Most of those people die

1168
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
Individual

1169
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
What suffering

1170
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,791
Are killed in small out-of-the-way villages

1171
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Hamlet

1172
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Who speaks for them

1173
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Let's let

1174
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:09,311
The relatively and comparatively well attested to situation in Nanking allegations if you return

1175
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
Fire but still

1176
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Well attested to allegations in the worst case in

1177
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
Mario let's let those speak for all those other

1178
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Spooky stories didn't make

1179
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,159
The second reason to focus perhaps

1180
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Inordinate

1181
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Atrocity

1182
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,487
Like Nanking

1183
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,815
Is that it's one of a bunch of

1184
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,607
Pre-war atrocity

1185
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,167
These will continue by the way during the conflict

1186
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
As well

1187
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
The scene to set up

1188
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
Dussehra

1189
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,359
Where you have these brutal

1190
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
Totalitarian type armies

1191
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,759
At least the way the Western liberal democracies look at the

1192
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:55,647
Things that seem to be on the March and they seem to be the bad guys in the store

1193
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
Bad guys isn't interesting

1194
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,583
Because in most wars especially all the recent ones

1195
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
I can get into the

1196
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
The newspaper accounts

1197
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
The stuff like that

1198
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,471
Pretty common to portray one dad

1199
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Dysentery

1200
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
In almost

1201
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,567
Apocalyptically evil

1202
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,383
In the first world war the Germans were

1203
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
Call the Hun

1204
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
Because hands were about the nastiest thing

1205
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,807
British propaganda and others could think of in Terms

1206
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
Slapping a label on them

1207
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,135
And they

1208
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,695
Helped out all they could on the German side by

1209
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,279
Doing things that have been named the rape of Belgium and stuff

1210
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,887
At the time shocking the genteel 19th century Sensibility

1211
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
Let the record show

1212
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
How exponential

1213
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
That can grow

1214
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
Ona near generation B

1215
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Because

1216
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,151
The outrage over the

1217
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
The rape of Belgium

1218
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
Involved about 6000

1219
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
People killed directly maybe though

1220
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
The modern numbers

1221
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
And we've already

1222
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
We talked about what

1223
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Numbers are

1224
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
In China

1225
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
It's worth pointing out

1226
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,303
If you take standard numbers for both world wars and

1227
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Compare them

1228
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,631
Look at the difference in the ratio of

1229
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
Civilian to

1230
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,215
Casualties in the first world war standard number you

1231
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
4 soldiers kill

1232
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
10 million feet

1233
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,335
About 7 million civilian

1234
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Estimated

1235
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
In the Second World War

1236
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,759
More like 20 to 25 million

1237
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
In military

1238
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,087
3 deaths and more like 35

1239
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
2

1240
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
60

1241
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
Million civilians

1242
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
So

1243
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,743
Several times more civilian deaths

1244
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
In the Second World War

1245
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Less civilian death

1246
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
In the first

1247
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,423
And that's the part that by the standards of Mo

1248
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Was war crimes

1249
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
Or just individual perception

1250
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:50,079
Makes the second world war so much more atrocious

1251
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
A lot of

1252
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
People are willing to

1253
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Forgive

1254
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
All sorts

1255
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Nastiness

1256
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,991
12 soldiers

1257
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
Women children old pee

1258
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,343
People the infirmed the sick the non-combat

1259
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
It's much more harrowing in shock

1260
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
Walking when there

1261
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
Chilled and here's the problem with the good ending

1262
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
Do you think

1263
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
At the Japanese

1264
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,887
Teaching their kids

1265
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
That they were on the

1266
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,679
Evil side of

1267
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,239
This war the way the Western Democratic textbooks

1268
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Can the frame

1269
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,311
The Japanese side of this

1270
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Obviously the Germans are

1271
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
Sauron

1272
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,919
But the Japanese are

1273
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
One of the

1274
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,015
Powers that work with sore on the rim

1275
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,063
The easterners one of those people

1276
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
One reason is that

1277
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,183
Countries like China have problems with Japan's Tech

1278
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
Focusing their minds they're not confronting this fact it wait a minute

1279
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,815
Let's acknowledge you were the evil side of the

1280
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
This war

1281
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,911
Good and evil is a strange thing though is that I had to think about this

1282
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
For a while

1283
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Because

1284
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Who says

1285
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,543
A particular behavior is evil

1286
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:58,175
You go talk to djingis Khan about Good and Evil in the 13th century

1287
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,247
From the Mongol point of view and he may have a point

1288
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
A different interpretation

1289
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:08,415
Of what constitutes one of the either write this is a perception thing

1290
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,743
If the Nazis had somehow won the war

1291
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
And we were all having our

1292
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
Concepts of

1293
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Good and Evil

1294
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Warframe

1295
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Under that regime

1296
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
How different do

1297
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
On. For example

1298
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
That the Fairmont

1299
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:29,663
Carried out on Hitler's orders in the East after they invaded the Soviet Union and it was this you know No Holds Barred

1300
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,967
All law thrown out the window kind of conflict

1301
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,527
How different is that look you think the Germans

1302
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
Were the Nazis

1303
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Cuz it might be a

1304
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Pan Nordic

1305
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Sort of

1306
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
Empire

1307
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,487
Do you think they frame that and good and evil terms and if they do

1308
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,791
You think they're framing their side is evil

1309
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,351
Perception thing is hard to get past isn't it

1310
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Because

1311
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
From

1312
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
The perspective of

1313
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,983
Someone who grew up in what

1314
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,567
The post-war history books always called the Great liberal democracies

1315
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
The Western democracies

1316
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
You have

1317
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,431
Concentration camps

1318
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,783
They're being used as genocide Factory assembly lines

1319
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
You pretty much

1320
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,391
Buy our value system states that where you are

1321
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,183
On the good evil side of the Divide

1322
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Pretty clearly

1323
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,511
The Japanese had something

1324
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,303
It reminds you of some of the Nazi

1325
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
Medical science

1326
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
I put that in

1327
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,447
Caesar quotes on their Unit 731 it was

1328
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,007
Was called in Manchuria in northern China

1329
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
The conductivity

1330
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,567
Experiments on human

1331
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Vivisection

1332
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
You know you infected

1333
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Fleas with bubonic plague

1334
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:39,039
Dropped them by air over Chinese cities and recorded the data

1335
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,575
Evil stuff like that

1336
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
From our Western liberal

1337
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
Enlightenment era

1338
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Face value

1339
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Are you system

1340
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
That's unrepentant

1341
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,143
Now if you take yourself out of those shoes though I went and read the

1342
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,935
Anyone should

1343
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,263
That the people who defend other points of view on

1344
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
Let's make

1345
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
Usually

1346
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
If they don't just deny

1347
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
The information outro

1348
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,735
The deniers of the Nanking atrocity or of the Holocaust do

1349
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,295
They will say yes but

1350
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,879
Yes we did these things and people are terrible but

1351
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
You did Terrible Things

1352
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
2

1353
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Things that are often not

1354
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,047
Admitted to or accepted

1355
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,399
By the liberal Democratic post-enlightenment side of this thing for example

1356
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,679
Strategic bombing

1357
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
You talk to people in

1358
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
In Japan

1359
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,263
Germany

1360
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Live

1361
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,615
The reality of their cities being bombed by sometimes

1362
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Hundreds of aircraft

1363
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,735
Sometimes multiple times sometimes with atomic bombs

1364
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,807
And they have an interesting perspective on it

1365
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,135
I'll never forget one of them saying to me

1366
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,023
If the same results had been achieved the old-fashioned way you'd come in here

1367
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
And done with bayonet

1368
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,887
The functional equivalent of what you did with bombs from a distance

1369
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
How does it look bad

1370
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Hard to get over the idea it looks a little like Nanking

1371
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
Doesn't it

1372
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Here's the thing

1373
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,639
You go to someone on the British

1374
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
And two things though that were

1375
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,247
On the receiving end of the Blitz the

1376
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,295
Luftwaffe was bombing

1377
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Of London

1378
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
And Britain

1379
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,207
Instead of saying yes that's how we felt too you'll often hear them say

1380
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
Pinotage

1381
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
You started it

1382
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
What you got back

1383
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,607
That was reaping what you sow

1384
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
And that's an interesting argument in

1385
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,983
Kind of understandable in human terms used the problem

1386
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,335
There's always been an implication that the people that are being bombed somehow

1387
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Deserve it

1388
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
And I will try to remind myself

1389
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Mike Hunt

1390
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,735
Country ever got into a war with someone else

1391
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,575
And I got bombed by them

1392
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,159
Would I somehow think I deserved it because of

1393
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
The row line

1394
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
I played

1395
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,023
And supporting my country's policies or supporting my country

1396
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,327
Or would I think that I was

1397
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
Person caught in the gears of History

1398
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,191
But I had little control over what really high

1399
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
And there's really no good

1400
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Home to fall on me

1401
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
The other argument

1402
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
You will sometimes get

1403
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
Sometimes from other Asian

1404
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,759
People sometimes other Asian people who were also victims of the Japanese

1405
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
Is they will bring it in

1406
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
The question of colonialism

1407
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
And they will say something like

1408
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
Sure the Western democracies were on their good behavior and did relatively well in terms of controlling the troops

1409
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Behaving

1410
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,143
Well militarily speaking during this conflict

1411
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,543
But look at the situation after the conflict and more importantly look at the situation before head with

1412
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:46,943
Centuries of colonialism add up all that stuff and all those evils and put them on the balance scale to Shirley

1413
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,223
The Japanese were terrible

1414
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,271
But let's not pretend that we're only tok

1415
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,367
Talking about the second world war here when we're adding up who's been terrible to home win

1416
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
This is about walking a mile in the other

1417
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
Moccasins

1418
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
It's important to can

1419
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
It is worth

1420
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Pointing out

1421
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
And many

1422
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Be here in the way

1423
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Westwood

1424
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
That the

1425
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,775
Terrible things done as part of the effort

1426
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
For 2

1427
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,591
When the Second World War

1428
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,407
Comes after these sorts of integer

1429
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,479
We're discussing here and maybe our

1430
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
Necessary

1431
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,039
Because of the kind of Internet

1432
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Since we're talking about

1433
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
That's why we spent so much time

1434
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Nanking

1435
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
Atrocity

1436
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,487
Because it's hardly the only thing going on

1437
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
This would be any

1438
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Inappropriate

1439
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
Find a Zumba

1440
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Read the story

1441
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,935
Keep one part of your peripheral vision always

1442
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
On China though

1443
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Because

1444
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
The Japanese biggest fear

1445
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:51,199
I'm getting bogged down in an endless war in China is going to come true we compared it to an addiction

1446
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
They're fully addicted they don't know how to get out

1447
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,063
And the more they conquer

1448
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,855
The worst their troubles are

1449
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,183
When the atomic bombs are dropped at the end of the war

1450
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,255
The Japanese are still bogged down in China

1451
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
I have this weird

1452
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,631
Upside down backwards Mirror Image Funhouse sort of

1453
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
View

1454
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Of the

1455
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,983
Strategic situation facing the Japanese in China

1456
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,055
It's like this weird turn around the United States

1457
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
Strategic dilemma

1458
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
In the Vietnam War

1459
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,967
Be there you had this giant Continental power the US

1460
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,295
Bog down and unable to extricate itself

1461
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,855
With any sort of these terms they can live with

1462
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
In a

1463
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
Place

1464
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,207
You say roughly just being vaguely the size of something I

1465
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
California

1466
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
The Japanese

1467
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,559
In

1468
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,607
The Chinese version of this

1469
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:47,007
They're more like the size of California and they're bogged down in the Guerrilla war and not always a guerrilla War

1470
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:50,079
In a continental landmass the size of the US

1471
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,175
The first thing I'm thinking about if I'm in the Japanese leadership is

1472
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
I don't want any more trouble

1473
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,759
With anyone else

1474
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
I'm busy

1475
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,623
And the Japanese will continue to conquer

1476
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
City after city after City they will

1477
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,255
Call the railway lines to connect these cities cities

1478
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,655
And the Chinese can just keep moving their Capital as far away as they need to go to be out of the Japanese

1479
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
In a range of the bombs all the way

1480
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
They do fall on

1481
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
The Chinese capital

1482
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
From time to time

1483
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,847
And the countryside is infested with

1484
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,151
Nationalist Army is communist Army

1485
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,967
Gorillas and surgeons warlord troops Bandits

1486
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
And there will be

1487
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,087
Hundreds of thousands usually close to a million

1488
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
Japanese troops some of their best forces to

1489
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,975
All requiring supplies all the time

1490
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
In this theater for the entire War

1491
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
As we said

1492
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
We have to zoom out

1493
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:51,519
At this point in the story because events elsewhere in the world are going to have more of an effect

1494
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,591
On what happens in this part of the

1495
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
World

1496
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:01,759
Then anything that's happening in this part of the world I mean for example as as the Europeans began to slide.

1497
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,319
Toward the second world war the Japanese are watching

1498
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,159
And is that war breaks out and gets underway

1499
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:13,535
They're paying attention to the results and reacting accordingly in other words like many powers

1500
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,839
They're trying to read the lay of the land

1501
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,191
And if the second world war will break out the lay of the land going to change

1502
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Quickly

1503
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
Tough to know

1504
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,079
Which horse to bet on when things are so fluid

1505
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,199
The 1930s as we should point out and it is important to understand the context

1506
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,503
He's a pretty crappy decade for most con

1507
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,831
It is in the Great

1508
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,135
Depths of the Great Depression

1509
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:43,231
And it is hard to exaggerate what that mean to me people think of

1510
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,303
Economic hard times but it opens the door to

1511
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,887
All sorts of political instability and problems

1512
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
On everything

1513
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
And some people like

1514
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,407
Franklin Roosevelt in the United States and leaders everywhere had their hands full trying to pull out of this economically

1515
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Nosedive

1516
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
Nobody was prepared to spend

1517
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
A lot of money

1518
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Or lot of political cap

1519
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:13,951
Or ask the country to give some great sacrifice for some calls around the world

1520
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,999
When you hardly can handle the problems

1521
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
Going to put people

1522
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
In

1523
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
Soup line

1524
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,631
In your in the streets of your major cities

1525
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
1938

1526
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
Here were things really spy

1527
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,359
Control although it's not always apparent that that's what happened

1528
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:36,223
Many people have suggested that it would have been very easy to imagine the Second World War

1529
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
Breaking out in 1938

1530
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,063
Me a lot of things happening you have

1531
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
D'Angelo's

1532
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:46,719
Where Germany annexes Austria you have the huge situation over Czechoslovakia

1533
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
Dayton wings and all that stuff

1534
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:51,839
You have the peace in our time Munich agreement

1535
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,887
And I should point out something because

1536
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
Try not to get on my soap

1537
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
Hierba drive me crazy

1538
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,775
The Munich agreement of course is where the

1539
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
The prime minister of Britain

1540
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,871
Quit going to a conference with hair Hitler

1541
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,455
Comes back gets off a plane and I've seen this unit you can go see it in the Museum's

1542
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Britain

1543
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,807
Waves this document with his signature and Hitler signature on it

1544
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,111
And declare is basically that this is peace in our time

1545
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
People apply

1546
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,207
Chamberlain is a reviled

1547
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511
To most people today

1548
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
He seen as a

1549
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
The week of

1550
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
Teaser

1551
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,607
It should have

1552
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,703
Confronted Hitler me this isn't a million things we throw its Aldi

1553
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
He's weak need

1554
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,055
Free Second World War

1555
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,079
Politically

1556
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,431
Totally forgetting to Major things in about a thousand minor

1557
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
What's going to the tomb

1558
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,759
You think the first one is D people had already live

1559
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,551
The worst war that they could never

1560
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,183
20 years ago before the first world war and nobody really knew what they were getting into

1561
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,975
In the 1930s everybody knows with

1562
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,815
Ticket in the first world war only worse again

1563
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
And too many of these people

1564
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
They thought

1565
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,983
They saw their civilization nearly knocked

1566
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,519
Out in that war

1567
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
If you're going to have another

1568
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,847
And it's going to be worse

1569
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,895
And you're starting it from a

1570
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,199
The Great Depression levels of

1571
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
Economic health

1572
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,039
What's the likely are you going to survive this

1573
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,879
What's the proper price to pay to avoid.

1574
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
Now

1575
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
What about

1576
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
The Publix

1577
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Support for knee pain

1578
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
This is the other thing

1579
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
Riley forgot

1580
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
In a place like the United States

1581
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Especially

1582
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,519
People who will log for being ahead of the power curve

1583
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,079
Guys like Winston Churchill who

1584
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,431
4C all this sort of and screaming for confrontation and

1585
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
And more

1586
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,295
Amor Bella Coast policy to ward off all this stuff

1587
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
Avoid this war

1588
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
We're tougher now

1589
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
The guy is

1590
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Like

1591
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,951
In the political wilderness

1592
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
In this.

1593
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Credence

1594
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
These

1595
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,815
Derided by many is a warmonger

1596
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,143
So he's sort of out of steps with the attitude of the time

1597
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:06,239
As we all know this war is going to break out in 1939

1598
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,591
A month after it breaks out a month after it breaks out

1599
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,383
There's a public opinion poll

1600
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
Map of America

1601
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,711
On the issue of the war

1602
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:20,575
I scolded by Francis Pike in hirohito's where I think it's a Gallup poll but I'm not sure

1603
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:27,231
All the poll taken had 84% of respondents saying that they wanted Britain and France to win

1604
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
Only 2% one of the

1605
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Irwin

1606
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,839
95%

1607
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
95%

1608
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
Wanted to stay out of the war

1609
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,495
First of all this is more roof

1610
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
The America of the

1611
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
That time.

1612
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,871
Much less interventionist Toronto

1613
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
Entire history

1614
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
Now

1615
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,991
But when you think of those kind of overwhelming number

1616
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,831
In a system where the political leaders are elected

1617
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
What is it

1618
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,183
Responsible to expect them to do

1619
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,023
How many people are going to go against that kind of supermajority

1620
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,583
What's more in a philosophical sense

1621
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:08,191
In a system where the people are supposed to sort of broadly

1622
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:14,335
Decide the course of the nation if 95% of them wants to take a left turn at the fork in the road

1623
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:18,431
Where's the moral Justice in the political leaders making a right instead

1624
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
So I think we judge these

1625
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
People harshly

1626
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Assume

1627
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,831
You know that they had more ability to

1628
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,135
Do what we want them to do than they did

1629
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,695
And of course what's remember the most important part whenever you do

1630
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
Do something like the Monday more

1631
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Quarterback

1632
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,047
History we know how things turn out

1633
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Datong

1634
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,911
Mother having been said

1635
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Famously

1636
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,495
The Munich agreement falls through

1637
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,287
Poland is invaded

1638
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Member 1st

1639
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
1939

1640
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,919
Old and it been given a guarantee by Britain and France because they

1641
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
They finally had enough of his

1642
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
I don't want anymore

1643
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
Don't worry

1644
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
And when the

1645
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,855
Nazis refused to leave Poland

1646
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,159
After it's demanded of them the war is on

1647
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,695
Money in Europe and the Japanese are

1648
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
Now as we know

1649
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,839
Poland is overrun

1650
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
Quickly

1651
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:15,775
The post-war propaganda calls it Blitzkrieg what it really looks like is just the first World War

1652
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
Texas strategy

1653
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,359
And philosophy developed over 20 years

1654
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Then there's this

1655
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
Stop. That sometimes called

1656
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
The phony War

1657
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271
Or where nothing much is going

1658
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:31,391
And then in April 1940 Germany invades Denmark and Norway and conquers them

1659
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,415
Pretty quickly

1660
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
And then a month later not even a month

1661
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
I don't think I'm

1662
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
May 1940

1663
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
Not necessarily

1664
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,911
Winston Churchill

1665
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
Becomes prime minister

1666
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
So now we have one of the major players

1667
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
In this story

1668
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Ensconced in power

1669
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
Decision maker

1670
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,663
Famously Pitbull liking his

1671
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Bellicosity

1672
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,247
And yet at the same time

1673
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,575
Seemingly the right man for the job because I mean

1674
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,159
If Churchill was a bit of a lemon antagonist in it

1675
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,047
And a fighter that was a little bit embarrassing in more peaceful times he's exactly what you need now that the war's going isn't he

1676
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
But may is also the month

1677
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Where are the

1678
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:19,519
Tony war ends on the Western Front the German blow through a couple of neutral countries

1679
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
And then enter France

1680
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,847
We should point out another real

1681
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,639
During the time. That's often for

1682
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
Forgot now

1683
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,015
France is widely considered to be the strongest land power in the world

1684
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
At this time.

1685
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
Many International

1686
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
Calculator

1687
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Nations are based on this

1688
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
Assumption

1689
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
This assumption would prove to be

1690
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Quickly

1691
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
France will be.

1692
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Defeated

1693
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
In a mere six weeks

1694
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,727
To put that in perspective

1695
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
Understand how

1696
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,311
Incredibly shocking that is

1697
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
For this time.

1698
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
You're talkin about country here

1699
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,199
It only 20 years previously

1700
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,735
Had spent

1701
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
More than a million

1702
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,319
Of their soldiers lives

1703
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,415
Holding off arguably the greatest army of the Aged

1704
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,487
The first world war German Army for more than 4 years

1705
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,119
And remember not only has France defeated here

1706
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,959
But the Dutch are defeated as part of

1707
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,263
The Germans blowing through this area

1708
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,615
And the British look like they're 5 minutes away from succumbing as well

1709
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:32,223
If you're making calculations based on world events in Japan

1710
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:37,855
All of a sudden all of these valuable areas in your neck of the woods that are controlled by

1711
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
The Dutch

1712
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
And the French

1713
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
And the British

1714
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,535
Don't seem so formidably defended anymore

1715
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:51,423
Remember if your Japan you might not even be looking at those places

1716
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:57,055
If you could just hold on to China and Conquer it and use its resources that's all they need

1717
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,871
Really couldn't give you everything you wanted but

1718
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:04,479
Miniature pans looking to be a great power and they think they have to suck up China to do it

1719
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:10,367
Everything in their policy is based on being able to maintain that addiction

1720
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,975
They only start looking towards some of these other

1721
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
Tempting areas like

1722
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,583
French Indochina modern-day Vietnam Laos

1723
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Cambodia

1724
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,423
Because some of the more obvious

1725
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,775
Avenues towards supplying your War Machine

1726
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Are being squeezed

1727
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
By other powers

1728
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,919
If you go look at the

1729
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Economic

1730
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:39,551
I'm excited the second world war which is a very popular way to look at it

1731
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,855
Lately and I find it very value

1732
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,159
In terms of understand some of the deeper motivation

1733
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,463
All of the Axis powers

1734
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
Words were concerned

1735
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
Self-sufficiency

1736
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Autarky

1737
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:57,727
And this is actually playing into the global trade situation involves economics in a way that kind of explains War motivation very

1738
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,287
Well but the reason that countries like

1739
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Germany

1740
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,127
Free sample wanted self-sufficiency was in part because

1741
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,431
They've been starved to death in the first world

1742
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,015
When their shipping and trade was cut off by the British Navy

1743
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,831
These countries wanted the flexibility to

1744
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,879
To be relatively immune

1745
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,183
To other countries economic pressure

1746
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,815
The Japanese wanted to do what they wanted to do in China

1747
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
And wanted to be able to

1748
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,679
Flip the middle finger to countries that told him to stop

1749
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
Unfortunately

1750
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,567
In this time. They depended on other countries too much

1751
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,455
Historian James L McClain rights in a modern history of Japan quote

1752
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,807
To the regretted mini Japanese economic planners

1753
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
In the late 1930s

1754
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:49,951
Japan still depended upon the United States for nearly one-third of its Imports

1755
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,023
From cotton to scrap iron and oil

1756
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,071
And matter seem to be growing worse

1757
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:59,679
Between 1929 and 1932 Japan purchased from the United States

1758
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,983
36% of its scrap iron

1759
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,055
Used to manufacture steel for Munitions and ships

1760
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:09,919
By 1938 American sources were supplying 74% of Japan

1761
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Scrap

1762
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:16,575
Similarly in 1938 Japan received more than 60% of its imported Machine Tools

1763
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:20,159
I nearly all sophisticated Alloys such as vanadium

1764
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
And molybdenum from the United States

1765
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,767
Traditionally self-sufficient in Copper

1766
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,375
Japan in 1939 extracted 90000 tons of that metal from its mine

1767
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:36,031
What industry was gobbling up so much for detonators and shell casings that the nation that year had to import a hundred and five

1768
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,311
Thousand tons of copper

1769
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,359
93% of it from the United States

1770
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:44,991
The situation for oil the most critical of all Commodities in the estimation of military planners

1771
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Was extremely desperate

1772
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,111
Japan relied on America for almost 80% of its fuel

1773
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,951
Emperor special distillates dependent student more than 90%

1774
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,023
In the eyes of Economic and military strategists

1775
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:03,423
By the summer of 1940 Western colonies in Southeast Asia had come to represent a treasure Trove of wrong

1776
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
Materials

1777
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:09,055
Whose possession would allow Japan to Vault into the ranks of the economic have

1778
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,127
To recall one of their prime minister's phrases

1779
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,431
And duster free itself from dependence

1780
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,735
Upon an increasingly hostile West

1781
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
And quote

1782
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,367
You can see why a concept like

1783
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
National

1784
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,927
Self-sufficiency

1785
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Attractive

1786
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
To someone like

1787
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Dependent on these outside powers

1788
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,447
To sell them what they need especially what they need to keep the war machine running

1789
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,007
So what happens

1790
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:44,383
If the people who sell you the stuff you need to keep the war machine running stop selling you the stuff you need

1791
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,687
And that becomes

1792
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
The story

1793
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,015
I know many of you are

1794
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Ora's fascinate

1795
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Adidas I am

1796
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
I have wars

1797
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
It started

1798
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
And there is no temp

1799
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
They're all different

1800
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
The variable

1801
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
The same

1802
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
But you can see

1803
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,839
You know similar patterns and in this particular case you see the

1804
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,399
Pattern of a sort of inertia developer

1805
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
You saw this in the first World War

1806
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
Described it

1807
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,519
Like someone pulling

1808
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
Hand grenade

1809
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
But you could also think about it like a

1810
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
Fuse being lit

1811
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,688
It's when events start to move

1812
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Towards Collision

1813
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,528
And at a certain point it almost becomes easier

1814
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,088
To run into each other and have a conflict

1815
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,136
Then to break out of

1816
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
The pattern and in this case

1817
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
Going to be

1818
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,536
A question of eating the Japanese War Machine

1819
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Skip this Dynamic going

1820
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:41,728
And I was trying to get into all the tit-for-tat things and it got very complicated because they're so many players

1821
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,008
And as we said earlier in

1822
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
Important to remember

1823
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:49,664
That in the Japanese government just like the Western democracies there is no hive mind

1824
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
At work

1825
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,224
There are lots of different ideas

1826
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,576
What's the best foreign policy directions are to go and different factions favoring differ

1827
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,880
Fun things and based on events

1828
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:02,464
Some factions are exalted and others are in Decline

1829
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,048
So there is no concerted

1830
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
Foreign policy effort

1831
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
Cities with outfits and start

1832
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Send a certain level of Chaos

1833
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
In the case of the Japanese

1834
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
And we talked about this earlier in the story

1835
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,640
Their governmental design is already not

1836
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,688
Wonderful

1837
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,528
In terms of accountability and the lines of command and all these things

1838
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,184
When we start getting to a moment where the stress level and the need for efficiency and clear thing

1839
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,232
Thinking and clear lines of authority

1840
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
I'm really important

1841
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:42,656
This government's going to break down in such a way that if you are a Japanese citizen that you have every right to

1842
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
Accuse them of some kind of criminal negligence

1843
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,800
Because look what the Japanese are

1844
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,848
You know right around the time

1845
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:57,248
France Falls where they have a major war and commitment going on in China there already rationing luxury goods and fuel

1846
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
The people are already grumbling

1847
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,624
And then what 18 months later

1848
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,720
When you add to that burden a war against

1849
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,024
The United States Great Britain France

1850
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
All there

1851
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,632
Former Colonial dominions and Commonwealth Nations

1852
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Mean

1853
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,448
How the hell does that happen

1854
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
Well in a broad sense it happens

1855
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,360
Because of a decision

1856
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
To stop

1857
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,688
The Japanese War Machine

1858
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:35,136
If you look at it objectively that becomes the issue where there's no given this is very controversy because everybody

1859
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,720
Are you forever what the cause of the Pacific meet award who's at fault

1860
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:44,096
But if you look at it if it becomes pretty simple that the Japanese priorities

1861
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,168
And the Americans and British the Anglo America

1862
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
You can call them

1863
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,216
Priorities

1864
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:49,984
Clash

1865
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:54,592
And the priorities have to do with what it is the Japanese are addicted to

1866
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
China

1867
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,712
The whole reason I like the addiction analogy

1868
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
It's because of where we're coming to

1869
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,136
There's going to be the global equivalent of an intervention here in the Japanese are going to be told

1870
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,416
But they have to stop

1871
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:14,304
Inflating themselves on the steroids that are the Chinese resources and land mass and all that

1872
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,120
And if they don't

1873
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,680
Stop they're going to get the means to that

1874
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,728
Cut off the means are things like oil

1875
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,568
Now worth pointing out cuz it's interesting from a military history standpoint

1876
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,128
The second world war is really the first big war

1877
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,688
Where oil is this super important resource

1878
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
Award-winning or War losing

1879
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016
Resource at a certain point

1880
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Guilin

1881
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
Most War

1882
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,672
Have a component of

1883
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,720
Resources involves some

1884
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Way or another

1885
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,304
Now what's interesting is over the air is often

1886
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,864
The important resource that you need to have changes

1887
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
Right during the

1888
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,984
Bronze Age having the Monopoly on the making of iron in

1889
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
And stuff like that at the National Security

1890
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,592
Why aren't still important in the 20th century but

1891
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:02,944
I mean it wasn't all that important all Petroleum in the Bronze Age

1892
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,968
Is critical

1893
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,272
In this area I think about the knee

1894
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,880
To have it for your Air Force if nothing else but also

1895
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,928
You know since the first World War

1896
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,512
Before the first world war they started changing over from coal

1897
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
2 oil

1898
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,608
For the fuel for all of their ships all the major powers

1899
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,936
Algae that creates a dependency you didn't have

1900
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
4

1901
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:31,104
In countries like Japan which didn't have a lot of oil to begin with let's just say almost none a little in the sakhalin island

1902
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
But almost none

1903
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:37,760
Are in a bind if the people you normally buy oil from decide to squeeze you

1904
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,088
This is an interesting thing to look at

1905
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
Because

1906
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:47,232
I remember as a kid growing up I lived through something that if you look in your history books now with a known historical

1907
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:53,120
Event with long-term huge ramifications that we still live with today at the time

1908
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:57,984
We just called it the oil crisis when I was a kid in 1973

1909
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,032
Long story short

1910
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:06,432
A cartel of oil producing Nations wanted to get the United States and friends to change their foreign policy

1911
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,456
Priorities

1912
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,736
As they related

1913
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
To his realtor

1914
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
The war in the Middle East going on

1915
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:15,136
Decided to squeeze the United States and Friends oil supply

1916
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,696
I have to get the price to rise to sort of

1917
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,768
Chorus might not be

1918
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,632
A strong enough word petrol blackmail is a word they sometimes use

1919
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,936
To get the United States to change its foreign policy

1920
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:36,128
The attitude that the US government had was completely understandable unpredictably attitude they have is no great power

1921
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:40,480
Our is going to let anybody dictate what their foreign policy priority should be

1922
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,576
Anywhere few people in the Nixon Administration that we're basically talking about

1923
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,624
In a listen if you don't sell the oil

1924
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:52,256
At a decent price where to come and take them

1925
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,864
You can understand the idea of no great Powers going to let another

1926
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,400
Country

1927
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,936
Dictate words

1928
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
We should be

1929
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,824
But during this period of time that's exactly what the Anglo American nations are going to do today

1930
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,592
Did the Japanese

1931
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:12,480
And in the same way it's hard to imagine the United States knuckling-under

1932
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,016
To the demands

1933
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:19,904
Of an oil cartel and changing its foreign policy it's hard to imagine the Japanese

1934
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:26,560
Publicly with their tail between their legs completely altering more than a decade's worth of 4

1935
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
Foreign policy

1936
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:34,240
And doing what the great power tells them to do otherwise they won't get any oil which they really needed to run the war

1937
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,056
War Machine in China which they wouldn't be in anymore

1938
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:43,456
But because it is so obviously something that might lead directly to war

1939
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,272
There is always been one side of the debate

1940
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
In the United States and elsewhere

1941
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,368
About how much

1942
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,976
We're going to talk about now these economic embargoes and sanctions

1943
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,328
And asset freezes and those kinds of things how much that was

1944
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,144
A nonviolent way

1945
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,776
To express the moral outrage of the public at the Japanese treatment of the Chinese and all this kind of stuff

1946
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,800
Versus

1947
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:14,944
A shove in a direction that the people in the know understood would lead directly to war

1948
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,504
That's why

1949
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,112
We're going to deal with a couple different sides of the debate here because this is not settle stuff

1950
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Play very hard

1951
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
You believe

1952
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,512
But there are number different

1953
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Ways to look at

1954
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,840
There's a place

1955
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:36,704
Where power politics and moral outrage intersect

1956
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,544
And power politics in a realpolitik

1957
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
And

1958
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,384
Moral outrage from

1959
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:49,504
Country like United States or Great Britain or any of these Western democracies these things are usually at odds with each other

1960
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:55,904
Mean a lot of times you have people like National Security advisor Henry Kissinger who was Nixon's National Security advisor

1961
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
Lamented the idea

1962
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:04,352
That he should be constrained by the public so that we be attitudes towards nation-states when he's trying to

1963
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:09,728
In a create treaties that keep nuclear war from breaking out from let's keep our eyes on the prize here in the nation's of Interest

1964
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Right

1965
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,288
And yet at the same time

1966
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,824
How do you expect a public

1967
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,408
Who's reading all this terrible stuff coming out of the War in China

1968
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:23,040
And babies being bombed in a people being beheaded and rapes of cities about to happen any minute now in the story

1969
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,112
How do you tell that public

1970
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,928
That they should just sit idly by and do nothing

1971
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,488
What's more what if

1972
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,584
Your country is providing the means necessary

1973
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,888
For these events even take place where are you

1974
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,424
It's certainly understandable.

1975
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,704
Flightreacts

1976
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
In fact

1977
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
You might worry about it

1978
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
Trees popular

1979
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
Malaysian the didn't

1980
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
In this case

1981
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,736
With a nation so against going to war

1982
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:56,320
What are the options that the president has in a situation like

1983
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Is right

1984
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,112
Well

1985
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,672
This begins to become clear

1986
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,744
In October 1937 in a famous speech that

1987
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,328
The president of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt give

1988
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
This is about a month or two before the Nanking massacre

1989
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,216
What happens what it's on the horizon

1990
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,264
In the Battle of Shanghai all that's happened

1991
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
And Roosevelt give this

1992
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,616
Speech where he talks about aggressor Nation

1993
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
He talks about

1994
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968
Their conduct being

1995
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,576
Like a contagion like a disease that will spread and he Compares it to what you do

1996
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,136
When people have diseases you quarantine them right

1997
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,952
He suggesting that that's what you be done today

1998
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,488
Aggressor States

1999
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Here's a sample

2000
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,096
1937 quarantine speech

2001
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,120
I present

2002
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:41,888
Franklin Delano

2003
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
Roosevelt

2004
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,216
It seems to be unfortunately true

2005
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,824
That the epidemic is spreading

2006
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,176
The best well

2007
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,224
Where am I

2008
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
Physical disease

2009
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:04,160
The community approves and joins in

2010
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,464
Eggs florentine

2011
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
Of the patients

2012
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:12,096
In order to protect the health of the community

2013
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:15,424
Against the spread of the disease

2014
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,152
It is my determination

2015
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,248
Go fast Chevrolet policy

2016
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:34,880
It is my determination to adopt every practicable measure

2017
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,720
Do I avoid involvement in law

2018
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,656
It ought to be

2019
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
Inconceivable

2020
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
That in this

2021
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,824
And in the face of experience

2022
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,664
Alienation could be so foolish and ruthless

2023
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:02,272
Time to run the risk of fronting the whole world

2024
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,832
By invading and violating

2025
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:07,392
In contravention of solemn trailers

2026
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,696
The territory of other nations

2027
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,512
Set up Dunlop no real home

2028
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,304
Sandwich shop 2 weeks

2029
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,864
No protect themselves adequately

2030
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,680
Just a piece of the world

2031
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,984
And the welfare and security

2032
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,800
Every Nation including our own

2033
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,848
Is today being threatened

2034
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:35,552
Now if this seems like a rather weak speech in terms of specifics and what not you wouldn't be the

2035
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:39,904
The only person that says so Francis Pike seems to indicate that Roosevelt

2036
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:45,536
Kind of weak on all the stuff for a while he said that this speech was just being a Roosevelt Field of testing the waters

2037
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,608
We gave some polling information earlier

2038
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:53,728
It gives you an idea about the attitude of the American electorate during this time

2039
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,312
If the president of the United States thanks

2040
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,408
That there's a very important direction that the country needs to go

2041
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:06,272
But the country doesn't want to go there what should the president of the United States

2042
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,368
It's worth examining this enigma

2043
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:13,184
That is President Franklin Delano Roosevelt

2044
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,464
For a minute because he's eight

2045
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,000
He part of this story

2046
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,632
He's unlike any other US president in history

2047
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,424
He was elected

2048
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
2 twice as many terms

2049
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,752
Has any other president

2050
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:30,080
The Constitution after he left the scene

2051
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,384
But that would never happen again

2052
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
But it gave him

2053
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:40,832
An unparalleled amount of actual practical hands-on experience with the levers of government

2054
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,416
Nobody ever move them any better

2055
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,208
Then Franklin Roosevelt did

2056
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,560
Roosevelt and unusually

2057
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:57,216
Hard to figure out US president you would think a guy that was on the scene as long as he was would have all sorts of him

2058
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,496
Information attached to

2059
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:02,080
Feelings about things but he died in office

2060
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,384
Early into the fourth term by the way

2061
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:11,296
Which meant we didn't get the normal run of presidential Memoirs and all that stuff afterwards because even if it's a pack of Lies

2062
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:15,904
My eyes are self-serving justifications historians have a way of using that to really

2063
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,744
Flesh things out and compare them to other events and whatnot triangulate

2064
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,792
But you don't even get that from Roosevelt

2065
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:26,656
And he was a hard to read guy anyway almost by

2066
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,192
It is very nature

2067
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
He still elicits

2068
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:34,592
Extremely strong emotions in

2069
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:40,224
Mini directions I mean at the time there was a euphemism for him the people who hated his guts

2070
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,248
Used

2071
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,320
They wouldn't mention his name they call him Batman in the White House

2072
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:52,000
Conservative Americans often saw Roosevelt as damn near socialist

2073
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,840
Man who exploded the size of the America

2074
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Government

2075
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:01,472
Put it in in all sorts of areas where did never stuck its nose in before

2076
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,544
Transferred money

2077
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,848
From the wealthier classes

2078
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,408
To the poorer classes set up all kinds of

2079
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:14,272
Agencies appear to be doing all kinds of things spending all kinds of money but we're there really any results

2080
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
Changing America fundamentally

2081
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:22,976
There is a before Franklin Roosevelt and after Franklin Roosevelt

2082
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
America

2083
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,304
He's arguably the most

2084
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,376
Transformative president that's ever been

2085
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,400
Again

2086
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,424
Part of it being

2087
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,728
How long he serve but also because

2088
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:40,128
When you serve during such major events of the Great Depression followed by the second world war you're going to be around

2089
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,408
When all kinds of things

2090
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,432
Transformed

2091
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,504
And you're going to be trying to ride the storm

2092
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
The captain of maybe

2093
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
Maybe

2094
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
The most powerful

2095
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,392
Will ship in the world

2096
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,072
To a lot of Americans liberal certainly but a lot of poor destitute Americans of the Great Depression Roosevelt

2097
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
Hero

2098
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,192
If he wasn't achieving things that wasn't for lack of trying

2099
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,240
He was literally doing

2100
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
You know programs were people

2101
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:14,176
Did all kinds of things that weren't even necessary in the government would hand them out of paycheck although they also did a ton of things

2102
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,480
That we still benefit from today

2103
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,760
All kinds of milk

2104
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,832
Conservation cores in all these things it would put people

2105
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
To work

2106
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
Simply to

2107
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
Put them to work

2108
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:29,792
Try to prime the pump of the American you cannot make engine and get things going again

2109
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:34,144
There were a lot of Americans who had food on the table because of Franklin Roosevelt

2110
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,680
That'll make you pretty pop

2111
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,472
Might even get you elected

2112
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Before Time

2113
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,080
Defenders would argue

2114
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:48,480
That if Roosevelt put in a lot of programs that conservatives thought of as socialist things like Social Security

2115
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:51,552
By the way or a Roosevelt a new deal program

2116
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,904
He was up against competition from other forms of government

2117
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
Like

2118
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,208
Bolshevism

2119
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,000
And fascism

2120
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:03,072
Took over in countries with political instability taken hold

2121
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:06,400
YouTube horrible economic situations in part

2122
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:12,544
Defenders would argue that Roosevelt managed to steer the United States

2123
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,384
Away from either one of those extremes and as one of my

2124
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,408
Professors put it

2125
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:21,248
Gave the country a little socialism to avoid having them demand a lot

2126
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Views on Roosevelt

2127
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Run the game

2128
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,672
Francis Pike in his

2129
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,488
Book about the Pacific War hirohito's war

2130
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,608
Talks about Roosevelt and points out that the guy is a hard man

2131
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,376
To figure out

2132
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,424
Rights quote

2133
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:44,800
At the best of times Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a difficult man to read

2134
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,640
Henry Wallace his former vice president said of him

2135
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Now wallet

2136
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
He doesn't know any man

2137
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:55,808
No man knows him even his own family doesn't know anything about him

2138
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,856
Now quoting Roosevelt

2139
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,392
I am like a cat

2140
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
He said about himself

2141
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
I make a stroke and then I relax

2142
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
Ike says quote

2143
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,584
Loved and respected as a leader

2144
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,424
Seemingly happiest in the company of women he was an enigma

2145
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,216
Detached enigmatic

2146
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:14,240
And ruthless

2147
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:19,104
What flying over Cairo Roosevelt glanced out the window and said

2148
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,896
Call my friend the Sphinx

2149
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
And quote

Hedley Donovan

2153
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,880
We met like seven presidents personally

2154
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:35,488
Newroz valuable Roosevelt was the first of the presidents that he knew and even wrote a book

2155
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
All the presidents

2156
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,584
He said about Roosevelt

2157
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,352
Quote

2158
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:43,424
FDR could brilliantly oversimplify

2159
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,984
Is best remembered single statement

2160
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,800
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself

2161
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Is patently absurd

2162
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:54,688
Emma's probably excellent tonic for a country whose banking system collapse

2163
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:58,016
But in the early and middle stages of decision making

2164
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:03,648
Before it was time to simplify and oversimplify Roosevelt could be impenetrable

2165
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:08,000
Rexford tugwell one of the early New Deal Brain Trust jurors wrote

2166
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,792
Now coding tugwell

2167
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,096
No one could tell what he was thinking

2168
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,656
To say nothing of what he was feeling

2169
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,192
Donovan continues

2170
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,264
He clearly relished being hard to figure out

2171
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,312
He likes secrets and had a few

2172
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,128
He was often devious for good reason

2173
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,688
Could also be devious just for the fun of it

2174
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,760
General Douglas MacArthur who despised him

2175
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,040
Ted Roosevelt

2176
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,576
Coding MacArthur now

2177
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:36,416
We never tell the truth when a lie would serve him just as well

2178
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,696
Donovan continue

2179
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Quote

2180
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
This was considerable slander

2181
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:46,400
What FDR unquestionably did enjoy manipulation and maneuver for their own sake

2182
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:49,472
All part of the great game of politics and Power

2183
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,008
Benny says

2184
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:56,128
He was also a man of deep convictions a dedication and unquenchable idealism

2185
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,504
He was firm and Serene in his religious faith and have a decent sense of privacy about

2186
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,344
It is impossible to imagine him at a congressional prayer breakfast

2187
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,672
He was impatient with the abstract or theoretical

2188
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,256
In no sense profound but spacious in vision

2189
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:15,072
America an ultimately all the nations

2190
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:21,728
He believed if not in the perfectibility of man in a rather spectacular Improvement in man's behave

2191
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,008
Saviour worldwide

2192
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
And quote

2193
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,104
This impenetrability

2194
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
Roosevelt

2195
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,176
So has kind of worked against him

2196
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
In terms of

2197
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:37,856
Is place in history because it leaves a lot of room for people to speculate about his motives

2198
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
And often times

2199
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,952
It gets wrapped up with

2200
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:46,048
People's politics ideologies worldviews and even

2201
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,584
Conspiracy theories

2202
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,144
Roosevelt

2203
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,936
Everything from

2204
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,984
A well-meaning

2205
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,032
Moral crusader

2206
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:01,152
Desperately trying to avoid war with Japan while still getting them to change their evil ways

2207
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,528
Two on the very far side of the other Spectrum off and conspiracy land

2208
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,880
Roosevelt is a man who Engineers this War years in advance

2209
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,696
Organized is it pushes the Japanese into it

2210
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:20,096
Knows about it in advance and then luckily orders the carriers out of Pearl Harbor just in time

2211
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
I'm so they don't get hurt

2212
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,936
Cuz he's also aware that carriers are going to be

2213
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,728
In the new battleships in the

2214
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,264
Modern Age Wichita

2215
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,824
Quite know yet but nonetheless

2216
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:30,848
Runs again

2217
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,152
Who is this Franklin Roosevelt

2218
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Hawkeye right

2219
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,944
Sneaky

2220
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
Conniving

2221
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,016
Let's remember

2222
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:42,880
He was elected originally way back in 1932

2223
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,672
To deal with the depression

2224
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:52,096
The things he did to deal with the depression were really effective at the time at least in making people feel

2225
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,912
Feel like somebody was finally doing something

2226
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:59,776
He left behind a lot of legacies that people in the United States argue over everything

2227
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
From

2228
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,592
In a bunch of different

2229
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:05,920
Government departments to things like Social Security

2230
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Roosevelt

2231
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,528
Looks to me like one of those

2232
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,064
People who has

2233
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,136
The reality Distortion field ability

2234
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,696
That was something Steve Jobs was supposed to have

2235
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
Up to

2236
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,000
Supposedly

2237
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,304
A guy like jobs or

2238
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,840
Maybe Roosevelt

2239
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:30,240
Could convince you that a job that was really hard to imagine anybody doing anything about was totally possible and where

2240
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
We're on the way

2241
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,800
Baby Elon Musk

2242
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,592
Has that ability to

2243
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
But

2244
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,944
I read that Andy hertzfeld was the one who

2245
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,712
Said that

2246
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:43,040
The reality Distortion field was a combination of

2247
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,600
Charm bravado

2248
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:50,720
Charisma hyperbole marketing appeasement and persistence

2249
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,256
And that

2250
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,536
Really sounds like

2251
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,096
Pretty good description of Roosevelt to me

2252
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,888
I wish. One of the best

2253
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,424
Examples of

2254
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,984
The Factory Roosevelt possessed disability

2255
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,824
Was that while never not admitting and being open about

2256
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,616
The information

2257
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,944
He sort of made the country just forget

2258
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,760
That he was paralyzed

2259
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,296
Below the waist

2260
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:22,208
You got polio is an adult he was confined to a wheelchair you didn't see pictures of that the pictures usually show him at electr

2261
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,232
Turn 4

2262
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,536
Seated with other world leaders

2263
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,072
Appearing

2264
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:30,912
Completely able-bodied you didn't but he didn't hide it really I mean

2265
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:37,056
There was talk of it everybody knew but she could just make you forget nowadays it would be something that was celebrated

2266
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,104
An exalted in used as an example

2267
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,944
Right of the possibilities don't let anything hold you back the president himself

2268
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Or herself

2269
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Uses a wheelchair

2270
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Right

2271
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
Industrious

2272
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:52,672
Roosevelt was it interesting and interesting sort of Steve Jobs age is not a bad description of him

2273
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,976
But if you didn't like his policies

2274
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:59,072
The reality Distortion field almost seems nefarious doesn't

2275
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,888
Now some of the people who thought

2276
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,448
Roosevelt most nefarious

2277
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,264
Are the people who wanted to see the United States

2278
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,640
Stay clear this new world war that had broken out in Europe you know by 1940s we said you have

2279
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:19,552
The German Army blowing through France and occupying Western Europe and by the way the stories coming out from that one

2280
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,856
What a harsh occupation how horrible it is

2281
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:24,928
Something that moves public opinion yet again

2282
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:29,536
It should be pointed out cuz it probably played into it in a major way

2283
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:35,936
The 1940 is a presidential election year in the United States and Roosevelt is running for an unprecedented

2284
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,216
Ended third term

2285
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,264
I read one history

2286
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,152
The prettiest way when they said that Roosevelt and his Republican opponent were vying to outdo each other

2287
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,552
With their promises that they would keep the country out of the European War other words there was no opponent running that said that they

2288
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:56,416
They would get them in the war it was a competition to see who could be most passionate about saying they would stay out of it

2289
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,464
And when Republican hopeful

2290
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:04,864
Wendell willkie charges that the president is secretly trying to get the us into the war or doing things that would get the US in

2291
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,656
In the war Roosevelt issues

2292
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
Solomon

2293
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,104
Play in the Democratic party platform and Roosevelt on the stumps is it over and over again this is from a campaign speech

2294
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:21,504
Not long before the election given in October 1940 we're Roosevelt references all the other times that he said it

2295
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
He says quote

2296
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,832
I have said this before

2297
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,928
But I shall say it again and again and again

2298
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:34,560
Your boys are not going to be sent into any Foreign Wars

2299
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,096
And quote

2300
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:39,936
Now

2301
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,752
Can you write that off as a

2302
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,056
Campaign promise if he breaks it

2303
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:48,384
Is this like you know I won't raise your taxes

2304
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,408
Lottery wins

2305
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,456
There's a problem with this in America

2306
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Consistent to

2307
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,784
Because there's precious few ways for the

2308
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,600
Public to weigh in on foreign policy in the country

2309
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:03,232
The presidents or people who want to be the presidents often make promises about foreign policy

2310
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,536
If they break those promises

2311
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,840
What does that mean for the ability of the

2312
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,864
The population

2313
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
To influence

2314
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,936
The country's foreign policy for example

2315
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,240
Some of the people most upset with

2316
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:19,104
Where Roosevelt is going are people that think that they can see through

2317
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
Is

2318
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:24,992
Why they see the midline is right when he says I'm not trying to get the country into war they're looking at what's actually happening

2319
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,904
And Roosevelt is mimicking many of the same things that Democratic President Woodrow Wilson did the year before the you

2320
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,696
Who asked God into the first World War

2321
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,536
Wilson also promising by the way that he won't get our boys you know

2322
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,840
To give their blood in the European War

2323
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:42,912
What is it 5 months after he wins the election there there

2324
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:47,264
And Roosevelt won't be the last person in the 20th century to do it

2325
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:49,568
There was a

2326
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,848
Very interesting argument

2327
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,664
Though that I read by historian Campbell Craig

2328
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
And I hope I got

2329
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:55,968
Get it right

2330
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,528
The spirit of it anyway but he was talking about

2331
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:04,672
American history Charles Austin beard who had his reputation destroyed when after the second world war he wrote a book

2332
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:07,232
That treated Roosevelt a little like

2333
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:10,304
Criminal in a docket and he was the prosecuting attorney in

2334
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,888
What he was trying to prove with that Roosevelt was involved in the conspiracy

2335
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,728
To take the country into the European war against the will of the country

2336
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Anne Frank

2337
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,568
A very interesting argument he said that

2338
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,128
Some historians are mad

2339
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,176
Charles Austin beard for saying that they were taken

2340
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:30,016
Conspiracies in the US government all the time

2341
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:34,368
Easter the conspiracies not the problem in the reason that beard was discredited

2342
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,720
Beard was just credited because Roosevelt turned out to have done

2343
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,304
What do you American people afterwards decided they approved

2344
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,912
So maybe you could compare him to the way we talked about Churchill

2345
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:49,472
In the era where Churchill was out of power

2346
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:54,336
His bellicose nature was out of touch with the tenor of those times

2347
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,664
Could Roosevelt be said to be more far-seeing

2348
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,552
The American public they met 95% of them say they don't want to get involved in this European war that maybe Roosevelt knows better

2349
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:08,160
And if I read Campbell Craig correctly he's saying that the public opinion polls

2350
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:14,560
After the war in the approval rating the people have for that in the fact that the guy who didn't want to be in that war Charles Austin beard

2351
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:18,912
The public turning in cuz it's such an unpopular attitude baby the argument is FDR with right

2352
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:25,824
Sometimes you have to lead from the front right at the American public aren't ready yet I'm ahead of the curve they will agree with me when we get

2353
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,128
Although

2354
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:34,528
As we said it was an election year and if you want to read the polls a certain way you could argue that Roosevelt was doing exactly what the police

2355
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,320
Data scenes you want him to do

2356
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:40,160
Right you have an overwhelming majority that do not want to send our boys over there to fight

2357
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:44,768
But you also have an overwhelming majority that want to see Britain and France prevail

2358
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,608
So those are the parameter is what sort of room for manoeuvre do you have

2359
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:52,192
Well many of the same things Woodrow Wilson did in the first World War

2360
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,472
Warframe

2361
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,264
You can help the allies

2362
01:47:56,288 --> 01:48:02,432
That's a bit of a problem when you're portraying yourself as a neutral country which is officially with the US was portraying itself in the first

2363
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
For whereas to a neutral country

2364
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,760
And you get argument again

2365
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,528
General

2366
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,064
Marine Corps General

2367
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,856
Smedley Butler I think he stole the

2368
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:13,440
A whole book

2369
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,976
Small book with a whole book

2370
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:18,304
Talking about how we were following the same pattern again

2371
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,424
And we're just going to run into the same kind of problems and that the people in power know this already

2372
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:29,312
Charles Austin beard himself eight years before the war predicted it would come from an incident or provocation and then there you go

2373
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,104
Well when you have

2374
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,896
German submarines

2375
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,712
Torpedoing British Merchant ships

2376
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:40,064
5 seconds after they leave the Eastern Seaboard Sports

2377
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:44,160
Maybe with some Americans on them isn't that just

2378
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,952
Setting up a provocation

2379
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:52,608
Isn't that exactly like what happened in the first World War I think there's a Life Magazine photograph I think I remember showing

2380
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:59,008
The explosion of a tank or something heading for Britain right off the u.s. shore and you can see the lights of

2381
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:02,336
Like New Jersey's Boardwalk or something in the distance at night

2382
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:05,408
You got to be crazy to think that that's not going to lead

2383
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:12,064
2 something that sucks a country into the war what's more Roosevelts got an Undeclared sort of War going and it's understand

2384
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,344
Hannibal why you would

2385
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:19,744
Sending US destroyers out to stalk those German submarines right the neutral country but Roosevelt could argue

2386
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:23,072
A lot of Americans would agree hey hey hey we can't have

2387
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,888
In submarine torpedo in people so close to us

2388
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,752
An argument can be made that Roosevelt was sort of following

2389
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:36,384
He said he was pushing it to the limits of the law but you can make an argument just like you can that he wanted the country into war

2390
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,200
But he every step of the way was doing the next

2391
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:42,784
Logical step in a progression and hoping it didn't go any farther

2392
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,600
Certainly you can make a better argument for that in Asia

2393
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
The Pacific

2394
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,416
Roosevelt is quoted in a cup

2395
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:56,864
Pacific because he only has one Navy in the implication is he's going to need it in the Atlantic against the Nazis but

2396
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,400
Let's be honest with a guy

2397
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,960
I like this that doesn't mean anything he's much more

2398
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,264
Nuanced and layered than that

2399
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:06,080
Some of the modern histories I've read on the

2400
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,616
Have a very interesting

2401
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:12,224
You point that I hadn't considered which shows you the blind spot of the kind of histories we used to read

2402
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,296
The more modern history point out things from the other side that make

2403
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,064
Clear

2404
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
Things that we forgot

2405
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,624
And then one of them is

2406
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,952
Debating whether or not Roosevelt wanted a war against

2407
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,768
Pan-pacific ignore the fact that he already has one

2408
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,328
It just doesn't involve us

2409
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:31,936
Mike Franco David macri and others

2410
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:36,800
Essentially refer to the War in China as a proxy war

2411
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,848
Not just for the United States

2412
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:45,248
But for Great Britain and the Soviet Union all of whom have an interest in keeping Japan

2413
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
Ball gown

2414
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,880
So all of them are at one time or another

2415
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,416
Providing arms

2416
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,696
Resources

2417
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,976
Supplies

2418
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,024
Some of the histories make

2419
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,328
The case that this becomes a wonderful

2420
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:05,216
Thing that Japanese commanders who been promising great victories in our failing can blame things on

2421
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:11,616
And you do once again see the similarities in the Vietnam War era we're all of a sudden it all became about the Ho Chi Minh

2422
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
Men Trail

2423
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,432
If we can just shut down that network of

2424
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,992
A resupply roads down

2425
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:23,392
The outside powers like China and the Soviet Union were supplying the North Vietnamese will be able to get their stuff to the moon will win

2426
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
In this case the Japanese

2427
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:31,840
Become obsessed with shutting off the many leaking like a sieve cuz it's about the geographical size of the

2428
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:35,680
Ussv said the many resupply points that the Chinese have

2429
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,728
The Soviets

2430
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:38,752
In the North

2431
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,824
The British are leaking stuff over from Hong Kong

2432
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,896
The Burma Road their stuff coming over from

2433
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:47,712
French Indochina and the US is

2434
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,272
In fits and starts doing stuff too and

2435
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:56,672
Sell at below-cost all kinds of things at one point to the Soviets a deliver like 800 planes and the advisors to teach you how to

2436
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,440
Fly them

2437
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,000
If you are the Japanese

2438
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,096
And you need a nice victory in China to free up another

2439
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:08,448
This is a food eating contest in the Japanese sat down to a giant plate

2440
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,984
A pancakes

2441
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:16,128
And they're halfway through the pancakes now and they're starting to realize holy cow I'm not going to make it through this mean while

2442
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,920
Other people are secretly

2443
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:24,320
The Soviet Union Great Britain the United States piling more Pancakes on the table when you're not looking and every time you turn the

2444
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,880
Around it more pancakes you're already almost full

2445
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,184
By 1939 the Japanese

2446
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:30,976
App China

2447
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,024
It's like they're addicted to it

2448
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,840
But they got too much it was an old comic book episode once about

2449
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:42,240
Are you going to steal Superman's power and you want it but then you couldn't you couldn't handle it all and you just overdosed on it well

2450
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:48,128
The Japanese are looking to figure out a way to have their cake and eat it too in China what that means is how do we get out

2451
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:54,528
But leave it in a circumstances where we control it right puppet governments things like that they want to replicate what they did in men

2452
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,600
You know now called Manchu quote

2453
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,416
Play Japanese puppet state just like Sharia is

2454
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:03,488
A lot harder to do that in a place the size of China

2455
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,304
Especially when you haven't defeated China yet

2456
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,912
In 1939 the Chinese been a couple of battles against the Japanese boom

2457
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,704
They weren't ready for that

2458
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,824
What's more the Japanese who always amongst the Army had a huge contingent of officers

2459
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,616
It really wanted to attack

2460
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,152
The Soviet Union

2461
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,968
Got their wish unfortunately

2462
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:28,320
A couple of things that were called incidents were clashes happened between the Red Army

2463
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:32,928
And the Japanese Army up there the kwantung Army and the Japanese got their nose severely

2464
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:36,256
17000 casualties in one of these

2465
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:40,352
Led to some reforms in the Japanese Army by the way

2466
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:45,984
But also blunted the enthusiasm that had been running in Japanese leadership circles for a

2467
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:52,384
Crusade against the Soviet Union which also turn Japanese eyes into other directions were things might be

2468
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,432
At less of a cost

2469
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,968
This is what's known by the way

2470
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,504
At the north-south

2471
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,904
Debate during the time. In Japanese politics do we go north against the Soviet Union South against those possessions

2472
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,928
Also well-defended

2473
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,464
Why the colonial Masters

2474
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,768
The Japanese

2475
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:11,840
Sources invariably focus on two things

2476
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:13,888
That we in the west don't focus on this much

2477
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,192
China and communism

2478
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:21,312
Saburo and I got years ago was pointing out going to keep your eye on the prize

2479
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,360
The Japanese art this is all about China

2480
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:29,760
All these other things that happened including the war with United States and all of this is an attempt to figure out how to solve

2481
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,552
Call their China war situation

2482
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,088
To their satisfaction

2483
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
And communism

2484
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,440
Is the other thing that they

2485
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:40,000
Focus on inordinately in we in the West

2486
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,536
Forget that to that

2487
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
It's

2488
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:45,120
Fair I think to call Japan

2489
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:49,728
The most fervently large anti-communist country in the world

2490
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:54,592
During this time period that's really saying something you need age where Nazi Germany exist

2491
01:54:55,360 --> 01:55:01,504
But the Japanese hate communism in they portray and they tell themselves and they using propaganda with their public and maybe

2492
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,624
There's even some truth to it that this war in China is in large part of war against communism

2493
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:12,000
They have their own version of what the West will have 10 or 20 years after this.

2494
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,328
With the West will be worried about the domino effect where

2495
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:18,144
Communism spreads one country to another you like dominoes

2496
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,680
The Japanese have their same

2497
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
Attitude here that's going to move through China and Japan so they going to stop it over there before it comes over to the Homeland

2498
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:32,480
You are there telling themselves that they're paying all this money sacrificing all these lives in an effort to

2499
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:38,112
Keep and protect the Chinese people who haven't fallen under communism sway free

2500
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,928
And even to roll back communism in free

2501
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:43,488
Chinese people who are the slaves of the

2502
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:45,280
Bolshevik and Lenin the stinkers

2503
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,072
You go talk to her

2504
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
Japanese

2505
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:53,472
Parent who lost a son in that fighting you're likely to hear some sort of rationale like

2506
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:57,056
Like that after all is that what you would like to think your son died for

2507
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,336
Other people's freedoms

2508
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,896
It's a pretty I might it cause

2509
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,176
Lot of people Sons

2510
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,968
On all sides in a lot of War

2511
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,504
Like that

2512
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,112
Now China of course is going to become

2513
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,160
Mary said like an intervention

2514
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:15,232
The big sticking point that it's hard to see anyone over

2515
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,000
We're coming because

2516
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:22,656
The Japanese in their minds have to get some sort of deal in China just like the US had to get some sort of deal in Vietnam

2517
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,448
Where it gets

2518
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:27,008
The boxes ticked off that it needs to get

2519
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,288
So we can leave

2520
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:32,896
In Japan's case those boxes really are control of China's resource

2521
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:35,968
This is not something that the Western powers are for

2522
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,992
Prepared to let them have

2523
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,784
So how do you get around that

2524
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,064
Well

2525
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,112
We had said that Japan was

2526
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,672
Basically being confronted with an intervention

2527
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
Body Angela Merrick

2528
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
Can powers

2529
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:51,072
They pull if you want to look at it this way something more like a Kobayashi Maru

2530
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:51,840
From Star Trek

2531
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,912
Rock you like a third way you didn't know I had a third option right

2532
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,752
I give up the drugs were going to cut off your money so you can't buy drugs will maybe I have

2533
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,776
Prince

2534
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,848
After the Germans blow through

2535
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,128
Western Europe

2536
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,408
In 1940

2537
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,224
Right around the same time the Japanese sign

2538
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:09,760
An alliance with

2539
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,576
Call the tripartite

2540
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,392
Late September 1940

2541
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:18,464
Create something called the axis and the Axis powers

2542
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,000
Because Italy will join in

2543
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,024
Some of their

2544
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,352
Fascist leaning countries smaller country to be named later

2545
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,424
This is a unification of

2546
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,448
Outside

2547
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,472
Countries in terms of

2548
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,520
The club all these countries want some sort of

2549
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:36,128
Autarky self-sufficiency and unfortunately for all of them none of them have oil

2550
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,664
In Romanian

2551
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
Little help a little

2552
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:43,552
But the Japanese joining the Axis powers

2553
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,112
Is one of the Fatal misstep

2554
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,392
Epsom and terrible moves

2555
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,416
That leads to tragedy

2556
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,696
For everyone in Asia

2557
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,000
And it's often

2558
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:52,768
Pointed out

2559
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:56,096
That it should have been avoided had you had

2560
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,888
A different kind of government

2561
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:58,912
With a different

2562
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,704
System of making decisions

2563
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:02,240
You might have avoided

2564
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,800
The way things went because if you actually look at

2565
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,360
What people felt like including the emperor

2566
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,128
There were

2567
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:14,528
Hunza people in the Japanese power structure that wanted nothing to do with a conflict with the United States and Britain

2568
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:17,856
Avoid that at all costs or how do you end up there

2569
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,928
Well is a ton of missteps

2570
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,720
A miscommunication

2571
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,280
And misinterpretation of mistranslations

2572
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,304
How about

2573
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:32,704
The mystery that happens when the Japanese foreign minister who signed this deal this access agreement

2574
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,776
How about his misread of how the United States would react

2575
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,336
This guy's name of the ways matsuoka

2576
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:41,152
And he is probably portrayed in all the history books

2577
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,224
Is important an influencer sometimes debated

2578
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,344
But this is a guy who owned his resume essentially called himself the American expert

2579
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,160
He graduated from the University of Oregon

2580
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,720
You work in the United States and goes back to Japan

2581
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:58,304
And he's the guy who thinks signing an agreement with Nazi

2582
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,072
Germany is gone

2583
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,608
Help give you Leverage

2584
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:03,680
I guess United States that that's how they're going to react

2585
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:10,080
Japan was hoping for someone who would even up the scales a little bit in terms

2586
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:11,360
Of its negotiating

2587
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,128
Power against

2588
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:18,016
When you read what they were hoping for including what the Prime Minister was hoping for they felt like they needed

2589
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:24,416
Somebody on their side otherwise you couldn't negotiate with the Americans from any sort of position to parody much less strength

2590
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,512
And I think you kind of have to call it about

2591
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,304
50% effective

2592
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:32,864
When examining results because

2593
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,656
I kind of did Scare

2594
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,448
The Americans get there

2595
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,216
Retention

2596
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:41,568
And force a response to 50% of the deal that was not

2597
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:44,896
Successful is it wasn't the response to Japanese were thinking they were going to

2598
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:49,760
It didn't make the Americans back off and think maybe they'd better

2599
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,296
How to be more cautious here

2600
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,136
Because otherwise maybe we'll be fighting the luftwaffe

2601
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:00,768
In the Pacific and the varimax will be defending some of these Japanese defense perimeter islands and

2602
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,304
Only the Japanese

2603
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,584
I'm certainly hoping that that might be

2604
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
Be the case and

2605
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:10,752
If you look at some of the promises the Nazis were making to the Japanese when try to convince them to sign this agreement which they tried to do the

2606
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,520
Before apparel

2607
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:16,128
They were sort of hinting that that's how it would be right up if you can do a war with United States

2608
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:20,224
Unfortunately for the Japanese

2609
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:27,136
That's a worst-case scenario for the Americans to in a situation that maybe they could have looked the other way for a while and Folk

2610
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:30,976
Focused on Europe when it was just Japan which had a limited amount of ability

2611
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:35,584
To really threaten the United States looked a lot more like something that had to be dealt with

2612
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,608
Right away

2613
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
When it's

2614
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:41,984
The Eastern wing of the axis Alliance in the tentacles are

2615
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,544
Now stretching out over the Pacific in the US

2616
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,336
The spacing of War on both fronts

2617
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:47,872
You don't

2618
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,896
Walk away with you

2619
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,176
Your tail between your legs

2620
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,200
That's the situation

2621
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:51,968
Malaysian

2622
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,992
You take it with

2623
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,272
Animoji

2624
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,552
Deadly serious

2625
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,696
The amount of diplomatic flexibility to Japanese

2626
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,464
You're going to have

2627
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,512
After signing this agreement

2628
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,280
With the Nazis

2629
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
This is

2630
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,096
Severely limited

2631
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:08,864
Dick compared to what it

2632
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:11,168
Before the state they weren't ready for this

2633
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,728
Fact that they were going to be lumped in now

2634
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,264
With people

2635
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,080
Who had some of the worst depression you can get

2636
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,616
In the western democracy

2637
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:21,664
The Japanese PR

2638
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:28,320
I wasn't good already we talked about the Life magazine photos of the babies being bombed in China and all these kinds of things

2639
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:32,672
Well now you hook yourselves up in the minds of the American public

2640
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,232
With people who are

2641
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:37,024
Diametrically opposed

2642
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,304
To the Western value

2643
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,328
Dinner trumpeted

2644
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,352
Celebrated

2645
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,632
You know you can

2646
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:43,424
Flip a coin who's more opposed

2647
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:48,032
Stalinist see in the Soviet Union or the Nazis in Germany

2648
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,080
None the less I mean these people

2649
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
AR book burner

2650
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:58,016
They persecute minorities and have government-sanctioned programs like kristallnacht there against

2651
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:04,416
Freedom of thought freedom of speech freedom of religion they don't have any due process they don't believe in equality under the law

2652
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:09,536
They have a harsh occupation they believe in Collective punishment they pry mean

2653
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,328
The list goes on and on

2654
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,656
And the Japanese have now

2655
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:18,240
Thrown in their lot in the eyes of The Americans

2656
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,520
With that crowd

2657
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:23,616
How much less willing to come to sort of an accommodation

2658
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
Imperial Japan

2659
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,944
Are the American people

2660
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:27,968
Now

2661
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:33,088
And how on Earth did a guy who graduated from the University of Oregon

2662
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:36,160
And work in the United States get that one so wrong

2663
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:39,232
To be fair

2664
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,840
Another aspect of this that we in the west don't always think about

2665
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:49,984
Is the fact that the way the second world war looks to us is not necessarily the way it looks

2666
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,544
To a bunch of the rest of the world especially place

2667
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,568
This is like Asia

2668
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,640
In the west we see this as good vs Evil

2669
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,688
In Asia

2670
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:02,784
In a lot of these countries that were under Colonial rule at this time

2671
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:09,184
It's a lot more questionable if it's a good guy bad guy thing it might be too bad guys from their point of view

2672
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:15,072
Storing John toland in a book that was written Way Back in 1970 but still has some value

2673
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:18,144
Inside it despite being outdated in other respects

2674
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:18,912
Including what we know

2675
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:19,680
How about the emperor

2676
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:22,496
But I mean he has a whole part admittedly trying to look

2677
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:24,288
Look at this from the Asian perspective

2678
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,824
It points out that

2679
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:32,736
You know if you don't see the Western democracies is all that good and a lot of Asia had bought into the promises the high-minded send

2680
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:36,832
Entenmann's from the first world war about self-determination and all these things that we fight for

2681
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,368
And people getting to have

2682
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:42,208
You know their own States and having all that stuff was kind of believed in this

2683
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:47,072
Several of the freedom fighters in these countries and pointed out a lot of the locals who died for

2684
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,656
Those causes only to find out after the war they didn't apply to that

2685
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:56,800
It was a racial thing and even in this conflict there's going to be exceptions for

2686
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:02,176
Colonial peoples when the high-minded sentiments are trotted out again is the reason why we fight

2687
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,968
In this case as

2688
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,784
Towing points out there were a lot of people in countries

2689
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,808
In Asia

2690
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:14,464
Who were darn happy to see anybody punching their colonial Masters in the face even if they didn't like those

2691
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,488
People so much

2692
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:19,840
If you wanted to look at this as a strategic war game

2693
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,120
Margot of the way I like to do

2694
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
These things

2695
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:24,960
And you try to figure out if your Japan

2696
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,752
How you ever win

2697
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:31,872
Win the victory conditions for japan-only Italy of the major player seems harder to me

2698
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:38,016
But they hope their wagon to Nazi Germany Japan's a long way away from anybody at the only way they can win

2699
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:43,136
Is turo like a double zero on the percentile dice but it double zero

2700
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,952
Is this weird possibility that the

2701
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,792
We are calling the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere

2702
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:53,376
Does that actually works even though a lot of the cynical people behind it

2703
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,656
You don't even want it to work

2704
02:04:54,912 --> 02:05:01,056
What is in acai imagine if you could somehow free Asia and be sort of the boss

2705
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,080
People of it

2706
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:06,688
We'll all the sudden you open up all kinds of possibilities that aren't there otherwise

2707
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,992
But this is why throughout this

2708
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:13,856
Situation even when the Japanese are undercutting this message of Asia for the Asians

2709
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,952
By raping and pillaging and doing all kinds of horrible things to other Asians

2710
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,512
The idea has a lot of appeal

2711
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,560
And sometimes you will run into quotes

2712
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,584
Some famous people

2713
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,352
Dondi

2714
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,888
He's one of the Mohandas Gandhi

2715
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,448
That make him look like a Nazi sympathizer

2716
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,984
Taken out of context

2717
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:31,264
Contacts

2718
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,824
It needs to be added back for to make some sense

2719
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,616
Is this idea that

2720
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:40,480
Oh yeah the Nazis are bad but we didn't see the colonial oppressor is all that great either

2721
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,528
And the really bad guy

2722
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
Was

2723
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:45,088
Doing something that weekend

2724
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,416
Our local bad guy and that was a good thing you know

2725
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,208
The enemy of my enemy is my friend

2726
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:53,280
The point is is that there are other ways to look at the

2727
02:05:54,048 --> 02:06:00,192
And if you're trying to look at it from a grand strategy point of view it's like what was always said about the great mistake and the inability

2728
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:00,960
Did the Nazis

2729
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:01,984
The capitalized

2730
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,776
On some of these

2731
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,568
Peoples that they took over

2732
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:08,896
Eventually when War would break out in the Soviet Union

2733
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:12,992
Because they could have come in there as liberators and they were welcomed by the

2734
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
Locals as liberate

2735
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,552
They could have been the Great

2736
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:21,952
3 years of the people under communist domination but because of their racial theories and their harshness and whatnot

2737
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:24,256
They ended up turning a lot of those people against them

2738
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:29,376
The Japanese didn't have those theories theoretically standing in the way

2739
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:32,960
They could have freed Asia and what would that have allowed

2740
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:33,984
Them to do

2741
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,800
Their problem of course is that they sort of wanted

2742
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,336
Take a shower while freezing it

2743
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:40,896
Burn down the village in order to save it

2744
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:46,272
Cheap China while somehow getting rid of the responsibility of fighting in it

2745
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,040
Leasing it

2746
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:53,696
And expand in the other territories even though we are totally tied down in China once again if I

2747
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:54,976
Boggles the mind looking at it

2748
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:58,304
From the perspective of somebody sitting on the sidelines now

2749
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,144
What Japan obviously has its hands full and yet the real debate for it

2750
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:07,776
In 1940 is out can we get something else and then we said all the sudden the Soviet Union seems like a little bit

2751
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:10,080
Too steep of a hill to climb right now

2752
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:13,920
So after they Ally with the Nazis are really right around the same time

2753
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:18,784
They're able to arm-twist is a good way to put it lean on is another way

2754
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:22,112
The puppet French government that the Germans are putting

2755
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,648
The place after they conquered France

2756
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:28,000
And move militarily into what's now in Northern Vietnam

2757
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,304
A piece of French Indochina

2758
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,608
This is kind of spark

2759
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,656
It starts the dynamic

2760
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,680
That lead now

2761
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,472
Kind of very clearly

2762
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,496
And straightforward

2763
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,520
In war

2764
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:45,408
Is a chicken and an egg thing because you'll give Japanese folk who will say two things one

2765
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:48,224
All this is just an attempt to shut down another one of these

2766
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:54,624
Aliki areas where support is coming in for the Chinese and everybody wants us to wind up its War in China what

2767
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,904
We can't do that if he supplies

2768
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,464
We're just trying to do what you want to do

2769
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:01,280
The other thing though is that if they're going to have

2770
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,584
Their raw materials cut off

2771
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,192
They're looking for ways to supplement that in one of the ways it's take the ones that are nearby

2772
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,216
And unlike

2773
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:12,544
In anything that might be up in the Soviet Union these are hardly

2774
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,080
Well defended at all and

2775
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,616
Simply by using

2776
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,224
Bullying diplomacy the Japanese occupy the northern part of

2777
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,040
French Indochina the reaction on the US and

2778
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,600
Britain and the Netherlands part is to ratchet up

2779
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,368
Sanctions

2780
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,952
Now the next big thing that happens

2781
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:32,512
It really influences this story

2782
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,280
Is that

2783
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:39,168
Just about little bit over a year from when the world is turned upside down

2784
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:40,192
And the Germans

2785
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,240
Take France in Western Europe

2786
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:45,824
The Germans turn the world upside down again

2787
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:49,152
And in an even more shocking fashion

2788
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,712
In June 1941

2789
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:57,344
The Axis powers in Europe launched a surprise attack against the Soviet Union

2790
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,672
To say that sounds ridiculous

2791
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:04,256
Because when you're launching an attack that is several times

2792
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,280
Does the size

2793
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:10,144
Of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the early 1800s with the Grand Army

2794
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,936
Angus 500,000 guys

2795
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,984
And the Grand Army multiple Nations

2796
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,264
Several times.

2797
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,848
And on the front that stretches from like the width of a continent

2798
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:21,152
How the hell does that Stacy

2799
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,200
There were plenty of warning

2800
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,480
But one way or another

2801
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:27,552
It had the same effect as a surprise attack

2802
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,624
And initially and very quickly

2803
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,720
The their mouth especially but the axis armies in general

2804
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:37,792
Appear to be having the same kind of success

2805
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:41,632
That the Germans had blowing through France the year before again

2806
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,728
And they are surrounding and annihilating

2807
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:48,544
Not Red Army units but Red Army

2808
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:55,712
And once again the rest of the world is looking on in shock and trying to reassess what the heck this mean

2809
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,784
This is the last train

2810
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,064
A Japanese

2811
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,832
Foreign policy

2812
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,368
Have to weave into the story be

2813
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
Because

2814
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:07,232
If you're a conservatively oriented person like I am

2815
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:12,608
And like many of the Japanese leaders were to there looking just like I would be looking

2816
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:16,448
To thinking they have their hands full with China yet there's this impetus

2817
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,496
To not miss the bus

2818
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:21,312
As one of the sayings of the time were to miss the bus

2819
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:24,384
A golden opportunity of the way another person put in

2820
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:27,456
That these changes in the global balance of

2821
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,480
The power offer

2822
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:33,856
There's a decent case to be made the Japanese foreign policy since they

2823
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,648
Rejoin the rest of the world

2824
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,952
In the latter part of the nineteenth century

2825
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:41,024
As always had a Keen Eye for opportunity

2826
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,352
And you never do any better than they did in the first World War

2827
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,632
They gained

2828
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,424
So much for almost nothing

2829
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:52,288
But they were very opportunistic they were allied with the British in the Allies remember and they gained mightily

2830
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,592
But they're trying to figure out what they are

2831
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:58,688
Opportunistic play is here and have a couple of different competing things going on

2832
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:01,248
Competing thing number one we already mentioned

2833
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:05,600
There's quite a few people in the Japanese power structure that want no trouble at all with

2834
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,368
Britain in the United

2835
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:09,184
Traditionally it's the Navy

2836
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:12,000
That is most credited in Churchill often

2837
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,280
Sympathetically

2838
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:17,376
The Navy didn't want the Navy was going to have to be the one fighting it

2839
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,168
Any new

2840
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:25,568
At the British and the American fleets were the two largest fleets in the world and you be fighting them combined in a war

2841
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
The Army could

2842
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:32,736
Pop out its chest and make also it's a brave statements all it wanted to if they weren't going to be handling a lot of the shooting a

2843
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:33,760
In the Navy was

2844
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:38,624
But there's also the two other elements that we mentioned earlier

2845
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:41,952
I need to be pointed out are still in play here and it's

2846
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:42,976
Crazy

2847
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,024
The first one is the mid-level

2848
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,048
Military off

2849
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,584
Officers are still having an empath

2850
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,656
These criminals and people of these sorts of rank

2851
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:54,240
Who don't have any of the responsibility

2852
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:58,848
You know having to live with the ramifications of the decisions they push

2853
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:02,944
They can just in an aggressive and almost pugnacious manner

2854
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:07,808
Aggressively push forward with their policies and for some reason their superiors

2855
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,344
Tend to be a little bit

2856
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:10,880
Lenient

2857
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:12,928
Or lack sword

2858
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:16,256
10 to defer it puts a lot of pressure though

2859
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:22,656
Otherwise be there the other thing of course it's exerting influence in that direction

2860
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:25,984
And it must play into the head of anybody that thinks wait a minute

2861
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:32,384
We need to back down now this is going to be negative direction is the fact the reason Japanese history demonstrates that your life

2862
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,432
We to get somebody killing you

2863
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,760
If you try move like that didn't you say it was only a few years before

2864
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:42,112
Some historians were describing the Japanese government as a government by assassination

2865
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:44,416
That's still a problem

2866
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,952
And if you're too

2867
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:49,536
Well let's just say non super-patriot

2868
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,840
You could find yourself shot

2869
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:55,168
Or your head cut or any number of other things that were happy

2870
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:57,216
Audrina spirit and they were

2871
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,496
Certainly lost

2872
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:03,360
The threatened and being anything other than a super-patriot at this time. Is to open yourself up

2873
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:06,432
Just suspicion and maybe imprisonment

2874
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,992
Let's remember the climate these people are operate

2875
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:12,320
But even the Prime Minister of Japan during the

2876
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,088
Time.

2877
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:19,744
He aggressively sometimes make public statements but he does not want a war with Britain and the United States

2878
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,512
And France

2879
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:24,608
And the emperor apparently doesn't want that either so how do you get it again

2880
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,168
Well this golden opportunity

2881
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,216
You just don't miss the bus moment

2882
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:34,336
That this change in the global situation seems to influence now that the Vermont

2883
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,896
Cutting through the Western

2884
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
Regions

2885
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,944
Of the Soviet Union

2886
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,992
Is to maybe take the rest

2887
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,552
French Indochina

2888
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:46,624
And start making a few public statements to the effect

2889
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:49,952
But you know maybe some deals going to have to be reached for

2890
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:53,792
The supplies we need or we might have to you know maybe move South some more

2891
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:57,120
And so right around the time the Germans

2892
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,144
Attack

2893
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,424
Soviet Union

2894
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:06,080
The Japanese again not quite bloodlessly but mostly blood does listo to move into the rest of French Indochina Laos

2895
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:06,848
Cambodia Viet

2896
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,664
And this is the Line in the Sand

2897
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,968
Not just because

2898
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:17,088
They have been trying to get the Japanese move in the other direction and it's like a slap in the face when they go the opposite way

2899
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:19,392
But also because it's more modern historians

2900
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,160
Deported out

2901
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:26,816
The raw materials that they're actually getting their hands on this area are raw materials that places like the US need as well

2902
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:33,984
So now it's not just about cutting Japan office about Japan cutting the United States off from things they need this is a heavy.

2903
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:34,752
Duty rubber

2904
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,824
So this is when the series

2905
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,592
Sanctions

2906
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:40,896
And it's funny because

2907
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:42,688
The negotiating position

2908
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,736
Originally start somewhere

2909
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:48,576
In the area of you need to get out of French Indochina which is something that's

2910
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Kind of possible

2911
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:52,672
But eventually will move into the area of no

2912
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:54,976
You need to tell us when you're getting out

2913
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:55,744
China

2914
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,560
Entirely and it's got to be relatively soon

2915
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,864
This sounds like a nuanced position but it

2916
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:01,632
It's pretty easy to

2917
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:04,704
To explain once again if you go back to our Vietnam War analogy

2918
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,984
And imagine

2919
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:10,592
The together the Soviet Union and China during that. The two other powers at my

2920
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:11,872
Baby great powers

2921
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,920
Counterbalance us strength

2922
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:17,504
If they had said to the United States in 1967

2923
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,552
You know when the Vietnam war is going

2924
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:23,904
I mean if it's a long long slog towards even defeat at that point

2925
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,184
If they'd said listen

2926
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,464
Are you got to get out of here

2927
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,512
Give us a timetable for when you're getting a

2928
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:30,560
And a timetable can't be like forever

2929
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,608
Maybe a year right

2930
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:37,472
If United States leaves Vietnam in 1968 it's the same as saying

2931
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:40,800
You're giving up and losing the war because the war is far from over

2932
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:43,616
The American position on China is

2933
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:46,432
We need a timetable for withdrawal and it's got to be soon

2934
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:50,272
Does it mean 5 minutes

2935
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:53,600
It may be designed to be too soon

2936
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:58,208
For the Japanese to do anything that they would consider to be winning

2937
02:15:58,464 --> 02:15:59,232
And then go home

2938
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:02,560
This is the intervention

2939
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:04,352
Get out of China

2940
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:06,400
We're going to cut off your ability

2941
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:08,448
To do what you're doing anymore

2942
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:12,800
This is the fuse being lit now

2943
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:16,640
The Winston Churchill I like to quote Churchill

2944
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:17,920
For the story because

2945
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:21,760
He's a participant in the store he has his own way of viewing things

2946
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,832
He's he's not unbiased by any stretch of the imagination

2947
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,136
But he's interesting on the job

2948
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:31,232
Meijer there martial culture

2949
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:34,560
And when Churchill was in his formative stages the

2950
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:36,352
British and the Japanese were allies

2951
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:41,728
Also as a colonialist himself as an Empire guy himself he can understand

2952
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:43,264
The desire in the field

2953
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:47,104
The colonies are not inherently evil thing we talked about the Japanese

2954
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,664
And of course she dictated or

2955
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,224
Recorded into a machine

2956
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,504
These histories

2957
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,552
Lady wrote about the conference really sound like

2958
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,088
They sound like Churchill talking to you

2959
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,624
But he sort of

2960
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,648
Encapsulate

2961
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:00,416
That's what happens

2962
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:04,000
I will a little Sympathy for the Japanese

2963
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:05,792
Winston Churchill ride

2964
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,072
Quote

2965
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:13,216
The DraStic application of economic sanctions in July 1941

2966
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:16,800
Route to head the internal crisis in Japanese politics

2967
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:19,104
Conservative elements were shocked

2968
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
Henna moderate leaders scared

2969
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:27,552
The domestic Prestige of the Japanese Army is a constitutional factor in shaping Japanese policy was

2970
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,576
Already involved

2971
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:32,416
Hitherto the Navy had exerted its restraining Force

2972
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:34,976
But the Embargo is which the United States

2973
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:37,024
Britton head Holland head in forest

2974
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:39,840
Cut off from Japan all supplies of oil

2975
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:44,448
On which the Navy and indeed the whole war power of Japan dependent

2976
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,496
The Japanese Navy was at once

2977
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:48,288
Sports 2 live on its oil Reserves

2978
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:54,176
At the outbreak of the Pacific War had in fact consumed 4 out of 18 month supply

2979
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:56,736
It was evident that this was a Stranglehold

2980
02:17:57,248 --> 02:18:01,856
Another Choice before them was either for Japan to reach an agreement with the United States

2981
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:02,880
Or go to war

2982
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,464
The American requirements involved Japanese withdrawal

2983
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,280
Not only from their new aggression in Indochina

2984
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,816
But from China itself

2985
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:14,144
Where they had already been fighting and heavy expense for so long

2986
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,192
This was

2987
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:16,960
He writes

2988
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:19,264
A rightful but a hard demand

2989
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:24,640
Any circumstances the Navy Associated itself with the Army in the policy of War

2990
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:27,712
If an acceptable diplomatic agreement could not be obtained

2991
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:28,992
And quote

2992
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:33,088
Cheat codes for the old idea by the way

2993
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:35,136
The Navy doesn't want the war

2994
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:40,512
But because of the sanctions in the cutting off a fuel supply slowly but surely will

2995
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:41,280
Maybe not even that

2996
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:45,632
Slowly the Navy begins to move toward the Army position in these things are more hard-line

2997
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:47,168
Anti anglo-american

2998
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,192
Imposition

2999
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,496
1 Admiral Pointe Dr

3000
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,264
The government

3001
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:56,128
That the fleet is burning 400 tons of oil an hour

3002
02:18:56,896 --> 02:19:00,224
The overall military need is something like 12000 tons

3003
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:00,992
Today

3004
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:03,808
Another official or Admiral its Des

3005
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,576
Disputed

3006
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:06,368
It's supposed to have told the government

3007
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:08,416
That this is like a patient

3008
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:09,952
Who's going to die

3009
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,976
Without surgery

3010
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:17,120
And he still made I even with the surgery but if you don't give him the surgery his Death is certain

3011
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:18,656
Some other word

3012
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:21,728
The showing the position that solve the chapel

3013
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:23,776
I think they find themselves in

3014
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,824
One of certain death

3015
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:29,920
Unless risky and still no potentially fatal

3016
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:31,968
Countermeasures are taken

3017
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,784
I should point out

3018
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:40,416
That while some people say and Frances Pike is pretty vociferous that every one of these Roosevelt

3019
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,696
People knew that once you

3020
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,464
Put oil

3021
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:45,536
On The Chopping Block that this basically meant

3022
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:47,072
The Japanese were going to go to war

3023
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,864
But in his

3024
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:52,704
A modern history Japan has during James McClain says that

3025
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,520
Secretary of State Cordell Hull didn't see it that way

3026
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:57,312
He really thought

3027
02:19:57,824 --> 02:20:01,152
You could get the Japanese to see reason

3028
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:03,456
Through something like this in other words

3029
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,736
If true

3030
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:10,880
This was the peaceful attempt right there between the two World Wars attitude sort of attempt

3031
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:17,280
To get another country to do the right thing and not just the right thing for you but in the long run the right thing for that

3032
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:19,328
McLane says quote

3033
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:23,936
As the situation in China worsened after 1937

3034
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:30,336
Secretary of State Howell became the primary proponent of waging an economic Cold War against

3035
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:35,456
In his view Japan's Reliance on the American market for strategic Goods

3036
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:39,552
Made the smaller Nations particularly vulnerable to economic sanctions

3037
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:43,904
And the systematic application of ever greater amounts of pressure wood

3038
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,440
At some point he believe

3039
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:47,488
Bring the Japanese to their senses

3040
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:52,096
The Secretary of State realize that he had to be careful about his calibration

3041
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:56,448
He did not wish to push Japan into a shooting war with the United States

3042
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,264
But he did mean to convince the country's leaders

3043
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:05,664
About the Folly of playing a high-stakes game in which the United States could continually up the economic auntie

3044
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,688
At some point

3045
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:07,456
Hohhot

3046
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:10,272
Moderates would return to power in Tokyo

3047
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:13,344
Japan with folded hand and peace would be possible

3048
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:14,624
And quote

3049
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:18,976
This is why we had brought up the

3050
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,024
The history of Japan

3051
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,560
From before this error

3052
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,608
Just sort of set up the contact

3053
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:29,472
And let's just call it the national psyche of Japan during this time.

3054
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:32,032
And of course I don't pretend to know about it it's

3055
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,336
Something that everybody talks about

3056
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:35,872
The fact that

3057
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:38,432
The Japanese have what we call it

3058
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,992
A rain man like

3059
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:43,040
Laundry list of grievances

3060
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,088
Places where they

3061
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:48,672
Think they've been shafted by the rest of the International Community

3062
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:53,280
When they feel like they've been treated as second-class in the some of this is racially oriented

3063
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:55,584
And in the minds of a lot of those people

3064
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:00,704
This just looks like the biggest baddest example of the same thing over again

3065
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:03,264
What are you supposed to do about that

3066
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,032
And

3067
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,312
Certainly

3068
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:11,456
Asking the Japanese to give up more than any of these previous cases because this War in China

3069
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:14,784
Has already cost something like a hundred thousand Japanese lives

3070
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,344
Untold amounts of money effort the

3071
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:21,696
Intense work of a generation Japanese Statesman

3072
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:25,024
What's the likelihood in reality

3073
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:31,936
Of Japan choosing anything other than war in this situation that's why so many people have suggested

3074
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:32,960
It's an ultimatum

3075
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:34,752
Time United

3076
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:36,032
What states is talking about

3077
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,312
Get out of China

3078
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:39,872
Cutting off your raw materials and oil

3079
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:41,920
The Japanese certainly saw it that way

3080
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,992
Mary's B Jensen that was interesting

3081
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,528
He pointed out that

3082
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:51,136
It's not true when it's not true because all of the ideas

3083
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:53,952
It made this look like an ultimatum were part of a

3084
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,232
The Japanese

3085
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,000
Construe

3086
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:59,584
They created this artificial

3087
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,864
Time deadline

3088
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:06,496
The put them behind the eight ball if you ignore the time deadline you could have

3089
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,264
Months

3090
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,312
Maybe even longer to negotiate

3091
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:13,664
But because you want to keep the option of going to war open

3092
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:18,272
There's as much of an artificial deadline limiting the

3093
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:22,624
Time to go Cedars have to solve this problem some other way

3094
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:28,000
If they had in the first world war in the first world war was all about in a mobilization timetables and

3095
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:31,072
War plans that required precise

3096
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:37,472
Your troop movements and people getting on schedule to places otherwise the whole War go down so you know that limited the time people had to do anything

3097
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:39,008
Other than carry out the plans

3098
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,288
In this conflict

3099
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,568
It's the fact that

3100
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:43,616
The Japanese Fleet is burning for

3101
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:45,152
Tons of oil

3102
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:46,176
An hour

3103
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:52,320
And the fleet isn't the only part of the Japanese military or the larger Japanese society that needs fuel

3104
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:55,392
It's worse than that though and it's easy to forget

3105
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:57,184
Frances Pike describes

3106
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,464
Something that sounds

3107
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:01,792
Benign you know we can all understand the oil question but what about that

3108
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,352
Financial squeeze

3109
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,656
That's involved here and what does that mean

3110
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,192
He writes quote

3111
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:12,288
The evening of 25th July 1941

3112
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:15,616
Roosevelt signed executive order number 88320

3113
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:20,480
Which subjected all of Japanese monetary assets held in the United States

3114
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:22,272
To control by license

3115
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:25,088
The White House Press release stated that quote

3116
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:31,488
This measure in effect brings all Financial in Import and Export trade transactions in which Japanese interests are

3117
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:33,792
Are involved under the control of the government

3118
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:37,376
And imposes criminal penalties for violation of the order and quote

3119
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,168
The order

3120
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:39,936
Pike right

3121
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:44,032
Extended to Japanese colonies including Manchu call and China

3122
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:48,896
To protect them from looting by Japan's puppet government installed in Nanking

3123
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:52,992
All assets owned 25% or more by Japanese interest

3124
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,016
Frozen

3125
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:58,112
When Wall Street open for business on Monday 28th July

3126
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:01,696
The Foreign Exchange Market for Yen the Japanese currency

3127
02:25:02,208 --> 02:25:02,976
Simply disappeared

3128
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,768
Japanese dollar Bond

3129
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:07,584
Crash 222 30% of their par value

3130
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:10,144
The Yokohama silk Exchange close

3131
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:13,472
The New York commodity exchange suspended silk futures

3132
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:14,240
In effect

3133
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:18,080
The entire Japanese International payment system seized up

3134
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:22,688
Japan's gold held in America became immovable and unusable

3135
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,968
In South America

3136
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:30,112
Modest amounts of gold in foreign exchange were similarly immobilized by governments that followed Roosevelt's lead

3137
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:33,952
Cargos destined for America remain stuck on Japanese war

3138
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:37,024
When Great Britain and Holland followed America's lead

3139
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:40,608
The Yen could only be used and traded with in Japan Zone Empire

3140
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,632
And quote

3141
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,472
Another way to put that

3142
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:46,752
Is catastrophic

3143
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,848
The Japanese are also well aware that

3144
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,872
Reducing balance

3145
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:57,248
Between the United States and Japan is growing everyday notches because Japan's getting weaker every day

3146
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:59,808
But because the US is getting stronger

3147
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:03,648
1940 the US essentially

3148
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,952
Start sits rearmament efforts and starts

3149
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:07,232
Gearing up for war

3150
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:08,768
Initiate

3151
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:10,560
First peacetime draft

3152
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,840
In the country's history

3153
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:17,472
Begins tripling budgets and spending all kinds of money that just the year before Congress would

3154
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,752
Laughed the idea of

3155
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:19,776
Appropriating

3156
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,312
You know what

3157
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:23,616
Germans taking over Western Europe

3158
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,664
So dominant as a way of

3159
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:26,944
Shocking

3160
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,712
In Congress

3161
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:30,784
YouTube making up for lost time

3162
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,856
The American system throughout most of his his

3163
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:35,904
Clarification

3164
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,672
Purposes

3165
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:38,720
I've been one that's been somewhat

3166
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:41,024
Suspicious of standing army

3167
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,328
And the lesson that the people

3168
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:45,120
Who designed the Constitution

3169
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:47,168
A framework of the US believed

3170
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:51,520
It's standing army stood in opposition to long-term Liberty

3171
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:52,800
And so

3172
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:56,128
While the US Navy has always been something that's

3173
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:59,200
And paid attention to obviously

3174
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,224
Battery Giant

3175
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,016
Moat surrounding your hemisphere

3176
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:03,040
Beer makes sense

3177
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:04,576
To pay attention to something

3178
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:09,952
But you have to spend some time in advance building you can't just say oh we have a war let's build a Navy

3179
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:11,488
Usually

3180
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:13,792
Time to use it

3181
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:14,816
Buc-ee's

3182
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:16,864
Where is armies in the old

3183
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,192
Say Roman legion style of the Republic

3184
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:22,496
You can sort of build from

3185
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:27,872
A hardcore veterans and that's what the US military the Army was traditionally lights

3186
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:31,712
These long service professionals but not very many of them

3187
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:36,576
It whenever war was going to happen all of a sudden you found yourself with all sorts of volunteers and

3188
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:39,392
Davy Crockett types and Rough Riders

3189
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:40,928
French Pirates

3190
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,952
The time

3191
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:43,744
Whatever you needed to get the job done

3192
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,560
Are always enough Americans looking for a little action that youku

3193
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:48,096
Could raise enough troops without any

3194
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:49,376
A draft or whatever

3195
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:53,216
And of course when the war was over they all went home

3196
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:54,240
Liberty Safe

3197
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:57,312
It should be pointed out

3198
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,360
That even though the United

3199
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:02,176
States is industrial capability had been

3200
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,480
In the first World War

3201
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:06,016
Do you watch was

3202
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:12,160
Still gearing up by the time the war ended and it was a us that was nowhere near as industrialized

3203
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:14,464
As the second world war us was

3204
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:16,768
When Hitler and his

3205
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,560
In a staff people

3206
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:19,584
We're given briefing

3207
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,608
Things on what this is

3208
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,376
The famous door

3209
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,656
Giving briefings on

3210
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,448
The industrial capabilities

3211
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,472
The USU

3212
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:27,264
Even when it ramped up

3213
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:31,104
The numbers that they were given turned out to be low

3214
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:34,432
But they laughed at them figuring they were fabrication

3215
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:35,968
So

3216
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:39,296
When you put yourself in the other side shoes and you say

3217
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:45,696
You know why the heck do they think they can pull off anything like this but remember that they didn't quite understand and maybe even a mare

3218
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:46,976
Perkins didn't either

3219
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:51,840
The capabilities of the United States once fully mobilized for war

3220
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:55,680
And 1940 is the year the mobilization begins in

3221
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:57,728
Catch up Africa

3222
02:28:57,984 --> 02:28:58,496
Because

3223
02:28:58,752 --> 02:29:00,288
The US is very far behind

3224
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:01,312
The power is it in Bennett

3225
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,872
4 years in the case of Japan remember

3226
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:07,712
This Chinese incident started in 1937

3227
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:13,856
The other shiny zaferes started in 1931 I mean their troops have been on the ground fighting for a long time

3228
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:16,416
And they've developed a lot of practical experience

3229
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,000
The US Army is a green force if there are

3230
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:24,864
That's not to say that the US doesn't have some

3231
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:26,656
Advantages in its back

3232
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,424
Pocket

3233
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:34,080
Take for example the fact that in many cases the US is reading the Japanese secret messages

3234
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,408
They continually

3235
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:42,528
Despite the Japanese belief that this is impossible they continually break Japanese codes

3236
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:43,552
From

3237
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:47,136
In the 1930s all the way into the War years

3238
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:50,208
They don't always have all the codes broke

3239
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:56,608
So it's hard to understand why if they knew about a why didn't they know about be but for example their reading a lot of the Diplomatic codes

3240
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:57,632
During this period

3241
02:29:57,888 --> 02:30:00,448
So while the Japanese are negotiating with the Americans

3242
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:04,800
Americans are often able to read the messages the Japanese sent to each other and the ones they send

3243
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:06,080
Germans

3244
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:09,664
Can I give you a little bit of an advantage in the negotiation

3245
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:15,040
By the summer of 1941 negotiations or not

3246
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:16,320
Doing well at all

3247
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:18,112
Position scene

3248
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,392
Hardened

3249
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,720
And you begin to see this dynamic

3250
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:23,488
We talked about earlier

3251
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:25,536
Sliding

3252
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,584
Towards War I always think about it

3253
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:28,864
Car accident

3254
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:30,656
A sheet of ice

3255
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,192
In Colorado I was parked

3256
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:33,984
I release the emergency brake

3257
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:34,752
And I watched

3258
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:38,080
Hill

3259
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,360
Picking up speed as it were

3260
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:40,384
Until it

3261
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,176
Smashed into another parked car

3262
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,784
I watched in slow motion but I could do nothing to stop and I was powerless

3263
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,344
And some of the histories that's the way it looks like

3264
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:51,392
Even the Japanese leadership

3265
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:52,160
Feel

3266
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:53,440
In this situation

3267
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:59,584
Right there's there's not many Rara people about the possibility of doing this and you wonder to yourself

3268
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:02,400
If there's such a sense of Gloom

3269
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,192
And foreboding

3270
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:07,008
Why on Earth are they stopping it

3271
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:11,104
It's one of those questions always comes into play about the emperor we mentioned it earlier

3272
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,664
The emperor supposedly has the power

3273
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:20,064
To stop a war like this before it starts me you stopped the war eventually if you can do it then why can't he stop it before it's

3274
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:23,648
Start these weird questions after the war that he was put to

3275
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:28,768
In this case the guy who's the prime minister's perhaps the next best

3276
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:31,840
Person to look at and say why didn't you do more

3277
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:33,888
Well this time.

3278
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,936
All the sudden he decides to

3279
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:37,984
And it's a little bit like

3280
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,800
Trying to atone for past sins

3281
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:44,896
He's an interesting character who gets a lot of criticism he's a prince

3282
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:47,712
Last name is Canelo and he was the Prime Minister

3283
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,480
Weis

3284
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:53,344
Earlier on he's this sabre-rattling pro-nazi guy is

3285
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:55,648
Historian Herbert P big says you know

3286
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:56,928
Quote

3287
02:31:57,440 --> 02:32:03,328
After the Manchurian Incident Cano have been precipitously anti anglo-american and pro-german

3288
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:06,144
On January 21st 1941

3289
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:09,472
He declared firmly before a secret session of the diet

3290
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:10,240
The quote

3291
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:12,544
Germany will win and quote

3292
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,616
Now he was just as sure that Germany would lose

3293
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:21,760
And also sure that the senior officers are both Services could not promise a Japanese victory

3294
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:22,784
And quote

3295
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,344
This guy

3296
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,904
All of a sudden seems to have like

3297
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:32,256
A crisis of confidence in this is what brings the human element back into the story

3298
02:32:32,512 --> 02:32:35,328
If you see the slow-motion car crash happening

3299
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:37,632
And it's going to kill lots of innocent people

3300
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:43,264
You know when you're the Prime Minister and you have half of a soul here what would you try to do

3301
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:45,312
Japanese historian

3302
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,336
Kerry Hotel

3303
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:50,432
Describes a conversation he had with another

3304
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:56,320
Should a member of the aristocracy supposedly the only kind of people he could show his true self to

3305
02:32:56,576 --> 02:33:02,720
He creates one of these figures where you kind of feel bad for the guy even though a lot of this is sort of his fault

3306
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:09,120
Can always looking for a way out of this mess and he thinks if he can

3307
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:14,496
Have a one-on-one conversation with President Roosevelt maybe they can solve this maybe they can stop the

3308
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:20,896
Cars slowly sliding into the other Park Vehicles right can you avoid disaster can you repair the damage

3309
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:21,664
As you called

3310
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:23,712
And by the way she's talking about

3311
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:26,272
Several of these Japanese aristocracy

3312
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:28,832
So when I give you some names that's who they are

3313
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,112
She writes quote

3314
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:31,648
At that time

3315
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:36,512
Saionji was preoccupied with helping cannoli arrange a meeting with Roosevelt

3316
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:41,888
TIG and many of his blue-blooded friends knew that a war with the West would be unwinnable

3317
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,192
Matsumoto chiharu

3318
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:49,568
The yale-educated journalist who was a direct descendant of another illustrious Meiji oligarchy

3319
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:51,360
Shared so young G's concern

3320
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:55,712
Quote I have made a big mistake on Japan's relations with China

3321
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:58,016
And quote kinue confided to him

3322
02:33:58,272 --> 02:34:01,856
In a show of vulnerability displayed only to his social equals

3323
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:03,904
The prime minister went on to Lament

3324
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,440
Folding canoe

3325
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:06,464
You're the former

Unipro fascist pro-nazi guy quote

3327
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:12,352
I'm so ashamed he cannot face up to my ancestor

3328
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:17,728
I do not want to repeat such a mistake and I want to avoid war with the United States at all cost

3329
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:22,336
If at all possible I want to improve sino-japanese relations as well

3330
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:23,872
I will give it my best shot

3331
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:25,152
So won't you help me

3332
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,688
And quote

3333
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,784
It's interesting to wonder about a guy

3334
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,320
In a position like that

3335
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:34,624
Who's older has a

3336
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:36,416
A moment where

3337
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:38,464
He wants to undo

3338
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:40,256
Stop may be seized

3339
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:44,608
In a Flash or maybe a slowly developing realization

3340
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,632
The

3341
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,400
Haitians of what

3342
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,424
What's involved here

3343
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:50,240
How to describe

3344
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:51,776
A

3345
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,568
Japanese

Sail to it

3348
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:56,896
People

3349
02:34:57,408 --> 02:35:00,736
Right during this time. As a way to make money right because there

3350
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:02,784
Encircled by all the other powers

3351
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,576
And she brings it all home though

3352
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:05,600
He talks about

3353
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:06,880
Well let me have her

3354
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:08,416
Lights quote

3355
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:13,024
Japan's leaders let the Diplomatic crisis Brew

3356
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:16,608
Meanwhile it's people remained ignorant of such development

3357
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:19,424
In a sweeping national campaign to raise money

3358
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,496
Citizens were urged to buy National Life Insurance

3359
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:28,384
Image Ally it was announced with great Fanfare that 50 million policies have been sold

3360
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,944
Japan's population was about 73

3361
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:36,832
Raising 10 billion yen almost 40% of the country's gross national product for 1941

3362
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,136
Most of that money she writes

3363
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:42,976
Went to purchase government bonds to fund Japan's War in China

3364
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:46,560
Little did people know that their lives would become very cheap

3365
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:51,424
Even worthless thanks to the government they so earnestly supported with their hard-earned

3366
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,960
Hard save money

3367
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,240
And quote

3368
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:56,800
Not just that

3369
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:58,336
But this is where

3370
02:35:58,592 --> 02:36:01,408
The Uber patriotism of the Japanese

3371
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:06,016
He's coming to play here as we said earlier like everyone else only more so

3372
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:08,576
I still feel like there was a

3373
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:10,368
And a New York Times

3374
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:11,904
Article

3375
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:13,952
Just before the war broke out

3376
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:15,744
Foraging John toland

3377
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,560
The Rising Sun

3378
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:20,864
We're someone over in

3379
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:24,192
Asia is trying to explain to the American public

3380
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,240
You not to

3381
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:27,776
Downplay

3382
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:34,432
The Japanese national spirit and what they're willing to do hey it's funny because if you think of many other country

3383
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:39,296
In a situation with their government gets them in an unwinnable War

3384
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,576
Where the cost

3385
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:43,392
Will be everything to everyone

3386
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:47,232
They might overthrow that government rather than go to war

3387
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,256
The Japanese people

3388
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:49,792
Are different

3389
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:54,400
If you could have shown the leadership a crystal ball

3390
02:36:54,912 --> 02:37:01,056
It only showed 5 years into the future that have given up anything you have made any concessions in any sort of dip

3391
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:01,824
Climatic.

3392
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,360
The barring that

3393
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:04,640
They could count on the

3394
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
Support of a p

3395
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,176
People

3396
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,200
Takes

3397
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:08,736
Patriotism

3398
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,272
Can you level

3399
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:15,904
Literally the day before War breaks out they'll be a

3400
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,464
Cable sent the New York Times by one of their

3401
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:20,512
People who

3402
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:25,120
Is in Japan and understands the situation they're better than his Auto delicious

3403
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:28,192
And the cable says

3404
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:33,824
That the Japanese people are refusing to believe that they're just about to get into a war

3405
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:36,128
With four nations simultaneous

3406
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:44,576
Think about how many governments would be overthrown by their people if those governments got them in a situation that hopeless

3407
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:46,624
The Japanese are

3408
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:48,928
A different class of folk

3409
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:49,952
And this

3410
02:37:50,464 --> 02:37:53,792
Writer is trying to point out to the New York Times readership

3411
02:37:54,304 --> 02:38:00,192
Exactly what things look like from the other side and don't underestimate these people

3412
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:04,288
After saying that the Japanese don't believe that they're about to face

3413
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:07,616
4 Nation simultaneously he continues by saying quote

3414
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:12,480
But their instinctive hopes are daily contradicted by the evidence of their senses

3415
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:16,064
They listen to alarming statements by the highest government officials

3416
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:20,416
About the greatest crisis Japan has ever faced in her 2600 year history

3417
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:24,256
We are called to mass meetings to hear denunciations of the enemy

3418
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:27,072
And they read a steady War clamor in the Press

3419
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:32,448
They see are shelters in water reservoirs being built everywhere in preparation for Air Raids

3420
02:38:32,704 --> 02:38:34,752
They're being drilled in Air Raid Offense

3421
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:36,544
Especially in fighting fires

3422
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,848
The greatest Japanese cities

3423
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:42,432
Finally they see taxes and prices rising

3424
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:45,248
They know that all these things are not done for fun

3425
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:50,112
And that war real war which only a short time ago seems so very far away

3426
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:54,720
Is rapidly stretching out its fiery arms towards nipon land of the Gods

3427
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:56,768
The cable continues quote

3428
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,072
The people do not want war

3429
02:38:59,328 --> 02:39:05,216
But neither do they want to give up the fruits of the war that they have been fighting which is costume such a lot of blood and treasure

3430
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:08,288
They've been told that this war is a war of self-defense

3431
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:11,360
To obtain Elbow Room for the Japanese people

3432
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:13,408
Crowded into a few small Islands

3433
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:14,944
A few national resources

3434
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:19,296
Deliberate one thousand million of Oriental peoples

3435
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:21,600
Exploitation by the white races

3436
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,392
It would be a great mistake

3437
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:24,928
The cable continues

3438
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:31,328
To assume that the Japanese are so war-weary that they would be reluctant to fight if War really came to their land

3439
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:36,704
Or that their War potential is a smaller is straightened at the outward picture might suggest

3440
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:39,520
As members of a Divine family state

3441
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:42,336
In which patriotism and religion merge

3442
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,872
They not merely say

3443
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:45,920
My country right or wrong

3444
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:50,272
But they're convinced with all the fervor of religious faith that their country is right

3445
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:53,344
Whatever mistakes in tactics individual states when they take

3446
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:54,624
And quote

3447
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:58,208
By the way it's this fervor

3448
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:03,584
Something that sometimes wrapped up into something the Japanese call the Yamato spirit

3449
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:09,472
That those Optimist were hoping for a positive outcome in any conflict with the West

3450
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:11,776
Are sort of basing their hopes on right

3451
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:18,944
If you look at 20th Century history by the way there is a lot of places that have tried to overcome

3452
02:40:19,456 --> 02:40:20,480
Industrial

3453
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:24,576
And material imbalances by saying things like while we're tougher

3454
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:27,136
Or a fighting Spirits better or what have you

3455
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:30,464
And the Japanese have no choice but to put

3456
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:33,024
Their hopes in the same sort of

3457
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:35,328
Rationales after all

3458
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:39,168
If the government gets a meeting right around this time. Where they're told that

3459
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:41,728
The Japanese industrial capabilities

3460
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:45,824
Even with all the steroids of the Chinese raw materials and everything else

3461
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:46,848
R1

3462
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:47,616
Madea

3463
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:49,152
Of the United States has

3464
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:50,944
Abilities and by the way

3465
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,992
That number is a low

3466
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:54,016
As well

3467
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,856
So the Prime Minister Prince konoye

3468
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:03,744
Puts his feelers forward and wants to have a meeting with Roosevelt in an attempt to it sounds like

3469
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,144
You know use this intricate Japanese governmental system in a way where he plays chess with

3470
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:15,264
The military officials and uses the emperor the nuclear bomb piece on the chessboard

3471
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,800
To sort of checkmate

3472
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,592
This war that's coming

3473
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:20,128
In it he says

3474
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:20,896
He needs

3475
02:41:21,152 --> 02:41:21,664
Is the

3476
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,432
Agreement

3477
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:28,832
With Roosevelt needs to come back with something so he proposes disagreement with Roosevelt Roosevelt can't come right away cuz he's mean

3478
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:30,880
Meeting secretly with Winston Churchill

3479
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:33,184
On some Naval vessels

3480
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:34,720
In the Atlantic

3481
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:38,816
And he'll come out of it with something that's known to history is the Atlantic Charter

3482
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:44,192
A template for the governance of the post second world war world

3483
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:45,984
Shorthand but

3484
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:49,056
There's a lot of high-minded Woodrow Wilson type stuff in it

3485
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:51,104
Self-determination

3486
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:55,456
People should be able to elect their own governments a bunch of stuff that if you are the Japanese

3487
02:41:55,712 --> 02:42:01,344
Looks like it's directed squarely at you we celebrated in the United States in high school textbooks here

3488
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:05,440
This is the kind of high-minded Western Democratic idealistic stuffing

3489
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:09,536
We've lost a lot of human beings fighting Wars for those kind of values

3490
02:42:10,048 --> 02:42:13,120
But if you're the Japanese and someone saying that you know we're going to go

3491
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:18,752
Towards shut down Nation who won't let people choose their own governments will what does that say about China

3492
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:21,568
Right there not choosing the Japanese to govern them

3493
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:25,152
So it sounds like it's directed at them what's more

3494
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:28,224
It looks very hypocritical especially to

3495
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,760
Peoples in Asia

3496
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,552
When the British were on board with

3497
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:34,880
Because the British are one of the great maybe they

3498
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:36,416
The greatest of the colonial

3499
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:37,184
Peoples

3500
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:43,840
And so are you saying that this Atlantic Charter applies to you too are you signing on the dotted line and saying that you're going to let the people in

3501
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:44,608
India

3502
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:48,960
Vote if they want to have the British government have the role the British government has in India

3503
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:50,752
In the 1930s for example

3504
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:52,800
Churchill goes on to clarify

3505
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:55,872
Like a month or two later no no no we're talking about

3506
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:59,200
Pakistan access dominated lands here when I'm talking about

3507
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:01,248
Eunos Singapore

3508
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:04,576
Once again though to the peoples in Asia

3509
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:11,488
This looks a little like okay it's World War 1 all over again these high-minded sediments don't apply to us

3510
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:16,096
And even though the Japanese are raping China as they conquer it

3511
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:19,168
They may not look as bad to Asians

3512
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:21,984
As they do to the people in the western democracies

3513
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:28,896
Roosevelt is apparently open to the idea of a meeting with the Japanese prime minister when he hears about it

3514
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:30,944
But his advisors kind of shut it down

3515
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:35,552
The Japanese have just rejected the latest diplomatic proposals and the

3516
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:38,368
If I just a list of those need to be clarified before we meet

3517
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:40,416
Now as we just discussed though

3518
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:42,464
How long can you put this off

3519
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:49,120
When the fleet burning 400 tons of fuel an hour right so this becomes another one of the problems and I'm not going to get into

3520
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:50,656
All the many things

3521
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:51,424
What happened in the last

3522
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,960
It's a great

3523
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:58,336
Era to look at if you are a fan of diplomatic history

3524
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:04,736
The tit-for-tat things that go on but also the Mini Miss assessments misinterpretation

3525
02:44:05,248 --> 02:44:06,528
Miss readings

3526
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:07,552
And

3527
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:09,088
Lee mistranslations

3528
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:14,976
What happened I mean in a famous case they'll be some Christian missionaries in the story well-meaning Folk

3529
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:18,304
For trying to help everyone a vertica tastrophe here

3530
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,096
Did the Japanese think

3531
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:23,424
Are working you as a back Channel for the US government

3532
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:24,704
But really aren't

3533
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:30,336
And this confuses matters for a while I mean it's one of these occasions where you wish you had

3534
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,896
What the Soviet Union in the United States

3535
02:44:33,152 --> 02:44:33,920
Add at one point

3536
02:44:34,176 --> 02:44:34,688
The Cold War

3537
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:36,992
Set the battle in the red phone the hotline

3538
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:40,064
And you can just call up the emperor the head of the Japanese government

3539
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:42,624
Talk to them directly with instant translation

3540
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:44,160
But you didn't have that

3541
02:44:45,952 --> 02:44:46,976
But even if you did

3542
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:51,584
Is there enough room on the core issues to compromise on any of this stuff

3543
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:55,168
One of the compromises that

3544
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:58,752
The Prime Minister had to make to even reach out to Roosevelt

3545
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:01,056
Was a deal apparently with the army

3546
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:02,848
It is the diplomacy didn't work

3547
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:05,152
Heat set a timetable for war

3548
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,944
Well the diplomacy didn't work

3549
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:09,760
Apparently Kanye

3550
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:14,368
There is a significant amount of responsibility for getting Japan into this mess

3551
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,416
Didn't want to sign off on

3552
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:23,328
The ramifications of it and have his John Hancock any War declarations or anything he didn't see any way out he said the emperor

3553
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:25,632
Basically going over to the other side now

3554
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:28,704
And so what's the point and resign

3555
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,776
The emperor replaces him

3556
02:45:32,544 --> 02:45:34,080
One of the

3557
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,640
Hawkish

3558
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:38,176
Figures out there

3559
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:41,504
The head of the war Ministry former General

3560
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:43,040
In the kwantung army

3561
02:45:43,552 --> 02:45:45,856
A man whose nickname was the razor

3562
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:47,648
The name is Hideki

3563
02:45:47,904 --> 02:45:48,416
Keto Mojo

3564
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:51,488
And now we haven't placed the entire

3565
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:54,048
Leadership that you're normally dealing with

3566
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:56,096
When you talk about this conflict

3567
02:45:56,608 --> 02:45:59,936
Tell Joe in the American war propaganda

3568
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:01,216
Was simply

3569
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:06,335
Turned into the figure that Americans could hate in the same way that they had Hitler and Mussolini

3570
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:09,407
He's the dictator of Japan is the way it's portrayed

3571
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:12,735
And this continued for decades after the war

3572
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:15,039
Because this became part of the propaganda that help

3573
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:18,623
She'll be Emperor from war crimes charges and by the way

3574
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:22,719
Several modern historians think the emperor might have been executed for war crimes

3575
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:25,279
And those charges been allowed to happen

3576
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:30,143
But if you say the emperor is a puppet with no power and you say he's a tool of the militarists

3577
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:34,239
How do you say the general Tojo the head of the militarists will then you just transferred all the

3578
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:39,871
Emperor's wartime responsibility to decide their figure and that's what the American propaganda kind of Dead 2

3579
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:46,271
Told you looks like your typical Japanese hardliner General but not as far as some of those Imperial Wayfair

3580
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,295
Faction people

3581
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,623
You can't really say he's like a Hitler

3582
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:52,927
For Mussolini or Stalin

3583
02:46:53,183 --> 02:46:54,463
Because unlike them

3584
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:55,999
He has a boss

3585
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:58,047
A boss that it's

3586
02:46:58,559 --> 02:46:59,327
Likely

3587
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:03,423
But he saw as the living embodiment of a god

3588
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:07,263
That's a very different situation than someone like Stalin or Hitler

3589
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:08,287
Example

3590
02:47:08,543 --> 02:47:09,567
It also means

3591
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,359
He has to do what he's told

3592
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:13,919
There's a lot of theories on the emperor for all the reasons why

3593
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:16,223
We talked about but one of them is that this move

3594
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:23,135
To put this Army General in control is not what most people think it is most people think this is a sign that they give

3595
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:25,951
Even in there going to go to war if we going to go to war they wanted general in charge

3596
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:30,047
But some people say that no this is actually the emperor is sneaky attempt to avoid war

3597
02:47:31,583 --> 02:47:33,887
This is a minority point of view obviously but

3598
02:47:34,143 --> 02:47:36,191
Those who push this idea suggests

3599
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:37,215
But it's a

3600
02:47:37,471 --> 02:47:39,519
Nixon goes to China, Scituate

3601
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,287
Malaysian

3602
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:42,591
The ol Switcheroo the emperor

3603
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:44,639
Appoints one of the really big

3604
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:47,967
Noisy Hawk to this position of prime minister

3605
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:51,295
He has all the respect of the other Hawks and militarists

3606
02:47:51,807 --> 02:47:56,159
And then you the emperor someone this person sees potentially as a living God

3607
02:47:56,415 --> 02:47:57,951
Orders this Hawk

3608
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:59,231
To make peace

3609
02:47:59,999 --> 02:48:00,511
Somehow

3610
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:01,791
Without War

3611
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:06,143
And then he'll cover your rear end with the other military is right cuz he's got total credibility

3612
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:07,423
It's an interesting Theory

3613
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:14,847
One thing is for sure is that the emperor orders Tojo to pursue diplomacy until the last possible minute and he fall

3614
02:48:15,103 --> 02:48:16,127
How old is the emperor's orders

3615
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,175
But he's working

3616
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:19,711
With the deadline

3617
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:25,855
And it's a deadline that changes a couple of times but eventually becomes a hard deadline where you have all over Asia

3618
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,135
Preparations in

3619
02:48:27,391 --> 02:48:27,903
In place

3620
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:29,183
Manor on the move

3621
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:34,047
Shipping is being co-opted things are happening and preparations are underway

3622
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:37,375
Unless something intervenes to stop now

3623
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:39,167
This momentum

3624
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:40,703
Things are going to happen

3625
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:41,983
And I will be set

3626
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,263
In the future

3627
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:44,543
Automatically

3628
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:48,895
The inertia we've been talking about for a while now

3629
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:50,943
He's becoming almost on the stop

3630
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,223
Football in the final deadline

3631
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:53,503
Now for some sort of diplomat

3632
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:54,527
Breakthrough

3633
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:55,807
Is the end of November

3634
02:48:57,599 --> 02:48:59,647
There's a lot of different interpretations of

3635
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,671
Hideki Tojo

3636
02:49:01,183 --> 02:49:02,463
What kind of guy he is

3637
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:05,023
One thing you never read about him though

3638
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:06,815
Is any sort of suggestion

3639
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:08,095
But he was insane

3640
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,143
That's

3641
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:11,679
Basically what

3642
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:14,495
Winston Churchill is saying

3643
02:49:15,263 --> 02:49:19,871
Did any Japanese government that would allow their country to slip into a war with the Anglo Mary

3644
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:21,151
And at this point

3645
02:49:21,663 --> 02:49:23,967
Is crazy suicidal is the way I think

3646
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:25,247
He puts a Churchill rights

3647
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:27,039
And right after the war

3648
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:28,319
Quote

3649
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:35,999
It it seemed impossible that Japan would Court destruction by war with Britain and the United States and probably

3650
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:37,023
Russia in the end

3651
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:41,631
A declaration of war by Japan could not be reconciled with reason

3652
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:47,007
I felt sure she would be ruined for Generation by such a plunge and this proved true

3653
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:50,591
What governments and people do not always take rational decision

3654
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,895
Sometimes they take mad decision

3655
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:55,455
For one set of people get control

3656
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:58,783
To compel all others to obey and Aid them in Folly

3657
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:02,367
I have not hesitated to record repeatedly he writes

3658
02:50:02,623 --> 02:50:05,183
My disbelief the Japan would go mad

3659
02:50:05,695 --> 02:50:11,839
However sincerely we try to put ourselves in another person's position we cannot allow four processes of the human

3660
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:13,375
Imagination

3661
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:15,423
To which reason offers no key

3662
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:16,959
He sums up

3663
02:50:17,471 --> 02:50:18,239
By saying

3664
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,263
Quote

3665
02:50:19,519 --> 02:50:25,663
Madness is however and affliction which in war carries with it the advantage of surprise

3666
02:50:26,687 --> 02:50:27,199
And quote

3667
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,271
The word surprise

3668
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:32,831
Is italicized in the original

3669
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:35,391
In order to

3670
02:50:35,647 --> 02:50:36,415
Get a little back

3671
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:37,439
And on how

3672
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:38,719
Any surprise my

3673
02:50:39,231 --> 02:50:39,743
Place

3674
02:50:40,255 --> 02:50:40,767
When you're talkin

3675
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:43,327
Powers that are so far away from each other

3676
02:50:44,607 --> 02:50:46,143
You got to go back to 1940

3677
02:50:46,655 --> 02:50:47,935
1941 late night

3678
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:53,823
1940's part of the demonstrations are resolved in the public displays

3679
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:54,847
2

3680
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:58,687
The bolster diplomacy and whatnot the Roosevelt administration did a couple of

3681
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:00,223
Big moves one of them was

3682
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:03,039
To reactivate general Douglas MacArthur

3683
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:04,575
Us

3684
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:07,647
General it was acting as Field Marshal the Philippine military

3685
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:12,511
Reactivating in the Philippines and let him sort of publicly start consolidating a

3686
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:15,583
Preparing just in case any message to Japan

3687
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:16,863
The other thing

3688
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:19,423
Was to demonstrate resolve and all that kind of stuff

3689
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:25,823
The Roosevelt administration did was they took the Pacific u.s. Pacific Fleet which is normally based on the west coast of the United States

3690
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:27,615
And moved it to Hawaii

3691
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:33,503
What is still a 6-hour Jet Plane ride towards Asia from the US West Coast

3692
02:51:33,759 --> 02:51:35,039
Based in Pearl Harbor

3693
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:36,575
What you know

3694
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:40,927
One man's intimidation move could be another man's

3695
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:42,207
Opportunity

3696
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:44,511
But it takes

3697
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:48,095
A person who's almost a little bit crazy

3698
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:49,119
To see it

3699
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:53,215
Sometimes that's what creative Geniuses are

3700
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:55,263
Sometimes you just

3701
02:51:55,519 --> 02:51:57,567
Require somebody willing to gamble

3702
02:51:57,823 --> 02:51:58,591
Farther than most

3703
02:51:58,847 --> 02:51:59,359
People are willing

3704
02:51:59,615 --> 02:52:00,127
Home to go

3705
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,431
Enter

3706
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:04,991
Merle isoroku yamamoto

3707
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:06,271
Did the story

3708
02:52:07,295 --> 02:52:09,343
The name's familiar he's famous and

3709
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:12,415
He's famous for both being a creative military genius

3710
02:52:12,671 --> 02:52:13,695
Crazy gambler

3711
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:16,511
You met him in person you probably

3712
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:18,559
We would not be very intimidated he stood

3713
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:20,095
543 Maybe

3714
02:52:20,607 --> 02:52:21,119
4

3715
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:23,935
Was missing several major fingers

3716
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:24,703
From one

3717
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:28,031
Hand and walk with a limp because an entire chunk of his

3718
02:52:28,287 --> 02:52:30,591
Leg been torn off along with those fingers

3719
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:33,919
In probably the most famous Naval

3720
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:36,479
Unify battle.of

3721
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:37,247
Ashima

3722
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:39,551
The

3723
02:52:39,807 --> 02:52:40,831
Improbable

3724
02:52:41,087 --> 02:52:44,671
Almost near impossible happened when an Asian Fleet defeated

3725
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:47,743
European Fleet and I mean resoundingly

3726
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:50,047
As we had talked about earlier

3727
02:52:50,303 --> 02:52:50,815
Japanese

3728
02:52:51,327 --> 02:52:52,351
Destroyed the Russian

3729
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,119
Pretended

3730
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:55,423
Yamamoto was there as a Young office

3731
02:52:55,679 --> 02:52:57,727
Officer and badly wounded and almost love

3732
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,495
Lost his life

3733
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:05,407
That is one of the battles that will often be cited as an inspiration for Yamamoto

3734
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:06,943
Idea here

3735
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:12,319
And idea that is so crazy and improbable in so much of a Gamble

3736
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:16,927
It when he presents it to the other Admirals you know on the big decision board

3737
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:18,463
They reject it

3738
02:53:19,743 --> 02:53:20,255
And

3739
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:26,399
It's a sign of how brilliant he was and this was recognized by his peers

3740
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:31,007
That when he threatened to resign if they rejected it

3741
02:53:31,263 --> 02:53:32,287
They change their mind

3742
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:37,151
They rather accept an idea they thought was crazy

3743
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:43,039
Then Lose the person who came up with it because they acknowledge what I created military genius

3744
02:53:43,295 --> 02:53:43,807
He is

3745
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:48,415
He didn't develop these plan by the way alone

3746
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:52,511
He had spent more than a year working with other notice

3747
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:55,839
People people that are famous in the story with my favorite one of them

3748
02:53:56,351 --> 02:54:00,959
Is a one historian described him as he's a military guy that he's a Gandhi like

3749
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:04,799
Figure who chain smokes and leaves Trails of Ashes behind him

3750
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:06,847
Seems like a you know a

3751
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:08,639
Einstein

3752
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,919
Flash

3753
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:13,503
Archimedes Sheldon Cooper kind of figure

3754
02:54:13,759 --> 02:54:15,039
Doesn't bathe

3755
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:21,439
Apparently or doesn't bathe very often locks himself in completely darkened rooms naked

3756
02:54:21,951 --> 02:54:28,095
Transpiration in dominicanas writes things down really quickly in a piece of these this fascinating like wild character

3757
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:30,655
Who can come up with an idea that is so crazy

3758
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:33,727
That the other side definitely doesn't see it coming

3759
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:40,127
And is so unusual and unexpected that I find it hard to even blame them

3760
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:41,407
For not seeing it coming

3761
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:42,943
I said about the 9/11 attack

3762
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:43,711
Before

3763
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:47,295
But even though there were warnings about them it just seems so improbable

3764
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:50,111
And seems so dwarfed by other

3765
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:54,463
Potential bad things that you're also getting warnings about that seem much more likely

3766
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:57,023
But it's only with hindsight that you look back

3767
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:00,095
Can go God why weren't we more Vigilant why do we see this coming

3768
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:01,631
Who would have seen

3769
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,679
A surprise attack

3770
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:05,727
On US territory

3771
02:55:06,239 --> 02:55:09,823
It was coming from a power that was 4000 miles away

3772
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:13,407
Remember this is an era before cruise missile

3773
02:55:14,175 --> 02:55:16,479
Before even airplanes that could get

3774
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:19,039
You know without a refueling stop

3775
02:55:19,295 --> 02:55:20,319
From Japan

3776
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:25,695
To replace like Hawaii I don't think they could get all the way that certainly can get to the West Coast certainly couldn't go round trip

3777
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:30,303
So if you're in a place like Hawaii how afraid are you

3778
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:35,167
The Japanese are going to strike you especially since you know you don't even have a war in the answer is

3779
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:36,447
Not very afraid

3780
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:40,031
Yamamoto and friend

3781
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:43,359
Are going to come up with an idea

3782
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:45,663
To win a war

3783
02:55:46,175 --> 02:55:47,455
But he doesn't believe

3784
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:48,479
Is winnabow

3785
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:51,551
That's an interesting thing to

3786
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:52,319
Task

3787
02:55:52,575 --> 02:55:53,343
Somebody with IBS

3788
02:55:53,599 --> 02:55:55,647
Yamamoto like a lot of these Japanese

3789
02:55:55,903 --> 02:55:58,719
Leaders especially the Navy Yamamoto went to Harvard

3790
02:55:58,975 --> 02:55:59,743
For a little while

3791
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:03,583
He has a famous line about you until you see in the factories of Duty

3792
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:07,167
Troy do the oil fields of Texas you know you don't know what you're talkin about

3793
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:08,191
When you want to make war

3794
02:56:09,215 --> 02:56:09,727
The Uso

3795
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:10,751
Famously

3796
02:56:11,263 --> 02:56:12,287
How it is

3797
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:18,175
Let's just call him extremely realistic like a lot of guys in the Navy which is part of the reason the Navy was

3798
02:56:18,431 --> 02:56:19,199
More against

3799
02:56:19,711 --> 02:56:20,735
Fighting the Anglo America

3800
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:22,015
We said earlier

3801
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:24,575
They understand they're going to be doing most of the fighting

3802
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:28,159
Historian area Ulta

3803
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:30,207
Has him talking to another app

3804
02:56:31,231 --> 02:56:34,559
And basically predicting the way the Warriors going to go

3805
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:37,119
Yamamoto tells Admiral Lugano

3806
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:38,143
Quote

3807
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:39,679
If I might add

3808
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:43,519
It is evident that the US Japanese war is bound to be protractor

3809
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:48,127
The United States will not give up fighting as long as Japan has the upper hand

3810
02:56:48,383 --> 02:56:50,431
The war will last for several years

3811
02:56:50,943 --> 02:56:57,087
In the meantime Japan's resources will be depleted battleships and weaponry will be damaged replenish

3812
02:56:57,343 --> 02:56:58,879
Fishing materials will be impossible

3813
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:00,671
Japan will be impoverished

3814
02:57:00,927 --> 02:57:03,231
He didn't famously concluded quote

3815
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:06,815
A war with so little chance of success should not be fought

3816
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:08,095
And quote

3817
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:12,703
But it was his job none of us to come up with a way to

3818
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:13,471
How to do it

3819
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:20,127
The plan has been I mean there's a lot of accounts it's famous some people being a say it's inspired by a famous Samurai by

3820
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:21,407
Got a long time ago

3821
02:57:21,663 --> 02:57:23,711
Some people say the Battle of tsushima that

3822
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:26,271
Yamamoto was out of the inspiration

3823
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:30,111
Others point to something much more recent in 1940

3824
02:57:30,623 --> 02:57:31,391
A British

3825
02:57:31,647 --> 02:57:35,231
Task force in the Mediterranean with a single aircraft

3826
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:37,535
Carrier and British aircraft carrier to not

3827
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:38,303
Cherry Lana

3828
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:39,839
By Pacific Standard

3829
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:42,143
And their airplanes are very outdated by

3830
02:57:42,655 --> 02:57:43,167
Tipping standards

3831
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:45,727
Launched an attack against the Italian Fleet

3832
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:47,519
Which was anchored in Port

3833
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:48,543
At night

3834
02:57:49,823 --> 02:57:51,871
These outdated biplane

3835
02:57:52,895 --> 02:57:58,271
And they were I think between 20 and 30 of them overall but a minute times you had like six of them attacking

3836
02:57:58,527 --> 02:58:02,623
Did a large amount of damage and put a bunch of these ships out of commission for quite a while

3837
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:06,463
The Japanese are there was a Japanese

3838
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:09,023
Envoy or advisor

3839
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:12,095
Attache in Berlin who I just came down to look at

3840
02:58:13,119 --> 02:58:15,679
Effects at the harbor at Toronto the 19

3841
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:16,447
E-40 battle

3842
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:19,007
It's called and sent that back

3843
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:23,615
To Japan so all of these things were studied in by January 1941

3844
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:24,895
Yamamoto is God

3845
02:58:25,663 --> 02:58:27,199
A like mock-up

3846
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:33,087
Of Pearl Harbor in an out-of-the-way place and he's got people sort of just planning for this he's wargaming it

3847
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:37,695
In the challenges by the way are immense

3848
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:39,999
Because the battlefield

3849
02:58:40,255 --> 02:58:40,767
What is a man

3850
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:46,911
This conflict which we fought in the Pacific but will instantly sucking all the Asian

3851
02:58:47,167 --> 02:58:49,983
Warfare this been going on now for several years already

3852
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:53,823
This is a battlefield so large you could drop whole continent

3853
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:55,871
The room all around the edges

3854
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:58,943
Logistics

3855
02:58:59,199 --> 02:59:03,807
You know getting the stuff that the armies and navies need to fight and operate

3856
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:10,463
Where they need to be in the quantities you need to have them is going to be the sort of challenge that overhangs every op

3857
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,231
Operation

3858
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:15,583
And will in large part determine the success or failure of them

3859
02:59:15,839 --> 02:59:18,143
For this entire conflict that's the overriding

3860
02:59:18,655 --> 02:59:20,447
In a military challenge in this theater

3861
02:59:20,703 --> 02:59:21,215
Distance

3862
02:59:22,751 --> 02:59:23,775
How to get an idea

3863
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:28,127
Of the kind of distance were talking about uniform comparison purposes

3864
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:33,759
At this same time where we are in the story in October November 1941

3865
02:59:34,271 --> 02:59:35,295
Wolverine

3866
02:59:35,807 --> 02:59:37,855
Well I was going to say you're a butt it's almost

3867
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:39,903
It on the way to Asia

3868
02:59:40,415 --> 02:59:46,559
Outside the doors of Moscow the vert mocked is fighting what they hope we're going to be these climactic

3869
02:59:46,815 --> 02:59:49,375
Battles with the Soviet Union's capital is going to fall

3870
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:56,031
But they're facing all sorts of logistical trouble right their supply lines are

3871
02:59:56,287 --> 02:59:58,335
Famously stretched to the Limit

3872
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:02,687
The Germans are now relearning the lessons you could have asked

3873
03:00:02,943 --> 03:00:06,527
Earlier conquerors about Napoleon could have explained the whole problem

3874
03:00:06,783 --> 03:00:08,319
While he was trying to

3875
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:10,111
Deal with supply issues

3876
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:13,183
When taking Moscow hats you could go back to

3877
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:18,047
Charles the twelfth of Sweden before Napoleon he could have told you the same story

3878
03:00:19,327 --> 03:00:25,471
That when you get that far away from your base of operations it's hard to get the troops at the head of the snake you know as a

3879
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:27,519
It's called what they need to fight

3880
03:00:27,775 --> 03:00:32,895
Berlin to Moscow is Like A Thousand Miles about as the crow flies anyway

3881
03:00:33,663 --> 03:00:34,687
Longer when you want you

3882
03:00:34,943 --> 03:00:35,967
Go on those roads

3883
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:38,015
But for perspective

3884
03:00:38,271 --> 03:00:41,087
Tokyo to Oahu which is the first

3885
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:45,695
You're not to downplay anybody but in the first significant u.s. territory closest to Japan

3886
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:46,719
The Guam

3887
03:00:46,975 --> 03:00:51,583
Alaskan Island things like that but that's 4000 miles away

3888
03:00:52,095 --> 03:00:55,935
4 times the distance from Berlin to Moscow so if they're having problems keeping the

3889
03:00:56,191 --> 03:00:57,471
Vermox applied

3890
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:59,775
It over by Moscow think about what it takes

3891
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:02,335
To transport everything you need

3892
03:01:02,591 --> 03:01:04,895
To keep an army put together across the Pacific

3893
03:01:06,175 --> 03:01:10,527
This is part of the war plans that the Japanese have had now for more than a decade

3894
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:16,415
Everyone knows right that major militaries have War plans in the back of their Dusty files

3895
03:01:16,671 --> 03:01:20,767
The cover almost any eventuality you can think of I mean you got to do something

3896
03:01:21,023 --> 03:01:23,071
You're not doing anything else and coming up with a plan

3897
03:01:23,327 --> 03:01:26,399
The United States to fight Canada the Canadians get all uppity

3898
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:29,727
Well you know that's just covering all your bases and by the way there was a plant

3899
03:01:33,311 --> 03:01:34,847
In this case the Japanese plan

3900
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:38,175
For dealing with the United States involved the Philippines

3901
03:01:38,431 --> 03:01:39,455
This is sort of

3902
03:01:39,711 --> 03:01:40,223
Bait

3903
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:42,527
They were going to take the Philippines

3904
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:46,367
And then when the United States sent the fleet over to contest it

3905
03:01:46,623 --> 03:01:48,671
They were going to have a trap set

3906
03:01:49,695 --> 03:01:53,279
This trap was going to be aided by they envisioned

3907
03:01:53,535 --> 03:01:58,399
Aircraft and submarines that would use Island bases farther out of the Pacific and they could

3908
03:01:58,911 --> 03:01:59,423
Sort of like

3909
03:01:59,679 --> 03:02:00,191
Gnats

3910
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:04,287
Or mosquitoes weakening the us all along the way

3911
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:09,919
You don't have them in a condition not feeling so excited about fighting and then they walk into a trap

3912
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:13,503
If you look at the way the Japanese Navy is put together

3913
03:02:14,015 --> 03:02:18,879
It's designed especially like their newer unit is designed for this trap

3914
03:02:19,135 --> 03:02:19,903
Situation

3915
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:25,279
Anyone who is a fan of the Japanese Navy in the second world war knows

3916
03:02:25,535 --> 03:02:30,655
That it was constrained by treaties and other things and not allowed to be as big as the British Fleet

3917
03:02:30,911 --> 03:02:31,423
What do you ask

3918
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:32,191
Sleet

3919
03:02:32,447 --> 03:02:37,311
So what do you do if your the Japanese and you got those kind of constraints will they decided to go quality

3920
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,079
Instead

3921
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:42,431
If we can only have so many battleships let's make them really good battleships

3922
03:02:43,199 --> 03:02:47,295
Just as Wars about to break out of here the Japanese are finishing up the field trials

3923
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:50,879
Of the most powerful Battleship not just in the world

3924
03:02:51,135 --> 03:02:53,695
The most powerful Battleship that will ever be built

3925
03:02:55,487 --> 03:02:57,279
It's famous it's the Yamato

3926
03:02:58,047 --> 03:03:01,631
The only other ship is powerful is the Yamato that will ever be built

3927
03:03:01,887 --> 03:03:03,423
Is it sister ship

3928
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,983
The Musashi that's only a little bit behind

3929
03:03:06,239 --> 03:03:06,751
The Yamato

3930
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:10,079
And then behind that is another one called the shin I know

3931
03:03:10,335 --> 03:03:11,359
All of these

3932
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:12,127
Ships

3933
03:03:12,383 --> 03:03:13,407
Will it rain

3934
03:03:13,919 --> 03:03:14,943
Their American counterparts

3935
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:16,479
They have

3936
03:03:16,991 --> 03:03:22,367
An unbelievable amount of armor they are enormous their guns are 18.1 in

3937
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:25,695
The nearest Naval competitor with 16-inch guns

3938
03:03:25,951 --> 03:03:29,791
19.1 inch gun just so you know and the Yamato has nine of them

3939
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:32,095
Can fire a car

3940
03:03:32,607 --> 03:03:33,887
In terms of weight

3941
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:35,167
26 miles

3942
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:40,287
The window shells landed the destruction was enormous

3943
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:43,359
The best battleships

3944
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:44,383
Germany

3945
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:45,407
The Bismarck

3946
03:03:45,663 --> 03:03:46,175
Tirpitz

3947
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:51,807
The best battleships of the United States in the Iowa-class Missouri type battleships

3948
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:54,879
You write down the specs for the

3949
03:03:55,135 --> 03:03:57,695
Side by side with the Yamato class and there's no

3950
03:03:57,951 --> 03:03:58,463
Comparison

3951
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:01,791
These super

3952
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:02,559
Battleship

3953
03:04:02,815 --> 03:04:03,839
So they're often termed

3954
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:06,655
We're going to be the major hammers that

3955
03:04:06,911 --> 03:04:10,239
Would come down on the American Fleet that's across the Pacific

3956
03:04:11,007 --> 03:04:14,591
We can buy submarines and aircraft the entire way across

3957
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:16,383
And during the Ambush This Is How They

3958
03:04:16,895 --> 03:04:17,663
Going to be destroyed

3959
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:20,479
In this existing long-term job

3960
03:04:20,735 --> 03:04:21,247
Japanese war plan

3961
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:27,391
Then what's interesting is the plan from that point on once you gain this big advantage over the American Fleet

3962
03:04:27,647 --> 03:04:30,207
Is the hunker down and sort of wait for the armistice

3963
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:33,535
Remind you a little of how the Russo Japanese war and

3964
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:34,559
Right

3965
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:36,863
The mistake in this thinking and it will be

3966
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:39,423
The mistake in the thinking in the Second World War

3967
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:43,263
Is what if the other side refuses to do the Armistice thing

3968
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:47,103
Well Admiral Yamamoto is

3969
03:04:47,871 --> 03:04:53,759
Atypical aggressive Commander there very few commanders that like to allow the enemy to seize the initiative

3970
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:55,807
To choose the place of Battle 2

3971
03:04:56,063 --> 03:04:57,087
Tacit the time

3972
03:04:57,343 --> 03:04:57,855
Of their

3973
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:04,767
These are all standard military sayings and Yamamoto has argument about the whole existing plan of the strap

3974
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:06,559
Is worth the American don't take the bank

3975
03:05:07,327 --> 03:05:08,863
What are they don't come across the Pacific

3976
03:05:09,119 --> 03:05:12,703
When you want them to what they stay home and build up their Fleet which they're doing already

3977
03:05:12,959 --> 03:05:14,495
Supercharged and then come over

3978
03:05:14,751 --> 03:05:17,823
What if they go around your trap I mean it's a whole lot of really good argument

3979
03:05:20,127 --> 03:05:20,895
Yamamoto has

3980
03:05:21,151 --> 03:05:21,919
Sing something

3981
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:23,455
This is the audaciousness

3982
03:05:23,967 --> 03:05:29,855
That we spoke about earlier this gambler but at the same time somebody who's a Visionary a Visionary is someone who sees something

3983
03:05:30,367 --> 03:05:31,135
Ahead of the crowd

3984
03:05:31,647 --> 03:05:35,743
Yamamoto sees what there are other Visionaries who also see by the way

3985
03:05:36,767 --> 03:05:38,303
The potential of aircraft carrier

3986
03:05:39,583 --> 03:05:45,727
We in the modern world have a hard time not seeing the potential of aircraft carriers do the capital ships of our air

3987
03:05:46,751 --> 03:05:52,639
And having one or not having one sort of differentiates first-class Navy's from other class navies

3988
03:05:53,407 --> 03:05:58,015
But remember it's going to be the second world war where these lessons are learned

3989
03:05:59,807 --> 03:06:01,343
We should also point out there for the first

3990
03:06:01,599 --> 03:06:07,743
More than two years of the war there's only one power that's really using aircraft carriers in combat so they're the only one

3991
03:06:07,999 --> 03:06:11,071
One's really learning a developing these techniques

3992
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:12,863
And that's the British by the way

3993
03:06:13,375 --> 03:06:16,447
The Germans and the Italians their principal opponents during the

3994
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:19,775
Two years before the Japanese Americans are in the war

3995
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:21,311
They don't have any aircraft carrier

3996
03:06:22,079 --> 03:06:24,127
Which means the British don't have to get into this

3997
03:06:24,639 --> 03:06:30,783
Technological race where they have to respond to the Innovations of the other side in carrier Warfare

3998
03:06:31,039 --> 03:06:32,063
Guy doesn't have any carriers

3999
03:06:32,575 --> 03:06:36,415
And the British being the quintessential Battleship Navy

4000
03:06:36,927 --> 03:06:39,999
They see the use of these carriers as something that

4001
03:06:40,255 --> 03:06:43,071
Increases the force multiplier for there

4002
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:44,607
Naval task force

4003
03:06:45,375 --> 03:06:50,495
Normally don't put a carrier with a naval task force in them all of a sudden it has Ariel capability which is a

4004
03:06:50,751 --> 03:06:51,263
Of course awesome

4005
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:54,591
You can scout way ahead now the range

4006
03:06:54,847 --> 03:06:57,407
A visibility now these ships is increased

4007
03:06:57,919 --> 03:07:01,247
Once they spotted enemy Naval unit they can harass it

4008
03:07:01,503 --> 03:07:04,831
Attacking and hopefully maybe you could cripple it or slow it down so that

4009
03:07:05,087 --> 03:07:06,879
When the rest of the fleet catches them

4010
03:07:07,391 --> 03:07:11,999
They can destroy the naval units of the enemy with Naval gunfire and 4p

4011
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:14,815
By the way can be aided by spotting from the

4012
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:16,351
Airplanes to Seoul

4013
03:07:16,607 --> 03:07:18,399
It's this role where they are

4014
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:20,447
Something that fits into British

4015
03:07:20,959 --> 03:07:22,495
Naval Doctrine pretty well

4016
03:07:23,519 --> 03:07:29,663
The attack at Toronto by the way is one of those areas where the Fleet air arm as it's called becomes extra

4017
03:07:29,919 --> 03:07:36,063
Are useful because the rest of the Navy can't reach the Italian Fleet and do damage with Naval gunfire so what the heck

4018
03:07:36,831 --> 03:07:39,647
Low-risk Venture send them in there and see what happens and everybody was

4019
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:42,719
Astonished by how well the results turned out

4020
03:07:43,487 --> 03:07:45,279
I like Yamamoto

4021
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:50,399
Is one of those people that allows you to jump several steps in the normal linear technological

4022
03:07:50,655 --> 03:07:51,167
Development

4023
03:07:51,935 --> 03:07:53,471
Instead of the normal in this is

4024
03:07:53,727 --> 03:07:56,287
Pretty typical in military circles you don't want to

4025
03:07:56,799 --> 03:08:02,431
Take too many chances if you're doing one thing different than the last time they tried that's considered innovation

4026
03:08:02,687 --> 03:08:08,575
A guy like Yamamoto allows you to skip several steps here cuz he looks at the Toronto situation it basically says

4027
03:08:08,831 --> 03:08:10,879
If they can do that with one carrier

4028
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:14,207
And 2230 outmoded by planes

4029
03:08:14,719 --> 03:08:17,023
What is instead of one carrier you had something like

4030
03:08:17,535 --> 03:08:18,303
6

4031
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:19,071
Aircraft

4032
03:08:19,327 --> 03:08:19,839
Carriers

4033
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:25,215
And what if instead of 20 or 30 outmoded biplanes you had more than 400

4034
03:08:25,727 --> 03:08:29,055
Of the most modern technologically sophisticated

4035
03:08:29,567 --> 03:08:31,359
Aerial attack monoplane

4036
03:08:32,639 --> 03:08:34,687
Also attacking by the way another Fleet

4037
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:35,455
Tied up

4038
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:36,223
Import

4039
03:08:38,015 --> 03:08:40,063
Yamamoto doesn't see aircraft carriers

4040
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:44,415
As something that aids the Strikeforce Yamamoto sees them as the strike

4041
03:08:44,671 --> 03:08:45,183
Force

4042
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:46,463
And instead of

4043
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:49,535
The naval gunfire being the setup to destroy

4044
03:08:49,791 --> 03:08:53,887
The enemy ships which was part of the old Japanese trap plan to wasn't it

4045
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:57,215
He sees the planes from the carriers themselves

4046
03:08:57,471 --> 03:08:58,751
Sinking the enemy ships

4047
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:05,663
It's hard not to see that is completely obvious with our modern mentality but not only is this a revolution

4048
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:07,455
Missionary and controversial idea

4049
03:09:07,967 --> 03:09:14,111
Without the data to really back it up think of what a gamble it is and Yamamoto says something at one point like at this plan fail

4050
03:09:14,367 --> 03:09:15,391
We just need to give up

4051
03:09:16,415 --> 03:09:22,559
Well that shows you how much of a gamble it is and watching this whole thing take place is like watching a guy play a car

4052
03:09:22,815 --> 03:09:23,327
Card game

4053
03:09:23,583 --> 03:09:26,143
Where the odds of winning are low

4054
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:28,703
Annie's been his family's lives on the outcome

4055
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:32,543
In a lot of situations where you see big

4056
03:09:32,799 --> 03:09:33,823
Audacious Gamble

4057
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:36,127
The store Yamamoto is working with here

4058
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:41,247
It's because people are in relatively hopeless situations and it's better to take a chance

4059
03:09:41,759 --> 03:09:44,575
Because what's going to happen if you don't is worse in the case of

4060
03:09:44,831 --> 03:09:47,391
Like cities that are under siege armies that are surrounded

4061
03:09:47,903 --> 03:09:52,767
Are you just going to die anyway so why not try a gamble here what have you got to lose

4062
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:54,559
In the case of Yamamoto

4063
03:09:55,071 --> 03:09:58,911
The Japanese government in the Japanese nation state they have a lot to lose

4064
03:10:00,191 --> 03:10:01,471
Their people are

4065
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:05,055
For the most part speaking right now on a relative

4066
03:10:05,311 --> 03:10:05,823
Curved

4067
03:10:06,079 --> 03:10:09,407
That your crystal ball would make clear if you could see five years in the future

4068
03:10:09,919 --> 03:10:10,431
Are safe

4069
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:13,759
Relatively prosperous

4070
03:10:14,271 --> 03:10:20,415
You want to talk about worst-case scenarios here it's not what the American sanctions could do to you it's that with the anglo-american

4071
03:10:21,183 --> 03:10:22,463
Demands that you

4072
03:10:22,719 --> 03:10:28,095
Attract your Empire could do to you it's what losing in this metaphorical card game that Yamamoto is playing

4073
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:31,935
Cuz he's betting with the live

4074
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:32,703
Is peep

4075
03:10:32,959 --> 03:10:33,471
People

4076
03:10:33,727 --> 03:10:34,495
Let's be honest

4077
03:10:35,007 --> 03:10:36,031
Betting is cities

4078
03:10:37,055 --> 03:10:37,567
Is the way it's going

4079
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:38,335
Workout

4080
03:10:39,359 --> 03:10:40,127
So what does he have to

4081
03:10:40,383 --> 03:10:40,895
To do to win

4082
03:10:42,687 --> 03:10:43,199
Well

4083
03:10:43,711 --> 03:10:49,855
This offensive attack against the US Fleet in Yamamoto spaces designed to do the same thing that the old trap was designed

4084
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:51,391
As we said

4085
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:53,439
Get the fleet out of the way

4086
03:10:54,207 --> 03:10:55,999
What's the fleet got to be out of the way for

4087
03:10:56,511 --> 03:10:58,815
So the Japan could take over

4088
03:10:59,327 --> 03:11:02,655
A huge chunk of Asia and the Pacific

4089
03:11:03,167 --> 03:11:04,959
And then hunker down

4090
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:09,567
And beat off any efforts by the anglo-americans to win it back

4091
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:11,871
And within this core

4092
03:11:12,127 --> 03:11:14,687
Surrounded by a defense perimeter that is

4093
03:11:14,943 --> 03:11:18,015
Yuan the largest Battlefield in human history

4094
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:20,831
Would be the resources that Japan needs

4095
03:11:21,343 --> 03:11:22,623
For self-sufficiency

4096
03:11:24,671 --> 03:11:27,487
So you grab the resources you need to continue

4097
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:29,279
Being a first-class power

4098
03:11:29,535 --> 03:11:31,327
To continue to support the war effort

4099
03:11:31,583 --> 03:11:36,703
You create a huge perimeter a long distance around that is defended

4100
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:42,079
And then you make the cost of taking it back higher than you think the other side is

4101
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:43,103
Willing to pay

4102
03:11:44,127 --> 03:11:45,919
This is where the Rose Colored Glasses

4103
03:11:46,431 --> 03:11:46,943
Start coming in

4104
03:11:47,199 --> 03:11:48,735
Things and according to writer

4105
03:11:48,991 --> 03:11:50,527
Cebu Road yonaga

4106
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:56,927
He points out that in all the estimations that the military government have to come up with your all the numbers that you're plugging in

4107
03:11:57,183 --> 03:11:59,231
For the unknowable the x's in the wise

4108
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:03,071
Are all sort of Rose Colored Glasses best case scenario

4109
03:12:03,327 --> 03:12:09,471
How do you beat the anglo-americans will you take over all this territory and then the Yamato Spirit of the Japanese

4110
03:12:09,727 --> 03:12:10,239
Warrior

4111
03:12:10,751 --> 03:12:16,127
Will Outlast the soft westerners and they won't be willing to pay the price that you have to take to do this

4112
03:12:16,383 --> 03:12:20,223
So they will negotiate and we will have some sort of an Armistice in Japan will come out ahead

4113
03:12:20,735 --> 03:12:23,039
Especially if you demoralize The Americans

4114
03:12:23,295 --> 03:12:25,599
Estimating their Fleet at the outset

4115
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:27,391
And get a

4116
03:12:27,647 --> 03:12:31,487
Advantage on the now the Pearl Harbor attacks they're going to come out of this

4117
03:12:31,743 --> 03:12:35,583
Americans have a tendency to tunnel vision and I do this myself

4118
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:37,119
And forget

4119
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:39,935
That is simply a means to an end

4120
03:12:40,447 --> 03:12:46,079
The elimination of the American Fleet which is the goal of the Pearl Harbor attack is merely meant to cover

4121
03:12:46,591 --> 03:12:50,431
The Rising Sun of Japan going supernova

4122
03:12:50,943 --> 03:12:56,319
And acquiring this defense perimeter and the raw materials resources and oil within it

4123
03:12:58,367 --> 03:12:59,135
The sculpt

4124
03:12:59,391 --> 03:13:01,695
Of the plan for this is

4125
03:13:02,207 --> 03:13:02,975
Breathtaking

4126
03:13:03,231 --> 03:13:03,999
And it's hot

4127
03:13:04,767 --> 03:13:08,863
But I keep running out of words to use audacity is the one I keep coming back to

4128
03:13:09,631 --> 03:13:14,495
Remember this is a country that is tied down heavily already on the Asian mainland

4129
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:17,823
But here's what historian Ronald H Spector

4130
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:18,591
Describes

4131
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:20,895
As the plans here

4132
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:24,991
Is it going to all kind of take place starting at the same time

4133
03:13:25,759 --> 03:13:26,783
He writes quote

4134
03:13:28,063 --> 03:13:31,647
The Japanese plan to seize and occupy a vast area

4135
03:13:31,903 --> 03:13:35,231
Including all of Southeast Asia they did not already hold

4136
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:36,255
Burma

4137
03:13:36,511 --> 03:13:37,279
Siam

4138
03:13:37,535 --> 03:13:41,119
Malaya the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies

4139
03:13:41,375 --> 03:13:45,471
Japan would occupy the American Island outposts of Guam and wake

4140
03:13:45,727 --> 03:13:49,823
She would also destroy here at least neutralize the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor

4141
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:56,479
On the first day of the war the Philippines Himalaya where to be hit by air attacks followed soon after buying

4142
03:13:56,735 --> 03:13:57,247
Invasion

4143
03:13:57,503 --> 03:13:59,295
Simultaneously he writes

4144
03:13:59,807 --> 03:14:02,623
Troops would occupy British Borneo in Hong Kong

4145
03:14:03,135 --> 03:14:04,415
What's the Philippines

4146
03:14:04,671 --> 03:14:10,815
And the Malay Peninsula with it's important Fortress of Singapore have been taken the conquest of Burma

4147
03:14:11,071 --> 03:14:12,863
And the Dutch East Indies would follow

4148
03:14:13,375 --> 03:14:13,887
And quote

4149
03:14:15,935 --> 03:14:17,471
Now you can't hide

4150
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:19,007
Preparations

4151
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:21,055
4 operations on that

4152
03:14:21,311 --> 03:14:21,823
Scale

4153
03:14:22,335 --> 03:14:23,871
And the British and the Americans

4154
03:14:24,127 --> 03:14:27,455
Figure out the something big is happening they C troop ships moving they

4155
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:33,855
Hear things in the codes that they broke and they're seeing the redeployment of forces it's a big thing and it takes months in month

4156
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:36,671
Ironically though

4157
03:14:36,927 --> 03:14:42,559
It's sort of attracts their attention in a way that diverts their attention from what's going on

4158
03:14:43,071 --> 03:14:49,215
In the very northernmost islands of Japan with short stretch up towards Siberia and really Frozen

4159
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:50,239
Foggy

4160
03:14:50,495 --> 03:14:52,287
In a rainy condition

4161
03:14:52,543 --> 03:14:53,055
Is it just sort of

4162
03:14:53,311 --> 03:14:53,823
Hi

4163
03:14:54,591 --> 03:14:55,871
Big warships

4164
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:58,943
By the latter part of November the job

4165
03:14:59,199 --> 03:15:00,991
Annies of quietly in mask

4166
03:15:02,271 --> 03:15:04,063
The most powerful aircraft

4167
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:07,135
Carrier Strike Force in world history up until that

4168
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:09,183
Current time in these Northern harbors

4169
03:15:09,951 --> 03:15:11,231
6 aircraft carrier

4170
03:15:11,487 --> 03:15:11,999
Prayers together

4171
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:14,047
Couple of battle

4172
03:15:14,815 --> 03:15:15,327
Bunch of oil

4173
03:15:16,351 --> 03:15:17,631
Supplies destroyers in

4174
03:15:17,887 --> 03:15:18,399
Support ship

4175
03:15:18,911 --> 03:15:21,983
Shrouded in the fog and Mist up there in the North

4176
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:26,079
Not coincidentally right around the same time that that

4177
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:26,847
Time limit

4178
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:27,615
Aspiring

4179
03:15:28,383 --> 03:15:32,223
On the diplomacy has to work soon or else timetable

4180
03:15:33,503 --> 03:15:34,527
On December 1st

4181
03:15:35,295 --> 03:15:36,063
Its or else

4182
03:15:36,319 --> 03:15:36,831
Time

4183
03:15:37,343 --> 03:15:43,487
And enough famous meeting the Japanese emperor in what some historians refer to as a meaningless ceremony to confirm something

4184
03:15:43,743 --> 03:15:44,255
Already done

4185
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:46,047
Others confuse the

4186
03:15:46,303 --> 03:15:46,815
Event with

4187
03:15:47,071 --> 03:15:49,631
With some decision-making power nonetheless it's the official

4188
03:15:49,887 --> 03:15:56,031
If the Japanese were going to have an official public declaration of war this would have been if but it's not public and nobody knows about it if you're not in

4189
03:15:56,287 --> 03:15:59,359
Get on it but this is where the decisions made signed off on

4190
03:15:59,615 --> 03:16:01,663
And by the time that happens

4191
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:04,991
That Fleet that have been sort of hiding in the Mist

4192
03:16:05,503 --> 03:16:06,527
In the northern harbors

4193
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:07,807
With the six carriers

4194
03:16:08,063 --> 03:16:09,343
Has already Departed

4195
03:16:09,855 --> 03:16:10,623
Out to sea

4196
03:16:11,391 --> 03:16:14,719
And is disappearing in the fog Banks of a northern route

4197
03:16:15,231 --> 03:16:17,535
Which avoids normal shipping lanes

4198
03:16:18,047 --> 03:16:19,583
And at this point

4199
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:21,375
Interestingly enough

4200
03:16:21,631 --> 03:16:27,007
American intelligence which monitors were all the Japanese big ships are found this fast

4201
03:16:27,263 --> 03:16:28,287
Before the second World War

4202
03:16:28,543 --> 03:16:30,591
They already generally know the location

4203
03:16:31,103 --> 03:16:32,127
The carriers in the battleships

4204
03:16:32,383 --> 03:16:33,919
Oh that's true radio traffic

4205
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:35,455
They lose

4206
03:16:36,223 --> 03:16:38,015
Side of them which leads to a famous

4207
03:16:38,527 --> 03:16:40,063
Pearl Harbor related quote

4208
03:16:40,319 --> 03:16:41,087
With one of the Admiral

4209
03:16:42,367 --> 03:16:47,487
On the island. You mean the Japanese League Of You rounding Diamond Head right now and we wouldn't even know it

4210
03:16:49,023 --> 03:16:51,839
The Americans knew war was coming so did the British in fact

4211
03:16:52,095 --> 03:16:53,119
There's no

4212
03:16:53,631 --> 03:16:57,215
Anticipation in terms of will it or won't it happen in the

4213
03:16:57,471 --> 03:16:59,263
Couple of weeks before it does

4214
03:17:00,031 --> 03:17:02,335
The question is what's going to happen when it breaks out

4215
03:17:03,103 --> 03:17:08,735
The Americans are pretty darn sure you're going to see moves to take over those resources we talked

4216
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:13,855
The Japanese are going to strike in Southeast Asia maybe the Dutch East Indies probably the Philippines

4217
03:17:14,623 --> 03:17:16,159
What they don't see coming

4218
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:20,511
Isn't attack across 4000 miles of ocean at them

4219
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:23,071
It is very good book on

4220
03:17:23,327 --> 03:17:24,095
Pearl Harbor

4221
03:17:24,351 --> 03:17:25,119
Call Pearl Harbor

4222
03:17:26,399 --> 03:17:28,191
Is author Craig Nelson quotes some of the

4223
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:29,471
Wonderful

4224
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:31,007
Pieces of dialogue

4225
03:17:31,519 --> 03:17:32,543
Were extracted after

4226
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:33,311
The fact that

4227
03:17:33,567 --> 03:17:34,591
Look either prophetic

4228
03:17:35,103 --> 03:17:35,615
Or

4229
03:17:36,127 --> 03:17:37,407
Yashow some sort of

4230
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:38,943
Vulnerability to

4231
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:39,967
That was exploited

4232
03:17:40,735 --> 03:17:42,527
By the surprise attack and in one of these

4233
03:17:42,783 --> 03:17:43,295
This conversation

4234
03:17:43,551 --> 03:17:44,063
He has

4235
03:17:44,575 --> 03:17:46,111
The various Admirals in military

4236
03:17:46,367 --> 03:17:49,183
Leaders in Hawaii right is late November

4237
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:53,535
Talking about sending planes to some of these islands that they're worried about the Japanese hitting

4238
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:59,423
And the Air Force Commander on Hawaii basically says don't send airplanes away we have to defend Hawaii

4239
03:17:59,679 --> 03:18:02,495
Which kind of stuns Admiral Kimmel who basically says

4240
03:18:02,751 --> 03:18:04,287
Are you worried about Hawaii

4241
03:18:05,311 --> 03:18:06,335
Nelson rights quote

4242
03:18:07,871 --> 03:18:14,015
The Hawaiian Air Forces Chief of Staff James Mollison return to shorts original point and he saying now

4243
03:18:14,271 --> 03:18:16,063
Our mission is to protect Oahu

4244
03:18:16,319 --> 03:18:19,903
And shipping out those Army planes will lessen our capability to do so

4245
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:22,975
Kimmel wanted details on his thinking

4246
03:18:23,231 --> 03:18:24,767
Why are you so worried about

4247
03:18:25,535 --> 03:18:27,583
Do you think we are in danger of attack

4248
03:18:27,839 --> 03:18:29,375
When Mollison replied

4249
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:33,215
The Japanese have such a capability the Admiral argued

4250
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:34,751
Capability yes but

4251
03:18:35,007 --> 03:18:36,031
Possibility

4252
03:18:36,543 --> 03:18:37,823
The author continues quote

4253
03:18:38,335 --> 03:18:42,943
Kimmel Ben asked his naval war plans officer rear Admiral Charles McMorris

4254
03:18:43,455 --> 03:18:46,271
What do you think about the prospects of a Japanese Air Attack

4255
03:18:46,783 --> 03:18:49,599
McMorris said none absolutely not

4256
03:18:50,111 --> 03:18:50,879
And quote

4257
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:54,463
So it doesn't matter how often

4258
03:18:54,719 --> 03:19:00,351
The American ministration gets a warning that Osama Bin Laden is bent on attacking the United States and is

4259
03:19:00,607 --> 03:19:03,935
In a rumor to be thinking about using airplanes to run into buildings

4260
03:19:04,703 --> 03:19:10,847
It doesn't seem real amongst all the other information that's out there until it happens and then after happens you can go

4261
03:19:11,103 --> 03:19:12,383
Go back and pick out those points

4262
03:19:12,639 --> 03:19:14,175
And they stand out like a sore thumb

4263
03:19:15,967 --> 03:19:16,479
Just like that

4264
03:19:16,991 --> 03:19:18,527
In a do you mean to say they could be

4265
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:20,831
Rounding Diamond Head right now

4266
03:19:21,343 --> 03:19:21,855
Well

4267
03:19:22,111 --> 03:19:27,487
Here's what we know they don't have to round diamond head because that strike force that is indeed approaching

4268
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:29,279
11 area north

4269
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:30,815
Of Hawaii

4270
03:19:31,327 --> 03:19:36,959
As aircraft carrier that can launch planes without ever getting that close to the Hawaiian Islands

4271
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:39,775
And on the morning of December 7th

4272
03:19:40,543 --> 03:19:41,311
Early

4273
03:19:42,079 --> 03:19:43,359
They begin to do that

4274
03:19:44,895 --> 03:19:48,223
By this time in the plans unfolding

4275
03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:51,039
The attack on Pearl Harbor you would have to say that they had

4276
03:19:51,295 --> 03:19:52,575
I've been very fortunate

4277
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:56,927
Some of the wargaming that they had done prepping for this event

4278
03:19:57,439 --> 03:20:03,071
And had the United States discovered them on the way in the Japanese Fleet having to fight its way within range of

4279
03:20:03,839 --> 03:20:04,607
Hawaii to make it

4280
03:20:04,863 --> 03:20:05,375
Sackbut

4281
03:20:05,887 --> 03:20:08,959
They managed to get 220 miles north of a wahoo

4282
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:10,495
Without being detected

4283
03:20:12,287 --> 03:20:16,127
The plane start launching in a really rough Sea by the way

4284
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:22,527
At 5:50 a.m. buy like 6:15 6:20 they got the first wave up in the sky and that's a lot

4285
03:20:22,783 --> 03:20:25,599
Aircraft by the way and the efficiency is going to be

4286
03:20:26,111 --> 03:20:27,391
Notably Japanese

4287
03:20:29,183 --> 03:20:34,559
This first wave by the way consists of 43 fighter planes 49 high-level bombers

4288
03:20:34,815 --> 03:20:36,863
51 dive bombers and 40

4289
03:20:37,119 --> 03:20:37,631
Torpedo plane

4290
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:43,263
At 6:20 it heads towards Oahu

4291
03:20:43,519 --> 03:20:44,799
The Japanese begin

4292
03:20:45,311 --> 03:20:47,103
Bringing up the next way

4293
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:48,383
2Go follow up

4294
03:20:49,663 --> 03:20:50,175
And this

4295
03:20:50,687 --> 03:20:51,455
Gamble

4296
03:20:51,711 --> 03:20:52,223
This

4297
03:20:52,735 --> 03:20:57,087
Huge audacious plan by Admiral Yamamoto and Company is underway

4298
03:20:57,599 --> 03:20:58,367
Ironically

4299
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:01,695
The commander of this operation a guy named nagumo

4300
03:21:01,951 --> 03:21:05,535
Not at all day shift guy much more so if conservative Commander

4301
03:21:05,791 --> 03:21:06,303
Who doesn't

4302
03:21:06,559 --> 03:21:09,631
Seems like he's got a whole lot of faith in this point it's interesting that you'd have the

4303
03:21:09,887 --> 03:21:10,399
The

4304
03:21:10,911 --> 03:21:16,287
Creative thinker who's really the Visionary come up with the idea and then put the implementation of it into the hands of somebody much

4305
03:21:16,543 --> 03:21:18,079
Less likely to

4306
03:21:18,335 --> 03:21:20,639
Will follow up in an aggressive way because

4307
03:21:21,151 --> 03:21:22,175
Is nature butt

4308
03:21:22,431 --> 03:21:23,967
None of those planes got off with

4309
03:21:24,223 --> 03:21:27,039
Great efficiency in when they're on their way to Hawaii

4310
03:21:27,551 --> 03:21:29,087
Hawaii is sleeping

4311
03:21:30,111 --> 03:21:33,439
There's a reason why the most famous books ever written about the Pearl Harbor attack

4312
03:21:33,695 --> 03:21:34,207
Actress called

4313
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:35,999
At dawn we slept

4314
03:21:37,023 --> 03:21:39,327
Because not only is Hawaii

4315
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:43,935
Sleeping it's Sunday morning everybody sort of rousing a little bit late

4316
03:21:44,447 --> 03:21:48,031
But it's a peaceful Island and I don't just mean in and

4317
03:21:48,287 --> 03:21:51,615
Environmental sense I mean in a diplomatic one

4318
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:54,175
Are these aircraft are approaching

4319
03:21:54,687 --> 03:21:56,479
It was going to be there attack Target

4320
03:21:56,991 --> 03:21:58,527
The country they're going to attack

4321
03:21:58,783 --> 03:22:00,063
Isn't it war with them

4322
03:22:00,575 --> 03:22:02,623
Need a lot of controversy that has arisen

4323
03:22:02,879 --> 03:22:05,439
Ever since about whether we was supposed to be

4324
03:22:07,231 --> 03:22:13,375
There seems little to no doubt that the attacks against British possessions in Asia where to be carried

4325
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:15,423
Don without wanting those were to be surprised

4326
03:22:15,679 --> 03:22:19,263
Whether or not that was supposed to be the same situation against the US

4327
03:22:19,519 --> 03:22:21,055
There are different points of view

4328
03:22:21,311 --> 03:22:22,335
And I'm not qualified to pay

4329
03:22:22,591 --> 03:22:23,103
Pokemon

4330
03:22:23,871 --> 03:22:24,639
For a long time

4331
03:22:25,151 --> 03:22:27,455
The official Japanese point of view from their historians

4332
03:22:28,223 --> 03:22:29,247
Basically said it was a screw

4333
03:22:30,015 --> 03:22:32,063
On the part of their diplomatic people

4334
03:22:32,319 --> 03:22:35,647
In Washington DC you didn't get the material

4335
03:22:35,903 --> 03:22:36,671
To the right place the right

4336
03:22:37,695 --> 03:22:42,303
And because of that what should have been there early enough to be sort of Advance warning didn't happen that way

4337
03:22:42,559 --> 03:22:48,703
There's a Japanese writer couple years ago that is part of a minority school that suggests that that's all the covered it was always a

4338
03:22:48,959 --> 03:22:49,727
Intended to be

4339
03:22:49,983 --> 03:22:51,775
You know I'm officially late by

4340
03:22:52,031 --> 03:22:52,799
Right ;-)

4341
03:22:54,591 --> 03:22:56,383
I kind of like author Craig Nelson

4342
03:22:56,639 --> 03:22:57,919
Ian is Pearl Harbor book

4343
03:22:58,943 --> 03:23:00,479
His point of view on it though because

4344
03:23:00,735 --> 03:23:02,527
It really does sound like

4345
03:23:03,295 --> 03:23:06,879
What probably happened which was there there was going to be

4346
03:23:07,135 --> 03:23:08,927
A very short window

4347
03:23:09,183 --> 03:23:13,535
Write a here here's a declaration of war 5 minutes later boom bombs dropped actually 30 minutes

4348
03:23:13,791 --> 03:23:15,839
Later seems to be about what they were after he writes quote

4349
03:23:16,863 --> 03:23:19,167
Going by the way plan Z means the plan to attack

4350
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:20,191
Pearl Harbor quote

4351
03:23:20,703 --> 03:23:21,727
From the beginning

4352
03:23:21,983 --> 03:23:27,615
Imperial Japanese army officers plan to invade Singapore without giving prior notice to Britain

4353
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:33,247
But the Imperial Japanese Navy felt very differently about the United States and operations e

4354
03:23:33,759 --> 03:23:36,575
After the Imperial conference on December 1st in fact

4355
03:23:36,831 --> 03:23:39,903
The emperor told prime minister Hideki Tojo repeatedly

4356
03:23:40,159 --> 03:23:42,719
But he was not to attack the United States without warning

4357
03:23:42,975 --> 03:23:49,119
Naval attache Duro sahi Matsu explained the sense of Honor that was a Hallmark of

4358
03:23:49,375 --> 03:23:50,655
Japanese military history

4359
03:23:50,911 --> 03:23:51,423
This is

4360
03:23:51,935 --> 03:23:53,471
This officer explaining now

4361
03:23:53,727 --> 03:23:54,239
Quote

4362
03:23:54,495 --> 03:23:57,823
Japanese warriors never tried to assassinate a person who is sleeping

4363
03:23:58,079 --> 03:24:02,431
When they tried to kill him they first kicked the pillow and woke him up and then killed him

4364
03:24:02,943 --> 03:24:04,735
The same principle applied to the attack

4365
03:24:04,991 --> 03:24:08,831
The required time to wake America up would be approximately 30 minutes

4366
03:24:09,855 --> 03:24:10,367
And quote

4367
03:24:12,671 --> 03:24:15,231
Now what Nelson says that really makes sense is

4368
03:24:15,487 --> 03:24:21,631
The Pepto really fine line to walk 30 minutes it doesn't allow for any kind of script at all and there's a bunch of

4369
03:24:21,887 --> 03:24:23,423
Things that have to happen and go well

4370
03:24:23,679 --> 03:24:24,447
And it didn't

4371
03:24:27,263 --> 03:24:29,055
Regardless of which point of view

4372
03:24:29,311 --> 03:24:30,335
You were here too

4373
03:24:30,591 --> 03:24:36,735
It's clear that the people in Hawaii didn't know this was coming and the American people didn't know this was coming in because

4374
03:24:36,991 --> 03:24:37,503
Is it bad

4375
03:24:37,759 --> 03:24:38,527
Their Wrath

4376
03:24:38,783 --> 03:24:40,319
For this entire War

4377
03:24:40,831 --> 03:24:41,599
Will be

4378
03:24:42,111 --> 03:24:42,623
Visceral

4379
03:24:42,879 --> 03:24:49,023
It is interesting in one history not read did this he said he didn't want to be interesting to imagine how different the mood might have

4380
03:24:49,279 --> 03:24:49,791
Have been

4381
03:24:50,047 --> 03:24:53,887
Had the Japanese said one day ahead of time we're at War and then struck

4382
03:24:54,143 --> 03:24:55,679
Interesting to speculate isn't it

4383
03:24:57,727 --> 03:24:58,751
The same time though

4384
03:24:59,263 --> 03:25:03,615
If it's a minor miracle that the Japanese can get a strike force this close to Hawaii

4385
03:25:03,871 --> 03:25:04,895
In peacetime

4386
03:25:05,919 --> 03:25:08,223
How much of a major Miracle would they have needed

4387
03:25:08,479 --> 03:25:10,271
To pull off the same thing in Wartime

4388
03:25:11,551 --> 03:25:12,319
You can make a case that

4389
03:25:12,575 --> 03:25:13,087
Yamamoto

4390
03:25:13,343 --> 03:25:13,855
Plan

4391
03:25:14,623 --> 03:25:15,135
Really

4392
03:25:15,391 --> 03:25:16,927
Requires in order to be successful.

4393
03:25:17,183 --> 03:25:17,695
Kind of

4394
03:25:18,207 --> 03:25:23,583
Surprised that you only get in a diplomatic situation where War hasn't broken out yet

4395
03:25:24,863 --> 03:25:26,143
You might need that

4396
03:25:26,655 --> 03:25:28,447
For this plan to work and remember

4397
03:25:28,959 --> 03:25:31,775
The stakes involved here are enormous

4398
03:25:32,543 --> 03:25:34,335
So I always try to imagine

4399
03:25:34,591 --> 03:25:40,479
I mean what they must have felt like both in Tokyo the leadership the emperor all those people who know that this is

4400
03:25:40,735 --> 03:25:44,319
About to happen you're looking at their watch wondering what's happening at this very moment

4401
03:25:44,575 --> 03:25:45,599
To the leadership

4402
03:25:46,111 --> 03:25:49,951
With the Strikeforce nagumo and his staff I think they're on the ikagi the aircraft

4403
03:25:50,207 --> 03:25:50,719
Carrier

4404
03:25:50,975 --> 03:25:57,119
To the leadership of the first wave Strike Force itself it's led by a guy named forsheda by the way

4405
03:25:57,375 --> 03:26:01,215
And he's been involved in the planning for this for a long time he's fully aware the stakes

4406
03:26:01,727 --> 03:26:04,287
He understands that what Yamamoto said

4407
03:26:04,543 --> 03:26:08,895
Is true which is if this attack doesn't do what we needed to do we might have to give up the war

4408
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:12,991
And he understands what breaks they have to get to have a chance of the attack working

4409
03:26:14,783 --> 03:26:18,367
The first break he needs a surprise we have to achieve the surprise that we're out

4410
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:25,279
There are a couple of famous things that happened on the morning of December 7th

4411
03:26:25,535 --> 03:26:29,375
That could have blown the surprise out of the water and ruin the whole thing they famously

4412
03:26:29,631 --> 03:26:32,191
We didn't there much investigated as you might imagine

4413
03:26:32,703 --> 03:26:35,007
After the events in after the war because they

4414
03:26:35,263 --> 03:26:37,823
Schinus failure isn't probably rightly so

4415
03:26:38,079 --> 03:26:39,103
The first one was

4416
03:26:39,359 --> 03:26:40,895
In the early morning hours like

4417
03:26:41,151 --> 03:26:42,175
Play 3 4 a.m.

4418
03:26:42,687 --> 03:26:44,735
Before the attack planes even take off

4419
03:26:44,991 --> 03:26:46,015
Midget submarine

4420
03:26:46,527 --> 03:26:51,647
Are discovered in Pearl Harbor these almost slipped call them suicide missions cuz that's what they turned out to be

4421
03:26:51,903 --> 03:26:54,463
Several Japanese midget submarines were part of this operation

4422
03:26:54,719 --> 03:26:55,743
A couple were discovered

4423
03:26:56,255 --> 03:26:59,327
An alert was sent and destroyers are soda

4424
03:26:59,839 --> 03:27:00,863
Agitated now

4425
03:27:01,119 --> 03:27:05,471
In the early morning hours there's activity stirred up in Pearl Harbor that

4426
03:27:05,727 --> 03:27:10,079
Wouldn't have been stirred up if those midget submarines hadn't been part of the plan Yamamoto was never

4427
03:27:10,335 --> 03:27:11,103
Them by the way

4428
03:27:12,383 --> 03:27:14,687
And then closer to the actual time of the attack

4429
03:27:15,199 --> 03:27:17,759
As the more than a hundred planes are

4430
03:27:18,015 --> 03:27:21,599
Making their way towards a wahoo they're picked up on Hawaiian radar

4431
03:27:22,111 --> 03:27:22,623
Which is a

4432
03:27:23,135 --> 03:27:24,671
The new thing in this.

4433
03:27:25,951 --> 03:27:31,583
Had War already been declared it's hard to imagine that this would not have prompted a major response

4434
03:27:32,095 --> 03:27:34,911
The fact that war isn't existing yet kind of help

4435
03:27:35,679 --> 03:27:36,191
Wings To Go

4436
03:27:36,447 --> 03:27:37,727
The Japanese way

4437
03:27:37,983 --> 03:27:44,127
Also the fact that Hawaii is like a giant aircraft carrier all by itself with planes incoming and outgoing all the time

4438
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:48,479
Makes it easier for the radar operation people to rationalize

4439
03:27:49,503 --> 03:27:52,319
Many many planes they all of a sudden see on their radar

4440
03:27:52,575 --> 03:27:56,927
As something else for example to have some b-17s a big heavy bombers do in

4441
03:27:57,183 --> 03:27:58,719
Easy to confuse them with that maybe

4442
03:27:59,487 --> 03:28:02,303
In hindsight it should have been seen for what it was but it was

4443
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:04,607
Something that makes the Japanese chances

4444
03:28:05,119 --> 03:28:07,679
At Pearl Harbor at least now possible

4445
03:28:08,959 --> 03:28:10,239
At about 7:40

4446
03:28:10,495 --> 03:28:11,519
A.m.

4447
03:28:11,775 --> 03:28:16,639
The first wave of the Japanese attack planes break through the clouds over a wahoo

4448
03:28:16,895 --> 03:28:18,431
Lacey Pearl Harbor

4449
03:28:18,687 --> 03:28:24,831
And they don't see any anti-aircraft fire or anything like that they don't see much activity it's obvious that they have not

4450
03:28:25,087 --> 03:28:27,903
Not been discovered in the surprise has been achieved

4451
03:28:28,927 --> 03:28:33,023
What they don't see this is the first piece of bad luck in the first bad breakup

4452
03:28:33,279 --> 03:28:36,863
Did the Japanese aircraft carriers and Scout playing

4453
03:28:37,375 --> 03:28:40,703
Zoomed by here 10 15 20 minutes previously didn't see them either

4454
03:28:41,471 --> 03:28:41,983
And

4455
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:46,079
No other Navy on the planet would have understood the potential value

4456
03:28:46,591 --> 03:28:49,407
Of an aircraft carrier more than this one obviously

4457
03:28:49,663 --> 03:28:51,455
They probably would have traded

4458
03:28:51,711 --> 03:28:55,551
A battleship or an aircraft carrier in terms of what they would have rather sunk

4459
03:28:56,063 --> 03:29:00,671
But while they may not have any aircraft carriers they have a bunch of battleships just sitting there

4460
03:29:01,695 --> 03:29:02,975
Appreciate it types out

4461
03:29:03,487 --> 03:29:04,767
I signal device

4462
03:29:05,023 --> 03:29:06,815
The famous abolition controversial

4463
03:29:07,071 --> 03:29:07,839
About to snap about weather

4464
03:29:08,095 --> 03:29:08,607
He was meant to weigh

4465
03:29:09,119 --> 03:29:09,887
It sounded in his

4466
03:29:10,399 --> 03:29:15,007
Portrayed famously in Italy Tora Tora Tora which means tiger tiger tiger

4467
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:18,335
And this is supposed to be the message not just to the fleet but it's

4468
03:29:18,591 --> 03:29:20,383
Picked up all the way miraculously

4469
03:29:20,895 --> 03:29:25,759
How the signal in Tokyo to telling everyone who's in the know that this is happening

4470
03:29:26,271 --> 03:29:27,807
The surprise has been achieved

4471
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:31,135
Way

4472
03:29:32,415 --> 03:29:35,231
It's described in at dawn we slept when you think about the

4473
03:29:35,743 --> 03:29:36,767
The unbelievable amount

4474
03:29:37,023 --> 03:29:37,535
Attention

4475
03:29:37,791 --> 03:29:41,631
Someone like oh I don't know Admiral nagumo with the strike force would have felt

4476
03:29:42,655 --> 03:29:48,799
A conservative guy doesn't have much faith in this plant anyway but realizes as everyone does just like Yamamoto hats

4477
03:29:49,055 --> 03:29:51,615
Sad and I'm paraphrasing but if this plane doesn't work

4478
03:29:52,127 --> 03:29:53,151
We'll have to end the war

4479
03:29:54,943 --> 03:29:55,711
This is

4480
03:29:55,967 --> 03:29:59,807
The gamble for everything in this is the call moment in the poker game

4481
03:30:00,319 --> 03:30:01,087
Here's the way

4482
03:30:01,599 --> 03:30:03,391
Author Gordon W praying

4483
03:30:03,647 --> 03:30:06,207
Describes it in at dawn we slept quote

4484
03:30:07,231 --> 03:30:11,839
Bushido's radio was still clicking when the first wave broke into its component parts

4485
03:30:12,351 --> 03:30:14,399
Kushida swung around Barbers Point

4486
03:30:14,655 --> 03:30:20,799
And sure beyond all possible doubt that they had indeed achieve maximum strategic surprise at 7:53

4487
03:30:21,055 --> 03:30:22,079
3 a.m. he sang out

4488
03:30:22,335 --> 03:30:23,871
Tora Tora Tora

4489
03:30:24,127 --> 03:30:25,663
Tiger tiger tiger

4490
03:30:25,919 --> 03:30:31,039
The code Words which told the entire Japanese Navy that they had caught the Pacific Fleet unaware

4491
03:30:31,807 --> 03:30:32,575
Aboard

4492
03:30:32,831 --> 03:30:33,599
The aircraft carrier

4493
03:30:34,111 --> 03:30:34,879
Ikagi

4494
03:30:35,391 --> 03:30:40,767
Kusaka was not in the least ashamed of the tears which coursed down his windburn cheeks

4495
03:30:41,023 --> 03:30:43,071
Impassive Zen Buddhist though he was

4496
03:30:43,839 --> 03:30:48,191
Admiral nagumo could not have other the word had life and honor depended on it

4497
03:30:48,447 --> 03:30:49,215
Incredibly

4498
03:30:49,471 --> 03:30:50,495
Miraculously

4499
03:30:51,007 --> 03:30:53,823
They had brought off yamamoto's madcap venture

4500
03:30:54,335 --> 03:30:55,615
What's island in the stink

4501
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:57,919
Each man stretched out his hand to the other

4502
03:30:58,431 --> 03:31:00,735
And in their eyes were all the words they could not

4503
03:31:02,271 --> 03:31:02,783
Ndk

4504
03:31:04,575 --> 03:31:07,391
All these planes begin to split up

4505
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:12,511
Into their component parts this is all well rehearse stuff everybody knows what they're supposed to do

4506
03:31:13,535 --> 03:31:17,119
And many of these planes don't go anywhere near Pearl Harbor

4507
03:31:17,375 --> 03:31:20,703
They go to airfields all over the island and they knock out

4508
03:31:20,959 --> 03:31:26,335
Not just the airfields but any planes that they find and unfortunately Americans were more concerned

4509
03:31:26,591 --> 03:31:29,919
With sabotage during this periods in something like this

4510
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:34,783
They parked all the planes like wingtip to wingtip which just makes it easier to guard

4511
03:31:35,039 --> 03:31:36,063
What makes them

4512
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:38,623
An easy to shoot up from the airport Uso

4513
03:31:39,135 --> 03:31:45,279
Nagumo and the strike force of carriers the main worry that they have two hundred and some miles north of Hawaii

4514
03:31:45,791 --> 03:31:47,583
Is it they're going to get hit with a counter-attack

4515
03:31:48,095 --> 03:31:50,655
The only things Hawaii can counter-attack them with our ships

4516
03:31:51,167 --> 03:31:51,679
And playing

4517
03:31:51,935 --> 03:31:55,263
So the Japanese attack takes both of those into account

4518
03:31:57,311 --> 03:31:58,847
And there will be planes

4519
03:31:59,103 --> 03:32:00,895
Singing all over the aisle

4520
03:32:01,407 --> 03:32:06,015
And in fact in an event Witness by tens of thousands of people in one way or another

4521
03:32:06,527 --> 03:32:09,599
There are so many stories about what happens on this day

4522
03:32:09,855 --> 03:32:15,999
Some of which are obviously misremembered and exaggerated but none of them are first hand accounts of people who witnessed

4523
03:32:16,511 --> 03:32:20,095
Something they never forgot because it was the most momentous thing of their lives

4524
03:32:20,351 --> 03:32:22,655
When they watch this attack on the fold

4525
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:24,959
I myself have a friend whose father

4526
03:32:25,215 --> 03:32:25,983
As a kid

4527
03:32:26,239 --> 03:32:27,519
Was working on a

4528
03:32:27,775 --> 03:32:32,639
It was higher up and a Japanese plane flew right past him and he in the pilot

4529
03:32:32,895 --> 03:32:33,663
Made eye contact

4530
03:32:33,919 --> 03:32:36,223
There's a lot of stories like that by the way

4531
03:32:36,735 --> 03:32:38,015
About seeing the gold teeth of the

4532
03:32:38,271 --> 03:32:39,551
The pilot for the pilot

4533
03:32:39,807 --> 03:32:44,415
Smiling or waving in fact as the planes approach Pearl Harbor

4534
03:32:44,927 --> 03:32:49,023
One of the workers at Pearl Harbor says he waved to the Japanese pilot

4535
03:32:49,279 --> 03:32:52,095
Because the Japanese pilot was waving to him

4536
03:32:53,631 --> 03:32:55,679
And in a remarkable coincidence that

4537
03:32:55,935 --> 03:33:00,543
Seems almost to Hollywood movie making style to be even true

4538
03:33:01,311 --> 03:33:07,455
These Japanese attack planes swarm down on Pearl Harbor right is the flag raising Sarah

4539
03:33:07,711 --> 03:33:09,759
Ramoni that happens in the morning is happening

4540
03:33:10,271 --> 03:33:16,415
And the bands like on the Nevada they've got the Nevada band and they're doing the Star-Spangled Banner like out of Apocalypse Now

4541
03:33:16,671 --> 03:33:22,815
Explosion starting with the bands playing on and by the way the Nevada band would finish the Stars

4542
03:33:23,071 --> 03:33:24,095
Star Spangled Banner

4543
03:33:24,351 --> 03:33:26,399
Even though they were being straight

4544
03:33:26,655 --> 03:33:29,471
While they were doing it in the flask was full of bullet holes

4545
03:33:31,263 --> 03:33:32,287
If you want to talk

4546
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:36,127
How unprepared people were for a war with Japan

4547
03:33:36,639 --> 03:33:39,967
Even after the bombs started falling American

4548
03:33:40,223 --> 03:33:43,807
Saylor's especially are looking at this and thinking it's just a screw up

4549
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:48,415
There was no US Air Force at this time there was an Army Air corps to Navy Air corps

4550
03:33:48,671 --> 03:33:54,815
And the Navy people are looking at this thinking some army guy really screwed up and put real bombs on these plans cuz they've been

4551
03:33:55,327 --> 03:33:58,655
Watching Army exercises for a long time in this just looks like a

4552
03:33:58,911 --> 03:33:59,679
Huge mistake

4553
03:34:00,191 --> 03:34:01,727
Although one of my favorite

4554
03:34:01,983 --> 03:34:03,775
Quotes that is in a lot of the history books

4555
03:34:04,287 --> 03:34:09,663
Is the one sailor who turns to his body even after the explosions have started

4556
03:34:10,175 --> 03:34:11,199
And says quote

4557
03:34:11,455 --> 03:34:14,783
This is the best goddamn drill the Army's ever put on

4558
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:15,807
And quote

4559
03:34:18,367 --> 03:34:19,903
Don't know soon enough it's not a drill

4560
03:34:20,671 --> 03:34:22,975
When you look at the timeline from this encounter

4561
03:34:23,487 --> 03:34:25,535
You'll notice that right after it starts the

4562
03:34:25,791 --> 03:34:27,071
The torpedo planes are

4563
03:34:27,583 --> 03:34:33,215
Honing in on the vulnerable battleships that are on the outside of some of these pairs

4564
03:34:33,471 --> 03:34:35,775
The makeup was called Battleship row

4565
03:34:36,287 --> 03:34:41,151
If you look at an actual diagram you'll notice that not all the battleships are in pairs but several of them are

4566
03:34:41,663 --> 03:34:47,807
The ones that are in pairs means that the that one ship is on sort of the Waterside and the other ship is on the

4567
03:34:48,063 --> 03:34:48,575
Dockside

4568
03:34:48,831 --> 03:34:52,415
The ship is on the dark side is protected by the outside ship

4569
03:34:52,671 --> 03:34:54,719
Those outside ships are going to take the brunt of the

4570
03:34:54,975 --> 03:34:55,487
Torpedoes

4571
03:34:55,743 --> 03:34:57,023
And the Torpedoes are shipped

4572
03:34:58,559 --> 03:35:04,703
They got like 500 pounds of explosives they weigh over a thousand pounds or 17 or 18

4573
03:35:04,959 --> 03:35:05,727
Feet long

4574
03:35:07,007 --> 03:35:10,335
A single plane will carry a single torpedo slung under it

4575
03:35:10,591 --> 03:35:16,735
The plane will fly low reloader the water sometimes below the level of the height of the ship there tour

4576

Peter Wang

4577
03:35:17,759 --> 03:35:19,807
Drop the torpedo and then speed off

4578
03:35:20,575 --> 03:35:25,439
These Torpedoes by the way have been specially designed for Pearl Harbor because normally

4579
03:35:25,695 --> 03:35:27,999
They dive so deep when you drop them

4580
03:35:28,255 --> 03:35:31,327
If they would just embed themselves in the mud of a harbor

4581
03:35:31,583 --> 03:35:37,727
The problem is once again that the Japanese designers here don't know if they're going to work so the very last major

4582
03:35:37,983 --> 03:35:40,287
Gamble the entire operation here

4583
03:35:40,799 --> 03:35:42,847
Is due the ship killers

4584
03:35:43,359 --> 03:35:45,663
Working this hard because if they don't you're screwed

03:35:53,855 --> 03:35:56,159
The opening of this attack and it's pretty clear

4590
03:35:56,927 --> 03:35:58,207
The Torpedoes work

4591
03:35:59,743 --> 03:36:00,511
Human rights quote

4592
03:36:02,047 --> 03:36:04,607
As the attack began at 7:55 a.m.

4593
03:36:04,863 --> 03:36:09,983
Unbelieving Americans watched his bombs rain down on Hickam in Ford Island Airfield

4594
03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:11,519
What a little flying Kate

4595
03:36:12,287 --> 03:36:13,055
Those are planes

4596
03:36:13,311 --> 03:36:15,615
Released their Torpedoes against the ships

4597
03:36:16,127 --> 03:36:20,991
Unforward Islands Westside Utah an old Battleship was a Target ship now

4598
03:36:21,247 --> 03:36:27,391
Moored in the aircraft carrier Enterprises usual place and possibly mistaken for a carrier Buy in any

4599
03:36:27,647 --> 03:36:30,463
Experience Japanese pilot torpedoes

4600
03:36:30,719 --> 03:36:32,511
Another struct cruiser Raleigh

4601
03:36:32,767 --> 03:36:34,047
Morton line ahead

4602
03:36:34,303 --> 03:36:35,839
Both ships began to list

4603
03:36:36,095 --> 03:36:38,399
And the target ship capsized at 8:12

4604
03:36:38,655 --> 03:36:40,703
What Riley's Crusade the cruiser

4605
03:36:40,959 --> 03:36:42,751
My heroic damage control efforts

4606
03:36:43,263 --> 03:36:45,823
On the opposite shore of Ford Island he writes

4607
03:36:46,079 --> 03:36:47,871
Torpedo struck Nevada

4608
03:36:48,127 --> 03:36:48,895
Arizona

4609
03:36:49,151 --> 03:36:49,919
West Virginia

4610
03:36:50,175 --> 03:36:51,967
Oklahoma and California

4611
03:36:52,223 --> 03:36:55,551
Tennessee moored in Board of West Virginia

4612
03:36:55,807 --> 03:36:58,879
And Maryland in Board of Oklahoma escaped

4613
03:36:59,135 --> 03:37:03,743
Torpedo damage as did the fleet Flagship Pennsylvania in drydock 1

4614
03:37:04,255 --> 03:37:04,767
And quote

4615
03:37:06,303 --> 03:37:07,839
The Oklahoma's going to be hip

4616
03:37:08,095 --> 03:37:10,655
A couple of torpedoes right when the attack begins at 7

4617
03:37:10,911 --> 03:37:11,423
56

4618
03:37:11,935 --> 03:37:14,239
She's going to be hit with another one 4 minutes later that

4619
03:37:14,495 --> 03:37:16,543
Penetrates where the first two already blew up

4620
03:37:17,055 --> 03:37:18,591
And she'll start to roll over

4621
03:37:19,103 --> 03:37:23,711
To get hit with two more while she's rolling over and within 12 minutes of being struck

4622
03:37:24,735 --> 03:37:29,343
You can see her Underside and men are scurrying as she tips over to try not to

4623
03:37:30,111 --> 03:37:31,135
Fall into the sea

4624
03:37:33,183 --> 03:37:38,303
Those are the lucky ones because at least 400 Sailors are trapped below decks in the Oklahoma

4625
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:40,351
With water pouring in

4626
03:37:40,607 --> 03:37:46,751
Shell's giant shells are getting dislodged and crushing men and the lights are going out in these people are trying to get

4627
03:37:47,007 --> 03:37:48,543
It out before they drowned

4628
03:37:49,567 --> 03:37:50,847
On the West Virginia there hitwe

4629
03:37:51,103 --> 03:37:52,895
Something like 6 or 7 torpedo

4630
03:37:53,919 --> 03:37:55,711
A couple of bombs on top of that to boot

4631
03:37:55,967 --> 03:37:57,503
And it's a nightmare over there

4632
03:37:59,039 --> 03:38:04,159
One of the survivors described what it was like to be on the deck of one of these ships when it was hit by a torpedo

4633
03:38:04,671 --> 03:38:06,207
And he says the torpedo

4634
03:38:06,463 --> 03:38:09,279
Rose up a mountain of water

4635
03:38:09,791 --> 03:38:11,327
Tons of liquid

4636
03:38:11,839 --> 03:38:16,959
That goes up in the sky higher than the ship is tall but then crashes down on the deck

4637
03:38:19,519 --> 03:38:23,871
And making it difficult because the ship's decks are Awash in water for a bit afterwards

4638
03:38:24,127 --> 03:38:27,455
To get off a ship that's just been hit by a torpedo and

4639
03:38:27,967 --> 03:38:28,735
You know what is

4640
03:38:28,991 --> 03:38:31,039
Exploding and burning and all that kind of stuff

4641
03:38:31,551 --> 03:38:32,063
Making it

4642
03:38:32,575 --> 03:38:33,599
Even more difficult

4643
03:38:34,111 --> 03:38:38,207
To deal with what amounts to most of these men on the ships

4644
03:38:38,975 --> 03:38:45,119
With something more like a natural disaster or an explosion at Sea that might not have anything

4645
03:38:45,375 --> 03:38:46,143
To do with war

4646
03:38:46,399 --> 03:38:48,191
Is very little of the combat

4647
03:38:48,447 --> 03:38:49,983
Side of this going on

4648
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:54,079
There are heroic Tales of men breaking into locked ammunition

4649
03:38:54,335 --> 03:38:56,639
Cabinets because everything is put away

4650
03:38:56,895 --> 03:38:58,175
In the gunzer

4651
03:38:58,431 --> 03:39:01,759
Sometimes on these planes for example still packed in the oil

4652
03:39:03,039 --> 03:39:08,927
So this is more and intentionally cause disaster in the story of all these human beings

4653
03:39:09,183 --> 03:39:10,975
Trying to make their way to safety

4654
03:39:11,231 --> 03:39:14,559
All sorts of heroism by the way and let's give

4655
03:39:14,815 --> 03:39:16,095
Props were there deserved

4656
03:39:16,351 --> 03:39:19,167
A US Navy that everyone noticed

4657
03:39:19,423 --> 03:39:21,215
Was behaving as well

4658
03:39:21,471 --> 03:39:23,007
As you could possibly imagine under

4659
03:39:23,263 --> 03:39:23,775
The circumstance

4660
03:39:24,031 --> 03:39:24,799
There's not mast

4661
03:39:25,055 --> 03:39:26,591
Panic and screaming and yelling

4662
03:39:26,847 --> 03:39:29,663
And people are even giving up their lives and dying

4663
03:39:30,175 --> 03:39:30,687
In

4664
03:39:31,455 --> 03:39:33,247
The Silence of resignation it's

4665
03:39:34,015 --> 03:39:34,783
Part of what makes

4666
03:39:35,039 --> 03:39:37,087
Everyone get their teeth and get so angry about

4667
03:39:37,343 --> 03:39:37,855
About this afterwards

4668
03:39:38,367 --> 03:39:38,879
Turn American

4669
03:39:39,647 --> 03:39:40,927
Right I mean this is

4670
03:39:41,439 --> 03:39:43,487
Such bravery when you want to avenge

4671
03:39:43,999 --> 03:39:45,023
People who died in Sao

4672
03:39:45,279 --> 03:39:45,791
Terrible surf

4673
03:39:46,303 --> 03:39:47,839
Chances of this and make no mistake about it

4674
03:39:48,351 --> 03:39:50,143
You look what's going to happen on the Arizona

4675
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:51,679
Because after the torpedo plane

4676
03:39:51,935 --> 03:39:52,447
And you're done

4677
03:39:52,959 --> 03:39:55,007
Income the high-altitude bombers

4678
03:39:55,263 --> 03:39:57,055
The dive-bombers are striking the

4679
03:39:57,311 --> 03:39:58,335
Airfields all over the

4680
03:39:58,591 --> 03:39:59,103
The place

4681
03:39:59,871 --> 03:40:05,503
The fighters and we haven't even talked about this are strafing all these ships with machine-gun bullets in the zero Fighters

4682
03:40:05,759 --> 03:40:08,831
Also at 2:20 mm cannons with your very nasty

4683
03:40:09,087 --> 03:40:10,111
When I used to war game

4684
03:40:10,367 --> 03:40:11,903
Second world war Naval battles

4685
03:40:12,159 --> 03:40:14,463
We paid very little attention in the rules

4686
03:40:14,975 --> 03:40:16,767
To the effects of strafing but it's

4687
03:40:17,023 --> 03:40:18,303
Clear from reading the Survivor

4688
03:40:18,815 --> 03:40:19,327
But it was

4689
03:40:19,583 --> 03:40:21,375
Massively effective

4690
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:27,007
Sweeping the decks of human beings making it impossible to get stuff done creating chaos

4691
03:40:27,263 --> 03:40:33,407
Stopping people from getting off the ships or where they needed to go because what would happen is on these heavily-armored warships there still a bunch

4692
03:40:33,663 --> 03:40:34,431
Stop it's breakable

4693
03:40:34,943 --> 03:40:35,711
And the bullets

4694
03:40:35,967 --> 03:40:39,039
Hit the ships creating tons of Spartan a Ricochet everywhere

4695
03:40:39,295 --> 03:40:45,183
And anything that's not nailed down or heavily armored goes flying the captain of I think the West Virginia will have his stomach

4696
03:40:45,439 --> 03:40:45,951
Torn out

4697
03:40:46,207 --> 03:40:50,559
Buy some of the shrapnel and they will try to get him off the ship into safety Hill die trying

4698
03:40:51,071 --> 03:40:53,375
And commanding the ship by the way and telling everybody not to

4699
03:40:53,631 --> 03:40:57,215
Not to bother with him another one of those many heroic stories out of Pearl Harbor

4700
03:40:59,007 --> 03:41:03,359
These high altitude bombers though come in at eight thousand fourteen thousand feet somewhere in there

4701
03:41:03,615 --> 03:41:06,687
And these are not the best plan to attack ships with by the way

4702
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:10,527
He's very hard to hit a ship from that altitude

4703
03:41:11,807 --> 03:41:16,671
Obviously these are not moving ships of that helps and on Battleship row where you have the ships

4704
03:41:17,183 --> 03:41:19,999
Moored side-by-side next to each other it's almost like you

4705
03:41:20,255 --> 03:41:22,815
Double the width of the ship so it makes it any easier Target

4706
03:41:23,583 --> 03:41:27,167
Nonetheless the hit ratio is nothing to be necessarily excited about

4707
03:41:27,679 --> 03:41:28,959
But when one of these

4708
03:41:29,215 --> 03:41:33,055
Bombs from these high altitude bombers and some of them are converted

4709
03:41:33,311 --> 03:41:35,615
16 inch Naval shells by the way

4710
03:41:36,127 --> 03:41:37,663
When one of them does hit

4711
03:41:38,175 --> 03:41:40,735
The amount of damage is overwhelming and one of them

4712
03:41:40,991 --> 03:41:42,015
It's the Arizona

4713
03:41:43,039 --> 03:41:45,599
And once again this is all happening

4714
03:41:45,855 --> 03:41:46,623
Very quickly

4715
03:41:46,879 --> 03:41:48,159
When the Arizona gets hit

4716
03:41:48,415 --> 03:41:51,487
This shell it is assumed it's difficult to conduct

4717
03:41:51,999 --> 03:41:54,815
Any sort of realistic Recreation of the

4718
03:41:55,071 --> 03:41:58,399
Wounds to the Arizona because she's so damaged

4719
03:41:58,655 --> 03:42:03,007
But it started this thing some people used to take it went down the smokestack but it's thought that it

4720
03:42:03,263 --> 03:42:07,103
It goes into the deck of the ship and penetrates and ignites the forward magazine

4721
03:42:07,359 --> 03:42:08,383
Where they keep all of the

4722
03:42:09,151 --> 03:42:10,687
Michels and ammunition

4723
03:42:10,943 --> 03:42:11,967
An explosives

4724
03:42:14,527 --> 03:42:18,623
Michael slackman says the Arizona's magazines contain 308

4725
03:42:18,879 --> 03:42:20,415
14 inch shells

4726
03:42:20,671 --> 03:42:22,975
Those are enormous and extremely heavy by the way

4727
03:42:23,487 --> 03:42:26,303
3505 in rounds

4728
03:42:27,327 --> 03:42:27,839
Those are

4729
03:42:28,095 --> 03:42:28,607
Standard

4730
03:42:28,863 --> 03:42:33,727
Land artillery side pieces right there nearly 5000 cans of powder

4731
03:42:33,983 --> 03:42:38,079
And more than 100 thousand rounds of machine gun and Small Arms ammunition

4732
03:42:38,591 --> 03:42:39,871
When that ignites

4733
03:42:40,127 --> 03:42:41,919
Survivors and there aren't many

4734
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:45,759
People on the ships All Around The harbourside

4735
03:42:46,271 --> 03:42:48,063
Say it was less of a

4736
03:42:48,319 --> 03:42:49,599
Big boom

4737
03:42:50,111 --> 03:42:52,415
The more a mighty whoosh

4738
03:42:52,671 --> 03:42:53,183
They said

4739
03:42:55,231 --> 03:42:57,279
Another person describing slackman

4740
03:42:57,535 --> 03:43:00,095
Hope said it was an awful swish Sora sound

4741
03:43:01,887 --> 03:43:02,399
A quotes

4742
03:43:02,655 --> 03:43:06,239
Seaman artist T Russo the Arizona he says explode

4743
03:43:06,751 --> 03:43:09,567
While he was on the nearby Nevada and says

4744
03:43:10,335 --> 03:43:10,847
Quote

4745
03:43:11,103 --> 03:43:12,383
The ship he said

4746
03:43:12,639 --> 03:43:18,015
Steam to jump at least 15 or 20 feet upward in the water and sort of break into

4747
03:43:18,527 --> 03:43:19,039
And quote

4748
03:43:21,087 --> 03:43:22,623
The explosion was so large

4749
03:43:23,903 --> 03:43:24,415
That

4750
03:43:24,927 --> 03:43:26,207
It blew out the

4751
03:43:26,463 --> 03:43:30,303
Flames on the ship next to the Arizona which was burning like

4752
03:43:30,559 --> 03:43:32,351
A concussion would blow out a match

4753
03:43:34,143 --> 03:43:35,167
Car engines

4754
03:43:35,423 --> 03:43:37,471
On Ford Island stall

4755
03:43:37,727 --> 03:43:38,495
From the concussion

4756
03:43:39,775 --> 03:43:42,847
But not everyone flat on some of the surrounding ships

4757
03:43:44,639 --> 03:43:46,175
And the bomber that released

4758
03:43:46,431 --> 03:43:46,943
The balm

4759
03:43:47,455 --> 03:43:48,479
Felt the concussion

4760
03:43:48,735 --> 03:43:50,015
Shake the aircraft

4761
03:43:52,319 --> 03:43:58,463
The amount of debris that shower down on the ships next to the Arizona to Tennessee's right by it and go

4762
03:43:58,719 --> 03:44:00,511
Gets hit with so much debris including

4763
03:44:01,023 --> 03:44:01,791
Body parts

4764
03:44:02,303 --> 03:44:06,399
It suffers more damage one author said from that then from the bombs that actually

4765
03:44:06,655 --> 03:44:07,167
He struck her

4766
03:44:08,447 --> 03:44:12,031
The fuel oil that instantly goes out everywhere

4767
03:44:12,287 --> 03:44:17,151
In all of these ships are gassed up and they carry hundreds of thousands close to half-a-million

4768
03:44:17,663 --> 03:44:19,711
Gallons of oil on them some of them more than half

4769
03:44:19,967 --> 03:44:21,247
How many gallons oil

4770
03:44:21,503 --> 03:44:22,271
Heavy oil types

4771
03:44:22,527 --> 03:44:27,903
It's instantly all in the water so it's survivors jump in to try to escape the devastation

4772
03:44:28,415 --> 03:44:29,695
In some places this is

4773
03:44:29,951 --> 03:44:30,975
6 in

4774
03:44:31,231 --> 03:44:32,511
Pic of oil in the water

4775
03:44:34,815 --> 03:44:35,839
The aftermath of

4776
03:44:36,095 --> 03:44:41,215
The Arizona explosion amid all this other destruction going on simultaneously is

4777
03:44:41,471 --> 03:44:42,239
It described by many

4778
03:44:43,007 --> 03:44:44,287
Maybe the most visceral account

4779
03:44:44,543 --> 03:44:45,567
My bread is Craig Nelson

4780
03:44:46,591 --> 03:44:49,151
He starts by quoting a West Virginia sailor

4781
03:44:50,175 --> 03:44:51,199
Who described the scene

4782
03:44:51,455 --> 03:44:51,967
Quote

4783
03:44:52,479 --> 03:44:57,087
Ships on fire ships burning explosion going on all over the place

4784
03:44:57,343 --> 03:44:59,391
I saw the Arizona blow up

4785
03:44:59,647 --> 03:45:01,695
And she just rained sailors

4786
03:45:01,951 --> 03:45:05,023
And of course those were the ones that were fortunate enough to live

4787
03:45:05,279 --> 03:45:06,815
The ones that were blown off the ship

4788
03:45:07,583 --> 03:45:08,607
Nelson continues

4789
03:45:09,375 --> 03:45:09,887
Quote

4790
03:45:10,399 --> 03:45:15,519
Burning Arizona crewman ran after into the water thinking they would find relief

4791
03:45:15,775 --> 03:45:20,383
Instead they found 6-inch pools of fiery fuel oil covering the sea

4792
03:45:20,639 --> 03:45:22,175
Turning them into matchsticks

4793
03:45:22,687 --> 03:45:24,479
Clint Westbrook said quote

4794
03:45:24,735 --> 03:45:30,879
All the oil tanks on all the battlewagons have been ruptured most of them and you could just about almost get out and

4795
03:45:31,135 --> 03:45:32,415
Walk on it was that big

4796
03:45:32,671 --> 03:45:34,975
And around those ships that have fire on it

4797
03:45:35,231 --> 03:45:40,607
It was on fire as well so a lot of these people jumping off the ship were jumping right into burning oil

4798
03:45:40,863 --> 03:45:44,703
We had just loaded the day before cuz we were going back to the States for Christmas

4799
03:45:44,959 --> 03:45:46,239
The Admiral

4800
03:45:46,495 --> 03:45:49,055
So we had filled the tank Saturday and quote

4801
03:45:50,591 --> 03:45:52,639
Nelson quotes another witness who said quote

4802
03:45:53,151 --> 03:45:54,687
These people were zombies

4803
03:45:54,943 --> 03:45:56,735
They were burned completely White

4804
03:45:56,991 --> 03:46:01,087
Their skin was just as white as if you would taking a bucket of whitewash and painted it white

4805
03:46:01,343 --> 03:46:07,487
Their hair was burned off their eyebrows were burned off the pitiful remains of their uniforms in their crotch was

4806
03:46:07,743 --> 03:46:08,767
Was a charred remnant

4807
03:46:09,023 --> 03:46:12,863
Indian soles of their shoes was about the only thing that was left on these bodies

4808
03:46:13,119 --> 03:46:14,655
They were moving like robots

4809
03:46:15,167 --> 03:46:19,775
Their arms were out held away from their bodies and they were stumping along the decks

4810
03:46:20,031 --> 03:46:20,799
And quote

4811
03:46:21,567 --> 03:46:23,359
Peter goes another sailor who said that

4812
03:46:23,615 --> 03:46:25,407
The decks look like a Boneyard

4813
03:46:25,663 --> 03:46:26,431
From all the body

4814
03:46:26,687 --> 03:46:27,199
He parts

4815
03:46:28,479 --> 03:46:29,759
Author Walter Lord in

4816
03:46:30,015 --> 03:46:32,319
Day of infamy describes the remembrances of

4817
03:46:32,575 --> 03:46:34,111
Tennessee Survivor

4818
03:46:34,623 --> 03:46:39,231
Who explained what it's like to look up and see a bomb coming down right at you

4819
03:46:39,487 --> 03:46:40,511
And then what happens after

4820
03:46:40,767 --> 03:46:41,535
The words he wrote

4821
03:46:41,791 --> 03:46:42,303
Quote

4822
03:46:43,071 --> 03:46:46,655
Seaman JP Burkholder looked out a porthole on the bridge

4823
03:46:46,911 --> 03:46:51,007
Just as one of the converted 16in shells crash down on number tutoring

4824
03:46:51,263 --> 03:46:52,287
A few feet forward

4825
03:46:52,799 --> 03:46:54,591
The porthole cover tore loose

4826
03:46:54,847 --> 03:46:57,919
Clobbered him on the head and sent him scurrying through the door

4827
03:46:58,431 --> 03:47:00,223
Outside he helped a wounded ensign

4828
03:47:00,479 --> 03:47:02,527
But couldn't help one of his closest friends

4829
03:47:02,783 --> 03:47:05,855
Who was so far gone he only wanted Burkholder to shoot him

4830
03:47:06,623 --> 03:47:09,695
Another armor-piercing bomber through number 3 turret

4831
03:47:09,951 --> 03:47:10,719
Farther app

4832
03:47:11,231 --> 03:47:12,767
Seaman SF Bowen

4833
03:47:13,023 --> 03:47:14,815
Stationed there was a powder Carmen

4834
03:47:15,071 --> 03:47:17,631
Was just dogging the hatch when the bomb hit

4835
03:47:18,143 --> 03:47:20,191
It wasn't a shattering crash at all

4836
03:47:20,703 --> 03:47:21,983
Just a ball of Fire

4837
03:47:22,239 --> 03:47:27,871
About the size of a basketball appeared overhead and seemed to melt down on everyone

4838
03:47:28,127 --> 03:47:31,455
It seemed to run down on his skin and there was no way to stop it

4839
03:47:31,967 --> 03:47:36,575
As he crawled out of the deck below he noticed that his shoe strings were still on fire

4840
03:47:37,343 --> 03:47:37,855
And quote

4841
03:47:40,159 --> 03:47:42,975
The tragedy is immeasurably made worse

4842
03:47:43,743 --> 03:47:46,047
When the fuel oil that all these

4843
03:47:46,559 --> 03:47:49,119
Sailors struggling in the water against

4844
03:47:49,375 --> 03:47:50,143
Catches fire

4845
03:47:52,703 --> 03:47:55,519
The combination of sailors being stuck underwater

4846
03:47:56,031 --> 03:47:57,567
And sailor is burning

4847
03:47:58,079 --> 03:47:58,591
Is

4848
03:47:59,103 --> 03:48:02,175
About as nasty as you can get them in there are reports of

4849
03:48:02,687 --> 03:48:05,759
Sailors jumping off the Arizona and sizzling when they

4850
03:48:06,015 --> 03:48:07,551
Get the water and then of course the water catcher

4851
03:48:07,807 --> 03:48:08,831
She's on fire it's a nightmare

4852
03:48:09,599 --> 03:48:15,743
Is that worse than the people that are trapped below decks in the many many stories of trying to escape the wall

4853
03:48:15,999 --> 03:48:16,767
Water the climbs up

4854
03:48:17,023 --> 03:48:22,399
Annie little pockets of air and people will be cut out of these things for weeks afterwards

4855
03:48:22,911 --> 03:48:24,703
The very belt Armour

4856
03:48:24,959 --> 03:48:30,847
I just supposed to make these ships a protective place for their Crews making it harder to cut into

4857
03:48:32,383 --> 03:48:33,663
There will also be people

4858
03:48:33,919 --> 03:48:34,431
That don't get

4859
03:48:34,687 --> 03:48:36,991
Cut out of the ships and timing are found

4860
03:48:37,503 --> 03:48:39,295
Later sometimes much later

4861
03:48:40,063 --> 03:48:40,575
Dead

4862
03:48:40,831 --> 03:48:43,135
Entombed in their ships with

4863
03:48:43,391 --> 03:48:44,159
Calendars off

4864
03:48:44,415 --> 03:48:46,207
Open marking each day that they were

4865
03:48:46,975 --> 03:48:48,255
Often in total darkness

4866
03:48:48,511 --> 03:48:49,279
Trapped under there

4867
03:48:51,839 --> 03:48:53,375
To give you an idea of the speed

4868
03:48:53,631 --> 03:48:54,399
Heat of these attacks

4869
03:48:55,167 --> 03:48:58,239
The bigwigs in the military on the island

4870
03:48:58,495 --> 03:49:03,871
Can kind of see the smoke they have these wonderful home sometimes even overlooking the area around Pearl Harbor

4871
03:49:04,383 --> 03:49:06,431
General Walter short C's disc

4872
03:49:06,687 --> 03:49:08,735
Admiral husband Kimmel sees this

4873
03:49:08,991 --> 03:49:09,759
And

4874
03:49:10,271 --> 03:49:13,343
Get a chance to watch some of this unfold as it happens

4875
03:49:13,855 --> 03:49:19,231
Did a famous story General shorts he's the smoke while he's having Sunday breakfast with his wife

4876
03:49:19,487 --> 03:49:22,815
Runs to his Center to ask what's going on

4877
03:49:23,071 --> 03:49:27,167
I asked Lieutenant Colonel George Bicknell what's going on out there

4878
03:49:27,423 --> 03:49:29,727
And Big Moe says I'm not sure General

4879
03:49:29,983 --> 03:49:32,031
But I just saw two battleships sunk

4880
03:49:32,543 --> 03:49:33,311
And then

4881
03:49:33,567 --> 03:49:36,127
Short streams that's ridiculous

4882
03:49:37,151 --> 03:49:43,295
Admiral Kimmel is having a similar experience and you'll get blamed for a lot of this app The Wharf didn't put out the torpedo

4883
03:49:43,551 --> 03:49:46,111
All kinds of the one that asked his associate

4884
03:49:46,367 --> 03:49:50,463
You know what the probability of a Japanese Air Attack was that the guy said not absolutely none

4885
03:49:50,975 --> 03:49:54,047
And now he's watching in disbelief in real time

4886
03:49:54,559 --> 03:49:58,143
You know what's going on out there and it's almost heartbreaking unless of course

4887
03:49:58,399 --> 03:49:59,935
Are you blaming for the whole thing

4888
03:50:01,983 --> 03:50:05,055
Author Craig Nelson in Pearl Harbor from infamy to Greatness rights

4889
03:50:05,311 --> 03:50:05,823
Quote

4890
03:50:07,103 --> 03:50:12,735
An officer phone Admiral husband Kimmel at home with the news the Japanese planes were attacking his Fleet

4891
03:50:13,503 --> 03:50:16,831
The Admiral was still buttoning his white uniform is he ran out of the house

4892
03:50:17,087 --> 03:50:20,415
And onto the neighboring lawn of the district's chief of staff

4893
03:50:20,671 --> 03:50:21,695
Captain John early

4894
03:50:22,207 --> 03:50:24,767
Which had a panoramic view of Battleship row

4895
03:50:25,023 --> 03:50:28,607
Miserly said later that Kimmel stood quote

4896
03:50:28,863 --> 03:50:31,423
In utter disbelief and completely stunned

4897
03:50:31,679 --> 03:50:34,495
His face is white does that uniform he wore

4898
03:50:35,007 --> 03:50:35,519
End quote

4899
03:50:37,311 --> 03:50:38,079
Now quoting

4900
03:50:38,591 --> 03:50:39,359
Kimmel

4902
03:50:40,383 --> 03:50:42,175
The sky was full of the enemy

4903
03:50:42,431 --> 03:50:43,455
Kimmel said later

4904
03:50:43,711 --> 03:50:48,319
He saw the Arizona quote lift out of the water then sink back down

4905
03:50:48,575 --> 03:50:49,343
Way down

4906
03:50:50,367 --> 03:50:50,879
And quote

4907
03:50:51,391 --> 03:50:53,183
Mrs. early he writes

4908
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:55,231
Start a battleship capsize

4909
03:50:55,487 --> 03:50:58,303
Instead looks like they've got the Oklahoman

4910
03:50:58,815 --> 03:51:02,399
Yes I can see that they have the Admiral numbly responded

4911

Nelson rights

4912
03:51:06,239 --> 03:51:07,519
Other people encountered

4913
03:51:08,031 --> 03:51:09,823
Camel ride around the same time

4914
03:51:11,615 --> 03:51:12,639
Kimmel and his associates

4915
03:51:13,407 --> 03:51:15,455
Send a message to the Pacific Fleet

4916
03:51:15,711 --> 03:51:18,527
And back to Washington singing to Pearl Harbor is under attack

4917
03:51:19,295 --> 03:51:21,599
He orders that the enemy force be found

4918
03:51:22,111 --> 03:51:24,927
And then one officer remembered and is quoted by Nelson

4919
03:51:25,183 --> 03:51:26,207
As saying quote

4920
03:51:26,719 --> 03:51:31,327
I ran over to my offices and I happen to be standing alongside the commander-in-chief himself

4921
03:51:31,583 --> 03:51:32,607
Admiral Kimmel

4922
03:51:32,863 --> 03:51:34,911
We were glumly watching the Havoc

4923
03:51:35,167 --> 03:51:36,959
The Carnage that was going on

4924
03:51:37,215 --> 03:51:41,055
And suddenly he reached up and tore off his four star shoulder boards

4925
03:51:41,311 --> 03:51:45,407
Which indicated his Rank and title as commander-in-chief Pacific Fleet

4926
03:51:45,919 --> 03:51:47,967
He stepped into his adjacent offices

4927
03:51:48,223 --> 03:51:53,599
And realizing he was going to lose command Dawn 2 Star rear Admiral shoulder boards

4928
03:51:54,111 --> 03:51:54,623
And quote

4929
03:51:55,647 --> 03:51:57,183
And then Nelson relate

4930
03:51:57,439 --> 03:51:58,975
His version of a

4931
03:51:59,231 --> 03:51:59,999
A famous story that

4932
03:52:00,255 --> 03:52:01,023
It's told a number

4933
03:52:01,279 --> 03:52:01,791
Different ways

4934
03:52:02,303 --> 03:52:03,327
But right around

4935
03:52:04,351 --> 03:52:06,399
That exact moment a bullet

4936
03:52:06,911 --> 03:52:13,055
Ricochets into the house if they spent 50 caliber shell is what I read somewhere which would probably indicate

4937
03:52:13,311 --> 03:52:14,079
Did he was an American Boy

4938
03:52:15,615 --> 03:52:20,479
But it was so spent that hit him in the chest and just bounced off and left a mark on his white uniform

4939
03:52:20,991 --> 03:52:21,503
And I

4940
03:52:21,759 --> 03:52:23,295
He's quoted as saying several things

4941
03:52:23,807 --> 03:52:25,855
Nelson has him saying I wish it

4942
03:52:26,111 --> 03:52:26,623
Killed me

4943
03:52:27,391 --> 03:52:30,463
But the variations are such that it's sort of a rueful

4944
03:52:30,719 --> 03:52:31,743
Dark joke

4945
03:52:32,255 --> 03:52:35,583
That that would have been better than what he's going to face now being response

4946
03:52:36,095 --> 03:52:36,607
For this immense

4947
03:52:36,863 --> 03:52:37,375
Carnage

4948
03:52:38,399 --> 03:52:39,423
It is visible to

4949
03:52:40,703 --> 03:52:41,471
A car needs that is

4950
03:52:41,727 --> 03:52:43,007
Describe over and over

4951
03:52:43,519 --> 03:52:49,663
And it's unbelievable that some of these people will come up from below decks on these ships that have settled into the mud of pearl

4952
03:52:49,919 --> 03:52:54,015
Pearl Harbor have been sunk by the way out at Sea they would have been lost forever

4953
03:52:54,271 --> 03:52:57,855
But a bunch of these ships just so to settle their heroic efforts by the

4954
03:52:58,111 --> 03:53:00,159
Cruise to counter flood them and save them

4955
03:53:00,415 --> 03:53:02,207
There's a lot of people trapped below them

4956
03:53:03,487 --> 03:53:07,327
And when they come up and they look around remember the world that they last Saw

4957
03:53:07,583 --> 03:53:11,423
Add blue skies and this marvelous glorious us Pacific Fleet

4958
03:53:11,679 --> 03:53:12,959
And they come up in the water

4959
03:53:13,215 --> 03:53:15,263
And his body is floating everywhere

4960
03:53:15,519 --> 03:53:21,663
The ships are all falling apart and smoking and then and you can't even see the sky through all the black smoke is the oil

4961
03:53:21,919 --> 03:53:22,687
Burns off the ocean

4962
03:53:23,711 --> 03:53:25,759
Their world has been transformed

4963
03:53:27,295 --> 03:53:28,319
They've gone

4964
03:53:28,575 --> 03:53:32,159
From a Pacific Paradise to a naval version

4965
03:53:32,415 --> 03:53:34,463
Dante's Inferno

4966
03:53:35,231 --> 03:53:36,255
In a matter of minutes

4967
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:41,631
And all of this Carnage and all this damage at all this destruction

4968
03:53:41,887 --> 03:53:43,167
Has been rocked

4969
03:53:43,423 --> 03:53:44,447
By the first

4970
03:53:44,703 --> 03:53:45,983
Japanese attack way

4971
03:53:46,239 --> 03:53:47,007
Remember

4972
03:53:47,263 --> 03:53:50,591
There's another attack wave not that far behind them

4973
03:53:51,615 --> 03:53:54,175
And not long after the first wave departs

4974
03:53:54,687 --> 03:53:56,223
The second one swoops in

4975
03:53:58,015 --> 03:53:59,295
A couple of ships

4976
03:53:59,551 --> 03:54:05,695
Heroically a couple of Destroyers the battleship Nevada heroically of managed against all laws to start moving

4977
03:54:05,951 --> 03:54:09,279
Making it look like you know we're back already and all ready

4978
03:54:09,535 --> 03:54:15,679
You have 30 minutes 35 minutes 45 minutes after a surprise attack the American Fleet on the move and it was inspirational.

4979
03:54:15,935 --> 03:54:16,447
All who can see it

4980
03:54:16,703 --> 03:54:17,471
Those ships

4981
03:54:17,727 --> 03:54:19,007
Attracted the specific

4982
03:54:19,263 --> 03:54:20,543
The contention of the second wave

4983
03:54:21,055 --> 03:54:23,103
Goes after them with bigger than a bad Waka

4984
03:54:23,359 --> 03:54:25,151
Beach in the sand to keep from sinking

4985
03:54:26,687 --> 03:54:28,479
Within 90 minutes it's all over

4986
03:54:28,991 --> 03:54:29,503
Start to finish

4987
03:54:31,039 --> 03:54:32,319
The planes fly off

4988
03:54:32,831 --> 03:54:34,367
And Pearl Harbor is left

4989
03:54:34,623 --> 03:54:36,671
They smoking devastation

4990
03:54:37,695 --> 03:54:39,743
Dead and wounded everywhere

4991
03:54:41,023 --> 03:54:42,559
More than 2400 people

4992
03:54:43,071 --> 03:54:43,583
Die

4993
03:54:44,095 --> 03:54:45,375
In this 90 minutes

4994
03:54:45,887 --> 03:54:46,655
More than a thousand

4995
03:54:46,911 --> 03:54:47,679
Irwindale

4996
03:54:48,191 --> 03:54:51,519
Almost 200 planes were destroyed on the ground

4997
03:54:51,775 --> 03:54:54,335
More than a hundred and fifty or damaged

4998
03:54:55,359 --> 03:54:58,431
And the entire Battleship complement of the US Pacific

4999
03:54:58,687 --> 03:54:59,199
Fleet

5000
03:54:59,455 --> 03:55:00,479
Is rendered

5001
03:55:00,991 --> 03:55:01,759
Useless

5002
03:55:02,783 --> 03:55:03,807
4 ships sunk

5003
03:55:04,319 --> 03:55:06,111
The others burning and damaged

5004
03:55:07,647 --> 03:55:09,695
The Japanese lose less than 30 playing

5005
03:55:11,487 --> 03:55:15,583
There's no possible way if you are on the Japanese side to look at this

5006
03:55:16,095 --> 03:55:19,679
And not see this as a huge Victory when you measure it

5007
03:55:20,191 --> 03:55:22,239
You know from a cost-benefit standpoint right

5008
03:55:22,495 --> 03:55:24,799
Less than 30 playing tuba get all that damage

5009
03:55:25,311 --> 03:55:25,823
Although

5010
03:55:26,847 --> 03:55:28,895
There were Japanese at the time

5011
03:55:29,151 --> 03:55:29,919
Who noticed

5012
03:55:30,175 --> 03:55:34,527
You know a silver lining from the Americans Viewpoint anyway

5013
03:55:35,295 --> 03:55:36,063
And that's that

5014
03:55:36,831 --> 03:55:39,391
The battleships may have been destroyed and put out of commission

5015
03:55:40,159 --> 03:55:42,207
But the carriers of the US Pacific

5016
03:55:42,463 --> 03:55:42,975
Fleet

5017
03:55:43,231 --> 03:55:46,047
Which had been at Pearl Harbor not that long ago

5018
03:55:46,303 --> 03:55:47,839
Weren't there when the attack happen

5019
03:55:49,119 --> 03:55:51,679
And that means that the weapon system

5020
03:55:51,935 --> 03:55:55,519
A few Only The Visionaries and seen as the next

5021
03:55:56,031 --> 03:56:01,663
Big thing in Naval Warfare that means the right after the battle that just proved conclusively

5022
03:56:02,175 --> 03:56:05,503
Did aircraft carriers were the next big thing in Naval Warfare

5023
03:56:05,759 --> 03:56:07,807
Didn't get any of the enemies are crap

5024
03:56:08,063 --> 03:56:08,575
Carriers

5025
03:56:09,343 --> 03:56:14,207
In the United States is carriers that managed to be away from Pearl Harbor on December 7th

5026
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:16,255
Will be instrumental

5027
03:56:16,511 --> 03:56:18,303
In avenging what was done there

5028
03:56:20,863 --> 03:56:21,887
Knocking out the

5029
03:56:22,143 --> 03:56:23,167
Battleship component

5030
03:56:23,423 --> 03:56:24,191
The Pacific Fleet

5031
03:56:24,959 --> 03:56:25,983
Is a big blow

5032
03:56:27,007 --> 03:56:28,287
The human lies are irreplaceable

5033
03:56:29,311 --> 03:56:30,335
But let's be honest

5034
03:56:31,103 --> 03:56:33,151
These battleships were not even Cutting Edge

5035
03:56:33,407 --> 03:56:33,919
Battleship

5036
03:56:34,687 --> 03:56:36,735
Most of them dating back to the first World War

5037
03:56:36,991 --> 03:56:38,783
Some of them are even older than that

5038
03:56:39,295 --> 03:56:41,343
Useful at a bunch of things surely

5039
03:56:42,111 --> 03:56:43,903
Fun if you were someone like

5040
03:56:44,415 --> 03:56:45,951
Winston Churchill

5041
03:56:47,231 --> 03:56:49,791
The most useful thing these battleships

5042
03:56:50,047 --> 03:56:51,071
Maybe did

5043
03:56:51,583 --> 03:56:53,119
In terms of helping

5044
03:56:53,375 --> 03:56:54,655
Win the war

5045
03:56:55,167 --> 03:56:56,959
Was exactly what they did do

5046
03:56:57,983 --> 03:56:59,263
And he did not see

5047
03:57:00,799 --> 03:57:02,079
Pearl Harbor

5048
03:57:03,103 --> 03:57:04,639
Strike is a tragedy

5049
03:57:06,175 --> 03:57:07,967
A better word might have been

5050
03:57:08,223 --> 03:57:08,991
Erowid

5051
03:57:10,271 --> 03:57:12,319
A necessary sacrifice

5052
03:57:13,087 --> 03:57:18,463
To get the United States to do something that from his point of view they should have already done

5053
03:57:19,999 --> 03:57:21,279
It's probably not act

5054
03:57:21,791 --> 03:57:23,071
It's probably a misquote

5055
03:57:23,583 --> 03:57:25,119
The one of the lines attribute

5056
03:57:25,631 --> 03:57:26,911
To Winston Churchill I would

5057
03:57:28,191 --> 03:57:29,471
Why is that you could always

5058
03:57:29,727 --> 03:57:30,495
Count on the America

5059
03:57:30,751 --> 03:57:32,543
Directions to do the right thing

5060
03:57:32,799 --> 03:57:35,359
After all the other options have been exhausted

5061
03:57:36,127 --> 03:57:36,895
In this case

5062
03:57:37,407 --> 03:57:39,711
The attack on Pearl Harbor eliminate

5063
03:57:39,967 --> 03:57:40,479
Did any other Rock

5064
03:57:43,295 --> 03:57:45,855
It aroused a sleeping giant

5065
03:57:46,111 --> 03:57:47,903
To a level of Wrath

5066
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:49,695
That would carry it forward

5067
03:57:50,207 --> 03:57:55,071
Through any misfortunes to an ending that a guy like Winston Churchill saw

5068
03:57:55,327 --> 03:57:56,351
As inevitable

5069
03:57:57,375 --> 03:57:58,143
The United States

5070
03:57:58,399 --> 03:57:58,911
It was

5071
03:57:59,167 --> 03:57:59,679
Shocked

5072
03:57:59,935 --> 03:58:00,447
And sad

5073
03:58:00,703 --> 03:58:01,983
Emotionally

5074
03:58:02,495 --> 03:58:04,543
Upset by the Pearl Harbor attacks

5075
03:58:05,311 --> 03:58:07,103
A guy like Winston Churchill

5076
03:58:07,615 --> 03:58:08,383
Was elated

5077
03:58:09,407 --> 03:58:10,175
Because to him

5078
03:58:11,199 --> 03:58:13,503
December 7th 1941

5079
03:58:14,271 --> 03:58:16,575
What the day that the war was decided

5080
03:58:17,855 --> 03:58:21,183
And Britain was going to be on The Winning Side

5081
03:58:21,439 --> 03:58:21,951
After all

5082
03:58:22,975 --> 03:58:25,023
He wrote after the war about his feelings

5083
03:58:25,791 --> 03:58:26,559
At this moment

5084
03:58:27,583 --> 03:58:28,351
And said quote

5085
03:58:30,399 --> 03:58:33,215
No American will think it wrong of me

5086
03:58:33,471 --> 03:58:38,079
If I proclaim the to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy

5087
03:58:38,847 --> 03:58:41,151
I could not foretell the course of events

5088
03:58:41,663 --> 03:58:45,503
I do not pretend to have measured accurately the Marshall might of Japan

5089
03:58:46,015 --> 03:58:50,623
But now at this very moment I knew the United States was in the war

5090
03:58:51,135 --> 03:58:52,927
Up to the neck and into the death

5091
03:58:53,695 --> 03:58:55,487
So we had won after all

5092
03:58:55,999 --> 03:58:57,535
Yes after Dunkirk

5093
03:58:57,791 --> 03:58:59,583
After the fall of France

5094
03:58:59,839 --> 03:59:01,887
After the horrible episode of a rhyme

5095
03:59:02,399 --> 03:59:07,775
After the threat of invasion when apart from the air in the Navy we were in almost unarmed people

5096
03:59:08,287 --> 03:59:11,103
After the deadly struggle of the U-Boat War

5097
03:59:11,359 --> 03:59:12,895
The first battle of the Atlantic

5098
03:59:13,151 --> 03:59:14,431
Game by a hands breath

5099
03:59:14,943 --> 03:59:20,831
Chapter 17 months of lonely fighting and 19 months of my own responsibilities and Dyer stress

5100
03:59:21,599 --> 03:59:22,623
We had won the war

5101
03:59:23,647 --> 03:59:24,927
England would live

5102
03:59:25,695 --> 03:59:26,719
Brenton Wood live

5103
03:59:27,231 --> 03:59:30,047
The Commonwealth of nations in the Empire would live

5104
03:59:30,815 --> 03:59:32,607
How long the war would last

5105
03:59:32,863 --> 03:59:35,679
Remote fashion it would end no man Patel

5106
03:59:35,935 --> 03:59:37,727
No did I at this moment care

5107
03:59:38,239 --> 03:59:41,311
Once again in our Long Island history

5108
03:59:41,823 --> 03:59:44,895
You should emerge however Mulder mutilated

5109
03:59:45,151 --> 03:59:45,663
Safe

5110
03:59:45,919 --> 03:59:46,943
Victorious

5111
03:59:47,711 --> 03:59:49,503
We should not be wiped out

5112
03:59:50,015 --> 03:59:52,063
Our history would not come to an end

5113
03:59:52,575 --> 03:59:54,879
We might not even have to die as individuals

5114
03:59:55,903 --> 03:59:57,439
Hitler's fate was sealed

5115
03:59:57,951 --> 03:59:59,743
Mussolini's fate was sealed

5116
04:00:00,511 --> 04:00:02,047
As for the Japanese

5117
04:00:02,815 --> 04:00:04,351
They would be ground to powder

5118
04:00:05,887 --> 04:00:06,399
And quote

5119
04:00:14,591 --> 04:00:17,407
We've been telling you about audible on this program for a long time

5120
04:00:17,919 --> 04:00:19,199
And there's a reason

5121
04:00:19,455 --> 04:00:20,223
Did you hear

5122
04:00:20,735 --> 04:00:25,599
Us discuss them as often as we do when it's because this is not a program that relies on advert

5123
04:00:25,855 --> 04:00:26,367
Revising

5124
04:00:26,623 --> 04:00:27,135
We're listeners

5125
04:00:28,159 --> 04:00:30,975
So we can afford to Simply do advertising that

5126
04:00:31,487 --> 04:00:35,839
Conforms to the hosts on radical beliefs on certain things

5127
04:00:36,095 --> 04:00:37,119
For example

5128
04:00:37,375 --> 04:00:38,143
Reading

5129
04:00:38,911 --> 04:00:39,423
Time 8

5130
04:00:39,679 --> 04:00:40,191
Voraciously

5131
04:00:40,447 --> 04:00:40,959
I'm one of the

5132
04:00:41,983 --> 04:00:43,519
The things that we benefit from reading

5133
04:00:43,775 --> 04:00:45,055
And we all collectively is a

5134
04:00:45,311 --> 04:00:45,823
Society

5135
04:00:46,079 --> 04:00:48,127
Society benefits from having more readers

5136
04:00:48,639 --> 04:00:50,175
And if you look at the strides

5137
04:00:50,431 --> 04:00:52,479
Over the amount of time we've been telling you about Audible

5138
04:00:52,735 --> 04:00:53,759

5143
04:01:08,351 --> 04:01:10,143
View a better Society

5144
04:01:10,911 --> 04:01:12,703
Me take for example what audible does

5145
04:01:14,239 --> 04:01:16,799
I mean this is an app that allows people to not just

5146
04:01:17,055 --> 04:01:18,335
You know enjoy the books

5147
04:01:18,591 --> 04:01:19,615
Because they're reading them

5148
04:01:20,127 --> 04:01:26,015
But to help tempt other people to enjoy books they may not be reading I love this end of this book

5149
04:01:26,271 --> 04:01:26,783
Feature

5150
04:01:27,039 --> 04:01:29,855
We're with the app you share a book from your library with anyone

5151
04:01:30,367 --> 04:01:33,439

2NE1

5155
04:01:42,143 --> 04:01:48,287
And I love that but you can also listen to different speeds so if the host talks a lot slower than I do and you like my my style you can speed them up or

5156
04:01:48,799 --> 04:01:52,127
Conversely ifmy celebrates on you you can slow down

5157
04:01:53,407 --> 04:01:54,175

5178
04:02:58,175 --> 04:02:59,455
Andrea Lee

Coming up

5192
04:03:50,655 --> 04:03:54,751
Call the Pearl Harbor attacks are going on pretty much simultaneously

5193
04:03:55,007 --> 04:03:56,287
A Japanese

5194
04:03:56,543 --> 04:04:01,407
Blitzkrieg is occurring in Asia and the Pacific the largest Battlefield in human history

5195
04:04:01,663 --> 04:04:03,455
That will succeed

5196
04:04:03,967 --> 04:04:10,111
In part because of the West's underestimation of Japanese capabilities and

5197
04:04:10,623 --> 04:04:12,927
For all sorts of reasons including racial ones

5198
04:04:13,695 --> 04:04:14,975
Some of these Colonial

5199
04:04:15,231 --> 04:04:16,767
Powers do not believe

5200
04:04:17,023 --> 04:04:23,167
And maybe a lot of Americans don't either that an Asian they would have said Oriental at the time people work 8

5201
04:04:23,423 --> 04:04:26,239
Capable of something like what the Japanese are about to pull off

5202
04:04:26,751 --> 04:04:32,895
But there's a reason we called this series Supernova in the East and this is where we see the Japanese rice

5203
04:04:33,151 --> 04:04:33,663
Rising Sun

5204
04:04:34,175 --> 04:04:38,015
Explode in conquered territories over a wide area

5205
04:04:38,783 --> 04:04:39,807
And the United States

5206
04:04:40,575 --> 04:04:42,367
Angered roused

5207
04:04:42,623 --> 04:04:43,903
But groggy

5208
04:04:44,415 --> 04:04:47,231
Is in no position to do anything about it right away

5209
04:04:47,743 --> 04:04:51,839
For those of you who've been missing the combat element of this story

5210
04:04:52,095 --> 04:04:58,239
And let's remember for a long time the histories of the story in the American history books started with Pearl Harbor

5211
04:04:58,495 --> 04:05:01,055
8 hours into this series let the record show this in contacts

5212
04:05:01,823 --> 04:05:07,967
But this is the part of combat operations that most Pacific War aficionados are familiar with and that's coming up

5213
04:05:08,735 --> 04:05:09,503
Along with all the other

5214
04:05:09,759 --> 04:05:12,575
Other stuff of course all that and more as we like to say

5215
04:05:12,831 --> 04:05:13,599
Imparts free

5216
04:05:14,111 --> 04:05:15,647
