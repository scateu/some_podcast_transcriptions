EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Friendship is far from the only figure in the story
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,000	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who falls into a similar category
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:43,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States is dealing with one themselves
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Elves

EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:54,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On what will become

EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It will be for done
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:12,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States is attention is taken off European Affairs by events going on in Northern Mexico
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mexico has been
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:18,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Convulsed by Revolution since1910
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:22,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Northern Mexico often becomes one of these
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hotbeds of unrest and instability
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in January 1916 gunmen waylay
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A train
EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:30,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In northern Mexico
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:34,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is at the
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:41,440	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tail end of the era where train robberies are not uncommon but these gunmen aren't there to rob the train in fact if they go up
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:42,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Up and down the aisles
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They leave
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:46,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Mexican national the locals alone
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,864	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they pull off
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Every American from the train that they fine
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They find 16 to 18
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Workers
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:00,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Employees of a US Corporation operating in northern Mexico
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:06,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They take these Americans off the train line them up
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:07,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In front of the track
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Forced them to strip
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:11,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then execute
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:16,000	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We know this because one of The Americans
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:19,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Feigned death and got away and told his story
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:21,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I believe he said that the bodies were also mutilate
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This very well may have been
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:31,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An attempt to provoke a response on the part of the US government and if so the mutilation is just part of adding fuel to
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:31,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To the fire
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:35,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little something to make the US government even angrier
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:36,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At this event
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:42,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And things have been escalating to this point in northern Mexico for sometime groups affiliated with the same gunman had been
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:47,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hacking isolated Americans and murder here and murder their rape here were there but this was
EDL	00:04:47,999	00:04:49,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Upping the ante significantly
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:51,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	None the less
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The maneuver accomplished
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nothing
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:55,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Concrete
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Note
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So a couple of months later
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In March
EDL	00:04:59,519	00:05:00,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1916
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This group of
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Gunman or Outlaws or revolutionaries
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you're looking at it from another point of view
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:08,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Up the ante again
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:10,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Across
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:11,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The US map
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mexican border
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:13,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In strength
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:15,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More than a hundred
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Go after
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:21,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	American interest on the US side of the Border
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Culminating in net in an attack on a US city
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Columbus New Mexico
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:27,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the middle of the night
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:30,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They Roar through this town
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:33,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Shooting looting killing and burning
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	18 Americans will be
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kill the town will be burned down
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bandits
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:41,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:42,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terrorist
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:45,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or revolutionary depending on your point of view
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will escape back into Mexico
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:53,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now is a side note then as now Americans are heavily armed people
EDL	00:05:53,279	00:05:55,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And those Bandits paid a high price
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:59,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Forearm what they did to that town many more of them died
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:00,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then Americans died
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:05,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	None the less the idea that you were safe and protected
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:08,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Within the confines of the US borders with shatter
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a way that hadn't happened
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:14,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Since the Apache Wars in that region attended 30 years previous
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The attackers of Columbus New Mex
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:18,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Chicago were affiliated
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With a Mexican revolutionary leader
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:23,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Known to history not his
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Actual name is Pancho Villa
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:32,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Navia almost certainly wasn't in Columbus New Mexico he'd been hurt not that long before
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:34,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But these gunmen
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're part of
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In his man
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And if you look at this superficially
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a lot of similarity
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:44,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Between Pancho Villa
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And Osama bin Laden
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:48,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is not said to insult

EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About a year later
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are a lot of interesting things
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That this Expedition
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cross the border
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Shows not just
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mexicans
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:36,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not just Americans
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:41,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But European observers everywhere who all throughout this war
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I wondered
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What do United States is going to do
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what their capabilities are
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:52,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All of a sudden they have a US military force in the field to have a look at and measure up against the standards of
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Early 20th century War
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:56,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Be honest
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	American Endeavor look
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Looks like a disaster
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:02,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It doesn't look a whole lot different
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:06,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then efforts 30 years ago to the year
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That were launched
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To go after the last Apache leader to
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:14,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You break off the US reservation system with 40 Warriors
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:19,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm going to some of the same country that via and his men were hiding in
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:26,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Looks like a very similar Army just add some motor cars which is what the US
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was employing to give them some Mobility
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:34,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And some airplanes that look like they were invented by the Wright brothers themselves in fact
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The pilots were trained in some cases by Orville and Wilbur Wright that's how recent
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:43,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know airplane development is and the US planes are so rickety
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so new and none of them survive
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:47,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The first week or two
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:48,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of operation down
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the more interesting
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:10:00,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Aspects to the US operations in northern Mexico to go get Pancho via is the US doesn't know Northern Mexico in there
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Maps are all wrong
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:05,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so they have leading their army as Scouts
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Apache
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Chinese Apache
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:12,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Include allegedly some
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Apache Scouts who were amongst the Apache Scouts
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The hunted down Geronimo 30 years before
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:22,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In fact there's quite a connection to a lot of these people involved in this conflict
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	John General John Blackjack Pershing
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was a junior officer
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Trailing Geronimo
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	30 years
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before these event
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's believed the Pancho via wanted to
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:40,511	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Get the US to attack northern Mexico and bog them down in this insane
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Saying country to fight
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Insane Terrain insane weather conditions
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:51,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And thereby raise his standing among several revolutionary leaders
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:53,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Vying for control
EDL	00:10:53,567	00:10:58,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the instability in Mexico that have been going on since the 1910 Revolution
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Began
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:04,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But if Europeans already had a stereo
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:05,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Typical View
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:11,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the United States is a nation of cowboys and an army mired in an almost old west
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sort of approach
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:17,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Expedition into northern Mexico to capture Pancho Villa
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Did nothing
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To disabuse them
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of that stereotype
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Too many European Observers
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:26,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It wasn't just a frontier Army
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States of America look like they possess
EDL	00:11:30,431	00:11:32,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's kind of a frontier mentality to go along with it
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:37,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the things that was really hard for European planners has been
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On both sides of the war by the way
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:43,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is it a beginning to look more and more like the United States are going to play this huge role in the war
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What did that even mean
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:51,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can I say to never sent over lots of men to go fight in some European War
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:55,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was alien to the American Experience or what they actually do that
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:12:01,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were a lot of European Observer that thought that even if us got into the war they wouldn't send troops
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:03,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Americans don't do that
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that's
EDL	00:12:05,503	00:12:09,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Part of what makes that pre first world war United States of America
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hard for modern Americans to understand
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you know your grandpa
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you're lucky enough to Adventure Grandpa
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:16,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Explain
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You begin to get a real feel
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bring what they're about even if they're very different than you are
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they're real
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:24,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can relate to
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:29,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	United States of 1916 is like a great great great great
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:34,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can read all about it you want those people are different from you and you don't understand and you never knew
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You never knew anyone like
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:37,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The modern United States
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of America is the most
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:41,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Interventionist great power in the world
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:44,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In 1916
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:45,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was the office
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:52,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it had a long mythology connected to its very founding
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It reinforced the idea
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But that's the way American forum
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:57,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Policy should be
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before the United States could involve itself in the first World War
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:06,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It had to somehow deal with this lasting Legacy
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Dating all the way back to
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:12,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pre-revolutionary days but why don't you just start with the
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:16,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Farewell speech of the first American President George Washington
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:19,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The speech that was really read aloud
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Once a year

EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To figure out is because the historians don't agree

EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:48,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And portray him as
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:52,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the most if not the most idealistic president in American history

EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:48,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know idealism in peace and they were German generals for example
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or never
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:53,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Falling for that story that Wilson was some Bambi deer in the Headlights
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:56,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the world stage and always thought that was just a really good mask
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:01,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is Machiavellian scheming hid behind making him even more.
EDL	00:21:01,567	00:21:03,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	His disguise was better
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:10,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Unless I'm not going to wait as a fan of History into which Wilson I believe with the real Wilson but look at how it adds to the
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Uncertainty of the whole thing
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What is the sky all about
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:19,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now I personally think that the air of mystery that surrounds Woodrow Wilson
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Make some more interesting character and he's a giant
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:27,680	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Enigma that's quickly becoming perhaps the most important single individual
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:30,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the story by the end of 1916
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:32,800	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you know I didn't have to live with them
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:38,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The people in this tale he's not a character he's a world leader
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what the United States does in this war might decide to conflict
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So the stakes couldn't be higher
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:46,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Winston Churchill
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Writing after the first World War
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:54,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	She's got a very interesting view on Wilson it's hard to describe you can see he's he's walking on eggshells sometime
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:59,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But he says this guy we didn't know anything about it when he comes out of Academia basically
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Age is only in the American system
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:05,056	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do you get these people that can come from totally outside
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Politics
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A complete unknown Eagles in Britain
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:14,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Such a prime minister would have spent years in the in the House of Commons or what-have-you you know working their way up there would be in the pub
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:17,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Buckeye the whole time they would be an unknown quantity by the time they got the top job
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:21,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He Marvels at the fact that Woodrow Wilson is an unknown
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know the most powerful man
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the United States
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:29,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quickly becoming the most important single figure
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:32,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the war Churchill writes about Wilson quote
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In all his strength
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:38,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in all his weakness in his nobility and in his foibles he was
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:41,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In spite of his long academic record in brief governorship
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An unknown
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:47,296	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I'm measured quantity to the mighty people who made him their ruler in 1912
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:50,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Still more was he a mystery To The World At Large
EDL	00:22:50,880	00:22:52,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Writing with every sense of respect
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It seems no exaggeration to pronounce
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The action of the United States
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With its repercussions on the history of the world
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:05,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Depended during the awful. Of Armageddon upon the workings of this man's mind and spirit
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:08,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To the exclusion of almost every other Factor
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:14,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then he played a part in the fate of nations in comparably more direct and personal than any other man
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:15,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:18,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's why we're talking about
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:20,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States so much in this afternoon
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:23,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And if one of the other
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:26,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Parts of the Wilson story that are interesting is when you get
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:29,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Human beings in positions of great power and authority
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:31,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Often times their little quirks
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or idiosyncrasies
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or characteristics
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:37,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can make-or-break history
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,288	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean we all have little
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:42,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Things about us that might be quirky or idiosyncratic
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:47,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because we're not in positions of power and authority they don't really make much of a difference if
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:52,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If I don't Hitler leave the military after the first World War II decorated Corp
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:55,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And goes and opens up a sausage shop in Munich
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:56,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is corks
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:59,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And idiosyncrasies and characteristics
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Don't make a big difference on the world
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You probably never hear about them they only affect
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:05,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In other people he have contact
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:11,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you take that same figure and you making the iron-fisted dictator of one of the Great
EDL	00:24:11,520	00:24:13,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	20th century Nations on the planet
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And all of a sudden that man's quirks and idiosyncrasies and characteristics
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:19,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can create a deadly Holocaust
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:22,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now Wilson didn't have those kind
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The characteristics at least
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I haven't heard that even from the evil witch
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:30,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But he did have characteristics that impacted this whole situation one was
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He was almost always convinced that he was right
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:38,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The paraphrasing here we said something to the effect of one that he felt pity
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4 people who had different opinions than him play knew they were wrong
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:47,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can watch the way he operates in government and he's a supremely gifted politician
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:52,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But what time those people are unwilling to let other men
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:52,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Carry out
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know their policies and end their programs
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because they know they could do it better and you can see that from Wilson to
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After the war
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:05,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The man is going to become the British prime minister game David Lloyd George
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:09,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We'll have to sit by the French military leader on one side
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:15,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the president of the United States on the other and he said it was like sitting between Napoleon on one side and that was the French leader
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Jesus
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:17,824	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the other
EDL	00:25:18,336	00:25:19,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That was Woodrow Wilson
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:24,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And Jesus was probably more the way Wilson saw himself
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:27,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	George was trying to convey
EDL	00:25:27,552	00:25:28,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the way others
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Negotiating
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the savior
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:34,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can require a debt
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And Wilson's demeanor
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:43,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so the professorial air of superiority and that I'm always right
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:46,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kind of Savior are about him sometimes
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:47,264	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Robbed
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:51,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some people the wrong way and certainly influence the way
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That Wilson handled things
EDL	00:25:53,152	00:25:56,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there were several big challenges to American neutrality
EDL	00:25:56,992	00:26:00,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It Wilson had to deal with an all were especially acute
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In 1960
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One involved American lives
EDL	00:26:04,928	00:26:06,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The other involved American money
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:08,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the last involved
EDL	00:26:08,768	00:26:09,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An American election
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Start with
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:14,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Perhaps the number one most obvious
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:19,264	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thing sucking United States into the whirlpool The Vortex of the first World War
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:23,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it was something that was so obviously doing that you can feel
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:28,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The momentum even now reading the history books about this sort of slide into a war because
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:33,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans use of this Thoroughly Modern science fiction almost weapon the submarine
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I have a submarine with creating conditions where
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:40,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A couple of Americans here and there every now and then we're dying on ships
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:43,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Every now and then it was worse than that
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the Lusitania went down
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which was a Titanic like
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:47,680	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Liner
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To a submarine torpedo
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,288	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More than a hundred Americans went down with that ship
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:54,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How long
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Any Nation put up with that
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The problem is is that the US would complain
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:27:00,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And work something out with the Germans
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tensions with drop and then a month later
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,576	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Month-and-a-half later boom it happens again
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's like a sore
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:09,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kept getting poked with a needle before it was
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:09,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Able to heal
EDL	00:27:10,720	00:27:11,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And yet
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:15,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson kept making the conditions more and more
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Impossible to fulfill so those
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:24,800	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Anti wilsonian historian to say no no you misunderstand Wilson was trying to create the conditions that the Germans couldn't help
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Violate and then get the United States into the war
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:29,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then claim it was forced upon the America
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For example Wilson at one point his administration
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:36,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which high-minded rhetoric and speeches was defending the right
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of an American passenger

EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:05,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were other complications that affected what he wanted to
EDL	00:29:06,176	00:29:08,224	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One had to do with perhaps

EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:43,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it is the economic transfer of wealth

EDL	00:44:25,983	00:44:29,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's worth noticing that in late 1916
EDL	00:44:29,055	00:44:31,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are several belligerents in this war

EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:14,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When and how the homefront is viewed
EDL	00:45:14,623	00:45:17,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The homefront of course is a shorthand word for the people back

EDL	00:52:36,991	00:52:39,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Usually just called Lloyd Georgia
EDL	00:52:39,295	00:52:40,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Feisty

EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:50,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Might be exactly what in the average dissatisfied with the way the Warriors going British to this and wanted
EDL	00:52:52,095	00:52:54,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now it is a little interesting that only a couple of weeks
EDL	00:52:54,655	00:52:56,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's before Lloyd George gets the job
EDL	00:52:57,215	00:53:01,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's recorded as having said about the Allies in Britain
EDL	00:53:01,055	00:53:02,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We lost this war
EDL	00:53:03,871	00:53:04,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now he's
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:08,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In charge of Britain's war effort it's also interesting to note that you could
EDL	00:53:08,735	00:53:15,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How how up in the air the outcome of the first world war is in 1916 where you can find leading figures on both

EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:20,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:25,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The French also get into the game 1960s been a terrible year for them to just as a

EDL	00:53:26,655	00:53:28,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they finally find the courage
EDL	00:53:29,215	00:53:32,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To get rid of their longtime military leader
EDL	00:53:32,031	00:53:33,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The legend

EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:45,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the French finally they can't fire and he's too much of a legend but they finally so
EDL	00:53:45,599	00:53:49,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kick him upstairs and promote him to a ceremony opposed to replace him

EDL	00:53:55,327	00:53:57,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Russian population in public
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:59,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which isn't really supposed to have much of a sway
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Supposedly cuz they live in a
EDL	00:54:02,239	00:54:05,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a strange sort of autocracy with a part-time legislature
EDL	00:54:05,823	00:54:09,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they're making their feelings known to more on that in a minute
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:11,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in Germany
EDL	00:54:11,711	00:54:14,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The population just wants a way out of this trap
EDL	00:54:15,039	00:54:16,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some people would like to see
EDL	00:54:16,831	00:54:18,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Efforts made towards
EDL	00:54:18,367	00:54:20,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Figuring out a way out of the War Witch
EDL	00:54:20,927	00:54:25,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They have people who say this in all the belligerent countries but you have to be careful
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:28,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little while ago we talked about Woodrow Wilson
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:32,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Suggesting that people who might oppose his policies were just loyal
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:34,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You could get you thrown in the
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:36,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Jails in a lot of these belligerent
EDL	00:54:37,055	00:54:41,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you appear to be disloyal so too much peace talk could get you in a lot of trouble
EDL	00:54:41,151	00:54:44,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless there was a body of German public opinion
EDL	00:54:44,223	00:54:45,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was pushing for another route
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:48,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They wanted their government to take the gloves off
EDL	00:54:50,111	00:54:51,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Stop playing nice
EDL	00:54:52,159	00:54:53,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the adversary
EDL	00:54:54,463	00:54:56,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They wanted their government
EDL	00:54:56,255	00:54:59,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To unleash the submarines and to heck with what the Americans would do
EDL	00:55:00,607	00:55:05,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germans the American policy look to be a very conniving way to Simply deny Germany
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:09,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The use of the submarines if you make the rules too restrictive
EDL	00:55:09,567	00:55:12,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then the Americans case the rule basically was
EDL	00:55:12,383	00:55:18,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then an American traveling on some ship gives it some magical protection simply by stepping on board you can't think that she
EDL	00:55:18,783	00:55:19,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now there's an American on it
EDL	00:55:20,319	00:55:23,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That pretty much nullifies the submarine for Germany
EDL	00:55:23,647	00:55:26,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At all but if that's the only way
EDL	00:55:26,463	00:55:30,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You see a chance to end the war with a German victory over the British
EDL	00:55:30,559	00:55:31,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What is that mean
EDL	00:55:32,095	00:55:34,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can you let the Americans hamstring you like that
EDL	00:55:36,447	00:55:40,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Add to that the fact that a lot of Germans don't really see the Americans all that neutral already
EDL	00:55:40,543	00:55:45,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And think that maybe Britain could be defeated in for 6 months before the Americans have a chance to do much of anything
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:52,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Add to that the fact that when public opinion beers in that direction
EDL	00:55:52,063	00:55:58,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are Germans in the military High command a majority of them that were already thinking that themselves now they have public opinion
EDL	00:55:58,463	00:55:59,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The submarine
EDL	00:56:01,279	00:56:02,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Americans come in the war
EDL	00:56:05,631	00:56:08,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were German leaders though that didn't like this choice
EDL	00:56:09,727	00:56:12,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wanted to find another option rather than
EDL	00:56:12,287	00:56:14,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know use the sub to get the United States into the war
EDL	00:56:16,127	00:56:17,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Chief among them was a chance
EDL	00:56:18,175	00:56:19,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany the top lid
EDL	00:56:19,455	00:56:20,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pickle guy's name was bethmann-hollweg
EDL	00:56:20,991	00:56:22,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can we discuss him before
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:27,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is all by the way very controversial very complicated very convoluted you're getting the Dan Carlin
EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:29,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Condensed
EDL	00:56:29,439	00:56:31,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Potentially unreliable version of this
EDL	00:56:31,743	00:56:34,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it's a fascinating time in the conflict because
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:37,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The politicians
EDL	00:56:37,119	00:56:40,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Blood by holding think they find a way to throw a monkey wrench
EDL	00:56:41,215	00:56:47,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Into that terrible choice that the allies of sort of voice did the Germans on with the hunger blockade and everything that they got to make a move
EDL	00:56:47,615	00:56:48,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So
EDL	00:56:48,383	00:56:49,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They make a very
EDL	00:56:49,407	00:56:50,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Unexpected
EDL	00:56:51,455	00:56:53,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	December 12th 1916
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bethmann hollweg
EDL	00:56:54,527	00:56:55,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Germans
EDL	00:56:56,319	00:56:56,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Announce
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:56:59,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That they are prepared
EDL	00:56:59,903	00:57:02,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To enter into negotiations
EDL	00:57:02,975	00:57:03,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Twin the war
EDL	00:57:06,303	00:57:08,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now it should be pointed out that such
EDL	00:57:08,863	00:57:12,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Calls for peace in discussions about peace and going on since the war started
EDL	00:57:12,959	00:57:14,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Woodrow Wilson had stepped up
EDL	00:57:14,751	00:57:16,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pretty much right at the beginning and said
EDL	00:57:16,543	00:57:18,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'll meet you at anytime you want
EDL	00:57:18,591	00:57:24,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were attempts by both sides in the war to try to make A Separate Peace with somebody else and maybe get
EDL	00:57:24,735	00:57:29,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In one of the Allies above your enemy to drop out of the war but those are peace terms
EDL	00:57:29,087	00:57:32,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just to get an edge in the conflict are not peace terms to end the war
EDL	00:57:32,415	00:57:33,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans were making the first
EDL	00:57:34,719	00:57:35,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Apparently serious
EDL	00:57:35,999	00:57:37,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Certainly public
EDL	00:57:37,279	00:57:38,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Offer
EDL	00:57:38,047	00:57:39,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To sit down
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:42,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And start talking about the issues that kept the conflict going
EDL	00:57:43,423	00:57:44,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This was
EDL	00:57:45,215	00:57:45,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Huge
EDL	00:57:45,983	00:57:46,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Shock
EDL	00:57:47,263	00:57:53,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not exactly to the Wilson Administration they've been getting some information fed through some back channels that the Germans might be ready to
EDL	00:57:53,663	00:57:57,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To do this but the Americans felt that they were going to unleash this being peace proposal
EDL	00:57:58,271	00:58:02,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the Germans do what they preempt Woodrow Wilson's version and he have to rush his out you know
EDL	00:58:02,879	00:58:04,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About a week later
EDL	00:58:04,159	00:58:10,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little bit miffed that the Germans stole his Thunder a little bit but all of a sudden in December 1916 after this horrible
EDL	00:58:10,559	00:58:11,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here
EDL	00:58:11,327	00:58:12,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were peace proposals on the table
EDL	00:58:13,375	00:58:16,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it puts everybody in a really uncomfortable position
EDL	00:58:17,471	00:58:19,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	German to taking a real chance by the way
EDL	00:58:20,031	00:58:22,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By trying this proposal route
EDL	00:58:22,079	00:58:26,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If this is a high-stakes card game and I often think of the warden in terms like that
EDL	00:58:26,431	00:58:32,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans because of the hunger block and everything else are forced to play a card and everyone thinks they're going to play that really high-risk high-reward
EDL	00:58:32,831	00:58:34,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More dangerous car they have
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:36,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The unrestricted submarine warfare card
EDL	00:58:36,927	00:58:39,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Instead they play a potentially equally
EDL	00:58:39,999	00:58:41,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Perilous card
EDL	00:58:41,279	00:58:43,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The one that no one's expecting they play the peace card
EDL	00:58:44,095	00:58:47,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The peace card can blow up in your face if you don't play it deaf
EDL	00:58:47,935	00:58:48,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Case in point
EDL	00:58:49,471	00:58:55,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are your enemies going to think when you become the first power to come forward and start talking about stopping the war
EDL	00:58:55,871	00:58:57,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're going to think you need to
EDL	00:58:58,431	00:58:59,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's more
EDL	00:58:59,455	00:59:04,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is it danger your own people might think that too and you spend a lot of effort in this War 2
EDL	00:59:04,063	00:59:06,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Stiffen their backbone and keep their resolve in place
EDL	00:59:07,135	00:59:10,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How much are you going to undercut it if you become the first power to seek
EDL	00:59:10,207	00:59:10,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Peace
EDL	00:59:11,999	00:59:14,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So this whole thing has to be worded very careful
EDL	00:59:15,071	00:59:16,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it is but almost
EDL	00:59:17,119	00:59:18,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In such a way to give your
EDL	00:59:19,679	00:59:23,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To give you whiplash as you're moving your neck between
EDL	00:59:23,263	00:59:27,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The humanitarian side of the German Chancellor's proposals
EDL	00:59:27,615	00:59:30,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the side is filled with overwhelming hubris
EDL	00:59:31,455	00:59:34,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans talk about what this war is doing the civilization
EDL	00:59:35,039	00:59:41,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And how they be willing to get into conversations about ending it but they're still invincible and they're going to win the war and they don't need to do this
EDL	00:59:42,207	00:59:45,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what would the terms be on the other side maybe you could say that
EDL	00:59:45,535	00:59:46,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Allies
EDL	00:59:47,839	00:59:49,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Historians have argued about
EDL	00:59:49,375	00:59:50,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The motives behind this
EDL	00:59:50,911	00:59:54,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ever since but the truth of the matter is if you look at this like a card game
EDL	00:59:54,495	00:59:58,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were some good reasons for the Germans to play that piece card
EDL	00:59:58,335	01:00:00,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Whether or not it was realistic
EDL	01:00:00,383	01:00:02,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And whether or not the other side except
EDL	01:00:03,711	01:00:05,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And some historians say this was
EDL	01:00:05,247	01:00:07,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What it was intended to do the whole time
EDL	01:00:07,551	01:00:09,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Provide some diplomatic cover
EDL	01:00:10,111	01:00:12,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the start of the unleashing of the submarine
EDL	01:00:12,927	01:00:15,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To go and say hey we'll talk about peace
EDL	01:00:15,999	01:00:18,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then when it's rejected be able to turn around
EDL	01:00:18,559	01:00:20,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To your own people
EDL	01:00:20,095	01:00:26,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And say you know you better give up those hopes of an easy piece we just tried they won't do it this is a fight to the end stiffen yourself
EDL	01:00:27,007	01:00:33,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And also to show the world including the neutrals and including the people on the other side of the wards population that we're not the ones
EDL	01:00:33,407	01:00:34,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Keeping this Carnage going
EDL	01:00:34,943	01:00:37,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We could have been over but your side wants to keep fighting
EDL	01:00:38,783	01:00:40,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Most especially
EDL	01:00:40,575	01:00:42,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is an attempt to maybe
EDL	01:00:42,623	01:00:47,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Influence public opinion in the neutral countries especially the most important neutral country the United States
EDL	01:00:48,255	01:00:51,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which has so many german-americans in it
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:55,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That they were more than 520 German language newspapers as we said
EDL	01:00:55,935	01:00:58,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What do you think the editorials are going to be
EDL	01:00:58,239	01:00:59,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In those newspapers
EDL	01:00:59,775	01:01:03,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After Germany makes a peace proposal and the Allies SWAT it down
EDL	01:01:04,895	01:01:06,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's going to put some pressure
EDL	01:01:06,431	01:01:12,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the US government to stay out of the war and that's going to influence American public opinion over who the bad guys and who the good guys are
EDL	01:01:12,831	01:01:15,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That may have been the overriding intention
EDL	01:01:15,135	01:01:17,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Others German peace efforts but nobody knows
EDL	01:01:17,951	01:01:18,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It may have been
EDL	01:01:18,975	01:01:19,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A
EDL	01:01:19,743	01:01:23,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Serious attempt to at least start negotiations going
EDL	01:01:23,583	01:01:29,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And to take a position that didn't make you seem too vulnerable at the outset the Germans pick the right time to do it it was right after
EDL	01:01:29,983	01:01:33,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The capital of Romania fell to the central powers are there
EDL	01:01:33,055	01:01:35,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Negotiating from a position of strength here
EDL	01:01:35,615	01:01:37,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Allies SWAT it down
EDL	01:01:38,687	01:01:39,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They have to
EDL	01:01:41,759	01:01:47,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The problem with asking these powers to State publicly what their War aims are in order to create a piece
EDL	01:01:48,671	01:01:52,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Used to show that the war aims of these Powers have gotten so out of hand
EDL	01:01:52,767	01:01:55,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That they bear no resemblance to anything that could be negotiate

EDL	01:02:06,591	01:02:10,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To their dismay was it at the means used to fight the war total
EDL	01:02:10,943	01:02:11,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so must be the end
EDL	01:02:12,735	01:02:16,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was almost impossible to stop short of total victory for one side
EDL	01:02:16,575	01:02:18,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And unconditional surrender for the other

EDL	01:02:31,423	01:02:33,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was a nineteenth-century sort of Warrant
EDL	01:02:33,983	01:02:35,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It sounded out of place
EDL	01:02:35,519	01:02:39,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the twentieth century of the British or the French or the Germans or anyone
EDL	01:02:39,615	01:02:42,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Had said that their War aims involved a little change of territory
EDL	01:02:42,943	01:02:46,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little reparations money or what have you it would have seemed so out of

EDL	01:02:48,831	01:02:50,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There would be real Danger
EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:55,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the public would think that's what the country was fighting for wasn't worth what the public was paying for

EDL	01:02:59,839	01:03:02,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were some craving territorial

EDL	01:03:11,103	01:03:12,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For example
EDL	01:03:12,383	01:03:13,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Italians were promised
EDL	01:03:14,175	01:03:17,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Territory from the austro-hungarian Empire once the war was over
EDL	01:03:18,527	01:03:21,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British couldn't very well say that was a Warframe
EDL	01:03:21,343	01:03:22,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And still not look like
EDL	01:03:22,623	01:03:23,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cynical
EDL	01:03:23,647	01:03:26,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Games been in this war when everyone by the way

EDL	01:03:27,999	01:03:31,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is a cynical games with but you can't show that to the public what's more
EDL	01:03:31,583	01:03:36,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The idea of War aims that stopped short of defeating the enemy unconditionally
EDL	01:03:37,727	01:03:39,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Clash with your propaganda
EDL	01:03:40,543	01:03:43,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is a war that using such 20th century ideas
EDL	01:03:44,127	01:03:46,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As a war to end all wars
EDL	01:03:48,223	01:03:51,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And a war to make the world safe for democracy
EDL	01:03:52,319	01:03:56,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's not a war to acquire a few colonies on the Mediterranean and some oil in the Middle East
EDL	01:03:56,415	01:03:57,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Based on the breakup of

EDL	01:03:59,487	01:04:05,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a war for these high-minded ideals the problem is is if your propaganda portrays the Germans as the second coming of the month
EDL	01:04:05,887	01:04:06,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ingles
EDL	01:04:06,911	01:04:09,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Well actually the Huns is the word the propaganda use
EDL	01:04:09,727	01:04:11,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And their baby killers
EDL	01:04:11,007	01:04:12,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And nurse
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:16,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Executioners and none rappers and all the things that propaganda makes them out to be
EDL	01:04:16,639	01:04:19,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How can you possibly sit down and sign a piece of paper to compromise
EDL	01:04:19,967	01:04:20,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's what them and have peace again
EDL	01:04:22,783	01:04:23,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the Vatican
EDL	01:04:24,319	01:04:26,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was I at this time trying to
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:28,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Help create the conditions were peace could happen
EDL	01:04:28,927	01:04:33,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Vatican kept telling the powers to live up to those pre-war agreements to make war
EDL	01:04:33,791	01:04:34,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Less horrible
EDL	01:04:35,327	01:04:38,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they were saying that they were favoring this not because
EDL	01:04:38,911	01:04:39,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were
EDL	01:04:39,935	01:04:40,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Idealistic
EDL	01:04:40,959	01:04:41,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because
EDL	01:04:41,727	01:04:44,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If these powers kept doing everything in there
EDL	01:04:44,799	01:04:51,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Edomite to destroy one another they were going to hate each other so much that there was going to be no space Andres mutual respect left
EDL	01:04:51,199	01:04:52,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To carve out a piece lighter
EDL	01:04:54,015	01:04:55,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans were no happier by the way
EDL	01:04:56,319	01:04:57,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Estate their warframes Pub
EDL	01:04:57,855	01:04:59,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the exact same reason
EDL	01:05:01,695	01:05:03,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There was an implied threat in
EDL	01:05:03,231	01:05:06,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Included when the Germans came forward with this attempt
EDL	01:05:06,047	01:05:07,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To get negotiations started
EDL	01:05:08,095	01:05:09,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An implied threat was
EDL	01:05:09,631	01:05:12,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If negotiations didn't happen in Warren fruitful
EDL	01:05:12,703	01:05:15,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They would play the unrestricted submarine warfare
EDL	01:05:17,311	01:05:18,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The peace negotiations
EDL	01:05:18,847	01:05:21,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are over by the end of January
EDL	01:05:21,151	01:05:21,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Weary
EDL	01:05:22,175	01:05:24,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the middle of January actually on January 20th
EDL	01:05:24,735	01:05:26,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson makes a famous speech
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:27,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A vase
EDL	01:05:27,807	01:05:30,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Speech where he calls for peace without victory
EDL	01:05:32,927	01:05:35,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And your so-called peace without victory speech
EDL	01:05:36,511	01:05:39,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the 22nd of January when essentially he already knew
EDL	01:05:39,839	01:05:42,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It wasn't going to happen Wilson lays down the kind of P
EDL	01:05:42,911	01:05:45,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Peace that Europe will have to broker to end the first World War
EDL	01:05:45,727	01:05:47,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If it's to be a lasting
EDL	01:05:47,519	01:05:49,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can't be one of those pieces
EDL	01:05:49,055	01:05:52,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know where the knife is turned in one side is left hating the other
EDL	01:05:52,895	01:05:58,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When you think about how the first world war ended and how it's sold the seeds for the Second World War
EDL	01:05:58,783	01:06:00,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson sounds like Nostradamus with some
EDL	01:06:02,111	01:06:05,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this part of the speech where he talks about you know having to have this
EDL	01:06:05,183	01:06:06,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kind of peace
EDL	01:06:06,207	01:06:06,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He says quote
EDL	01:06:07,743	01:06:09,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm speaking only to face reality
EDL	01:06:09,791	01:06:12,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Add to FaceTime without soft concealment
EDL	01:06:12,607	01:06:15,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser
EDL	01:06:15,679	01:06:19,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A Victor's terms imposed upon the vanquished
EDL	01:06:19,007	01:06:21,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It would be accepted in humiliation
EDL	01:06:21,055	01:06:22,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Under duress
EDL	01:06:22,079	01:06:24,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Add an intolerable sacrifice
EDL	01:06:24,383	01:06:25,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And would leave a sting
EDL	01:06:25,663	01:06:26,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A resentment
EDL	01:06:26,687	01:06:29,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A bitter memory upon which terms of Peace would rest
EDL	01:06:29,759	01:06:32,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not permanently but only as upon quicksand
EDL	01:06:32,831	01:06:35,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Only a peace between equals can last
EDL	01:06:35,647	01:06:38,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Only a piece the very principle of witches equality
EDL	01:06:38,719	01:06:41,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And a common participation in a common benefit
EDL	01:06:41,535	01:06:45,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The right State of Mind the right feeling between nations
EDL	01:06:45,119	01:06:47,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is as necessary for a lasting peace
EDL	01:06:47,423	01:06:50,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As is a just settlement of vexed questions of territory
EDL	01:06:50,751	01:06:52,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	National Allegiance
EDL	01:06:54,079	01:06:54,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	01:06:55,615	01:06:57,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So you not only calling
EDL	01:06:57,151	01:06:57,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Peace
EDL	01:06:58,431	01:07:02,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where nobody can claim a victory we just stop fighting
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:04,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And begin negotiating
EDL	01:07:04,831	01:07:06,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For a postwar world
EDL	01:07:06,879	01:07:09,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In which Wilson and envisions
EDL	01:07:09,183	01:07:12,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A new international Global structure
EDL	01:07:12,767	01:07:13,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To enforce
EDL	01:07:14,559	01:07:16,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Global Peace and harmony
EDL	01:07:16,351	01:07:20,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So that we never have a first world war again as I said for those historians who suggested
EDL	01:07:20,959	01:07:21,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson
EDL	01:07:21,983	01:07:25,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is out to make Wilson the biggest historical figure he can
EDL	01:07:25,567	01:07:26,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That would be a heck of a leg
EDL	01:07:26,847	01:07:27,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I can see if he can pull that
EDL	01:07:30,431	01:07:31,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But instead
EDL	01:07:31,711	01:07:32,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Within a couple of months
EDL	01:07:33,503	01:07:35,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States will be in the war
EDL	01:07:36,319	01:07:38,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And from the Allied perspective
EDL	01:07:38,879	01:07:40,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not a moment too soon
EDL	01:07:42,207	01:07:43,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The end of 1916
EDL	01:07:44,255	01:07:45,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Early 1970
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:47,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We've been spending quite a bit of time
EDL	01:07:47,839	01:07:48,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Setting
EDL	01:07:48,607	01:07:49,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This.
EDL	01:07:49,887	01:07:51,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the war up
EDL	01:07:51,167	01:07:55,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But this. In the war is probably the most important 6 months in the last
EDL	01:07:55,519	01:07:56,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hundred years
EDL	01:07:58,335	01:08:01,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People talk about the first world war this transformative moment
EDL	01:08:01,407	01:08:03,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the after effects that we're living with
EDL	01:08:03,967	01:08:05,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	No even now all around us
EDL	01:08:06,271	01:08:09,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the most transformative moment in that conflict
EDL	01:08:09,343	01:08:10,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's about to happen now
EDL	01:08:11,903	01:08:12,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	01:08:12,671	01:08:13,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know
EDL	01:08:13,439	01:08:17,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I can't help it find some sort of metaphor analogy approach to looking at it but I mean it
EDL	01:08:17,279	01:08:18,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's like we have this tree
EDL	01:08:18,815	01:08:20,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they've been shopping at it
EDL	01:08:20,095	01:08:21,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For two years and at the end of 1960
EDL	01:08:22,911	01:08:23,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Falls over
EDL	01:08:23,935	01:08:27,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Winston Churchill says three ingredients acting together
EDL	01:08:27,519	01:08:29,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Create what he calls the second climax
EDL	01:08:30,335	01:08:30,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the war
EDL	01:08:31,615	01:08:32,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the spirit

EDL	01:11:25,695	01:11:27,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In Austria-Hungary is worse than done
EDL	01:11:30,815	01:11:36,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This new emperor during this coming year will go behind the Germans back to the Allies reportedly
EDL	01:11:36,959	01:11:39,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And try to sew to sell them out
EDL	01:11:39,519	01:11:43,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Germans find out about it and then they never going to take their eyes off Austria-Hungary gain all the sudden

EDL	01:11:47,455	01:11:49,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was very interesting move that a lot of pee
EDL	01:11:49,503	01:11:50,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People talked about
EDL	01:11:50,271	01:11:56,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's almost like World War version of Rudolph Hess flying to Great Britain you know to make A Separate Peace for
EDL	01:11:56,415	01:12:00,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nazi Germany in the second world war just this weird little Endeavor and all it does is
EDL	01:12:00,767	01:12:03,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Learn Austria-Hungary Germany's mistrust
EDL	01:12:04,607	01:12:05,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then you have

EDL	01:12:09,471	01:12:11,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are the Russians from the very start of this
EDL	01:12:11,519	01:12:13,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This war even before this war for a very long time
EDL	01:12:14,335	01:12:16,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Have been this contradiction in power
EDL	01:12:17,663	01:12:20,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In one sense they are massively
EDL	01:12:20,223	01:12:23,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Powerful in a military sense theoretically they are terrifying
EDL	01:12:25,087	01:12:27,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And yet they are at the same time
EDL	01:12:27,391	01:12:30,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So fatally flawed in the underpinning
EDL	01:12:30,975	01:12:37,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Anything Rush is doing in this world he seems to be like riding some real or we're walking a tightrope and and Design

EDL	01:12:40,959	01:12:41,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So the situation
EDL	01:12:42,495	01:12:44,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a story that sort of shows this
EDL	01:12:44,543	01:12:46,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This contradiction in terms

EDL	01:14:58,687	01:15:05,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I can a bomber throws a bomb it sounds a little like the whole Sarajevo thing the kicked out the first World War II bomber throws a bomb to bomb
EDL	01:15:05,087	01:15:07,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Goes off kills people who are not the target
EDL	01:15:07,391	01:15:10,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The target comes out in this case is our comes out to look around
EDL	01:15:10,719	01:15:12,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there's another bomber in the crowd
EDL	01:15:12,767	01:15:16,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Supposedly the Tsar at the time it said something about enough thank God
EDL	01:15:16,607	01:15:21,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But nothing happened in the other assassin that he's throwing the bomb and I'm saying it's a little too early to thank God
EDL	01:15:22,239	01:15:23,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Boom
EDL	01:15:23,519	01:15:25,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Any bleeds out in the Royal Palace floor
EDL	01:15:26,335	01:15:30,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	While the Czar who will be commanding Russia as the autocrat
EDL	01:15:30,175	01:15:31,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the first World War
EDL	01:15:31,967	01:15:37,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As a 13 or 14 year old boy watches he knows how dangerous the job is
EDL	01:15:38,111	01:15:39,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He knows that there's
EDL	01:15:39,903	01:15:40,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A violin
EDL	01:15:40,927	01:15:41,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Current
EDL	01:15:41,951	01:15:42,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rottenness
EDL	01:15:43,487	01:15:45,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That opposes his sister
EDL	01:15:45,023	01:15:46,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's dealing with it all the time
EDL	01:15:48,863	01:15:53,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the things that makes this story so interesting that was when you're dealing with one person
EDL	01:15:53,727	01:15:54,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With almost
EDL	01:15:54,751	01:15:55,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Total power
EDL	01:15:55,775	01:15:57,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As we said earlier
EDL	01:15:57,567	01:15:59,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Their little idiosyncrasies
EDL	01:16:00,895	01:16:02,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Make a big impact on history
EDL	01:16:03,711	01:16:05,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the case of Nicholas II
EDL	01:16:06,015	01:16:08,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The autocrat of all the Russians right
EDL	01:16:08,831	01:16:10,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	His idiosyncrasies involve
EDL	01:16:11,647	01:16:12,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some things that
EDL	01:16:12,927	01:16:14,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I think most
EDL	01:16:14,207	01:16:18,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People out there who have children can at least relate to a little bit of
EDL	01:16:20,607	01:16:21,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's interesting that there's a
EDL	01:16:22,143	01:16:22,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Judas story
EDL	01:16:23,935	01:16:25,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The chest has a
EDL	01:16:25,471	01:16:26,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Personal
EDL	01:16:26,239	01:16:26,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tragedy
EDL	01:16:27,263	01:16:28,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wrapped up in it
EDL	01:16:28,543	01:16:30,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is an example why you
EDL	01:16:30,079	01:16:31,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can't reduce history
EDL	01:16:31,871	01:16:32,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	2
EDL	01:16:32,639	01:16:33,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some sort of mathematics
EDL	01:16:34,687	01:16:35,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or some sort of
EDL	01:16:35,455	01:16:38,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Predictable set of rules are there human beings involved
EDL	01:16:39,807	01:16:41,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the case of the Tsar
EDL	01:16:41,855	01:16:43,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a fascinating story
EDL	01:16:43,391	01:16:44,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Play The Man
EDL	01:16:44,159	01:16:48,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just so you know I mean this is how you were wise this is the Old Europe is being destroyed
EDL	01:16:48,255	01:16:50,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's the first or second cousin with everybody
EDL	01:16:52,351	01:16:58,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's the first cousin with the King of England he's the second cousin with the Emperor of Germany I mean he's related to every
EDL	01:16:58,751	01:16:59,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Everybody and his wife
EDL	01:17:00,287	01:17:01,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is the first cousin
EDL	01:17:01,823	01:17:03,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the king of England I mean
EDL	01:17:04,383	01:17:05,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little incestuous Maybe
EDL	01:17:07,199	01:17:08,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But that explains why
EDL	01:17:08,991	01:17:10,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The czar
EDL	01:17:10,527	01:17:12,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And his wife mourn her in a second
EDL	01:17:13,087	01:17:14,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who only have one son
EDL	01:17:15,135	01:17:16,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Give birth to a son
EDL	01:17:16,927	01:17:17,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who's a hemophiliac
EDL	01:17:20,255	01:17:21,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It runs in the family
EDL	01:17:21,279	01:17:27,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Queen Victoria who sort of the the the descended that all these people can trace their Heritage back you said that this did not run
EDL	01:17:27,679	01:17:28,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And her family
EDL	01:17:28,959	01:17:29,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it seemed to
EDL	01:17:31,007	01:17:33,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Victoria of course was German in her roots
EDL	01:17:34,335	01:17:35,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So was the czar's wife is Irina
EDL	01:17:37,407	01:17:37,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Alexandra
EDL	01:17:39,199	01:17:40,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Both of them
EDL	01:17:40,735	01:17:41,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lovage
EDL	01:17:42,271	01:17:45,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I say this because you know you would think today would of course they did
EDL	01:17:45,599	01:17:48,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Listen this is an era where especially amongst nobility
EDL	01:17:48,671	01:17:55,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You often had three political marriages you also have these very old-fashioned things that were very common back then with a husband and wife really didn't love me
EDL	01:17:55,071	01:17:56,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Each other the husband was out
EDL	01:17:56,095	01:17:58,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know with all the girls all it wasn't like that
EDL	01:17:58,911	01:18:01,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With Nicholas and Alexandra this is what this was a lobster
EDL	01:18:01,471	01:18:01,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Really why
EDL	01:18:02,495	01:18:04,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And not just between the two of them
EDL	01:18:04,543	01:18:05,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But with their children too
EDL	01:18:06,079	01:18:08,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They love their children the way we think of
EDL	01:18:08,895	01:18:11,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Every modern person loving their children all the way they should
EDL	01:18:12,223	01:18:14,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that is not to say that people in the past didn't
EDL	01:18:14,783	01:18:20,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Although you find a lot of examples in the royal family throughout history with the father hardly sees the Sunday. It's not like that with
EDL	01:18:21,951	01:18:24,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They take an active day today roll
EDL	01:18:24,767	01:18:27,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In their parenting and they wrote letters to each other
EDL	01:18:27,583	01:18:28,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Constantly Road in English
EDL	01:18:30,399	01:18:32,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they both spoke well
EDL	01:18:32,191	01:18:34,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The tsarina was German but but
EDL	01:18:34,495	01:18:37,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	She spoke Russian she spoke English the Czar spoke everything
EDL	01:18:37,567	01:18:41,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they communicated in more than a thousand letters with each other will you get a real feel for the
EDL	01:18:42,687	01:18:43,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm one of the things
EDL	01:18:43,967	01:18:45,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They are absolutely terrified
EDL	01:18:46,527	01:18:48,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is there Sun who's got haemophilia
EDL	01:18:49,855	01:18:51,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's their only son he's the next
EDL	01:18:51,903	01:18:52,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Zar
EDL	01:18:52,927	01:18:56,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he is almost certainly going to die young from this
EDL	01:18:57,791	01:19:00,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I just so you know haemophilia is a disease where your blood.
EDL	01:19:01,375	01:19:03,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not to get too technical cuz I couldn't explain it anyway
EDL	01:19:03,935	01:19:05,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But but basically
EDL	01:19:05,983	01:19:10,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Any little cut or bruise has the potential to spiral out of control
EDL	01:19:10,591	01:19:11,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The normal
EDL	01:19:11,615	01:19:14,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a rough-and-tumble of a of a young child's life
EDL	01:19:14,943	01:19:15,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will kill you
EDL	01:19:16,991	01:19:19,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in this era especially
EDL	01:19:19,551	01:19:21,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Parents just assumed almost Adesa
EDL	01:19:22,111	01:19:23,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And these two
EDL	01:19:23,135	01:19:25,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Parents as any parent we would think of today probably
EDL	01:19:25,951	01:19:26,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Could hardly handle
EDL	01:19:26,975	01:19:27,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I thought
EDL	01:19:28,511	01:19:31,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they were looking around for cures and trying to find them
EDL	01:19:31,071	01:19:33,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And eventually they found someone
EDL	01:19:33,631	01:19:34,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who seem to be able to
EDL	01:19:35,167	01:19:35,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fix their son
EDL	01:19:36,959	01:19:41,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And because of the little idiosyncrasy connected to who this person tended to be
EDL	01:19:42,847	01:19:44,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	World history completely halt
EDL	01:19:47,199	01:19:49,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in the funny part about it is and I know it
EDL	01:19:49,503	01:19:53,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If it is a tragic story that it's an interesting story to bring human story
EDL	01:19:53,343	01:19:55,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But there are elements to it that would make a good
EDL	01:19:56,159	01:19:57,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a sitcom
EDL	01:19:57,695	01:19:59,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or a good movie premise
EDL	01:19:59,231	01:20:00,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As I walked
EDL	01:20:00,255	01:20:03,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	2 in to talk about this today I remember the movie that was kind of based on the premise
EDL	01:20:04,095	01:20:07,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nick Nolte and Eddie was called Down and Out in Beverly Hills
EDL	01:20:07,423	01:20:12,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the story is about a vagrant kind of homeless kind of guy who by hooker by crook ends up
EDL	01:20:12,543	01:20:15,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know he's living with a rich family in Beverly Hills
EDL	01:20:15,616	01:20:17,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Really fabulously Rich family
EDL	01:20:17,408	01:20:22,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And of course because of the dichotomy and their lifestyles in the way they view the world hilarity ensues right
EDL	01:20:23,296	01:20:24,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's kind of what happened
EDL	01:20:24,832	01:20:25,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What does r
EDL	01:20:25,600	01:20:27,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And his wife and their hemophiliac son
EDL	01:20:28,416	01:20:31,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When they found somebody who seem to be able to heal him
EDL	01:20:31,232	01:20:34,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That somebody was basically the equivalent of the vagrant
EDL	01:20:34,816	01:20:36,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In Down and Out in Beverly Hills
EDL	01:20:37,632	01:20:38,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were bringing
EDL	01:20:39,168	01:20:39,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A peasant
EDL	01:20:40,448	01:20:40,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In
EDL	01:20:41,472	01:20:43,264	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To have a look at their six son
EDL	01:20:44,800	01:20:46,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hasn't name is Gregorio
EDL	01:20:47,872	01:20:53,504	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And history has always been I mean he's a hardcore history personality if you've ever found one
EDL	01:20:55,808	01:20:56,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the fact
EDL	01:20:56,832	01:20:58,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That this government was run
EDL	01:20:59,136	01:21:02,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	99% by one guy and his wife
EDL	01:21:02,976	01:21:04,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Opens up the door
EDL	01:21:05,024	01:21:08,352	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tua Grigori Rasputin being able to have the effect on his
EDL	01:21:11,424	01:21:13,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Historian Peter Hart does a good job of

EDL	01:24:21,632	01:24:22,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A1905
EDL	01:24:23,936	01:24:24,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About 10 years
EDL	01:24:25,728	01:24:26,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Time.
EDL	01:24:26,496	01:24:27,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We are in the story
EDL	01:24:27,776	01:24:30,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there's an entry by the Czar and his diary we met a man of God today
EDL	01:24:32,640	01:24:34,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so starts this relationship
EDL	01:24:34,432	01:24:34,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Between
EDL	01:24:35,712	01:24:39,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This person who was born a poor peasant in Siberia
EDL	01:24:39,808	01:24:41,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An uneducated everything
EDL	01:24:42,112	01:24:43,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And his relationship
EDL	01:24:43,648	01:24:46,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With two of the most Royal figures in the world
EDL	01:24:46,208	01:24:52,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean the king and queen of England that's the level were talking about with the tsar and tsarina imagine today's queen of
EDL	01:24:52,608	01:24:55,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	No power at all picking up some
EDL	01:24:55,168	01:25:01,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Person off the street who's almost homeless and not even the London homeless person someone from the sticks up in the north of England somewhere some
EDL	01:25:01,568	01:25:03,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Small town bringing them in the palace
EDL	01:25:03,872	01:25:06,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And having them live with you for a while instead of questioning them
EDL	01:25:07,200	01:25:07,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the state of things
EDL	01:25:08,480	01:25:09,504	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are the people saying
EDL	01:25:10,016	01:25:13,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And oh yeah letting the minister medicinally to your child
EDL	01:25:15,392	01:25:16,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a crazy story
EDL	01:25:16,672	01:25:20,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the only reason Rasputin becomes important you can hardly imagine important
EDL	01:25:20,768	01:25:22,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In most of the other systems of government
EDL	01:25:22,816	01:25:25,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because Russia is so autocratic
EDL	01:25:25,120	01:25:26,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you capture the czar
EDL	01:25:27,424	01:25:28,448	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You capture the country
EDL	01:25:29,472	01:25:32,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin made the Royal Family
EDL	01:25:33,056	01:25:34,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Emotional hostages
EDL	01:25:36,896	01:25:40,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Whether that was intentional or otherwise is debatable historians disagree
EDL	01:25:41,760	01:25:43,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's some historians who think this is a person who stalks
EDL	01:25:43,808	01:25:44,576	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was a blast
EDL	01:25:44,576	01:25:47,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Man of God with the special powers to do
EDL	01:25:47,648	01:25:52,000	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know religious oriented things that other say he's a charlatan and he knew he had
EDL	01:25:52,000	01:25:57,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The royal couple sort of emotionally blackmail but there was nothing anyone can do about it there's a great quote from the Tsar
EDL	01:25:58,656	01:26:00,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You're in the middle of the story with Rasputin wear
EDL	01:26:00,960	01:26:03,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of his advisors says something to the effect that you got to get rid of this guy
EDL	01:26:04,544	01:26:06,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the answer is there's nothing I can do about
EDL	01:26:08,128	01:26:10,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And a lot of historians have always interpreted that
EDL	01:26:10,432	01:26:13,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To mean that the Tsar is basically saying he can't stand up to his wife
EDL	01:26:14,528	01:26:17,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know that she wants him and there's nothing that the zarkin do you won't stand up to his wife
EDL	01:26:18,368	01:26:23,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you know some historians have come out recently and said you know it could easily mean there's nothing he can do about it
EDL	01:26:24,000	01:26:27,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because there's only one person who can save their son's life the heir to the throne by the
EDL	01:26:28,608	01:26:29,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you really believe that
EDL	01:26:30,400	01:26:32,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Disputing God got you in a weird position
EDL	01:26:33,984	01:26:36,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Between 1905 when the song Rasputin first meet
EDL	01:26:37,312	01:26:39,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And where we are in the story right now
EDL	01:26:39,616	01:26:40,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Late 19c
EDL	01:26:40,640	01:26:41,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	16
EDL	01:26:41,408	01:26:45,504	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin has been worming his way into the czar's family
EDL	01:26:46,016	01:26:46,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pretty consistent
EDL	01:26:47,808	01:26:51,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not a circle of friends his family does Ry these get together sometimes we would
EDL	01:26:51,648	01:26:53,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	His wife
EDL	01:26:53,184	01:26:54,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And his kids and Rasputin
EDL	01:26:55,744	01:26:57,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now there are back step
EDL	01:26:57,536	01:27:03,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sometimes the relationship goes sour for a while usually cuz Rasputin who is a Serial misbehavior
EDL	01:27:03,168	01:27:04,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Does something particularly outrageous
EDL	01:27:05,472	01:27:07,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Either embarrassing is are so much that
EDL	01:27:07,776	01:27:11,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That that he does with his underlings are continually telling him to do and
EDL	01:27:11,616	01:27:13,152	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And sends Rasputin away
EDL	01:27:13,152	01:27:15,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or legitimately upsetting him
EDL	01:27:15,456	01:27:18,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless everytime he manages to break the relay break up
EDL	01:27:18,784	01:27:20,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I guess you could say with Rasputin
EDL	01:27:20,576	01:27:23,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Inevitably Alexi his son the heir to the throne
EDL	01:27:23,904	01:27:24,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will get sick again
EDL	01:27:24,928	01:27:27,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Necessitating a return

EDL	01:41:38,944	01:41:42,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If the tsar of Russia was in the process of
EDL	01:41:42,016	01:41:44,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kicking his Rasputin habit he fell off the wagon
EDL	01:41:44,832	01:41:46,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After that 1912
EDL	01:41:46,624	01:41:48,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pull your son back from the brink of death
EDL	01:41:50,976	01:41:51,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here's the thing
EDL	01:41:53,024	01:41:54,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin
EDL	01:41:54,560	01:41:55,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wasn't the problem
EDL	01:41:56,096	01:41:57,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because he kept feeling
EDL	01:41:57,888	01:41:58,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Heirs
EDL	01:41:58,656	01:42:00,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If he had stuck to that
EDL	01:42:00,960	01:42:02,752	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Probably we don't even
EDL	01:42:02,752	01:42:03,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Talk about him very
EDL	01:42:04,288	01:42:10,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of course the reason we do talk about in the reasons a famous figure the reason half of Russia wants him dead is because he's not stick
EDL	01:42:10,688	01:42:12,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fixing the air he's meddling in Polish
EDL	01:42:15,040	01:42:17,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a funny way to I can see how that have
EDL	01:42:17,856	01:42:21,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm not so appalled I mean if you if you if you look at this from the tsar and tsarina is bandage
EDL	01:42:22,720	01:42:24,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you think this guy has some
EDL	01:42:25,024	01:42:29,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Does Ariana think he's a man of God and that God favors him and only
EDL	01:42:29,120	01:42:29,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Prophetic
EDL	01:42:29,888	01:42:33,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And if you'd seen what she's seen when you think so maybe two and if you thought that
EDL	01:42:34,496	01:42:37,056	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wouldn't you want to use this guy like a Magic 8 Ball
EDL	01:42:38,848	01:42:45,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Especially with the stakes as high as they are for the Czar at this time I mean when the first world war breaks out when the Romanov
EDL	01:42:45,248	01:42:46,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Dynasty is threatened
EDL	01:42:46,272	01:42:49,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When millions of lives hinge on the decision is our makes
EDL	01:42:49,856	01:42:51,392	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How tempting would it be
EDL	01:42:51,392	01:42:52,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now to just sort of
EDL	01:42:53,440	01:42:54,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin what he thought about
EDL	01:42:55,744	01:42:57,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Appointment through that idea
EDL	01:42:57,792	01:43:00,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Should I go to the front end command from the Frontline source
EDL	01:43:02,912	01:43:04,448	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that's the event by the way
EDL	01:43:04,448	01:43:05,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Tsar going to commanded
EDL	01:43:05,984	01:43:06,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The frontlines
EDL	01:43:07,008	01:43:09,312	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which opens up the door to turbocharge
EDL	01:43:09,824	01:43:11,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin's influence
EDL	01:43:11,360	01:43:17,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And really ushering Russia into the terminal phase of the end of the Romanov Dynasty cuz what happens is
EDL	01:43:17,760	01:43:19,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	End of the terrible losses against the
EDL	01:43:19,808	01:43:21,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Central powers that the Russians had suffered
EDL	01:43:22,368	01:43:23,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bizarre thought
EDL	01:43:23,904	01:43:25,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The people might need a scapegoat and he
EDL	01:43:26,208	01:43:32,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Altruistically offered himself up as a sacrificial lamb you think he's going to go to the front his advisers think this is a tear
EDL	01:43:32,608	01:43:34,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terrible idea with lots of downsides
EDL	01:43:34,400	01:43:35,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But Rasputin likes the ID
EDL	01:43:36,448	01:43:37,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Therefore by the way those are real
EDL	01:43:38,240	01:43:41,824	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The idea that one points desires wavering and think maybe he shouldn't do in Rasputin
EDL	01:43:41,824	01:43:44,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a bolster his confidence that it's a good idea
EDL	01:43:44,384	01:43:47,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cancel the Tsar leaves the capital and goes to kind of clothes
EDL	01:43:47,712	01:43:48,224	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Frontline
EDL	01:43:48,736	01:43:55,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A little something is Irene is left in charge of the day-to-day activities and she is using Rasputin like a match
EDL	01:43:55,136	01:43:56,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	She gave ball like you wouldn't believe
EDL	01:43:58,720	01:44:01,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can read it in the letters back and forth between the Czar and his wife
EDL	01:44:02,304	01:44:05,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because she'll inform him what's going on she calls Rasputin our friend
EDL	01:44:06,144	01:44:06,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Code name
EDL	01:44:06,912	01:44:12,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And she'll say to those are our friend thinks we should do this our friend doesn't like that legislator
EDL	01:44:12,032	01:44:14,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Heartburn things that appointment job to go to this person
EDL	01:44:14,848	01:44:16,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Until debated back and forth and
EDL	01:44:16,384	01:44:17,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rasputin is
EDL	01:44:17,920	01:44:24,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Making huge decisions for Russia's future in Wartime when things are deteriorating bad
EDL	01:44:24,320	01:44:26,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Italian bread riots are happening in

EDL	01:44:36,352	01:44:38,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Don't think the belligerent powers
EDL	01:44:38,400	01:44:43,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the other countries aren't aware of it either the British secret service is monitoring according to
EDL	01:44:43,008	01:44:45,056	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A story like Joseph Furman
EDL	01:44:45,056	01:44:46,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is monitoring
EDL	01:44:46,080	01:44:46,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rescue

EDL	01:44:50,432	01:44:51,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	01:44:51,200	01:44:55,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Many things about Rasputin trouble than they're not sure he's not a German agent
EDL	01:44:55,040	01:44:57,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They think he's unstable certainly
EDL	01:44:57,088	01:44:58,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They think he is
EDL	01:44:58,880	01:45:03,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In favor of some sort of peace deal to get Russia out of the war the whole lot of reasons they don't kind of like him
EDL	01:45:04,512	01:45:06,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But this problem is becoming acute
EDL	01:45:07,072	01:45:07,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	01:45:08,352	01:45:09,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some noblemen apparently

EDL	01:45:19,104	01:45:20,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When we reach this point

EDL	01:53:54,688	01:53:58,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Generous financial support and understanding on our part
EDL	01:53:58,272	01:54:03,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That Mexico is to reconquer the Lost territory in Texas New Mexico and Arizona
EDL	01:54:04,416	01:54:06,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The settlement in detail is left to you
EDL	01:54:06,720	01:54:09,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You will inform the president of the above
EDL	01:54:09,024	01:54:13,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain
EDL	01:54:13,888	01:54:17,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And at the suggestion that he should on his own initiative
EDL	01:54:17,216	01:54:19,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Invite Japan to immediate adherence
EDL	01:54:19,520	01:54:22,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves
EDL	01:54:23,104	01:54:29,504	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Please call the president's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect
EDL	01:54:29,504	01:54:32,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Compelling England in a few months
EDL	01:54:32,064	01:54:33,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To make peace
EDL	01:54:33,088	01:54:33,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	01:54:35,904	01:54:37,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So there's a note
EDL	01:54:37,952	01:54:40,000	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Suggesting that Mexico go to war
EDL	01:54:40,512	01:54:44,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As part of the Central Powers against the United States if United States gets into the war
EDL	01:54:44,608	01:54:45,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's more
EDL	01:54:45,632	01:54:52,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They talked about getting Japan on board to that was one of the United States is great worries by the way the Japanese have to
EDL	01:54:52,032	01:54:58,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are the Americas all these theories from American planner that maybe they could either go take the Panama Canal and come up through Mexico mean
EDL	01:54:58,432	01:55:00,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When is All This Is War playing kind of fantasies
EDL	01:55:00,992	01:55:02,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the idea that
EDL	01:55:02,272	01:55:04,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Japan to be brought in
EDL	01:55:04,064	01:55:10,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And flipped cuz they're on the Allied side the Germans are talk about flipping the Japanese making them on the Central Powers to having a
EDL	01:55:10,464	01:55:13,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Japanese attacked the Americans the Mexicans attack the Americans
EDL	01:55:13,024	01:55:14,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If nothing else
EDL	01:55:14,560	01:55:18,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That keeps the Americans busy so they're not over there fighting Germans in Europe
EDL	01:55:20,704	01:55:27,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you're playing a board game here of risk or something that's not a bad idea going to the game called The Plum
EDL	01:55:27,104	01:55:29,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you're playing the game called diplomacy
EDL	01:55:30,688	01:55:32,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's all kinds of variables in real life
EDL	01:55:32,992	01:55:36,576	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not taking into account in the game of diplomacy one of them is
EDL	01:55:37,088	01:55:43,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But your enemies might be tapping into the cable that you use to send a secret message like that
EDL	01:55:43,488	01:55:45,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From Germany to Mexico
EDL	01:55:46,304	01:55:47,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British got it
EDL	01:55:48,608	01:55:51,424	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Snatched it right off of the American
EDL	01:55:51,936	01:55:53,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Atlantic Cable
EDL	01:55:53,728	01:55:54,752	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which they were tapping
EDL	01:55:56,032	01:55:58,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I think we mentioned in an earlier episode
EDL	01:55:58,080	01:56:01,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British may be the the best Espionage codebreaker
EDL	01:56:02,176	01:56:03,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People of all time
EDL	01:56:04,480	01:56:06,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the war starts they cut the German
EDL	01:56:06,784	01:56:10,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Transatlantic cable to Germany can't send Telegraph messages across the Atlantic
EDL	01:56:10,624	01:56:14,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So they work out deals to borrow other people's cable sometimes
EDL	01:56:14,720	01:56:16,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do United States let them use
EDL	01:56:16,768	01:56:20,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The US cable for just messages Woodrow Wilson thought with
EDL	01:56:20,608	01:56:21,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Would maybe
EDL	01:56:21,632	01:56:24,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Masterpiece Riley wants to the Germans have an open channel to him
EDL	01:56:25,472	01:56:30,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Did the Germans use the American cable to send a message to Mexico offering some
EDL	01:56:30,336	01:56:32,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	American states to them if they come in the war
EDL	01:56:33,152	01:56:34,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By attacking United States little Iraq
EDL	01:56:36,992	01:56:38,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British have a problem
EDL	01:56:39,552	01:56:42,880	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They can't tell the Americans about this cable right away
EDL	01:56:43,392	01:56:46,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because then you're going to get all these embarrassing questions like how do you get the cable
EDL	01:56:47,488	01:56:53,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then the British would have to say if they were going to be truthful well we tapped into your cable and we've been reading your message
EDL	01:56:53,888	01:56:54,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I just for the whole War
EDL	01:56:55,168	01:56:56,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can't quite
EDL	01:56:56,192	01:56:57,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Say that too easily
EDL	01:56:57,984	01:57:02,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So by hooker by crook it's a great story Barbara tuchman wrote a whole book on it
EDL	01:57:02,080	01:57:04,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British figure out a way
EDL	01:57:04,640	01:57:07,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To sort of hide the source of
EDL	01:57:07,200	01:57:08,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know how they got this cable
EDL	01:57:09,248	01:57:10,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They give it to the Americans
EDL	01:57:11,296	01:57:14,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Woodrow Wilson in Stockton
EDL	01:57:14,624	01:57:16,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And understand the contact right
EDL	01:57:16,416	01:57:19,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is the very month January 1917
EDL	01:57:19,744	01:57:23,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Did American military forces are finally withdrawing
EDL	01:57:23,584	01:57:27,680	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the Pancho Villa Expedition right this attempt to go get this
EDL	01:57:27,680	01:57:28,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terrorist
EDL	01:57:28,704	01:57:31,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Us settlers in Arizona New Mexico
EDL	01:57:31,008	01:57:32,288	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Texas would have called him
EDL	01:57:32,288	01:57:37,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mnusports kind of comes back with their tail between their legs it didn't get Pancho via that killed a bunch of his man but
EDL	01:57:39,200	01:57:40,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Despite you know
EDL	01:57:40,480	01:57:41,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hi public
EDL	01:57:42,016	01:57:48,160	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Praising of everything involved General John Blackjack Pershing says it wasn't a very memorable. In American history
EDL	01:57:48,160	01:57:50,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless it made the Mexicans
EDL	01:57:50,720	01:57:55,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mad as hell and in the US almost went to war with Mexico twice in two years
EDL	01:57:55,584	01:58:01,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In 1914 US troops occupy the city of Veracruz in about 200 people died in that little Endeavor may be closer to 300
EDL	01:58:02,240	01:58:03,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nearly
EDL	01:58:03,520	01:58:06,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Call the war between the US and Mexico the end
EDL	01:58:06,336	01:58:12,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then in this Pancho Villa expedition to us crosses the Border goes after a guy who is also the enemy
EDL	01:58:12,736	01:58:13,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mexico's leader
EDL	01:58:14,272	01:58:19,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it's so upset the Mexicans to have US troops in their country for any reason at that almost led to war
EDL	01:58:19,648	01:58:23,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so just as you're getting your troops the very month you're getting your troops out of Mexico
EDL	01:58:24,256	01:58:26,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans are sending him a telegram saying hey
EDL	01:58:27,328	01:58:29,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Want to go to war against United States I'll give you three Fates
EDL	01:58:30,144	01:58:30,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will help you
EDL	01:58:31,936	01:58:33,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It struck a nerve
EDL	01:58:33,728	01:58:35,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For Americans
EDL	01:58:35,008	01:58:37,824	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When Woodrow Wilson release that letter
EDL	01:58:37,824	01:58:38,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Publicly
EDL	01:58:40,640	01:58:42,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the American public first heard about
EDL	01:58:42,688	01:58:43,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany's offer to Mex
EDL	01:58:45,248	01:58:51,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The reaction was one that I think would Woodmere the reaction of the American public in a similar situation today
EDL	01:58:51,648	01:58:53,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A large number of them thought that
EDL	01:58:53,184	01:58:54,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The telegram was a forgery
EDL	01:58:56,000	01:58:57,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British intelligence was behind
EDL	01:58:58,048	01:59:01,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Did this was an attempt to trick the American government
EDL	01:59:01,120	01:59:05,472	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And to affect American public opinion and make them more Angry Germany more pro-war
EDL	01:59:06,752	01:59:08,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Speculate how much
EDL	01:59:09,056	01:59:13,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know that's what a perception would have stayed that way if the German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmermann
EDL	01:59:13,664	01:59:16,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Haven't done something in early March 1917 that looks
EDL	01:59:17,248	01:59:18,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Inexplicable
EDL	01:59:19,296	01:59:20,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He admit it
EDL	01:59:20,320	01:59:23,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the telegram had been sent and that it was genuine
EDL	01:59:23,904	01:59:24,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Twice
EDL	01:59:26,208	01:59:27,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The second time
EDL	01:59:27,488	01:59:31,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He said he hoped the American people would understand that this was only
EDL	01:59:31,072	01:59:35,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To come into effect if war broke out between Germany and United States
EDL	01:59:35,168	01:59:37,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As a way of saying you know you understand that right
EDL	01:59:37,728	01:59:39,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	American people wouldn't
EDL	01:59:40,032	01:59:43,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The confirmation that the Zimmerman Telegram was indeed an official
EDL	01:59:43,872	01:59:46,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Secret proposal from the German government to the Mexican Government
EDL	01:59:47,200	01:59:48,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Outside of town of America
EDL	01:59:48,736	01:59:53,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An undercut the cause of german-americans and irish-americans were hoping to keep the United States neutral
EDL	01:59:54,880	01:59:55,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was another
EDL	01:59:55,648	01:59:59,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nail in the coffin of neutrality and a huge German missed appt
EDL	02:00:02,816	02:00:03,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In fact
EDL	02:00:03,840	02:00:05,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The whole decision
EDL	02:00:05,120	02:00:06,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To unleash the sub
EDL	02:00:07,424	02:00:09,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When they did was a bad decision by
EDL	02:00:09,216	02:00:09,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany
EDL	02:00:09,984	02:00:12,800	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If they had only waited a little while longer
EDL	02:00:12,800	02:00:14,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Longer events would have
EDL	02:00:14,592	02:00:15,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Happened
EDL	02:00:15,360	02:00:17,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That would have made that move unless
EDL	02:00:17,664	02:00:18,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terry
EDL	02:00:18,688	02:00:23,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And if that's the move that gets the United States into the war that it would have made that event unnecessary
EDL	02:00:24,576	02:00:26,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Winston Churchill points out
EDL	02:00:27,392	02:00:28,160	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the
EDL	02:00:28,928	02:00:30,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Timing of the event
EDL	02:00:30,208	02:00:31,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What happened in
EDL	02:00:31,232	02:00:32,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	March and April
EDL	02:00:33,024	02:00:34,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1917
EDL	02:00:34,560	02:00:37,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In his mind show the hand of Destiny at
EDL	02:00:37,632	02:00:38,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here's how he framed
EDL	02:00:39,168	02:00:43,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's about to happen what's about to happen latest in German that will screw up everything
EDL	02:00:43,008	02:00:44,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In here
EDL	02:00:44,032	02:00:50,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know set the stage for our modern world as much as the United States getting into this conflict will set the stage for the modern world
EDL	02:00:50,688	02:00:51,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Russia has its Revel

EDL	02:00:56,320	02:00:58,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The beginning of 1917
EDL	02:00:58,624	02:01:00,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was marked by three stupendous events
EDL	02:01:01,440	02:01:06,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The German Declaration of unlimited U-Boat War the intervention of the United States
EDL	02:01:06,816	02:01:08,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Russian Revolution
EDL	02:01:08,608	02:01:12,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Taken together these events constitute the Second Great climax of the war
EDL	02:01:12,960	02:01:15,520	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The order in which they were placed was decisive
EDL	02:01:16,032	02:01:18,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hit the Russian Revolution that occurred in January
EDL	02:01:18,848	02:01:20,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Instead of in March
EDL	02:01:20,128	02:01:26,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wharf alternatively that the Germans had waited to declare unlimited U-Boat War until the summer they would have been no one
EDL	02:01:26,528	02:01:27,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Limited U-Boat War
EDL	02:01:27,552	02:01:30,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And consequently no intervention of the United States
EDL	02:01:30,624	02:01:33,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hit the Allies have been left to face the collapse of Russia
EDL	02:01:33,696	02:01:36,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Without being sustained by the intervention of the United States
EDL	02:01:36,768	02:01:40,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It seems certain that France could not have survived the year
EDL	02:01:40,096	02:01:42,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the war would have ended in the Peace by negotiation
EDL	02:01:42,912	02:01:45,472	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or in other words a German victory
EDL	02:01:45,472	02:01:47,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Did Russia lasted two months less
EDL	02:01:47,776	02:01:50,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany refrained for 2 months more
EDL	02:01:50,336	02:01:52,896	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The whole course of events would have been revolutionized
EDL	02:01:53,408	02:01:54,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this sequence
EDL	02:01:54,432	02:01:56,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We discern the footprints of Destiny
EDL	02:01:56,992	02:01:58,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Either Russian endurance
EDL	02:01:58,528	02:02:02,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or German impatience was required to secure the entry of the United States
EDL	02:02:02,624	02:02:03,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And both were 4th
EDL	02:02:04,672	02:02:05,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:02:06,976	02:02:10,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As we mentioned already the situation in Russia had been seething and simmering
EDL	02:02:11,328	02:02:12,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For quite some time
EDL	02:02:12,864	02:02:14,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The straw that broke the camel's back
EDL	02:02:15,168	02:02:16,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was an almost complete break
EDL	02:02:17,472	02:02:18,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Brushes transfer
EDL	02:02:19,520	02:02:22,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which has been withering since the war started
EDL	02:02:22,592	02:02:23,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that had suffered
EDL	02:02:23,872	02:02:25,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terribly in the winter that just happened
EDL	02:02:25,920	02:02:26,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Russia almost
EDL	02:02:26,944	02:02:30,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Couldn't handle is transportation needs in peacetime
EDL	02:02:30,016	02:02:31,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After several years of war
EDL	02:02:31,552	02:02:32,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were whole cities
EDL	02:02:32,832	02:02:34,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're not receiving enough food
EDL	02:02:34,624	02:02:35,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of them was the Kappa
EDL	02:02:35,904	02:02:36,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Metrograph
EDL	02:02:37,440	02:02:39,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Petrograd used to be called Saint Peters
EDL	02:02:39,488	02:02:41,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But when the war started that's
EDL	02:02:41,024	02:02:42,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sounds a little to German
EDL	02:02:43,328	02:02:44,352	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So they changed it
EDL	02:02:44,352	02:02:45,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To petrograd this is a city that we
EDL	02:02:45,888	02:02:46,656	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will change its name all the
EDL	02:02:47,424	02:02:51,264	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	During the Communist years it will be known as Leningrad now St Petersburg
EDL	02:02:51,264	02:02:51,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Broke again
EDL	02:02:52,288	02:02:54,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless it's the big Metropolis
EDL	02:02:54,336	02:02:56,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it doesn't have enough food
EDL	02:02:56,640	02:03:01,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You take a bunch of people who were angry already add the War Admiral food
EDL	02:03:02,016	02:03:05,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's not surprising they were marching they've been doing it all throughout 19-7
EDL	02:03:06,112	02:03:07,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Irish historian William Mullen
EDL	02:03:08,160	02:03:08,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Points out
EDL	02:03:09,184	02:03:12,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the beginning of 1917 there was a wave of strikes
EDL	02:03:12,768	02:03:14,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Concentrated in petrograd
EDL	02:03:14,560	02:03:16,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the 7th of March
EDL	02:03:16,096	02:03:20,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	30000 workers were locked out of the feudal of armaments plants in the city
EDL	02:03:20,704	02:03:27,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The following day international women's day women gathered in the vyborg working-class district
EDL	02:03:27,104	02:03:28,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Protest against hybrid prices
EDL	02:03:29,152	02:03:31,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They marched past Finland station

EDL	02:03:43,744	02:03:48,352	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The protesters connected their experience of war with much broader political claims
EDL	02:03:48,864	02:03:52,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Although the Crux of their complaints was the food supply crisis
EDL	02:03:52,192	02:03:58,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This material experience of War had political implications including the overthrow of the czarist regime and then.
EDL	02:03:58,592	02:04:01,152	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The war it was possible in theory
EDL	02:04:01,152	02:04:03,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the food supply system could be reformed
EDL	02:04:03,712	02:04:07,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the Striker's new the czarist regime could no longer reform itself

EDL	02:04:24,192	02:04:29,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It seems a certain there's anything can be that the emperor and Empress are riding for a fall

EDL	02:04:45,184	02:04:46,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are open to

EDL	02:04:47,744	02:04:50,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some of the higher levels of Russian Society
EDL	02:04:50,816	02:04:52,864	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The terror attack should be made against
EDL	02:04:52,864	02:04:55,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Someone stands up at the Duma and important person
EDL	02:04:55,936	02:04:57,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Later in the story
EDL	02:04:57,216	02:05:01,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And says that the Tsar needs to be removed by terrorist means if necessary
EDL	02:05:03,872	02:05:04,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now
EDL	02:05:04,640	02:05:06,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It would be foolish to say that the
EDL	02:05:06,688	02:05:08,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Uniroyal Court did not have their so
EDL	02:05:09,248	02:05:09,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They did
EDL	02:05:10,272	02:05:12,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they had people who didn't have a problem with
EDL	02:05:13,344	02:05:16,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know when Emperor but they had a problem with Nicholas II
EDL	02:05:16,672	02:05:19,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So they were all stripes in this idea
EDL	02:05:19,232	02:05:21,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the Czar needed to go
EDL	02:05:21,024	02:05:25,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And no consensus at all about what would take its place or how to get from here to there
EDL	02:05:27,168	02:05:29,472	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Russian knew how to have protest
EDL	02:05:29,472	02:05:29,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To revolt
EDL	02:05:30,752	02:05:34,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About a dozen years before this time. They had the famous 1905 rap

EDL	02:05:42,272	02:05:44,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It got so serious the Tsar
EDL	02:05:44,320	02:05:45,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Supposedly
EDL	02:05:45,344	02:05:48,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Rode out his application letter he didn't deliver it but it was ready to go

EDL	02:06:07,872	02:06:14,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Recently the conviction has been expressed without exception that we are on the eve of great events and comparison

EDL	02:06:28,864	02:06:34,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They can be seemingly inevitable for the longest time and still come as a surprise when they actually show up

EDL	02:14:31,424	02:14:33,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Call Saks drove the police away who did it
EDL	02:14:34,240	02:14:36,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now one of the things that if you watched
EDL	02:14:36,544	02:14:38,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Recent revolutions you'll notice that
EDL	02:14:38,848	02:14:40,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Often times some incident will happen
EDL	02:14:41,152	02:14:41,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the
EDL	02:14:41,920	02:14:45,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Demonstrators and protesters and rioters will sort of
EDL	02:14:46,016	02:14:47,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Clean to some sort of symbol
EDL	02:14:47,808	02:14:49,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Generally from the event
EDL	02:14:49,344	02:14:55,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It becomes almost like a high sign that protesters use and that they rally around
EDL	02:14:55,232	02:14:56,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	According to Trotsky
EDL	02:14:57,024	02:14:59,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What it was in this Revolution was a Cossack
EDL	02:15:00,608	02:15:01,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Calvarymen
EDL	02:15:01,888	02:15:03,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lincoln to the crowd
EDL	02:15:04,192	02:15:06,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that this wink became sort of a
EDL	02:15:06,496	02:15:07,264	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Symbol
EDL	02:15:07,264	02:15:09,312	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of what was going on here's the way
EDL	02:15:09,312	02:15:15,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Trotsky explained it and remember trotsky's a revolutionary for him this is a hugely heroic tale and that's the way he
EDL	02:15:15,712	02:15:16,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He tells it
EDL	02:15:16,480	02:15:18,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I think we're all colored
EDL	02:15:18,016	02:15:20,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At least those of us who know what's coming
EDL	02:15:20,064	02:15:21,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Buy what's coming
EDL	02:15:22,368	02:15:25,440	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This revolution is going to devolve into something very terrible
EDL	02:15:25,440	02:15:26,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	02:15:26,208	02:15:30,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A lot of us look back on this event thinking that that's how we should View
EDL	02:15:30,816	02:15:34,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bee removal of what came before communism
EDL	02:15:34,144	02:15:36,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And yet there was a. After this revolution
EDL	02:15:36,704	02:15:40,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where Russia was on the road to becoming something more like the United States
EDL	02:15:41,056	02:15:42,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so getting rid
EDL	02:15:43,104	02:15:47,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of a czarist regime that these people seem to hate like a Saddam Hussein
EDL	02:15:47,712	02:15:48,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was initially viewed
EDL	02:15:49,504	02:15:50,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As a plus
EDL	02:15:50,272	02:15:53,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the reporter on the scene for example for the British press
EDL	02:15:53,088	02:15:54,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's thoroughly in favor
EDL	02:15:54,880	02:15:56,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Oh something replacing this regime
EDL	02:15:58,208	02:16:04,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States is too by the way one of the problems the United States has with joining the Allies are being
EDL	02:16:04,608	02:16:08,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Associated with the Allies is not Britain and France would they feel very close to in a lot of ways
EDL	02:16:08,704	02:16:09,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's Russia
EDL	02:16:10,240	02:16:12,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To them Russia is the same kind of
EDL	02:16:12,544	02:16:14,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Militant autocracy that
EDL	02:16:14,592	02:16:17,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do us propaganda paint the Germans ass
EDL	02:16:19,200	02:16:23,296	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The ideas are going away to be replaced by some sort of constitutional government
EDL	02:16:23,296	02:16:25,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Makes a lot of people in the Allied camps it up and
EDL	02:16:26,368	02:16:27,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cheer for the protesters
EDL	02:16:29,952	02:16:33,024	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now in the story by Trotsky of the Winking Cossack
EDL	02:16:33,024	02:16:38,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He explains that the officers of the Cossacks kind of force them to charge into the crowd at one point
EDL	02:16:38,144	02:16:40,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But as soon as the officers pass by in Scatter the crowd
EDL	02:16:40,960	02:16:45,824	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The regular Cossacks are very careful moving through with their horses not to hurt anyone
EDL	02:16:46,592	02:16:47,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	02:16:47,360	02:16:48,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Trotsky right
EDL	02:16:48,128	02:16:48,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's quote
EDL	02:16:49,152	02:16:53,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Behind them filling the whole width of the prospect Gallop the Cossack
EDL	02:16:53,248	02:16:54,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Decisive moment
EDL	02:16:54,528	02:16:55,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's a Horseman
EDL	02:16:55,808	02:17:00,160	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cautiously in a long ribbon Road through the corridor just made by the officers
EDL	02:17:00,672	02:17:01,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some of them smile

EDL	02:17:05,024	02:17:07,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And one of them gave the workers a good wing
EDL	02:17:07,840	02:17:08,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This wink
EDL	02:17:08,608	02:17:09,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Karate size
EDL	02:17:09,632	02:17:11,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was not without meaning
EDL	02:17:11,168	02:17:15,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The workers wearing Bolden with a friendly not hostile kind of assurance
EDL	02:17:15,008	02:17:17,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And slightly infected the contacts with it
EDL	02:17:17,568	02:17:19,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The one who went found imitators
EDL	02:17:19,872	02:17:22,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In spite of renewed efforts from the officers
EDL	02:17:22,432	02:17:27,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Cossacks without openly breaking discipline failed to force the crowd to disperse
EDL	02:17:28,064	02:17:30,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Flowed through it in the Stream
EDL	02:17:30,112	02:17:36,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This was repeated three or four times and brought the two sides even closer together individual cost X began to

EDL	02:17:38,048	02:17:41,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And even to enter into momentary conversations with them
EDL	02:17:41,376	02:17:46,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm disciplined there remained but a thin transparent shelf that threatened to break through any second
EDL	02:17:47,008	02:17:52,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The officers hasten to separate their patrol from the workers and abandon the idea of dispersing them
EDL	02:17:52,384	02:17:57,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lines the Cossacks out across the street as a barrier to prevent the demonstrators from getting to the center
EDL	02:17:58,272	02:17:59,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:17:59,040	02:18:03,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He then told the story about how these Concepts will allow themselves to be used as a mounted barrier
EDL	02:18:04,160	02:18:04,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they don't stop
EDL	02:18:04,928	02:18:07,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The protesters from diving under the horses bellies
EDL	02:18:09,536	02:18:13,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The fact that the Cossacks traditionally thesaurus

EDL	02:18:16,192	02:18:19,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Less than enthusiastic about carrying out their traditional role
EDL	02:18:19,776	02:18:21,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Convinces the government that they have to bring in the

EDL	02:18:41,280	02:18:41,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now
EDL	02:18:42,304	02:18:44,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The people of petrograd
EDL	02:18:44,096	02:18:45,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are appealing

EDL	02:19:09,440	02:19:11,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I did a lot of that going on
EDL	02:19:13,792	02:19:14,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After the
EDL	02:19:15,584	02:19:17,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Shootings in the street on March 11th
EDL	02:19:17,888	02:19:21,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Citizens were told workers go up to

EDL	02:22:09,664	02:22:11,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The first thing is our try to do is just get rid of the Duma
EDL	02:22:12,736	02:22:14,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And when the head of this

EDL	02:26:56,896	02:26:59,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is a rule that says that anything involving the military

EDL	02:27:36,576	02:27:37,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At a certain point
EDL	02:27:37,344	02:27:43,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They tell the Allies that they're going to continue fighting a committed to continue fighting the Allies start pouring
EDL	02:27:43,488	02:27:47,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Money and stuff into Russia even at a greater pace and they were before
EDL	02:27:47,840	02:27:52,960	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How do you continue to hold off Germany in the Central Powers with your army
EDL	02:27:53,728	02:27:56,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	While you're 300 year old
EDL	02:27:56,800	02:27:59,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Monarchy is busy collapsing all the structures
EDL	02:28:00,384	02:28:02,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That have been you know hanging by a string
EDL	02:28:03,200	02:28:04,224	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Start falling apart
EDL	02:28:06,016	02:28:09,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are the soldiers at the front going to do this became the key question
EDL	02:28:09,344	02:28:11,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it's not answered right away
EDL	02:28:12,672	02:28:14,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Churchill as only he can
EDL	02:28:14,976	02:28:21,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Saw the whole thing is an unmitigated disaster looking back on it from the late 1920s again now he can see
EDL	02:28:21,376	02:28:22,912	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where all this is going to go
EDL	02:28:22,912	02:28:25,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Communism in the future so his ideas are probably
EDL	02:28:26,240	02:28:31,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He said the tragedy of Russia was and I'm quoting here that her ship went down within sight of
EDL	02:28:31,616	02:28:32,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Port
EDL	02:28:32,384	02:28:34,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Meaning we were just going to win this war
EDL	02:28:34,944	02:28:37,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then Russia doesn't get to share in the spoils
EDL	02:28:37,248	02:28:39,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he says of Russia quote
EDL	02:28:39,040	02:28:40,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With victory in her grasp
EDL	02:28:40,832	02:28:42,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	She fell upon the Earth
EDL	02:28:42,368	02:28:45,440	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Devoured alive like Herod of old by worm
EDL	02:28:45,952	02:28:48,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But not in vain her Valiant Deeds

EDL	02:29:13,344	02:29:14,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Since Germany
EDL	02:29:14,112	02:29:15,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Decided to unleash the submarines
EDL	02:29:16,672	02:29:18,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the first 20 days

EDL	02:29:28,192	02:29:34,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the month of February when this all starts that start losing a million dollars 1917 value money by the way
EDL	02:29:34,592	02:29:35,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A week
EDL	02:29:36,640	02:29:39,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The next month March 1917 those numbers will double
EDL	02:29:40,480	02:29:41,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And all of a sudden
EDL	02:29:41,760	02:29:44,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We begin to see what the first
EDL	02:29:44,064	02:29:44,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Real
EDL	02:29:45,344	02:29:46,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Competent

EDL	02:29:48,160	02:29:51,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At least a minimum number of submarines is liking world has
EDL	02:29:52,512	02:29:55,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans have been perfecting that you do with these new
EDL	02:29:55,584	02:30:01,472	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Weapon systems like submarines the science fiction type weapons what do you how do you use them at the beginning of the war they're kind of going after
EDL	02:30:01,984	02:30:08,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Warships and whatnot and then they they work on short little bursts going after neutrals and Merchant ships and now by 19
EDL	02:30:08,384	02:30:11,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1017 the Germans know what they want to do with these things
EDL	02:30:11,200	02:30:12,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they have enough ships to make
EDL	02:30:12,992	02:30:15,296	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Their plan work minimum number but enough
EDL	02:30:15,808	02:30:21,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They Unleashed them to go after everything which is what their strategy has told them you have to do to really maximize this weapon system
EDL	02:30:22,720	02:30:23,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there
EDL	02:30:24,256	02:30:25,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thinking enough ships
EDL	02:30:26,304	02:30:31,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So that Britain is for the first time in the war in real danger itself of going under
EDL	02:30:32,704	02:30:37,056	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are the advantages of being an island nation is it you got the strongest Navy
EDL	02:30:37,056	02:30:39,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You don't have to have the same kind of fears that are Russia have
EDL	02:30:40,128	02:30:41,152	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Auray France
EDL	02:30:41,920	02:30:45,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans aren't going to be able to break you directly cuz they can't reach you
EDL	02:30:46,272	02:30:49,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is the first time in the war that the British faced any serious threat
EDL	02:30:49,856	02:30:54,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of the Germans in one way or another reaching them affecting them personally
EDL	02:30:54,464	02:30:55,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Forcing them perhaps
EDL	02:30:56,256	02:30:57,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To knuckle under
EDL	02:30:58,048	02:30:59,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just some sort of peace deal
EDL	02:31:00,352	02:31:01,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In April
EDL	02:31:01,632	02:31:02,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The month
EDL	02:31:02,400	02:31:04,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States gets into the war
EDL	02:31:04,960	02:31:06,752	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans sink 400

EDL	02:31:09,056	02:31:10,080	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Almost 805
EDL	02:31:10,592	02:31:11,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1000 tons of ship
EDL	02:31:13,664	02:31:14,688	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British Empire
EDL	02:31:14,688	02:31:15,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I cannot stay
EDL	02:31:16,224	02:31:16,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Those kind of losses
EDL	02:31:19,040	02:31:19,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The submarine war
EDL	02:31:20,320	02:31:21,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It eventually brings the United
EDL	02:31:21,856	02:31:22,624	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	States in
EDL	02:31:22,624	02:31:24,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If for no other reason
EDL	02:31:24,416	02:31:25,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Venice
EDL	02:31:25,184	02:31:26,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Disrupting
EDL	02:31:26,464	02:31:28,000	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Operations in the country
EDL	02:31:29,024	02:31:35,168	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The president is under a lot of pressure on a day-to-day increasing basis because once he starts thinking all these ships US ship stop leak
EDL	02:31:36,704	02:31:38,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They begin to congregate
EDL	02:31:38,240	02:31:43,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And clogged up and cause traffic jams outside the major ports on the Eastern seaboard
EDL	02:31:43,104	02:31:48,992	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then all of the Commodities and food and perishables that we're going to be loaded onto those ships begin backing up
EDL	02:31:49,504	02:31:50,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You got this
EDL	02:31:50,272	02:31:50,784	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terrible
EDL	02:31:51,296	02:31:57,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Clogged all the ports on the eastern coast of material this rotting and degrading because the ships won't cross the Atlantic
EDL	02:31:57,696	02:31:58,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because they are afraid of the submarine
EDL	02:32:01,792	02:32:02,560	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At one point
EDL	02:32:02,560	02:32:04,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson wants the army ships
EDL	02:32:04,096	02:32:05,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Change the situation
EDL	02:32:06,656	02:32:08,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Watch provide Assurance of the taken
EDL	02:32:08,704	02:32:09,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Norcross
EDL	02:32:09,984	02:32:15,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But this is like a ticking Time Bomb for Wilson he's got to do something this situation is only going to get worse
EDL	02:32:16,896	02:32:19,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Zimmerman Telegram happens in late February to a mean
EDL	02:32:19,968	02:32:23,296	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All these things that just increase a situation that's bad
EDL	02:32:23,296	02:32:24,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And make it worse
EDL	02:32:24,320	02:32:25,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But there's no
EDL	02:32:25,600	02:32:28,160	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Instant moment where the line has been crossed
EDL	02:32:29,184	02:32:30,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there never will be
EDL	02:32:33,280	02:32:34,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At some point
EDL	02:32:34,816	02:32:39,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By March 1917 at the latest then probably around the same time the Russian Revolution is happening
EDL	02:32:39,936	02:32:41,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Wilson Administration decides
EDL	02:32:42,240	02:32:43,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They've had enough
EDL	02:32:44,288	02:32:47,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	5 us ships go down in March 1917
EDL	02:32:47,616	02:32:52,224	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Twosome in the Wilson Administration this is confirmation that the US is already at War
EDL	02:32:52,224	02:32:52,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	War with Germany
EDL	02:32:53,248	02:32:57,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It doesn't have to be some big Lusitania 911 moment
EDL	02:32:57,088	02:33:02,720	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To cross over this invisible line it's happening every day and on April 2nd Wilson Gibbs
EDL	02:33:02,720	02:33:06,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is most famous beach one of the most important speeches in American history
EDL	02:33:06,816	02:33:07,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Concerning
EDL	02:33:08,096	02:33:09,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The situation
EDL	02:33:09,632	02:33:10,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That he see
EDL	02:33:11,168	02:33:12,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States is at war with
EDL	02:33:13,216	02:33:13,984	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany
EDL	02:33:13,984	02:33:16,800	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The interesting part about the speech if you dissected it
EDL	02:33:16,800	02:33:18,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Monumental on so many levels
EDL	02:33:19,104	02:33:22,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's so crappy way it's put together he never says that the Congress
EDL	02:33:22,432	02:33:28,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Declare war on Germany you know so that we'll be at war with Germany he says we are at war with Germany and I invite you to
EDL	02:33:28,832	02:33:29,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To confirm that fact
EDL	02:33:30,112	02:33:32,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He had no time gives Congress
EDL	02:33:32,416	02:33:35,488	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The impression that they have any control over this decision at all
EDL	02:33:36,000	02:33:38,304	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Luckily for him they went along with him big
EDL	02:33:38,304	02:33:39,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Time but what if they hadn't
EDL	02:33:41,632	02:33:47,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Part of Wilson's speech focuses on the specific reason we're at this point talked about the submarine warfare Compares Germans
EDL	02:33:47,776	02:33:49,824	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do pirates and all these kinds of things
EDL	02:33:49,824	02:33:51,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Take some time out of the speech to say
EDL	02:33:52,384	02:33:55,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That we're not at war with the German people we have no quarrel with
EDL	02:33:55,968	02:33:58,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's their government we don't
EDL	02:33:58,016	02:34:00,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Liking this is a big change by the way
EDL	02:34:00,064	02:34:01,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In in the way
EDL	02:34:01,600	02:34:04,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That much of the United States government will
EDL	02:34:04,928	02:34:05,440	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Craft
EDL	02:34:05,952	02:34:09,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Another way that they frame relationships with other countries to
EDL	02:34:09,536	02:34:11,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Got nothing against the people
EDL	02:34:11,072	02:34:13,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's the government of Wilson point of view is
EDL	02:34:13,120	02:34:16,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is the people aren't running the government like in a democracy or Republic
EDL	02:34:16,704	02:34:18,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Within the people aren't responsible
EDL	02:34:18,496	02:34:22,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For what their government decisions are they may be the victims of it and we might have to hurt you
EDL	02:34:22,848	02:34:25,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In order to overthrow your government but we're not mad at you
EDL	02:34:29,760	02:34:31,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is really high-minded sentiments
EDL	02:34:32,064	02:34:35,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Forever known afterwards as wilsonian principles
EDL	02:34:35,648	02:34:42,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The talk about things like the need to make the world safe for democracy I'll give you a taste of that in the second
EDL	02:34:42,048	02:34:43,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But more interesting
EDL	02:34:43,328	02:34:47,680	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And again one of the more groundbreaking parts of the speech is that Wilson takes on the US
EDL	02:34:48,448	02:34:49,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tradition
EDL	02:34:49,728	02:34:52,288	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of non-involvement in European affairs

EDL	02:34:53,568	02:34:55,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he basically said
EDL	02:34:55,616	02:34:56,896	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That was the way it was
EDL	02:34:57,408	02:34:57,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Times of change
EDL	02:34:58,944	02:35:00,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here's the exact phrasing

EDL	02:35:01,248	02:35:02,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What is a sea change
EDL	02:35:03,040	02:35:04,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In American
EDL	02:35:04,320	02:35:07,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Foreign policy in the way the government of the United States approaches
EDL	02:35:07,648	02:35:13,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The conflict involvement with the rest of the world and that course changes one we are still living with today
EDL	02:35:13,792	02:35:15,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the modern world
EDL	02:35:15,072	02:35:16,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the middle of his speech
EDL	02:35:16,608	02:35:21,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Telling Congress that a war exists right now with Germany Wilson says quote
EDL	02:35:23,264	02:35:29,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of peace and Justice in the life of the world
EDL	02:35:29,664	02:35:31,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As against selfish and autocratic power
EDL	02:35:31,968	02:35:36,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And a set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world
EDL	02:35:36,320	02:35:41,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles
EDL	02:35:42,208	02:35:46,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable
EDL	02:35:46,048	02:35:48,096	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where the Peace of the world is involved
EDL	02:35:48,096	02:35:49,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the freedom of its people
EDL	02:35:49,632	02:35:54,496	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Menace to that Peace and Freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments
EDL	02:35:54,496	02:35:56,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Back by organized Force
EDL	02:35:56,032	02:35:59,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which is controlled Holy by there will not by the will of their people
EDL	02:36:00,384	02:36:02,432	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We have seen the last of neutrality
EDL	02:36:02,432	02:36:08,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In such circumstances we're at the beginning of an age where it will be insisted that the same standards of Conduct in a person

EDL	02:36:13,184	02:36:16,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That are observed among the individual citizens of civilized States

EDL	02:36:26,240	02:36:28,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just started to sound really low
EDL	02:36:28,032	02:36:28,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Old fashioned
EDL	02:36:30,336	02:36:31,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But at least
EDL	02:36:31,616	02:36:32,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wilson's
EDL	02:36:32,640	02:36:34,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Got some really good
EDL	02:36:34,688	02:36:36,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Arguments to justify the historic
EDL	02:36:38,272	02:36:39,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These are the ideas
EDL	02:36:40,064	02:36:40,832	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm wilsonia
EDL	02:36:41,600	02:36:42,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And here's
EDL	02:36:42,368	02:36:43,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How Wilson enunciate
EDL	02:36:43,648	02:36:44,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just some of them
EDL	02:36:45,184	02:36:45,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Quote
EDL	02:36:45,952	02:36:49,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is a distressing and oppressive Duty Gentlemen of the Congress
EDL	02:36:49,536	02:36:51,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which I have performed in this addressing you
EDL	02:36:51,840	02:36:56,448	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us
EDL	02:36:56,960	02:37:03,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all
EDL	02:37:03,360	02:37:06,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Towards civilization itself seeming to be in the ballet
EDL	02:37:06,688	02:37:08,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the right is more precious than peace
EDL	02:37:09,248	02:37:13,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts
EDL	02:37:13,344	02:37:14,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For democracy
EDL	02:37:14,368	02:37:17,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government

EDL	02:37:23,072	02:37:27,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Why such a concert of free peoples I shall bring peace and safety to All Nations
EDL	02:37:27,936	02:37:30,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And make the world itself at last free
EDL	02:37:30,752	02:37:36,896	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes everything that we are and everything that we have
EDL	02:37:37,408	02:37:41,504	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged
EDL	02:37:42,016	02:37:46,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth
EDL	02:37:46,368	02:37:49,184	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And happiness and the peace which she is treasured

EDL	02:37:51,744	02:37:52,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:37:53,536	02:37:55,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One wonders what John Quincy Adams
EDL	02:37:56,608	02:37:57,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Would reply to that
EDL	02:37:58,656	02:37:59,424	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:37:59,936	02:38:03,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Guys like Theodore Roosevelt who been saying he was going to
EDL	02:38:03,008	02:38:06,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Skin Wilson alive if Wilson didn't go to war
EDL	02:38:06,848	02:38:07,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Like the speech a lot
EDL	02:38:10,176	02:38:11,456	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's interesting to note by the way
EDL	02:38:12,480	02:38:16,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the one American political figure that the Europeans
EDL	02:38:16,832	02:38:19,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Really respect in this whole question is Theodore Roosevelt
EDL	02:38:20,160	02:38:23,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because Theodore Roosevelt is really one of the early what will be called Atlantis
EDL	02:38:24,768	02:38:25,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People who believe
EDL	02:38:25,536	02:38:29,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For example in locking arms with country like Great Britain in and doing great things with them
EDL	02:38:29,888	02:38:31,680	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	TR was an interventionist
EDL	02:38:32,192	02:38:33,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before his time
EDL	02:38:33,216	02:38:39,616	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in the United States he's thought of as an extremist the Republican candidate for
EDL	02:38:39,616	02:38:46,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tell him to stop campaigning for him because he's so bellicose it's working against the Republican Party write your
EDL	02:38:46,016	02:38:48,576	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Letting Wilson in the opposition for traces warmongers
EDL	02:38:49,344	02:38:52,160	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's the guy though that appeared to be ahead of
EDL	02:38:52,160	02:38:54,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The curve when it came to figuring out
EDL	02:38:54,976	02:38:56,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germany needed to be dealt with
EDL	02:38:57,024	02:38:58,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Again from the British point of view
EDL	02:38:58,816	02:39:02,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a lot of this that you can look at and say the very things the Germans are being
EDL	02:39:02,400	02:39:04,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In Slam for doing
EDL	02:39:04,192	02:39:08,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are things that they were kind of forced into doing by what their opponents were up
EDL	02:39:08,544	02:39:09,056	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Up to
EDL	02:39:09,824	02:39:11,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The first world war is not the
EDL	02:39:11,360	02:39:13,408	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The clear-cut Good and Evil
EDL	02:39:13,408	02:39:15,200	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Separation at the Second World War
EDL	02:39:16,224	02:39:17,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He mentioned that
EDL	02:39:17,248	02:39:18,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4
EDL	02:39:18,016	02:39:21,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless if you're on one side of it it certainly is
EDL	02:39:21,600	02:39:26,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Prime Minister of Great Britain for about a couple of months when Wilson makes his

EDL	02:39:29,280	02:39:33,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In his Memoirs Lloyd George writing after the war can't help
EDL	02:39:33,888	02:39:35,424	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Take a shot
EDL	02:39:35,424	02:39:36,192	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At Wilson
EDL	02:39:36,704	02:39:39,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not because of what he did but because of how long it took him
EDL	02:39:41,056	02:39:42,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Speaking about Wilson speech now
EDL	02:39:43,104	02:39:44,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	George writes quote
EDL	02:39:45,152	02:39:48,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These principles were excellent and excellently expressed
EDL	02:39:48,736	02:39:52,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	DIY democracies of France in the British Commonwealth
EDL	02:39:52,064	02:39:56,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Penn already borne the burden they've been scorched by the heat of a thousand days
EDL	02:39:56,416	02:39:58,976	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the battle with this natural photo to Liberty

EDL	02:40:01,280	02:40:02,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Blind from his
EDL	02:40:02,048	02:40:04,608	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Speech they rejoiced George does
EDL	02:40:04,608	02:40:10,240	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At the Advent of this powerful help from the greatest democracy in the world at a time when troubles were multiplying
EDL	02:40:10,752	02:40:17,152	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They perhaps might be excused for thinking that issues so clear now to President Wilson ought to have been apparent early
EDL	02:40:17,152	02:40:18,176	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Clear to his eyes
EDL	02:40:18,176	02:40:20,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They felt grateful in their hearts to the Great America
EDL	02:40:20,736	02:40:22,272	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Theodore Roosevelt
EDL	02:40:22,272	02:40:24,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Whose Vision was so undimmed
EDL	02:40:24,320	02:40:28,672	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And whose sympathies were so sure from the outset of this Grim struggle for international right
EDL	02:40:29,440	02:40:29,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:40:30,976	02:40:33,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Winston Churchill sounded almost the exact
EDL	02:40:33,792	02:40:35,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Same way what took you so long
EDL	02:40:36,096	02:40:37,120	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Speaking of Wilson
EDL	02:40:37,632	02:40:38,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Peace out
EDL	02:40:39,168	02:40:39,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Quote
EDL	02:40:39,936	02:40:44,544	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He had behind his policy a reasoned explanation and massive
EDL	02:40:44,544	02:40:50,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And all must respect the motives of a Statesman who seeks to spare his country the waste in horrors of War
EDL	02:40:50,944	02:40:52,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But nothing Churchill rights
EDL	02:40:52,736	02:40:56,320	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can reconcile what he said after March 1917
EDL	02:40:56,320	02:40:58,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the guidance he had given before
EDL	02:40:58,368	02:41:02,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What he did in April 1917 could have been done in May 1950

EDL	02:41:04,256	02:41:06,048	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What abridgment of the slaughter
EDL	02:41:06,048	02:41:10,144	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's pairing of the agony what ruined what catastrophes would have been prevented
EDL	02:41:10,656	02:41:14,752	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And how many million homes would an empty chair be occupied today
EDL	02:41:14,752	02:41:19,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How different would be the shattered World in which Victors and vanquished alike are condemned to live
EDL	02:41:20,128	02:41:20,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:41:21,408	02:41:23,712	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Writing from the late 1920
EDL	02:41:23,712	02:41:24,736	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And seeing
EDL	02:41:24,736	02:41:28,064	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The mortally wounded and terribly scarred
EDL	02:41:28,576	02:41:29,344	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Continent
EDL	02:41:29,856	02:41:33,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which Winston Churchill remembers as being the height of World Civilization
EDL	02:41:34,464	02:41:37,792	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To him the US taking this long to get into the war
EDL	02:41:38,304	02:41:39,584	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Looks like something that
EDL	02:41:39,584	02:41:41,376	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cost you the world you knew
EDL	02:41:45,216	02:41:47,008	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A couple days after the president
EDL	02:41:47,008	02:41:48,032	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Gives his famous speech
EDL	02:41:48,800	02:41:50,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Congress vote to support him
EDL	02:41:50,848	02:41:52,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And take the nation to war
EDL	02:41:52,896	02:41:57,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Don't wasn't close by the way in the House of Representatives it was something like 374
EDL	02:41:57,248	02:41:58,528	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	375 2
EDL	02:41:58,528	02:41:59,040	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	50
EDL	02:41:59,808	02:42:01,856	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And as much as a Wipeout is that sounds
EDL	02:42:02,368	02:42:03,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I read somewhere that that's the
EDL	02:42:03,648	02:42:09,280	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The second most opposition the Congress has ever shown the president in a war vote the War of 1812 being the
EDL	02:42:09,792	02:42:10,304	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The most
EDL	02:42:11,584	02:42:12,352	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless
EDL	02:42:12,352	02:42:15,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Seems pretty clear that most of those people voting
EDL	02:42:15,936	02:42:17,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Punisher about
EDL	02:42:17,216	02:42:19,776	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What voting for going to war was going to mean
EDL	02:42:20,288	02:42:22,592	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The future mayor of New York.
EDL	02:42:22,592	02:42:23,104	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	LaGuardia was
EDL	02:42:23,616	02:42:24,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Congressman win this vote
EDL	02:42:25,664	02:42:31,808	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He said that 60% is a 30 years after the war that 60% of his Brethren were pretty sure this wasn't going to mean troops
EDL	02:42:33,344	02:42:35,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Westin send armies overseas
EDL	02:42:35,904	02:42:40,768	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The fight in on Europeans way they thought it was going to be like financial aid and Naval help
EDL	02:42:43,072	02:42:45,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mabel help is the one thing that us can do right away
EDL	02:42:45,888	02:42:47,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military help in an army
EDL	02:42:47,936	02:42:48,704	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's a problem
EDL	02:42:48,704	02:42:49,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because the US really doesn't
EDL	02:42:52,032	02:42:54,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In April 1917 the US Army's rank
EDL	02:42:54,336	02:42:55,360	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	17
EDL	02:42:55,360	02:42:56,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Largest
EDL	02:42:56,128	02:42:56,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the world
EDL	02:42:58,944	02:43:03,552	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Doesn't have any flamethrowers or any tanks or any gas masks or mortars
EDL	02:43:04,576	02:43:05,600	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	No grenades
EDL	02:43:06,624	02:43:09,696	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Aircraft are these rickety strange
EDL	02:43:09,696	02:43:10,464	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Beast
EDL	02:43:10,464	02:43:11,232	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The dino
EDL	02:43:12,000	02:43:15,328	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The right look like the planes the Wright brothers kind of
EDL	02:43:15,840	02:43:17,888	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Put together they don't look modern at all
EDL	02:43:19,168	02:43:20,448	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's not enough artillery
EDL	02:43:20,960	02:43:24,288	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Shells for the guns to shoot more than a few minutes by Western Front
EDL	02:43:24,800	02:43:25,568	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a standard
EDL	02:43:27,360	02:43:27,872	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Astoria
EDL	02:43:28,384	02:43:29,664	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Justice don'key says
EDL	02:43:30,176	02:43:34,016	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the US relatively speaking have been better prepared
EDL	02:43:34,016	02:43:37,088	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the American Revolution in the War of 1812
EDL	02:43:37,600	02:43:38,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then they were
EDL	02:43:38,368	02:43:39,392	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pairing for the first word
EDL	02:43:39,392	02:43:39,904	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	World War
EDL	02:43:40,672	02:43:44,256	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I disagree with him about that but his point is well taken
EDL	02:43:44,256	02:43:47,072	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The United States if it's going to be any help to Europe
EDL	02:43:47,072	02:43:52,448	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You're just going to have to survive while it waits for this help to be accumulated the only place the US
EDL	02:43:52,448	02:43:58,336	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can help right away as with money which they were kind of doing already going to lower interest rates and give better deals but
EDL	02:43:58,336	02:44:00,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a continuation of what was already happening
EDL	02:44:00,640	02:44:01,920	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the use of the Navy
EDL	02:44:02,432	02:44:04,224	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The thing the Navy can do right away
EDL	02:44:04,992	02:44:11,136	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is help against the submarines cuz we said in April 1917 the submarines take more than 400
EDL	02:44:11,648	02:44:12,416	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Merchant ships
EDL	02:44:13,696	02:44:19,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Britain's problem isn't it doesn't have to stop all the sinking have to stop the rate which is so much more than what it can reveal
EDL	02:44:20,352	02:44:25,728	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If it loses less ships and it can build a month it's doing well if it loses more ships than they can build a month it's in trouble
EDL	02:44:27,008	02:44:28,800	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Height of the submarine war will be
EDL	02:44:28,800	02:44:32,128	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	February 1917 when unrestricted Warfare is declared
EDL	02:44:32,128	02:44:32,640	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the next date
EDL	02:44:33,664	02:44:34,944	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is when Britain
EDL	02:44:34,944	02:44:35,968	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lives or dies
EDL	02:44:35,968	02:44:42,368	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I thought of the steaks and Lloyd George and Churchill them all these guys go out of their way to talk about the almost a lot
EDL	02:44:42,368	02:44:44,928	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Farm is the word Lloyd George Lloyd George says
EDL	02:44:44,928	02:44:46,208	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But there are some of the most
EDL	02:44:46,208	02:44:51,840	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cautious people in his cabinet that are starting to Muse out loud about maybe we better make peace while we still have some ships afloat
EDL	02:44:54,144	02:44:55,936	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He says the Germans were getting gleeful
EDL	02:44:56,448	02:45:02,848	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But at times they just had these reports coming and it made all the pro submarine people seem to be perfectly
EDL	02:45:02,848	02:45:09,248	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were all of a sudden going to win the war Churchill said we went from being you know the side that had time on our side
EDL	02:45:09,248	02:45:15,648	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Why do we can just wait this out and everyday the Germans were losing the war little bit more to having the tables flipping out I'm was on the German side
EDL	02:45:15,648	02:45:17,952	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the British had to come up with countermeasures
EDL	02:45:17,952	02:45:19,744	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or lose the war fast
EDL	02:45:20,768	02:45:21,536	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They not only did
EDL	02:45:22,304	02:45:24,352	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it was the civilian leadership
EDL	02:45:24,352	02:45:26,400	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The pushed for the answer that turned out to make the biggest
EDL	02:45:27,936	02:45:30,752	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is sort of one of these early indications of something is changing
EDL	02:45:32,032	02:45:36,384	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For years the military men have had almost unquestioned Authority
EDL	02:45:36,896	02:45:40,480	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To choose whatever path for Fighting the War they wanted to know matter what happened
EDL	02:45:40,992	02:45:41,760	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But now
EDL	02:45:41,760	02:45:46,112	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How many people have died in so many disasters in so much of the same tactic seeming to
EDL	02:45:46,112	02:45:52,512	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know equal the same results except more body stacking higher and higher that there was push back now from civilian leaders
EDL	02:45:52,512	02:45:54,816	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lloyd George and Britain is one of these guys who
EDL	02:45:54,816	02:45:57,632	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who says openly that my job is to protect the soldier in the field
EDL	02:45:58,144	02:46:01,216	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And to the soldier in the field of General his biggest enemy sometime
EDL	02:46:01,728	02:46:08,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you could hear all this talk about the stupidity of the military leaders even Churchill kind of goes out of his way to say that the
EDL	02:46:08,127	02:46:09,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military experts were all against
EDL	02:46:09,919	02:46:11,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The solution that ended up solving the subproblem
EDL	02:46:12,479	02:46:16,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was a civilian leaders for the most part that pushed the idea that one the day
EDL	02:46:17,343	02:46:19,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The idea was both breathtakingly simple
EDL	02:46:19,903	02:46:21,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And Incredibly complex
EDL	02:46:22,207	02:46:23,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The idea was Convoy
EDL	02:46:25,279	02:46:27,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The grouping of ships into large
EDL	02:46:28,607	02:46:29,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Formation
EDL	02:46:29,887	02:46:35,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Surrounding them with warships and escorts and sending these large bodies of ships across
EDL	02:46:35,775	02:46:37,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Organize times and schedules
EDL	02:46:39,359	02:46:42,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The military man off and believe that this was just going to group your targets
EDL	02:46:42,943	02:46:43,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the submarine
EDL	02:46:43,967	02:46:47,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Make it even easier to line ships up like in the shooting gallery
EDL	02:46:47,807	02:46:52,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When it was experimented on again the civilian leaders pushing to experiment with this
EDL	02:46:52,927	02:46:54,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The results were fantastic
EDL	02:46:54,719	02:46:55,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Almost right away
EDL	02:46:57,791	02:47:00,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you about that approach these kinds of formations often got sunk
EDL	02:47:01,375	02:47:03,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The idea that it was going to be easier to spot
EDL	02:47:03,679	02:47:10,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fifty or sixty ships on the water rather than a single ship turned out to not be true in the in the vast spaces of the Ocean Beach
EDL	02:47:10,079	02:47:11,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Eagle convoys got
EDL	02:47:11,359	02:47:13,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Swallowed up to and is Churchill said
EDL	02:47:13,407	02:47:19,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When these convoys made it across the water and slipped through the blockade instead of having one ship make it through the German blockade you had 40
EDL	02:47:19,807	02:47:20,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	5460 ships do
EDL	02:47:23,135	02:47:28,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By October 1917 of 99 convoys heading to Great Britain
EDL	02:47:28,255	02:47:30,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With more than 1500 ships in them
EDL	02:47:31,327	02:47:32,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Only 10
EDL	02:47:32,863	02:47:34,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're still part of the Convoy we're song
EDL	02:47:35,935	02:47:36,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	14 more
EDL	02:47:36,959	02:47:38,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's training.
EDL	02:47:38,239	02:47:38,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lottery
EDL	02:47:39,775	02:47:40,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Those are
EDL	02:47:41,311	02:47:43,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Easily replaceable losses
EDL	02:47:43,615	02:47:46,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And by October 1917 it was clear
EDL	02:47:46,687	02:47:48,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans were no longer going to be able
EDL	02:47:48,735	02:47:49,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The sink
EDL	02:47:49,503	02:47:50,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More shipping
EDL	02:47:50,783	02:47:51,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The new British
EDL	02:47:51,807	02:47:52,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Could replace
EDL	02:47:52,575	02:47:53,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's more
EDL	02:47:53,343	02:47:54,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They now have us ship
EDL	02:47:54,879	02:47:55,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We aren't helping to replace the
EDL	02:47:58,463	02:47:59,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As you might imagine
EDL	02:47:59,743	02:48:01,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The whole decision on
EDL	02:48:01,023	02:48:01,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany
EDL	02:48:02,559	02:48:03,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To engage in this
EDL	02:48:03,583	02:48:04,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can a submarine
EDL	02:48:04,351	02:48:07,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Walker is one of the most if not the most criticized
EDL	02:48:07,935	02:48:08,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Decision
EDL	02:48:08,959	02:48:09,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The German leadership ever
EDL	02:48:12,031	02:48:13,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Understandable
EDL	02:48:13,055	02:48:15,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know what kind of once again puts the lie to
EDL	02:48:15,359	02:48:16,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The stereotype
EDL	02:48:16,383	02:48:17,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Have the Germans as sort of a
EDL	02:48:17,919	02:48:20,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Applauding methodical sort of
EDL	02:48:21,503	02:48:23,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Conservative sort of leadership style
EDL	02:48:24,063	02:48:25,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because in both world wars
EDL	02:48:25,599	02:48:27,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Germans would prove to be great
EDL	02:48:27,391	02:48:27,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Creek Camp
EDL	02:48:28,927	02:48:29,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They just weren't lucky
EDL	02:48:30,975	02:48:35,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they were willing many times or so to throw caution to the wind and try these things
EDL	02:48:35,071	02:48:38,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Innocence though it's a defense mechanism when you are the weaker party
EDL	02:48:40,191	02:48:43,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mean to me the analogy that works best in that in the war
EDL	02:48:44,031	02:48:46,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That that we have going right now is to weight-lift
EDL	02:48:46,847	02:48:51,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are competing against each other and one of these weightlifters is bigger and stronger than the other
EDL	02:48:51,455	02:48:54,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One which is obviously a huge advantage in weight lifting
EDL	02:48:54,527	02:48:55,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it isn't everything
EDL	02:48:56,831	02:48:58,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the weaker weightlifter has to
EDL	02:48:58,623	02:48:59,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Try
EDL	02:48:59,647	02:49:01,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You need to make up for it with technique
EDL	02:49:01,695	02:49:02,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And training
EDL	02:49:02,719	02:49:03,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And will to win
EDL	02:49:05,279	02:49:05,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And maybe
EDL	02:49:06,303	02:49:06,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Give me some chances
EDL	02:49:07,839	02:49:09,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's Germany strategy for the
EDL	02:49:09,631	02:49:10,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This war
EDL	02:49:10,399	02:49:13,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you know you're seeing so many aspects
EDL	02:49:13,215	02:49:13,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I've changed
EDL	02:49:14,495	02:49:17,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the 19th century to the 20th century that you
EDL	02:49:17,055	02:49:19,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can point you in the story because that's really the theme when you look at
EDL	02:49:20,639	02:49:21,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You in a big picture
EDL	02:49:22,687	02:49:24,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany has transformed
EDL	02:49:24,223	02:49:25,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the recent
EDL	02:49:25,247	02:49:27,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1916 the year before this time we're in now
EDL	02:49:27,551	02:49:29,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm really in a old style
EDL	02:49:29,343	02:49:35,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Monarchy with legislative in a balancing out to something that looks much more like a 20th century military dick
EDL	02:49:36,511	02:49:40,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That doesn't happen overnight and it almost kind of happens because it needs to
EDL	02:49:40,351	02:49:43,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The only way Germany has a chance in this war is to be
EDL	02:49:44,191	02:49:44,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The technique man
EDL	02:49:45,471	02:49:49,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And have the greater will to win all those things I said about the smaller weightlifter
EDL	02:49:49,055	02:49:50,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Germany has to organize it
EDL	02:49:50,847	02:49:51,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's Society
EDL	02:49:51,615	02:49:52,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More efficiently
EDL	02:49:52,639	02:49:53,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then the more powerful
EDL	02:49:53,663	02:49:54,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Allied temp
EDL	02:49:54,687	02:49:56,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If it's going to stand a chance in one of the things that happens is
EDL	02:49:56,991	02:50:00,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When you get Hindenburg and ludendorff in there remember the 2 German Commanders
EDL	02:50:00,831	02:50:01,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We talked about
EDL	02:50:01,599	02:50:03,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This military team but
EDL	02:50:03,135	02:50:03,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's really only one day
EDL	02:50:04,415	02:50:04,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ludendorff
EDL	02:50:05,951	02:50:10,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He takes on more and more the powers that in the twentieth century we see over and over again
EDL	02:50:10,303	02:50:16,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In regions where you have one strong man who started his dictatorial control in the German start to try to organize their society
EDL	02:50:16,703	02:50:17,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To make it more efficient
EDL	02:50:17,983	02:50:18,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Like
EDL	02:50:18,751	02:50:21,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You're being able to tell workers where they're going to work
EDL	02:50:21,567	02:50:24,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a controlling people down to that level because
EDL	02:50:24,127	02:50:25,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As one
EDL	02:50:25,151	02:50:26,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The German leader said
EDL	02:50:26,431	02:50:30,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The goal is to turn Germany into one vast Munitions fact
EDL	02:50:31,039	02:50:33,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To do that requires a sort of single-minded
EDL	02:50:33,599	02:50:35,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fitness and in a lot of power concentrated in one person
EDL	02:50:36,671	02:50:38,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At this stage in the war that person is ludent
EDL	02:50:38,975	02:50:41,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hindenburg took over 1916
EDL	02:50:41,279	02:50:43,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the first thing they did was sort of doing an audit
EDL	02:50:43,839	02:50:46,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Of how the war is going and what we're doing to fight it in the condition
EDL	02:50:47,423	02:50:51,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the first condition you notice when you take over the entire War
EDL	02:50:51,007	02:50:52,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is on the Western Front
EDL	02:50:52,799	02:50:55,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You have about two and a half million men
EDL	02:50:55,615	02:50:57,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Manning the barricades
EDL	02:50:57,151	02:50:58,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The other side has a mouth
EDL	02:50:58,687	02:50:59,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4 million man
EDL	02:50:59,711	02:51:02,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And their numbers are increasing every month how do those trends
EDL	02:51:03,807	02:51:05,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You have food riot
EDL	02:51:05,343	02:51:06,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's at home women
EDL	02:51:06,879	02:51:09,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fighting with police officers in the streets
EDL	02:51:09,183	02:51:11,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because they can't get the food they need you have
EDL	02:51:11,999	02:51:18,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Strikes in a bunch of the major firms in a bunch of the cities and they get so bad sometimes the Army has to be called in
EDL	02:51:18,655	02:51:19,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To disperse the strikers
EDL	02:51:20,703	02:51:27,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So the government is now going in and sending strike leaders to the front to get him out of the way mean the society is under
EDL	02:51:27,103	02:51:28,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Severe stress and we already talked about the food
EDL	02:51:29,407	02:51:30,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean there's a quote
EDL	02:51:30,687	02:51:31,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From Ice glaciers
EDL	02:51:32,479	02:51:34,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sums it up when he talks about this
EDL	02:51:34,271	02:51:35,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is Pure Eatery now he quit he says quote
EDL	02:51:36,319	02:51:41,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Soon alluded ham thrilled us more than the fall of Bucharest or some apparent success elsewhere
EDL	02:51:42,463	02:51:42,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	02:51:43,999	02:51:47,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These people's knees are shrunk down to the most basic human survival level
EDL	02:51:48,095	02:51:52,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Yeah great we took Bucharest but did you see that ham we have in the cellar that we found I mean you know
EDL	02:51:53,727	02:51:55,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Something any of us could understand
EDL	02:51:55,775	02:51:56,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The star
EDL	02:51:57,311	02:51:59,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The pressure is on Germany's military leaders
EDL	02:51:59,615	02:52:06,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Get to do something you can't very well launch an offensive on the Western Front when you're outnumbered the way you are you going to be lucky to survive at all
EDL	02:52:06,015	02:52:08,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1916 was terrible for the Germans on the Western Front
EDL	02:52:08,831	02:52:10,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So you launch the submarines
EDL	02:52:10,623	02:52:11,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That becomes
EDL	02:52:11,647	02:52:14,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Your chance to win the war without having to
EDL	02:52:14,207	02:52:15,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do the Imposter
EDL	02:52:15,231	02:52:15,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the Western Front
EDL	02:52:17,791	02:52:18,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now ludendorff
EDL	02:52:19,327	02:52:20,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is a very strange
EDL	02:52:21,631	02:52:24,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is Commander Germany you'll sort of in more everyday
EDL	02:52:24,447	02:52:25,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the story
EDL	02:52:25,215	02:52:27,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hindenburg is partner with the Charisma guy
EDL	02:52:27,775	02:52:31,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's a old man he really if he have been great at one time in his life
EDL	02:52:31,615	02:52:33,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's in his dotage now
EDL	02:52:33,151	02:52:37,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's he's the revered public-facing is governed by ludendorff the guy behind the scenes
EDL	02:52:38,015	02:52:43,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And we talked about him and he's the one who way back in 1914 got that City in Belgium
EDL	02:52:43,903	02:52:48,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To surrender by banging on the front doors with the hilt of his sword
EDL	02:52:48,255	02:52:51,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know when he easily could have been killed walk right up to the front door
EDL	02:52:51,583	02:52:54,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Loan guide I mean that he's an interesting guy
EDL	02:52:54,655	02:52:56,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's flawed in a lot of ways and
EDL	02:52:56,447	02:52:59,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Depending on what your story and you grab you're going to hear that
EDL	02:52:59,007	02:53:05,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The bumbling psychologically fragile ludendorff or you're going to see this this great Gambler who
EDL	02:53:05,407	02:53:10,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who was who was fantastic at certain things and remember all these generals are 19th century man
EDL	02:53:10,783	02:53:12,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're adapting Under Fire
EDL	02:53:12,831	02:53:15,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At a quick Pace to all these new conditions
EDL	02:53:15,903	02:53:17,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And just when you think they're getting it
EDL	02:53:17,695	02:53:18,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some new develop
EDL	02:53:18,719	02:53:24,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And comes around maybe you're starting to understand the physics of land Warfare a year or two into the first world war of your general
EDL	02:53:24,351	02:53:29,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then tanks appear and then gas appears every what do you do with all this airplane start having a real impact
EDL	02:53:29,983	02:53:34,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You don't just have to learn you have to be flexible to continue to evolve as these generals
EDL	02:53:35,359	02:53:36,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nobody's greater
EDL	02:53:37,151	02:53:38,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Endorse not bad
EDL	02:53:40,223	02:53:41,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ludendorff changes
EDL	02:53:41,759	02:53:42,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The basic strategy
EDL	02:53:42,783	02:53:43,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The guy
EDL	02:53:43,807	02:53:44,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who came before
EDL	02:53:44,831	02:53:46,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Von falkenhayn strategy was
EDL	02:53:46,623	02:53:49,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Basically defend every inch of territory
EDL	02:53:49,183	02:53:52,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ludendorff is perfectly willing to give up territory in exchange for killing
EDL	02:53:54,559	02:53:57,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He'll pull off things like operation Albury
EDL	02:53:57,375	02:54:00,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Right about this time period start in late February 1917

EDL	02:54:01,471	02:54:02,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Holdback
EDL	02:54:02,751	02:54:04,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Troops that are that are in an egg
EDL	02:54:04,543	02:54:10,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bose Lupin the line the line is a straight because of fighting here in there it's bulging out in some places lyrics
EDL	02:54:10,943	02:54:11,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kingston
EDL	02:54:11,711	02:54:15,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he begins in early 1917 to pull troops back there
EDL	02:54:15,295	02:54:20,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Their way out there in no man's land and straighten up his line he'll cut off like 25 miles
EDL	02:54:20,671	02:54:21,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the Western Front by doing this
EDL	02:54:22,975	02:54:26,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Freeing up 13 or 14 division is basically a German army
EDL	02:54:27,327	02:54:28,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To be used elsewhere
EDL	02:54:29,375	02:54:30,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not too complicated maneuver
EDL	02:54:31,423	02:54:35,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But his strategy in 1917 as far as he's concerned is going to be defense
EDL	02:54:35,775	02:54:40,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So he's going to line things up and prepare for that and it gives him all kinds of advantage of this
EDL	02:54:40,639	02:54:41,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is one area
EDL	02:54:42,175	02:54:43,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It'll be called the Hindenburg line
EDL	02:54:43,967	02:54:44,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He puts together
EDL	02:54:45,759	02:54:51,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is hard to imagine making the defenses of 1916 deeper and stronger and more
EDL	02:54:52,159	02:54:54,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Impenetrable but that's what they do in 90
EDL	02:54:54,719	02:54:57,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	June 17th the Hindenburg line is an example of
EDL	02:54:57,791	02:54:59,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who endorsed idea of Defense in depth
EDL	02:54:59,839	02:55:02,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what that means is it the German defenses go back
EDL	02:55:02,911	02:55:03,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Jack Ma
EDL	02:55:04,703	02:55:08,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they're designed to act like a rubber band so that when something runs into them
EDL	02:55:08,799	02:55:13,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He just stretches and stretches and stretches in the farther it stretches the more resistance you find
EDL	02:55:13,663	02:55:15,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then eventually just snaps back
EDL	02:55:16,991	02:55:17,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Devious
EDL	02:55:18,015	02:55:24,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The way it's designed and I don't need to get into all the details it's the machine guns on the barbed wire and the pill boxes and all these things but they
EDL	02:55:24,415	02:55:29,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just go far back into the distance and there's no more trenches anywhere near the front line
EDL	02:55:29,023	02:55:35,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because those are too easy to pick out and and she'll everybody just sort of sits in holes in the ground in a sort of a random Pat
EDL	02:55:35,423	02:55:36,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's no lie
EDL	02:55:37,727	02:55:40,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In fact there's hardly any Germans when you first get to it
EDL	02:55:40,543	02:55:46,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's just a few Germans holding you up and taking casualties and then as soon as they can't keep you at Bay anymore they were three facts
EDL	02:55:46,943	02:55:48,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The next line and then to the next line
EDL	02:55:48,991	02:55:54,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And every step of the way the defenses are a little bit stronger and the Germans are a little bit more numerous
EDL	02:55:54,623	02:55:57,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As the British or the French were attacking them are getting less
EDL	02:55:57,695	02:55:58,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And less numerous
EDL	02:55:58,975	02:56:01,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then is there getting more tired of me I thought to myself
EDL	02:56:01,791	02:56:02,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some of these
EDL	02:56:02,559	02:56:06,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Defenses go back 9:10 Mi it would kill me without any resistance
EDL	02:56:07,167	02:56:08,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Imagine trying to do it
EDL	02:56:08,959	02:56:10,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With machine guns
EDL	02:56:10,239	02:56:11,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And rifle fire at
EDL	02:56:12,031	02:56:13,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Grenades
EDL	02:56:13,055	02:56:14,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Artillery I may just
EDL	02:56:15,103	02:56:16,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You just can't imagine
EDL	02:56:16,639	02:56:22,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Having much left if you even get the nine or ten miles to the end of the defenses and then waiting for you there
EDL	02:56:23,551	02:56:24,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are German army
EDL	02:56:25,343	02:56:28,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're going to counter attack anything that the last
EDL	02:56:28,415	02:56:30,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That makes it all the way through these defenses
EDL	02:56:31,231	02:56:37,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is absolutely almost impenetrable and devious if you only have 2 and 1/2 2.8 million men
EDL	02:56:37,887	02:56:41,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To fight four or four and a half million men on the other side
EDL	02:56:41,215	02:56:43,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is a good way to equalize the odd
EDL	02:56:43,775	02:56:47,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is a weightlifter who figured out a way to lift more
EDL	02:56:47,103	02:56:47,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Denny's
EDL	02:56:47,871	02:56:48,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bigger opponent
EDL	02:56:49,663	02:56:50,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	My favorite
EDL	02:56:50,431	02:56:51,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Part of the Hindenburg
EDL	02:56:51,455	02:56:52,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Red line defense
EDL	02:56:52,223	02:56:53,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military history
EDL	02:56:54,271	02:56:57,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is that they build a giant
EDL	02:56:57,087	02:56:57,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Moat
EDL	02:56:58,111	02:57:00,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In front of it I mean there's no other way to
EDL	02:57:00,159	02:57:03,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Pray that it's an absolutely perpendicular walls
EDL	02:57:03,231	02:57:03,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Trench
EDL	02:57:04,255	02:57:06,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That is between 9 and 10 ft deep
EDL	02:57:07,583	02:57:08,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And 12 feet across
EDL	02:57:09,631	02:57:11,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's meant to stop every
EDL	02:57:11,423	02:57:16,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Define tanks especially Amino fall into the air and won't be able to climb up the perpendicular side
EDL	02:57:16,031	02:57:17,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it's not an easy job
EDL	02:57:17,823	02:57:20,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4 troops either end behind this
EDL	02:57:20,127	02:57:20,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Giant
EDL	02:57:21,407	02:57:27,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mold as you might imagine our machine gun positions and all kinds of defenses and more wire and all these sorts of things
EDL	02:57:27,807	02:57:30,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is crazy to think about having to attack something like
EDL	02:57:31,391	02:57:34,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what's more when ludendorff has
EDL	02:57:34,463	02:57:35,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People
EDL	02:57:35,231	02:57:35,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Retreat
EDL	02:57:35,999	02:57:39,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	SWTOR the Hindenburg line and give up these positions
EDL	02:57:39,071	02:57:40,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The hundreds
EDL	02:57:40,095	02:57:42,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thousands of Germans who died
EDL	02:57:42,143	02:57:44,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Contesting over the last couple of years
EDL	02:57:44,703	02:57:46,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He has soldiers destroyed
EDL	02:57:46,751	02:57:47,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Everything
EDL	02:57:48,031	02:57:49,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know as they go
EDL	02:57:49,567	02:57:52,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Creating a dead zone from the old front line to the new one
EDL	02:57:53,663	02:57:54,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Scorched-earth policy
EDL	02:57:54,943	02:57:56,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Something which by the way upset
EDL	02:57:56,991	02:57:58,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Crown Prince Rupert
EDL	02:57:58,527	02:58:02,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who was the field-marshal commanding some of the troops you had to do this destruction
EDL	02:58:02,111	02:58:04,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He was so upset he almost resigned over it
EDL	02:58:04,415	02:58:10,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And complained about it how this was Germany's reputation and in that discussion you basically ca19

EDL	02:58:17,727	02:58:19,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ludendorff a thoroughly
EDL	02:58:19,263	02:58:21,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	20th century Total War kind of guy
EDL	02:58:21,823	02:58:23,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a clash of cultures
EDL	02:58:23,359	02:58:26,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The 20th century 1 ludendorff got his way
EDL	02:58:26,431	02:58:29,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the troops of the German Army in a very old
EDL	02:58:29,247	02:58:30,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	School style
EDL	02:58:30,783	02:58:33,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Began creating a dead zone
EDL	02:58:33,855	02:58:39,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this part of France in front of the Hindenburg line and a dead zone that extended in some places 20 mi

EDL	02:58:46,911	02:58:48,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he Compares it to a kind of lunacy
EDL	02:58:49,727	02:58:50,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Image
EDL	02:58:50,495	02:58:56,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's funny because if you think about people doing this in the second world war you think about them using mostly explosives and there were explosives used
EDL	02:58:57,151	02:58:59,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To create this dead zone but Germany needed her
EDL	02:58:59,711	02:59:02,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so a lot of this stuff was done by hand
EDL	02:59:03,807	02:59:08,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And younger says it had a bad effect on the troops and he also blame some of it on
EDL	02:59:08,671	02:59:09,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What he calls
EDL	02:59:09,439	02:59:11,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Economic Times we live in
EDL	02:59:11,999	02:59:14,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or something like that and what he really means by that is this
EDL	02:59:15,327	02:59:17,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Total War 20th century sort of mentality

EDL	02:59:27,359	02:59:31,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The villages we passed through on our way had to look a vast lunatic asylum

EDL	02:59:38,367	02:59:39,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Trees were cut down

EDL	02:59:45,791	02:59:50,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We saw men dashing about wearing suits and dresses left behind by the inhabit

EDL	02:59:52,703	02:59:56,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With destructive cunning they found the roof trees of the houses
EDL	02:59:56,799	02:59:59,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fixed ropes to them and then with concerted shouts
EDL	02:59:59,871	03:00:02,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hold until they all came tumbling down
EDL	03:00:02,431	03:00:05,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Others were swinging pile driving hammers
EDL	03:00:05,247	03:00:08,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And went around smashing everything that got in their way
EDL	03:00:08,319	03:00:12,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the flower pots on the window sills two-hole ornate Conservatory

EDL	03:00:39,039	03:00:41,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The scenes were reminiscent of a madhouse
EDL	03:00:41,343	03:00:43,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the effect on the men with similar
EDL	03:00:43,647	03:00:45,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Half bunny half repellent
EDL	03:00:45,951	03:00:47,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were all so we can see right away
EDL	03:00:47,999	03:00:50,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bad for the men's morale and honor
EDL	03:00:50,303	03:00:55,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here for the first time I witnessed wanton destruction that I was later in life to see 2xs
EDL	03:00:55,423	03:00:59,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is something that is unhealthily bound up with the economic thinking of our age
EDL	03:01:00,031	03:01:03,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it does more harm than good to the destroyer and dishonors the soldier
EDL	03:01:04,383	03:01:04,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	03:01:06,431	03:01:09,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it should be remembered that this isn't a war damage
EDL	03:01:09,759	03:01:16,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Country this this area that they're pulling apart now in creating a dead zone was an idyllic part of France it wasn't touched
EDL	03:01:16,159	03:01:20,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By The Wharf you weren't right on the front in the first world war especially in the Western Front
EDL	03:01:20,255	03:01:21,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Things were great behind
EDL	03:01:22,047	03:01:25,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the complaints French soldiers on leave happy as you can get
EDL	03:01:25,119	03:01:29,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	20 or 30 miles behind the front line and everything is like there's not even a war going on
EDL	03:01:30,751	03:01:34,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know they see men with their sweethearts prowling around going to restaurants for dinner
EDL	03:01:34,847	03:01:38,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a town 30 miles from the front and it's like it's another world
EDL	03:01:39,199	03:01:41,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So they're tearing down these beautiful
EDL	03:01:41,759	03:01:42,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Parts of France
EDL	03:01:42,783	03:01:45,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To create this dead zone they're destroying every
EDL	03:01:46,623	03:01:47,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then
EDL	03:01:47,903	03:01:49,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're leaving booby traps
EDL	03:01:49,951	03:01:51,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because when the Germans give up their position
EDL	03:01:52,255	03:01:55,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're going to retreat as I said sometimes 20 miles in this one area
EDL	03:01:55,839	03:01:57,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All the way back to the main line

EDL	03:01:59,423	03:02:04,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Allies are going to follow them when they follow them they're going to run into these town when they run into these towns
EDL	03:02:04,799	03:02:08,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're going to run into and younger talked about it earlier booby

EDL	03:02:15,295	03:02:17,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Very fine wires almost invisible
EDL	03:02:17,855	03:02:20,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're stretched across the entrance of buildings and shelters
EDL	03:02:20,927	03:02:23,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which set off explosive charges at the faintest touch
EDL	03:02:24,511	03:02:28,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In some places near Road ditches were dug across roads
EDL	03:02:28,095	03:02:29,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And shells hidden in them
EDL	03:02:29,631	03:02:31,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were then covered over by a large
EDL	03:02:31,423	03:02:32,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Plank and Earth
EDL	03:02:32,703	03:02:33,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Screen over them
EDL	03:02:33,727	03:02:37,311	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A nail has been driven into the plank only just above the shelf
EDL	03:02:37,823	03:02:41,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The space was measured so that marching troops could pass over the spot safely
EDL	03:02:41,919	03:02:47,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the moment the first trucker field gun rumbled up the board would give in the nail which off the shell
EDL	03:02:47,807	03:02:49,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where there were spiteful Timebomb

EDL	03:04:12,287	03:04:14,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not a lot of generals would pull disc
EDL	03:04:14,079	03:04:14,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kind of stunt
EDL	03:04:15,359	03:04:19,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was a game-changer in many respects I mean that hold dead zone for example
EDL	03:04:19,711	03:04:21,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Proved to be a huge problem
EDL	03:04:21,759	03:04:24,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For British and French forces to try to overcome
EDL	03:04:24,575	03:04:25,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They move into this
EDL	03:04:26,111	03:04:27,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cratered
EDL	03:04:27,135	03:04:31,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Destroy denuded area where even the wells have been poisoned how do you even

EDL	03:04:49,151	03:04:52,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I can do it and there are railroads bringing supplies up to the back
EDL	03:04:53,247	03:04:54,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What ludendorff
EDL	03:04:55,295	03:04:56,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was wrong foot
EDL	03:04:56,831	03:04:59,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Allies he stole the night Marchi
EDL	03:05:00,159	03:05:02,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Seize the initiative he changed
EDL	03:05:02,207	03:05:03,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Their plans
EDL	03:05:03,231	03:05:06,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's for 1917 without knowing what their plans were
EDL	03:05:06,559	03:05:10,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Assembly figured if I do this all the planning they've been doing for months
EDL	03:05:11,423	03:05:12,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will be obsolete
EDL	03:05:12,959	03:05:14,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're planning to have mito

EDL	03:05:16,031	03:05:17,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Closer to Paris than I am
EDL	03:05:20,383	03:05:22,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If you were an Allied General how would you deal with it
EDL	03:05:23,967	03:05:30,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And if you said you don't want to deal with this problem at this looks like an impenetrable nightmare that just puts you in League
EDL	03:05:30,367	03:05:33,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With those military thinkers at the time who were known as Eastern
EDL	03:05:34,463	03:05:35,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These people who thought
EDL	03:05:36,255	03:05:38,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hacking on the Western Front was insane
EDL	03:05:39,327	03:05:41,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Look at the defenses who would do that
EDL	03:05:42,655	03:05:45,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Prime minister Britain Lloyd George is one of these guys
EDL	03:05:47,007	03:05:47,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here's the thing though
EDL	03:05:48,799	03:05:52,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can always find generals and Military Commanders
EDL	03:05:52,639	03:05:54,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who no matter how
EDL	03:05:54,943	03:05:56,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Impossible the military task looks
EDL	03:05:57,759	03:06:01,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will be optimistic about explaining to you how their play
EDL	03:06:01,087	03:06:02,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Plan will overcome
EDL	03:06:03,135	03:06:03,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After all
EDL	03:06:04,415	03:06:07,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	People don't get those jobs by explaining how they
EDL	03:06:07,231	03:06:07,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hantover
EDL	03:06:07,999	03:06:09,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here come the enemies
EDL	03:06:09,023	03:06:09,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Defenses
EDL	03:06:10,815	03:06:11,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We told you earlier that
EDL	03:06:11,839	03:06:12,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The French soccer
EDL	03:06:13,119	03:06:16,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Their military leader that they've had since the beginning of the war Joseph chakra
EDL	03:06:16,959	03:06:18,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Any sort of going to kick him upstairs
EDL	03:06:19,007	03:06:23,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And before they do they have another one of those yearly meetings were all the allies
EDL	03:06:23,103	03:06:27,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Russians in the British in the French and all the other allies they get together they have this meeting and they try to coordinate next
EDL	03:06:27,711	03:06:28,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Deers military plan
EDL	03:06:29,503	03:06:30,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So that when
EDL	03:06:30,527	03:06:36,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British in the French attack on the Western Front the Russians at the same time attack on the east in the Italians attack in the South and everybody's pushing in
EDL	03:06:36,927	03:06:39,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Multiple directions all at once portion the Germans to
EDL	03:06:39,743	03:06:40,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know
EDL	03:06:40,767	03:06:42,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Maybe break some
EDL	03:06:42,047	03:06:44,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean the Central Powers at this point of liking
EDL	03:06:44,095	03:06:44,863	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Eggs
EDL	03:06:44,863	03:06:51,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And as soon as you can break into any one of their sides east west north south I mean you feel like the war
EDL	03:06:51,263	03:06:52,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will be over
EDL	03:06:52,031	03:06:53,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they're all holding steady
EDL	03:06:53,823	03:06:57,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The most commanders are looking at the Western Front and say but nothing is a steady is that
EDL	03:07:00,223	03:07:00,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Must we attack it
EDL	03:07:02,015	03:07:04,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The friend should always believe yes you must
EDL	03:07:04,319	03:07:07,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Course they're a little biased because the Germans are on their soil and they would like to
EDL	03:07:07,391	03:07:08,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Does he even pushed off
EDL	03:07:08,671	03:07:10,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When Joseph jafra

EDL	03:07:13,791	03:07:20,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are we going to do in 1917 what's the plan Jennifer tells him his plan is a repetition of the song the battle that was
EDL	03:07:20,191	03:07:24,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just wrapping up the battle that was so horrible for British and even for French forces
EDL	03:07:26,079	03:07:31,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Going to wear the Germans down in in in a several months long battle that forces them to throw in the last of their resources
EDL	03:07:32,479	03:07:33,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	French politicians were horrified
EDL	03:07:35,039	03:07:39,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The last thing they wanted is about a like that because as far as they were concerned
EDL	03:07:39,135	03:07:41,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How did anybody know that it wouldn't be the French Nation
EDL	03:07:41,695	03:07:43,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The true in all their resources in men
EDL	03:07:46,303	03:07:48,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is part of the reason is I forgot

EDL	03:07:49,375	03:07:50,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Different politicians
EDL	03:07:51,679	03:07:52,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just like British politician
EDL	03:07:53,471	03:07:55,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were starting to do the unthinkable
EDL	03:07:55,775	03:07:57,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In terms of 19th century attitude
EDL	03:07:58,591	03:08:03,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were starting to interfere with military decisions because they were losing faith that
EDL	03:08:03,199	03:08:05,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The people making the military decisions
EDL	03:08:05,247	03:08:06,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How to write priority
EDL	03:08:07,807	03:08:08,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The politicians
EDL	03:08:09,087	03:08:09,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wer
EDL	03:08:10,367	03:08:10,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Worried
EDL	03:08:11,391	03:08:12,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About the casualty
EDL	03:08:13,183	03:08:16,511	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	One of the big criticisms especially from the soldiers in the field
EDL	03:08:17,023	03:08:18,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is it the generals weren't
EDL	03:08:20,095	03:08:24,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The guy who gets the job is the main allied military commander 1970 we mentioned earlier
EDL	03:08:24,703	03:08:25,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is a guy named Robert nivelle
EDL	03:08:26,239	03:08:29,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Annabelle gets this job because he's the guy out there
EDL	03:08:30,079	03:08:31,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Optimistic about victory
EDL	03:08:32,383	03:08:34,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Remember generals do not get hired
EDL	03:08:35,199	03:08:37,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Promising to not overcome the enemies
EDL	03:08:37,759	03:08:41,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fences so there's an ingrown bias in the whole process
EDL	03:08:42,111	03:08:42,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Robyn Adele
EDL	03:08:43,647	03:08:45,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tells the French leadership
EDL	03:08:45,951	03:08:51,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When he takes over that you don't have to have another bottle of the song you don't have to have a grinding months-long battle
EDL	03:08:51,839	03:08:54,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can have a lightning bolt
EDL	03:08:55,935	03:08:56,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hammer stroke
EDL	03:08:56,959	03:08:58,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It just ends the war
EDL	03:08:58,751	03:08:59,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In
EDL	03:08:59,519	03:09:00,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	48 hours
EDL	03:09:01,823	03:09:04,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now it sounds crazy doesn't know where a bunch of French
EDL	03:09:04,383	03:09:06,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	General some of whom
EDL	03:09:06,175	03:09:08,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nouvelle leapfrogged over
EDL	03:09:08,735	03:09:12,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How they were guys who probably deserve the job at least 3 maybe 4
EDL	03:09:12,831	03:09:14,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	More than development eval was this
EDL	03:09:15,647	03:09:16,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's a
EDL	03:09:16,415	03:09:17,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Charmer
EDL	03:09:17,183	03:09:19,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's he's one of these people that can win anyone over
EDL	03:09:20,511	03:09:26,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He's not winning over these jealous General he leapfrogged but there's a lot of politicians that are sold
EDL	03:09:26,399	03:09:26,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When your bowel
EDL	03:09:27,679	03:09:28,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And some of them aren't even French
EDL	03:09:29,727	03:09:32,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Novelle has this great advantage over the other French
EDL	03:09:33,311	03:09:34,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military leaders
EDL	03:09:34,847	03:09:35,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He speaks English
EDL	03:09:36,895	03:09:39,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Repeat perfectly speak sit without an accent
EDL	03:09:39,199	03:09:39,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is Mother's Day
EDL	03:09:41,503	03:09:43,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So he's a charmer to begin with
EDL	03:09:43,295	03:09:47,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kind of a Salesman but people like him he doesn't feel slimy or sleazy
EDL	03:09:48,415	03:09:49,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He sort of an optimist
EDL	03:09:49,695	03:09:52,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he goes over to Brittany wins over even the
EDL	03:09:52,767	03:09:54,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Archie Sterner
EDL	03:09:54,559	03:09:55,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lloyd George
EDL	03:09:57,631	03:09:59,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was in there and explain to the British exactly how this
EDL	03:09:59,679	03:10:01,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Plan to rupture the Enemy Lines will work
EDL	03:10:02,239	03:10:04,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it involves creating a reserve
EDL	03:10:04,799	03:10:08,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	2728 divisions that are going to be like the spider in the web
EDL	03:10:08,895	03:10:14,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And as soon as the Germans are held in certain places and weekend and then this 27 divisions will go get him and it's going to take
EDL	03:10:15,039	03:10:15,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	48 hours
EDL	03:10:17,343	03:10:18,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	03:10:18,111	03:10:21,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Like any good salesman offering some of the money back guarantee
EDL	03:10:21,439	03:10:25,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a guarantee guarantee that nibbled tells everybody
EDL	03:10:25,535	03:10:28,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is if it doesn't work in 48 hours will call it off.
EDL	03:10:30,143	03:10:36,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now that's a promise to get rid of the part of these battles that's most troubling to people who care about dead people
EDL	03:10:36,799	03:10:37,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A lot of the Dead
EDL	03:10:39,103	03:10:43,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Unless you have just tragic first day is like the battle of the Somme fought in the battle of the Frontiers
EDL	03:10:43,711	03:10:44,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A lot of the deaths
EDL	03:10:44,991	03:10:51,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Happened because he's battled one for months and you could end up after 48 hours if you had a chance to see is it working or not working call it off it's now
EDL	03:10:51,391	03:10:57,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not working that takes a lot of the risk out of it and you can see why politicians would like that plan a lot more than Joseph opera singer
EDL	03:10:57,791	03:10:58,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Let's have another
EDL	03:10:58,559	03:11:00,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For 5 months long battle
EDL	03:11:03,679	03:11:04,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The problem is
EDL	03:11:04,703	03:11:06,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In hindsight is everyone knows
EDL	03:11:06,751	03:11:09,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nouvel was working on a on an idea
EDL	03:11:09,567	03:11:10,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It might not have been tenable
EDL	03:11:12,639	03:11:16,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Annabelle made his name at the Battle of Verdun at the very last stages of
EDL	03:11:16,223	03:11:18,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the Germans were being pushed back in the other direction
EDL	03:11:18,783	03:11:21,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a lot of historical debate over whether or not anything
EDL	03:11:21,855	03:11:23,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Novelle did
EDL	03:11:23,135	03:11:24,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was effective
EDL	03:11:24,159	03:11:30,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But even if it was affected it was effective at a very very low-level to all the sudden be the military leader in charge of not yet
EDL	03:11:30,559	03:11:32,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All of France's forces
EDL	03:11:32,095	03:11:37,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What kind of Britain's forces to who he will Clash developer clash with Britain's Commander Douglas Haig
EDL	03:11:37,471	03:11:41,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They do not like each other the egos of generals are proverbial anyway
EDL	03:11:41,567	03:11:43,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At least you guys were fighting about
EDL	03:11:43,103	03:11:45,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will create problems between Britain and France's allies

EDL	03:11:52,831	03:11:54,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is first real problem happens
EDL	03:11:55,647	03:11:57,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the Germans pull this

EDL	03:12:02,559	03:12:05,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Remind me a little of the British getting away at Gallipoli
EDL	03:12:05,375	03:12:08,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And fooling the Turks at the Turks didn't know that they'd laugh

EDL	03:12:13,311	03:12:14,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the British to find out they're gone
EDL	03:12:16,895	03:12:18,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I love the way it starts by the way starts with
EDL	03:12:18,943	03:12:22,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the British looking out over there trenches and seeing the German trenches
EDL	03:12:22,783	03:12:23,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Beanshell
EDL	03:12:24,063	03:12:27,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then coming to the realization that the German trenches and that they'd get there
EDL	03:12:27,903	03:12:30,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Facing off against there being shelled by German
EDL	03:12:30,975	03:12:32,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it's a German artillery
EDL	03:12:32,767	03:12:38,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Blowing up the trenches in destroying everything of value in it and then destroying the trenches so the British can't move up into the menus
EDL	03:12:40,703	03:12:41,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then of course
EDL	03:12:41,471	03:12:42,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Probing
EDL	03:12:42,239	03:12:43,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It must have been Erie
EDL	03:12:43,519	03:12:49,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were like single Germans left behind a shooter rifle off every now and then it just keep the Allied armies from pursuing to claw
EDL	03:12:49,919	03:12:50,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mostly
EDL	03:12:50,687	03:12:52,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But once it was
EDL	03:12:52,223	03:12:58,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What year that the Germans were pulling back into miles an miles church I said like 50 miles every place I rented more like 20 at the
EDL	03:12:58,367	03:12:59,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The farthest
EDL	03:12:59,135	03:13:00,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But nonetheless
EDL	03:13:00,159	03:13:03,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To pull back that far means your military maps are all different
EDL	03:13:03,743	03:13:04,511	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The place
EDL	03:13:05,023	03:13:08,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Let the hammer blow in nipples offensive was going to fall
EDL	03:13:08,351	03:13:10,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is the place ludendorff just make hate it
EDL	03:13:10,911	03:13:13,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Okay so as ludendorff probably intended
EDL	03:13:13,471	03:13:15,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You got to change your plans don't you
EDL	03:13:15,263	03:13:16,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You mean conditions on the ground a chain
EDL	03:13:17,567	03:13:21,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ennavale said I don't have to change my plans this all helps
EDL	03:13:21,663	03:13:22,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's my goal
EDL	03:13:23,199	03:13:25,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And this is where everything starts to fall apart in this
EDL	03:13:25,759	03:13:28,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Plan and yet at the same time you can see
EDL	03:13:28,575	03:13:29,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How
EDL	03:13:29,855	03:13:30,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These are such
EDL	03:13:30,879	03:13:35,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Huge Affairs involving so many months of preparation so much momentum
EDL	03:13:35,743	03:13:37,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But even if you find out
EDL	03:13:37,535	03:13:41,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Near the beginning of the of the battle that things have changed
EDL	03:13:41,631	03:13:43,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a momentum that you can't really even
EDL	03:13:43,679	03:13:47,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Stop in this case everything starts going wrong for me Bell before the whole Battle Star

EDL	03:13:51,359	03:13:52,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The campaign
EDL	03:13:52,895	03:13:56,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's sort of a diversionary campaign designed to
EDL	03:13:56,479	03:14:00,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Make the Germans move away from where niveles going to attack
EDL	03:14:00,319	03:14:03,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Start that's the part of this campaign

EDL	03:14:06,719	03:14:07,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It happens
EDL	03:14:07,743	03:14:10,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm next to the French position at a place called

EDL	03:14:13,119	03:14:15,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And at this battle for at least
EDL	03:14:15,679	03:14:16,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A few days
EDL	03:14:16,959	03:14:18,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Everyone gets a chance to

EDL	03:14:19,775	03:14:22,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Exactly how you would go about
EDL	03:14:22,079	03:14:25,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Striking defenses as Invincible as the Germans
EDL	03:14:26,175	03:14:26,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it looks a lot
EDL	03:14:27,455	03:14:28,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Like world

EDL	03:14:31,807	03:14:34,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you know several history is it pointed out that by the end of the first
EDL	03:14:35,391	03:14:36,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the armies are Proto

EDL	03:14:38,719	03:14:41,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are certain battles know during the war where you can say aha
EDL	03:14:42,303	03:14:43,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There is a big step for
EDL	03:14:43,839	03:14:45,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Forward towards that second World War
EDL	03:14:45,887	03:14:46,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	20th century
EDL	03:14:47,935	03:14:48,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a style of fighting
EDL	03:14:49,215	03:14:50,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's what the Battle of arras is known
EDL	03:14:51,775	03:14:54,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the grand scheme of things as we said
EDL	03:14:54,079	03:14:59,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is the spring offensive this is what the Allies do every year right the weather gets good in Spring we launch an offensive
EDL	03:15:00,223	03:15:06,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British and the French launched one together with a launch one in tandem the Italians do as we said many launching everywhere the Russians
EDL	03:15:06,623	03:15:07,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is the Big Spring offensive
EDL	03:15:07,903	03:15:13,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British part is the sort of diversion as we said and yet they're going to pull this off
EDL	03:15:13,279	03:15:14,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Initially
EDL	03:15:15,071	03:15:16,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So well
EDL	03:15:16,095	03:15:17,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're going to show everyone
EDL	03:15:18,143	03:15:20,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What 20th century combined arms
EDL	03:15:20,703	03:15:21,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Warfare looks like including Eric
EDL	03:15:22,751	03:15:23,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The amount of
EDL	03:15:23,519	03:15:24,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Coordination no
EDL	03:15:24,799	03:15:25,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Have to come off
EDL	03:15:25,567	03:15:26,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Correctly to make this work
EDL	03:15:28,127	03:15:29,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it can't be maintained
EDL	03:15:29,663	03:15:32,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But for the short period of time they're able to make it work
EDL	03:15:32,735	03:15:34,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British show you that

EDL	03:15:41,951	03:15:42,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Here's a way historian Peter
EDL	03:15:43,487	03:15:43,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Describes
EDL	03:15:44,511	03:15:50,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The many things that were starting to come together that could be Unleashed at at rosson house scientific and modern 20th century
EDL	03:15:51,167	03:15:53,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This profession of arms is really becoming
EDL	03:15:54,239	03:15:55,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He writes quote
EDL	03:15:57,055	03:15:59,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Many lessons have been learned from the song
EDL	03:15:59,359	03:16:01,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An artillery was at the heart of the plan
EDL	03:16:01,663	03:16:05,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Royal artillery and come a long way since 1915
EDL	03:16:05,247	03:16:09,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The thousands upon thousands of new recruit to learn their trade well
EDL	03:16:09,343	03:16:10,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The gun detached
EDL	03:16:10,623	03:16:15,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The layers the NCO the officers were all now wedded into efficient batteries
EDL	03:16:15,743	03:16:19,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They were capable of increasingly sophisticated and complex bombardment
EDL	03:16:19,839	03:16:21,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The guns themselves without plaintiff
EDL	03:16:21,887	03:16:28,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Anywhere vast numbers of medium and heavy artillery pieces joining the masses of ordinary 18-pounder and

EDL	03:16:30,591	03:16:32,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Advances in technology and science
EDL	03:16:32,639	03:16:36,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Also combined to give a greater understanding of the mechanics of a shell in flight
EDL	03:16:36,991	03:16:40,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the measurable adjustments caused by different meteorological conditions
EDL	03:16:41,343	03:16:42,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Accuracy was improved
EDL	03:16:42,879	03:16:45,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Advent of the 106 fuse
EDL	03:16:45,183	03:16:49,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mented shells would burst instantaneously on the slightest contact
EDL	03:16:49,023	03:16:51,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Switchmate clearing barbed wire in great deal simpler
EDL	03:16:52,095	03:16:58,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Smoke shells were also now routinely incorporated into the barrages to try to mass be attacking infantry from
EDL	03:16:58,495	03:16:59,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	German Defenders
EDL	03:16:59,263	03:17:01,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Gas shells were a key part of the garage
EDL	03:17:02,079	03:17:05,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they were less visually dramatic than the clouds of gas released from cylinders
EDL	03:17:05,919	03:17:07,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they were far easier to deploy
EDL	03:17:07,967	03:17:10,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And much more predictable in their effects
EDL	03:17:10,015	03:17:16,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Progress in the linked tasks of photographic reconnaissance and artillery observation allowed targets to be

EDL	03:17:32,031	03:17:34,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is astounding and it shouldn't be surprising that it usually does
EDL	03:17:35,615	03:17:38,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What makes a Roth difference is that in some cases it did

EDL	03:17:41,247	03:17:42,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The creeping barrage
EDL	03:17:43,295	03:17:45,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The creeping barrage is a fantastic
EDL	03:17:45,599	03:17:49,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military Innovation and they've been trying to make it work before

EDL	03:17:50,207	03:17:51,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this battle they got it right
EDL	03:17:52,255	03:17:55,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this battle they were able for a while to create
EDL	03:17:55,327	03:17:57,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Protective
EDL	03:17:57,119	03:17:58,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Explosive force field
EDL	03:17:58,911	03:17:59,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Around British troops
EDL	03:18:01,215	03:18:02,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The way it work as you would get
EDL	03:18:02,495	03:18:06,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Town of guns anywhere from several hundred to more than a thousand
EDL	03:18:06,079	03:18:07,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Firing
EDL	03:18:07,103	03:18:08,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Giant
EDL	03:18:08,127	03:18:09,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Cannonades
EDL	03:18:09,407	03:18:11,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In front of your advancing forces
EDL	03:18:12,223	03:18:15,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Creating a wall of explosions in front of them
EDL	03:18:15,807	03:18:17,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you have it coordinated everybody would have their
EDL	03:18:18,367	03:18:21,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Winner watches synchronized in the troops will be told okay in the first
EDL	03:18:21,695	03:18:23,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	20 minutes you are to move
EDL	03:18:23,487	03:18:24,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know a hundred yards forward
EDL	03:18:25,279	03:18:30,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And at this time the barrage will shift another hundred yards in front of you so this is all worked out so that
EDL	03:18:30,911	03:18:36,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know the protective barrage supposed to keep the troops safely and as they Advance toward the enemy
EDL	03:18:36,287	03:18:40,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the very last step of course is the barrage will land right on the enemy
EDL	03:18:40,383	03:18:45,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then it will lift at the last second in the enemy will look up in the British forces will be right there standing in front of them
EDL	03:18:45,759	03:18:47,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Having March the whole way
EDL	03:18:47,551	03:18:49,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With a giant explosive force field protecting
EDL	03:18:50,623	03:18:51,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As you might imagine
EDL	03:18:51,903	03:18:53,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Coordination is critical
EDL	03:18:53,439	03:18:55,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You screw this up in one of two things happen
EDL	03:18:56,511	03:18:57,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The better thing
EDL	03:18:57,791	03:19:03,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is that the garage gets way ahead of the troops and they're exposed to all the machine-gun fire and all the stuff the garage was supposed to protect them
EDL	03:19:04,191	03:19:06,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's the good part that's the best outcome
EDL	03:19:06,495	03:19:08,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The worst outcome is that the garage is short
EDL	03:19:09,311	03:19:13,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that giant explosive wall That's supposed to protect you from the enemy instead
EDL	03:19:13,407	03:19:13,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Decimate
EDL	03:19:15,711	03:19:16,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When it works
EDL	03:19:16,735	03:19:17,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's fantastic
EDL	03:19:18,527	03:19:20,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Battle of arras it works
EDL	03:19:20,063	03:19:20,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Initially
EDL	03:19:22,879	03:19:24,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tell me a bunch of Innovations
EDL	03:19:25,183	03:19:26,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Another one again
EDL	03:19:26,463	03:19:29,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's been tried before but never quite like this is whole batteries
EDL	03:19:30,047	03:19:31,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Submachine gun
EDL	03:19:31,071	03:19:31,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will be used
EDL	03:19:31,839	03:19:33,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What's called indirect
EDL	03:19:33,119	03:19:35,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fire meaning they Point them up to the sky
EDL	03:19:35,679	03:19:37,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So that the bullet end up falling
EDL	03:19:37,983	03:19:41,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know right straight down on targets you can shoot over Hills
EDL	03:19:41,823	03:19:45,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not even seeing what you're shooting at is one historian
EDL	03:19:45,151	03:19:46,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Explain it apply hosing down
EDL	03:19:47,455	03:19:48,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An important piece of
EDL	03:19:48,479	03:19:49,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In ground they would have
EDL	03:19:49,247	03:19:51,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thousands of machine gun bullets
EDL	03:19:51,039	03:19:52,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Falling every second on some of these
EDL	03:19:52,831	03:19:53,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Important Road
EDL	03:19:53,855	03:19:55,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Crossings and whatnot
EDL	03:19:55,391	03:19:55,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All through this
EDL	03:19:57,951	03:20:00,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What are the important elements at the start of the battle
EDL	03:20:00,255	03:20:01,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is that
EDL	03:20:01,023	03:20:04,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So many of the troops that are going to initially rushed
EDL	03:20:04,095	03:20:06,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The German side are underground
EDL	03:20:06,143	03:20:06,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At the start of the
EDL	03:20:07,167	03:20:10,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a lot of Chucky ground in this part of France and like a lot of these battles
EDL	03:20:11,007	03:20:12,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There will be a ton of digging
EDL	03:20:13,055	03:20:16,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In fact for months the Germans and the British on both sides of had sort of a
EDL	03:20:16,895	03:20:17,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tunneling War
EDL	03:20:17,919	03:20:21,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And occasionally in a British tunnels toward the German front
EDL	03:20:21,759	03:20:27,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Run into German tunnelers going the other way and they had these terrible gunfights in the dark underground you know like
EDL	03:20:27,391	03:20:27,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Troglodyte
EDL	03:20:30,719	03:20:33,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some sources say that the moment the actual Ground Battle
EDL	03:20:33,791	03:20:35,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Adam Ross started
EDL	03:20:35,071	03:20:38,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some of these tunnels have gone up all the way to the German lines but just
EDL	03:20:38,143	03:20:39,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Couple of feet
EDL	03:20:39,167	03:20:40,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Separated them
EDL	03:20:40,447	03:20:42,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From the German trench lines and that
EDL	03:20:42,751	03:20:44,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At the Second Battle started exploded
EDL	03:20:44,799	03:20:46,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Charges in those those
EDL	03:20:46,335	03:20:48,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Little walls of dirt blew down in the Canadiens
EDL	03:20:48,895	03:20:51,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Storm32 breaches it doesn't matter what
EDL	03:20:51,967	03:20:53,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Exactly happened
EDL	03:20:53,247	03:20:56,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Canadian storm. Vimy Ridge now and took it
EDL	03:20:56,831	03:20:57,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the first day
EDL	03:20:58,111	03:20:59,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Arrange that
EDL	03:20:59,135	03:21:02,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Untold numbers are Frenchmen had died trying to take
EDL	03:21:02,719	03:21:03,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Back in 1950
EDL	03:21:04,511	03:21:06,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a huge Canadian
EDL	03:21:06,815	03:21:10,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Germans were in terrible trouble for a short while
EDL	03:21:10,655	03:21:15,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At the Battle of arras by the way it's not you they get a lot of credit and deservedly so
EDL	03:21:15,775	03:21:18,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But there were Scotsman for example up on the same Hill
EDL	03:21:18,847	03:21:20,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Dealing with all kinds of problems
EDL	03:21:21,919	03:21:22,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And yet
EDL	03:21:23,199	03:21:25,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For the first 24 hours
EDL	03:21:25,503	03:21:28,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It looked like Douglas hang the British commander
EDL	03:21:28,575	03:21:31,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was going to have on his hands the long-awaited much
EDL	03:21:31,647	03:21:33,951	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fantasized about in his head breakthrough
EDL	03:21:37,279	03:21:39,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Ludendorff writes in his diaries that it was a
EDL	03:21:39,839	03:21:42,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A dangerous moment and then and then lamented the fact
EDL	03:21:42,911	03:21:48,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The here this brand-new defense-in-depth system he come up with with all this working all this money spent was apparently useful
EDL	03:21:48,799	03:21:51,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Against these new British combined arms tactics
EDL	03:21:52,127	03:21:53,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That was until he figured out
EDL	03:21:53,663	03:21:56,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	His commander on the scene a guy named Falcon housing
EDL	03:21:56,479	03:21:58,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	70 something year old guy
EDL	03:21:58,527	03:22:00,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hadn't quite figured out
EDL	03:22:00,575	03:22:02,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What he was supposed to do
EDL	03:22:02,367	03:22:03,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With these new tax
EDL	03:22:03,391	03:22:05,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If they were still way too new
EDL	03:22:05,183	03:22:10,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And he had done a bunch of things that were part of the old tactics he put all his guys for the most part way up front
EDL	03:22:10,559	03:22:11,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where they could be
EDL	03:22:11,839	03:22:18,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You're taken by the artillery more than two and a half million British shells by the way if fired
EDL	03:22:18,239	03:22:20,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a shorter time than the battle of the Somme
EDL	03:22:21,567	03:22:25,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then he put his reserve That was supposed to be there to plug any holes
EDL	03:22:25,151	03:22:31,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	15 miles back too far to do anything in for a short. Of time it look like the British were going to break through at this battle
EDL	03:22:32,575	03:22:34,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then just like
EDL	03:22:34,367	03:22:35,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All these other battles
EDL	03:22:36,415	03:22:37,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It slows down
EDL	03:22:37,951	03:22:42,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Once the troops Advance Beyond where their gunfire can help them
EDL	03:22:42,047	03:22:44,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Then the guns behind them have to move to
EDL	03:22:44,863	03:22:45,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that takes
EDL	03:22:45,887	03:22:47,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Time and everybody gets
EDL	03:22:47,167	03:22:53,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tired and I begin to wear out and while they're resting and rejuvenating cells for the next pushed the Germans arbre
EDL	03:22:53,567	03:22:54,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bringing up their Reserves
EDL	03:22:54,847	03:22:58,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Battle of arras with this wonderful first day in his capture this important
EDL	03:22:58,943	03:22:59,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Vimy Ridge
EDL	03:23:00,479	03:23:03,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Turned into just another one of these battles
EDL	03:23:03,039	03:23:06,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By the time it's over more than a month later
EDL	03:23:06,879	03:23:13,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You have like a hundred and fifty thousand British casualties at like a hundred and thirty thousand German ones and by the way I found it
EDL	03:23:13,279	03:23:18,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Interesting that the newer histories numbers of the casualties these battles is significantly higher than the older
EDL	03:23:19,423	03:23:21,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I have some that say that 75000 British
EDL	03:23:21,983	03:23:23,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Died at this battle
EDL	03:23:23,007	03:23:24,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That's a big discrepancy in the number
EDL	03:23:25,823	03:23:27,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The traditional numbers
EDL	03:23:27,103	03:23:28,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Turn out today are well over a hundred thousand
EDL	03:23:29,407	03:23:29,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All sides
EDL	03:23:31,455	03:23:32,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Joy over
EDL	03:23:33,247	03:23:34,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Beanie was short-lived
EDL	03:23:35,807	03:23:37,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And what happened at this battle what happened
EDL	03:23:37,855	03:23:38,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And a bunch of other
EDL	03:23:38,879	03:23:39,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	First World War
EDL	03:23:39,903	03:23:43,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It shows the difference between how well the first
EDL	03:23:43,231	03:23:46,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Stay usually the first 24 maybe 36 hours of these
EDL	03:23:46,559	03:23:49,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Minutely exquisitely planned encounters go
EDL	03:23:49,631	03:23:51,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The part that's all been rehearsed
EDL	03:23:52,191	03:23:57,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And trained for 4 months and months and months goes great and you're able to make the coordination work
EDL	03:23:57,567	03:23:59,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But then the next jump
EDL	03:23:59,103	03:24:03,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And wherever you are in these battles is a part that becomes much more improvisational
EDL	03:24:03,455	03:24:04,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Much more ad hoc
EDL	03:24:04,991	03:24:06,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can't have a plan
EDL	03:24:06,783	03:24:12,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a month in advance for what you do on the second day of the battle cuz you're not really sure where you're going to be the second day
EDL	03:24:13,439	03:24:14,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You may have some
EDL	03:24:14,719	03:24:19,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But that doesn't mean that's what you're going to do when and as many historians point out when you look at the next
EDL	03:24:19,071	03:24:19,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Jumps
EDL	03:24:19,839	03:24:24,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In any of these offences they are so much more haphazard and all that coordination falls apart
EDL	03:24:24,703	03:24:31,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you don't see the wonderful results that that months of preparation gave you for 24 or 30
EDL	03:24:31,103	03:24:35,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	6 hours and yet you can't break through these kinds of deep defenses
EDL	03:24:35,455	03:24:38,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In that short of a period of time you would have to have
EDL	03:24:38,271	03:24:43,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The combined arms activity work as well as it did for the first 24 hours at a Ross
EDL	03:24:43,647	03:24:45,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And be able to carry it through for a week or two
EDL	03:24:47,231	03:24:48,511	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nevertheless it was a near run thing
EDL	03:24:49,279	03:24:50,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Gone down in history as a as a
EDL	03:24:51,583	03:24:56,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Heroic encounter mostly for the Canadians the largest in Denver they participated in yet on the Western Front
EDL	03:24:57,983	03:24:59,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I always have to remind myself
EDL	03:24:59,775	03:25:01,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know you look at this in an almost
EDL	03:25:01,823	03:25:06,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A field Marshal type fashion when you study this for military history you see it the way the General's office
EDL	03:25:07,455	03:25:12,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	These advancements on these Maps what worked and what didn't another coordination question that the technical side of War
EDL	03:25:12,831	03:25:15,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do we have to remember that when I was try to remind myself
EDL	03:25:15,647	03:25:17,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do the people on the ground this is not so technical
EDL	03:25:18,719	03:25:19,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Philip Gibbs
EDL	03:25:19,999	03:25:20,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Was there
EDL	03:25:21,279	03:25:23,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He was in the tunnels
EDL	03:25:23,583	03:25:26,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the troops as they came back
EDL	03:25:26,399	03:25:29,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From these encounters up on Vimy Ridge and places
EDL	03:25:29,471	03:25:30,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Like that
EDL	03:25:30,239	03:25:31,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Gives gives you a real
EDL	03:25:31,519	03:25:32,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A feel for what it was like
EDL	03:25:33,311	03:25:34,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He writes quote
EDL	03:25:35,359	03:25:39,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were tunnels beneath the roster which are men advance to the German lines
EDL	03:25:39,711	03:25:44,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I went along the one one line of men was going into battle and another was coming back
EDL	03:25:44,575	03:25:45,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Wounded
EDL	03:25:45,599	03:25:46,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Some of them blind
EDL	03:25:46,879	03:25:47,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bloody
EDL	03:25:47,647	03:25:50,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Vomiting with the fumes of gas in their lungs

EDL	03:26:09,663	03:26:14,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There were long queues of wounded men taking their turn to the surgeon
EDL	03:26:14,015	03:26:15,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who were working in a deep

EDL	03:27:31,839	03:27:35,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	After such an intense fighting you always had men lying out in no man's land
EDL	03:27:36,447	03:27:42,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Probably with their testicles blown off and crying in agony and laying out there all night long in the dark in the rain
EDL	03:27:42,591	03:27:44,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Most would never have survived
EDL	03:27:44,639	03:27:45,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you had a choice
EDL	03:27:45,919	03:27:48,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They could die in agony or you could shoot them
EDL	03:27:48,991	03:27:51,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You were showing how to do the thing very cleanly
EDL	03:27:51,295	03:27:54,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You would take your 45 revolver and talk to the man
EDL	03:27:54,879	03:27:58,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you behind him and whilst you were talkin pull the trigger
EDL	03:27:58,975	03:28:03,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Put a bullet through the back of his head and immediately the whole front skull came away and they were dead instantly
EDL	03:28:04,351	03:28:05,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There was no pain about it
EDL	03:28:05,631	03:28:07,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But I can honestly say this
EDL	03:28:07,423	03:28:09,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But I never had the courage because that's what it took
EDL	03:28:10,239	03:28:12,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I never had the courage myself to shoot a wounded soldier
EDL	03:28:13,311	03:28:16,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I carried out the operation many times afterwards on animals
EDL	03:28:16,895	03:28:19,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I could kill a pet dog far better than a vet could
EDL	03:28:19,711	03:28:21,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But I was never able to shoot a wounded soldier
EDL	03:28:22,271	03:28:23,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I probably should have
EDL	03:28:23,807	03:28:26,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	My friend Auto Marie Dixon was wounded in the stomach

EDL	03:28:30,975	03:28:33,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The kindest thing would have been to shoot him on the battlefield
EDL	03:28:34,047	03:28:37,631	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Instead of that they took him back to the hospital when he died days later
EDL	03:28:37,631	03:28:39,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's a tremendous thing to shoot a friend
EDL	03:28:39,935	03:28:43,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Even though he's in agony and I just didn't have the courage to do it
EDL	03:28:43,519	03:28:45,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Most of them died overnight
EDL	03:28:45,055	03:28:46,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And of course they didn't thank you for it I'm sure

EDL	03:33:04,895	03:33:06,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Jobs to do
EDL	03:33:06,175	03:33:07,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In this coming offensive

EDL	03:33:13,343	03:33:14,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is all part of this
EDL	03:33:15,391	03:33:16,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Growing

EDL	03:33:55,839	03:33:58,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the war minister has some good argue
EDL	03:33:59,679	03:34:00,959	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He tried to tell him look
EDL	03:34:01,471	03:34:02,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Everything's changed
EDL	03:34:02,751	03:34:03,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Since you first formulated

EDL	03:34:33,983	03:34:37,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In late March when the war minister talking to the veil about this

EDL	03:34:53,951	03:34:54,719	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Surprise to tell
EDL	03:34:56,255	03:35:00,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	No one's going to hold you I mean Everything's changed maybe we should re-evaluate Annabelle says no
EDL	03:35:02,143	03:35:04,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The government gets even more desperate as the
EDL	03:35:04,447	03:35:05,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Offencive nears
EDL	03:35:05,983	03:35:06,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And

EDL	03:35:11,359	03:35:14,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He says to the government either you back me on this ride resign
EDL	03:35:16,223	03:35:18,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And everything I've read says that this is a crisis
EDL	03:35:18,527	03:35:19,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The French
EDL	03:35:19,295	03:35:21,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For all sorts of internal reasons
EDL	03:35:21,599	03:35:24,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It was likely to bring the government down if they
EDL	03:35:24,159	03:35:27,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They fired the veil right before his offensive was supposed to take hold
EDL	03:35:27,231	03:35:29,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And everyone bought into the optimism and drank the Kool-Aid
EDL	03:35:29,791	03:35:31,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That almost no choice in this confrontation
EDL	03:35:31,583	03:35:33,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Politicians and Generals
EDL	03:35:33,119	03:35:34,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the government back down
EDL	03:35:35,423	03:35:37,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it was even worse than the government knew
EDL	03:35:38,239	03:35:39,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because the Germans knew
EDL	03:35:39,775	03:35:40,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	All about
EDL	03:35:40,799	03:35:41,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Novella
EDL	03:35:41,567	03:35:43,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Plans in detail
EDL	03:35:44,127	03:35:45,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Two major incidents

EDL	03:35:52,575	03:35:57,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the officer that they captured were able to find out more the Germans knew all about
EDL	03:35:57,439	03:35:58,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The French plan
EDL	03:35:58,207	03:35:59,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When they were going to take place and what was going to happen
EDL	03:36:01,279	03:36:03,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they had known in general 4 months
EDL	03:36:04,095	03:36:05,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Air reconnaissance
EDL	03:36:05,375	03:36:11,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And told him I mean these giant Affairs are like giant Supply dump that go on for miles and miles and miles it's very difficult to keep
EDL	03:36:11,775	03:36:13,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Keep the enemy from finding out about it
EDL	03:36:13,567	03:36:17,151	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And in January the Germans had about nine divisions opposite

EDL	03:36:24,319	03:36:25,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they're waiting
EDL	03:36:26,623	03:36:27,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it's a disease

EDL	03:36:47,871	03:36:50,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Given the news of the offensive in the difficulty of the terrain

EDL	03:37:39,839	03:37:42,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just like a Terraza week before the weather was bad
EDL	03:37:43,167	03:37:46,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know who has snow during a spring offense

EDL	03:38:27,967	03:38:34,367	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To add to The Ravines and the gorgeous and everything that are already in it and stuff machine guns into every hole

EDL	03:38:52,799	03:38:58,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The soldiers actually take quite a bit more ground than they did in the earlier battles but that's sort of deceiving
EDL	03:38:58,687	03:39:00,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because this is all part of the new German strategy
EDL	03:39:01,503	03:39:07,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This defense-in-depth where the Germans aren't supposed to fight to the death ball up on the front lines now and not giving into brownish supposed to fight
EDL	03:39:08,159	03:39:11,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Two reasonable degree and then retire to the next line
EDL	03:39:11,999	03:39:16,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So they're letting the enemy have more ground they're just killing more of them while they retreat
EDL	03:39:18,399	03:39:20,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The French actually Stumble Inn

EDL	03:39:22,239	03:39:26,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	First-line areas and think that they're winning cuz they're just not finding that many German
EDL	03:39:27,103	03:39:29,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then the Germans open up on them from the second
EDL	03:39:31,967	03:39:33,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As you might imagine
EDL	03:39:33,759	03:39:35,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A government that has been assured
EDL	03:39:36,319	03:39:39,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That they'll call this thing off in 48 hours

EDL	03:42:56,511	03:42:59,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And it's ironic that it would be that way cuz if it's just judged

EDL	03:43:22,367	03:43:28,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So even between the big battles is horrible but in the big battle the numbers are astronomical by that standard

EDL	03:44:48,127	03:44:54,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The one thing that the politicians have in their favor is that they're concerned about casualties and the generals appear to not be

EDL	03:45:35,999	03:45:37,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Instead

EDL	03:53:16,799	03:53:21,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In late 1917 mid 1917 is maybe the best Army in the war at this
EDL	03:53:21,919	03:53:23,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's taken years for the British
EDL	03:53:23,711	03:53:26,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a traditionally a c power to build up a land power
EDL	03:53:26,783	03:53:32,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Goodbye July August 1917 they've done a great job of doing just that and its Millions
EDL	03:53:32,159	03:53:32,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Strong

EDL	03:53:35,231	03:53:39,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When this war started very very fine and professional and volunteers but
EDL	03:53:39,327	03:53:40,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the boutique
EDL	03:53:41,119	03:53:47,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What they have in 1917 are a bunch of mostly conscripts unfollows you to mostly conscripts they don't
EDL	03:53:47,519	03:53:53,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sing on their way to and from Battle anymore like in 1914 after the song that all stop these are a bunch of Grimm
EDL	03:53:54,175	03:53:54,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Professional

EDL	03:53:59,295	03:54:00,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I have a sort of a
EDL	03:54:00,831	03:54:02,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'm a real that's hard to do
EDL	03:54:02,879	03:54:05,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Describe and they suffered a terrible
EDL	03:54:05,183	03:54:11,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	An ordeal the year before the battle of the Somme terrible lost a lot of fantastic people but came back with even more are
EDL	03:54:11,583	03:54:14,655	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Artillery pieces here in 1917
EDL	03:54:14,655	03:54:17,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In the hands of Hague and Hayden wants to use it in Belgium against the Germans
EDL	03:54:19,519	03:54:21,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But there are people that think that's a stupid idea
EDL	03:54:22,335	03:54:25,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And after several years of war when you've watched
EDL	03:54:25,919	03:54:32,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know the same thing happened over and over again in all these battles there are people that are going to push back they're starting to see some of these for
EDL	03:54:32,319	03:54:33,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Political leader start
EDL	03:54:33,343	03:54:35,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Question what the military is doing open
EDL	03:54:35,647	03:54:36,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To their face
EDL	03:54:36,671	03:54:42,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know when we mentioned this earlier I don't want to insinuate that this never happens I mean Abraham Lincoln for example
EDL	03:54:42,559	03:54:45,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Famously would argue with a Civil War General
EDL	03:54:45,887	03:54:47,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But in some countries like Germany
EDL	03:54:47,935	03:54:49,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Politicians in Germany
EDL	03:54:49,471	03:54:51,007	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Do not interfere in military strategy
EDL	03:54:52,031	03:54:53,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I need only
EDL	03:54:53,567	03:54:55,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just started doing that in France
EDL	03:54:55,615	03:54:57,919	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With the collapse of the novella fences
EDL	03:54:57,919	03:55:00,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Right it was in development of this would have brought them into
EDL	03:55:00,735	03:55:02,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Saying are you sure we want to do something like this
EDL	03:55:03,039	03:55:03,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Again
EDL	03:55:04,319	03:55:05,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In Britain
EDL	03:55:05,599	03:55:10,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I would think as a modern person reading the story and I think many of you probably thought the same thing
EDL	03:55:10,207	03:55:15,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You're wondering why it took this long how many times can you lose hundreds of thousands of people
EDL	03:55:15,071	03:55:19,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In what appeared to the non-military I to be very similar kinds of attacks
EDL	03:55:19,679	03:55:23,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Maybe a little strange if there were more people questioning this in Britain there are
EDL	03:55:24,543	03:55:26,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Led by the prime minister
EDL	03:55:26,335	03:55:27,103	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lowell George
EDL	03:55:28,639	03:55:30,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now George to be fair
EDL	03:55:30,943	03:55:33,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is viewed by history very similarly to the way Woodrow Wilson
EDL	03:55:34,271	03:55:35,551	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's almost as though
EDL	03:55:35,551	03:55:36,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's a good Lord George
EDL	03:55:36,831	03:55:37,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there's an evil Lloyd
EDL	03:55:38,111	03:55:40,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Different histories will portray him differently
EDL	03:55:40,927	03:55:43,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But taken at face value
EDL	03:55:43,231	03:55:45,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Lloyd George presents himself
EDL	03:55:45,535	03:55:48,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As the person who defends the soldiers
EDL	03:55:48,863	03:55:49,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	From The General
EDL	03:55:50,911	03:55:53,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He says during this whole lead in
EDL	03:55:53,471	03:55:56,799	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To whether or not he gets to have his Belgian defensive quote
EDL	03:55:58,847	03:56:00,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The cabinet must regard themselves
EDL	03:56:00,895	03:56:04,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As Trustees for the fine fellows that constitute our army
EDL	03:56:04,479	03:56:06,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're willing to face any danger
EDL	03:56:06,271	03:56:08,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And they do so without complaint
EDL	03:56:08,319	03:56:13,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But they trusted the leaders of the nation to see that their lives are not needlessly thrown away
EDL	03:56:13,439	03:56:16,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Another not sacrifice John Muir gambles
EDL	03:56:16,255	03:56:19,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Witcher resorted to merely because those who are directing the war
EDL	03:56:19,839	03:56:22,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can think of nothing better to do with the men under their command
EDL	03:56:22,911	03:56:24,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It is therefore imperative
EDL	03:56:24,447	03:56:27,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before we Embark upon a gigantic attack
EDL	03:56:27,775	03:56:34,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which must necessarily hentel the loss of scores of thousands of valuable lives and produce that sense of discovery
EDL	03:56:34,175	03:56:38,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which might very well Rush Nations into premature peace
EDL	03:56:38,015	03:56:40,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That we should feel the fair confidence
EDL	03:56:40,063	03:56:43,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But such an attack has a reasonable chance of succeeding
EDL	03:56:43,135	03:56:46,463	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Amir gamble would be both a Folly and a crime
EDL	03:56:47,487	03:56:47,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And quote
EDL	03:56:49,535	03:56:50,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I must confess
EDL	03:56:51,071	03:56:55,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The to the modern Observer having just witnessed the several years previous of this war
EDL	03:56:55,935	03:56:57,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You think yourself when you hear something like that
EDL	03:56:58,495	03:56:59,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	About damn time
EDL	03:57:01,567	03:57:03,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But many modern historians Wonder
EDL	03:57:04,895	03:57:06,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They wonder if Hague
EDL	03:57:06,431	03:57:08,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Didn't have a pretty good feel for this thing
EDL	03:57:09,247	03:57:13,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And that these politicians were barking up the wrong tree maybe for their own political purposes
EDL	03:57:15,135	03:57:19,487	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hagstrom makes it look like Lloyd George doesn't know what he's talking about
EDL	03:57:19,487	03:57:20,511	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When he
EDL	03:57:20,511	03:57:22,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Opens up an operation
EDL	03:57:22,559	03:57:25,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On June 7th 1917
EDL	03:57:25,119	03:57:25,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To take this
EDL	03:57:26,655	03:57:27,423	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	High Ground
EDL	03:57:27,423	03:57:29,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But you need to take before you can have his Ypres.
EDL	03:57:30,495	03:57:31,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's called Messina rich
EDL	03:57:32,031	03:57:35,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the British had since 1915
EDL	03:57:35,615	03:57:39,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Been tunneling under this 8 miles of Ridgeline
EDL	03:57:39,711	03:57:42,271	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And planting explosives underneath
EDL	03:57:42,271	03:57:47,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The incredibly deep and complicated German defenses up there who they were impenetrable
EDL	03:57:47,391	03:57:48,671	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British went underneath them
EDL	03:57:49,183	03:57:51,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And the Germans knew they were doing some of this cuz they found one of them
EDL	03:57:52,767	03:57:57,375	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But on June 7th 1917 when he decides he's going to take this High Ground
EDL	03:57:57,375	03:57:58,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He starts off his attack
EDL	03:57:59,423	03:58:00,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	By blowing up
EDL	03:58:00,703	03:58:04,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That 8 miles of Ridge lines with these munitions
EDL	03:58:04,799	03:58:07,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's more than a million pounds of explosives underneath those Hills
EDL	03:58:08,383	03:58:11,455	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And when they blow up all within 28 seconds of each other
EDL	03:58:11,967	03:58:13,503	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Supposedly
EDL	03:58:13,503	03:58:14,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You could hear it in London
EDL	03:58:15,295	03:58:17,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I've heard some people say it was heard
EDL	03:58:17,599	03:58:18,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In iron
EDL	03:58:19,135	03:58:23,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thought to be the biggest man-made explosion before nuclear weapon
EDL	03:58:25,535	03:58:26,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A vaporizer
EDL	03:58:26,815	03:58:28,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	10000 Germans insta
EDL	03:58:30,911	03:58:32,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The second those
EDL	03:58:32,191	03:58:33,471	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Minds are blown up
EDL	03:58:34,239	03:58:39,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Thousands of British artillery pieces on the horizon open fire on the same line of ridges
EDL	03:58:39,871	03:58:40,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	03:58:40,639	03:58:41,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The British
EDL	03:58:42,175	03:58:48,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	80000 of them who come out of their trenches and end March toward that High Ground have a pretty darn easy.
EDL	03:58:48,575	03:58:49,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Time taking it
EDL	03:58:49,343	03:58:50,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I first world war standard
EDL	03:58:51,391	03:58:52,927	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I got always throw that in because
EDL	03:58:52,927	03:58:55,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To the naked eye it still looks like a lot of people died but
EDL	03:58:55,743	03:59:01,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	My first world war standards that's a pretty darn good attack and once again it seems to show that the British have found the secret sauce
EDL	03:59:01,887	03:59:08,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The magic formula of how the tanks in the artillery the aircraft and all work together perfectly and boom Messina Ridge taken
EDL	03:59:08,287	03:59:09,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4
EDL	03:59:09,055	03:59:10,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not that much loss of life
EDL	03:59:11,359	03:59:13,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Seems like he knows what he's doing
EDL	03:59:13,407	03:59:17,759	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But before he gets approval for this battle Ade prelims pulling up the guns he's getting ready
EDL	03:59:17,759	03:59:23,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Boy George and Company take him into a back room and make him kind of do a PowerPoint presentation
EDL	03:59:23,135	03:59:26,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Britain civilian leader in Hague sort of grits his teeth and does it
EDL	03:59:26,975	03:59:29,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Explains why it'll be a good thing
EDL	03:59:29,023	03:59:34,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Your wife why we should be doing this and why it should be a walkover did you see that wonderful battle we just bought and took Messina Ridge
EDL	03:59:36,191	03:59:38,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hague will end up getting other generals and
EDL	03:59:38,495	03:59:39,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Admirals
EDL	03:59:39,263	03:59:45,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just want to side with him against the political leadership there were always politicians who sided with them
EDL	03:59:45,663	03:59:48,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Military professionals who leave things to them
EDL	03:59:48,223	03:59:50,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Four guys like Churchill
EDL	03:59:50,015	03:59:52,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Or Lloyd George who were the ones
EDL	03:59:52,319	03:59:58,207	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Questioning military leadership they were very tough position can you imagine what risk they would have run
EDL	03:59:58,207	04:00:03,327	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	If they had overruled all their military professionals and then 200,000 guys get killed
EDL	04:00:03,327	04:00:04,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In a battle
EDL	04:00:04,607	04:00:08,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which by the way is almost the default result of a lot of these battles
EDL	04:00:08,191	04:00:14,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So you could pretty much be assured that that would happen if it happened to the generals oh well it just happened again.
EDL	04:00:14,591	04:00:19,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	General but if Lloyd George overruled all their generals and it happened because of him you can be sure
EDL	04:00:19,711	04:00:20,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He would have been roasted
EDL	04:00:23,295	04:00:24,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So predictably
EDL	04:00:25,343	04:00:26,879	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Douglas he gets his offencive
EDL	04:00:27,391	04:00:29,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He starts by
EDL	04:00:29,183	04:00:33,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Starting a military bombardment of the area right around July 15th July 20th
EDL	04:00:34,303	04:00:37,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before the ground attack starts the British will shoot almost
EDL	04:00:37,887	04:00:44,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	4 million shell to just show you how the progression is going a year ago with the psalm we were all
EDL	04:00:44,287	04:00:47,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Call saucer-eyed and so was the rest of the world at the time
EDL	04:00:47,359	04:00:50,943	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When the British shut off a million shells before they started
EDL	04:00:50,943	04:00:56,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Bad battle for this when they're shooting off almost 4 million you can see why Germany is concerned
EDL	04:00:56,831	04:00:57,599	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	With
EDL	04:00:57,599	04:01:01,695	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Finding a way to turn the entire country into a Munitions Factory
EDL	04:01:02,719	04:01:03,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The goal
EDL	04:01:04,511	04:01:06,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On July 31st
EDL	04:01:07,327	04:01:08,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	1917
EDL	04:01:09,375	04:01:10,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The Ypres offensive
EDL	04:01:12,703	04:01:14,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Very soon afterwards
EDL	04:01:15,263	04:01:15,775	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So is the rain
EDL	04:01:17,823	04:01:20,127	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It will be the rain that will give this battle
EDL	04:01:20,639	04:01:22,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's Unique standout Carey
EDL	04:01:23,711	04:01:26,015	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And there are so many battles in the first World War
EDL	04:01:26,015	04:01:27,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Sound the same
EDL	04:01:27,295	04:01:33,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It only a few standout and it's always for some particular reason they become associated with something special you know an offer if
EDL	04:01:33,439	04:01:34,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Take away the most casual
EDL	04:01:34,975	04:01:37,023	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The most shells
EDL	04:01:37,023	04:01:38,047	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean everyone knows
EDL	04:01:38,047	04:01:40,351	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Verdun is the grade artillery meat grinder offense
EDL	04:01:41,119	04:01:42,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The song is that
EDL	04:01:42,399	04:01:43,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Horrible
EDL	04:01:43,679	04:01:44,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Tragic
EDL	04:01:44,447	04:01:46,751	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Situation would maybe tragic encompass
EDL	04:01:46,751	04:01:49,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Brusilov offensive in the East is known for its scope
EDL	04:01:50,335	04:01:51,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Passchendaele
EDL	04:01:51,615	04:01:54,431	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Show me the British name for 30 / is known for its mod
EDL	04:01:55,711	04:02:00,575	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And my doesn't sound like too terrible thing but when you think about living outdoors and fighting
EDL	04:02:01,087	04:02:02,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Mud makeup
EDL	04:02:02,111	04:02:03,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Terrible situation
EDL	04:02:03,903	04:02:09,791	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And I don't want to suggest that just because this is probably the worst mud anyone has ever fought in the first World War
EDL	04:02:10,303	04:02:15,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That mud has not been a problem for soldiers on other fronts and another battles
EDL	04:02:15,167	04:02:19,263	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It's been sort of the bane of the existence for people especially in trenches
EDL	04:02:19,775	04:02:21,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But nowhere is the mod like it is in flan
EDL	04:02:22,591	04:02:26,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The soldiers fighting and it described it as having a consistency of porridge
EDL	04:02:26,175	04:02:26,687	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Torchy's
EDL	04:02:28,223	04:02:29,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There is no bottom
EDL	04:02:30,015	04:02:32,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you stink in it slowly
EDL	04:02:32,319	04:02:33,343	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As you would in quicksand
EDL	04:02:34,111	04:02:35,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There are a lot of people
EDL	04:02:35,647	04:02:39,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Who died in the first two battles of Ypres by drowning
EDL	04:02:41,023	04:02:42,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In addition
EDL	04:02:42,303	04:02:43,583	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There is a complex
EDL	04:02:44,095	04:02:48,703	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Very fragile system of dikes and other water and flood control measures
EDL	04:02:48,703	04:02:54,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That have been implemented in that area over the centuries to keep the water from taking it over
EDL	04:02:54,079	04:02:58,175	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The artillery has done great damage to that before 30 price
EDL	04:02:58,175	04:03:03,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now with this wonderful barrage of 4 million shells that the British launched into this area
EDL	04:03:03,807	04:03:06,111	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Destroyed whatever was left in that sis
EDL	04:03:07,647	04:03:11,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But it's when the rain starts that he gets horrifying because you taken already
EDL	04:03:11,743	04:03:18,143	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Horrifying first world war Western Front Battlefield of the sort we've described with the giant trenches everywhere the veggie tray
EDL	04:03:18,143	04:03:21,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Haitian all gone except for the little twigs and sticks that used to be giant trees
EDL	04:03:21,983	04:03:24,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is horrific hell Mordor like
EDL	04:03:24,543	04:03:26,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A landscape and you flood it
EDL	04:03:27,103	04:03:32,223	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Now we had battles like the song where there will be rain and you will have moments of flooding but it isn't like this
EDL	04:03:32,223	04:03:34,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This battlefield will start the flood and it will stay that way
EDL	04:03:36,319	04:03:39,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There will only be three dry days in the month of August
EDL	04:03:41,695	04:03:42,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	In fact they get double
EDL	04:03:43,487	04:03:44,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The normal rainfall
EDL	04:03:45,023	04:03:46,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And this turns the area
EDL	04:03:47,071	04:03:48,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Into swamp
EDL	04:03:49,887	04:03:50,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Swamp of quicksand
EDL	04:03:52,191	04:03:54,239	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And very quickly with all of the
EDL	04:03:54,239	04:03:58,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	No casualties that start cropping up you get the same kind of situation we talked about at the Somme
EDL	04:03:58,591	04:04:04,991	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Where if the shell holes with your everywhere filled with water become like toxic dumps with
EDL	04:04:04,991	04:04:07,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Human bodies decaying in them in the remnants of
EDL	04:04:07,295	04:04:09,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Poison gas and trash
EDL	04:04:09,087	04:04:09,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And
EDL	04:04:09,855	04:04:16,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The results of the music these things is latrines and it is being most sickening stuff you can think of as a matter of fact one of the problems can
EDL	04:04:16,255	04:04:17,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Fronting the British
EDL	04:04:17,279	04:04:18,303	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	At this battle
EDL	04:04:18,303	04:04:19,071	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is
EDL	04:04:19,071	04:04:23,679	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They don't have water for the truth they have water everywhere they have water coming out their ears but none to drink
EDL	04:04:25,215	04:04:27,519	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Can you show holes in the mud
EDL	04:04:27,519	04:04:32,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Will form as nasty and enemy to the soldiers fighting in this
EDL	04:04:32,639	04:04:33,663	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As they are
EDL	04:04:33,663	04:04:40,063	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know opposition and I don't want to suggest it wasn't bad for the Germans either that maybe the Overlook side of passchendaele it's so
EDL	04:04:40,063	04:04:44,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Horrible in this is seared into British Consciousness then it's so horrible for British troops
EDL	04:04:44,415	04:04:46,975	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Which let's remember and not just English folks
EDL	04:04:46,975	04:04:47,999	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And Welsh
EDL	04:04:47,999	04:04:53,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Scotch Irish Newfoundland Indian Australia New Zealand Canadian and I'm leaving some out
EDL	04:04:54,655	04:04:56,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They're all their suffering
EDL	04:04:56,959	04:04:58,495	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But the Germans are suffering too
EDL	04:05:00,287	04:05:01,823	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The rain is so bad
EDL	04:05:01,823	04:05:02,847	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Dead Within
EDL	04:05:02,847	04:05:03,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Just a few days
EDL	04:05:04,127	04:05:07,967	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He has to call a halt to operations the guns are sinking
EDL	04:05:07,967	04:05:11,807	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know what's the horses are syncing up to their chip the people
EDL	04:05:12,319	04:05:16,159	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Are sinking what makes this battle particularly horrifying
EDL	04:05:16,159	04:05:22,559	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is that in no other battle in the first world war do you routinely see the soldiers putting that unbelievable situation
EDL	04:05:22,559	04:05:24,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Equation that we quoted Norman Cousins that
EDL	04:05:25,119	04:05:25,887	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Scottish Soldier
EDL	04:05:26,399	04:05:29,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	He was saying he was given the tools to
EDL	04:05:29,215	04:05:32,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kill his fellow man if they were badly wounded on the battlefield
EDL	04:05:32,543	04:05:34,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What if they're slowly sinking in mud
EDL	04:05:35,615	04:05:36,895	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Because that's what was happening
EDL	04:05:36,895	04:05:39,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	When we talk about battles it's carnation
EDL	04:05:39,711	04:05:40,479	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	What do we mean by
EDL	04:05:41,503	04:05:43,295	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Well in the first World War
EDL	04:05:43,295	04:05:47,647	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hundreds of thousands sometimes millions of men would go through these terrible places
EDL	04:05:48,159	04:05:49,183	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Passchendaele one
EDL	04:05:49,695	04:05:52,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know we're done with another the song was another
EDL	04:05:52,255	04:05:56,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The brusilov offensive I mean these people who go through these horrible experiences
EDL	04:05:56,095	04:06:01,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Number in the hundreds of thousands or millions of those survivors then go home permanently changed
EDL	04:06:01,727	04:06:04,031	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	How many human beings have to go home
EDL	04:06:04,031	04:06:05,055	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Permanently change
EDL	04:06:05,567	04:06:07,871	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	For that to Ripple across their entire Society
EDL	04:06:08,639	04:06:12,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Passchendaele did just that and part of the reason why would because what these people saw
EDL	04:06:13,247	04:06:14,527	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Troy Dam
EDL	04:06:16,319	04:06:17,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I mean the most widely
EDL	04:06:17,855	04:06:19,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You know lampooned poetic line
EDL	04:06:20,415	04:06:23,743	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is Wylie Lampoon because it became so associated with the
EDL	04:06:23,743	04:06:25,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This battle Siegfried Sassoon wrote
EDL	04:06:25,535	04:06:26,815	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I died in hell
EDL	04:06:26,815	04:06:28,095	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They called it passchendaele
EDL	04:06:30,399	04:06:32,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can see pictures by the way of this battle
EDL	04:06:32,703	04:06:36,543	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the battlefield to try to keep soldiers from getting stuck in the mud
EDL	04:06:36,543	04:06:38,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	They laid down duct board
EDL	04:06:38,591	04:06:43,711	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And so you have and you have to imagine go look at pictures it is amazing you have a battlefield that looks like
EDL	04:06:43,711	04:06:46,783	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The moon if the moon had been turned too much
EDL	04:06:47,551	04:06:48,319	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And then
EDL	04:06:48,831	04:06:55,231	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	On the mud to try to keep people from sinking into it as though it's quicksand they put these little teeny planks in
EDL	04:06:55,231	04:06:56,255	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nmama
EDL	04:06:56,255	04:06:57,279	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Make them look like
EDL	04:06:58,047	04:07:04,447	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Hats in for where people need to go but what this does it means that the soldiers have to actually walk on those a machine gun
EDL	04:07:04,447	04:07:05,727	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Understand just Target them

EDL	04:24:45,055	04:24:46,335	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	I'd like to apologize
EDL	04:24:46,335	04:24:47,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	A couple of things right off
EDL	04:24:48,383	04:24:49,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The first thing is for
EDL	04:24:49,919	04:24:51,199	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Silly little
EDL	04:24:51,199	04:24:52,735	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Persnickety mistakes
EDL	04:24:54,271	04:24:57,855	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	You can probably tell special if you wait for these programs to be released as we make
EDL	04:24:58,623	04:24:59,391	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But I'm a bit of a
EDL	04:24:59,903	04:25:01,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Not when it comes to detail
EDL	04:25:02,207	04:25:08,607	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And yet the people around me keep telling me that there's a certain failure rate that should be expected I'm not really good at accepting that is
EDL	04:25:08,607	04:25:11,167	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Especially when I catch the errors before the show gets out
EDL	04:25:11,679	04:25:12,191	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless
EDL	04:25:12,703	04:25:16,287	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This one will go out with me saying the word trenches
EDL	04:25:16,799	04:25:18,079	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To describe
EDL	04:25:18,079	04:25:18,591	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The
EDL	04:25:19,103	04:25:20,383	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Kind of fortification
EDL	04:25:20,383	04:25:21,407	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	That the British Orion

EDL	04:25:24,223	04:25:25,247	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	To be a much
EDL	04:25:25,247	04:25:28,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Closer term I think trenches to those British soldiers would have been a luxury on
EDL	04:25:30,111	04:25:31,135	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless
EDL	04:25:31,135	04:25:33,439	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Those are the piddly little things
EDL	04:25:33,439	04:25:39,839	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It slipped through our strainer here even when we catch them so that these shows come out more than once a year which we are just
EDL	04:25:39,839	04:25:41,119	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Barely beating that
EDL	04:25:41,119	04:25:43,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Think right now heading toward once a year at this pace
EDL	04:25:44,959	04:25:49,567	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	So I apologize for the piddly little errors in the past the ones in this show any in the future
EDL	04:25:50,079	04:25:51,615	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We try hard
EDL	04:25:52,127	04:25:52,639	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	We're not
EDL	04:25:54,943	04:25:59,039	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	The other thing I'd like to apologize for is for perhaps ignoring your favorite part of the story
EDL	04:25:59,807	04:26:00,831	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Whatever that might be
EDL	04:26:01,343	04:26:03,903	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Favorite region favorite Army a favor

EDL	04:26:06,975	04:26:08,767	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Picking a topic like this
EDL	04:26:08,767	04:26:09,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Is humbling
EDL	04:26:10,559	04:26:14,399	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	And you know it once again shows you some of the potential downsides with our leap
EDL	04:26:14,911	04:26:15,935	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Before we look
EDL	04:26:15,935	04:26:17,983	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Topic picking policy here on the program
EDL	04:26:18,751	04:26:23,359	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Nonetheless I will forgive in advance from now on I promise I've learned my lesson

EDL	04:26:28,735	04:26:33,087	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	Expensive other areas of the first world war because you start to realize why that becomes important
EDL	04:26:33,599	04:26:34,623	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	This is a very confusing
EDL	04:26:35,391	04:26:36,415	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	There's alot going on
EDL	04:26:36,927	04:26:41,535	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	It would be so easy to go off in the weeds and lose everybody I have
EDL	04:26:41,535	04:26:46,911	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	But I'm worried about losing myself in the story you end up sticking to the Western Front and Russia and the United States
EDL	04:26:46,911	04:26:49,215	| dchha54_Blueprint_for_Armageddon_V |	As a sort of an anchor to keep the story
