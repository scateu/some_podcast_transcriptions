EDL	00:00:00,750	00:00:02,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Iran, when we look at what paved the way
EDL	00:00:02,375	00:00:03,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	for this lawsuit, what
EDL	00:00:03,833	00:00:05,166	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	exactly did Citizen Lab
EDL	00:00:05,166	00:00:06,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	discover by analyzing
EDL	00:00:06,708	00:00:07,958	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Hanan El-Ather's phone?
EDL	00:00:07,958	00:00:09,666	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:00:09,666	00:00:12,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Well, we discovered that her phones,
EDL	00:00:12,791	00:00:13,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	while not in her
EDL	00:00:13,750	00:00:17,541	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	possession in Dubai, someone had
EDL	00:00:17,541	00:00:21,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	typed in a website address that is used
EDL	00:00:21,583	00:00:23,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	to install Pegasus
EDL	00:00:23,041	00:00:25,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	spyware on a target's phone.
EDL	00:00:25,458	00:00:25,916	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:25,916	00:00:26,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	In fact, we could see
EDL	00:00:26,791	00:00:29,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	them manually typing this in.
EDL	00:00:29,375	00:00:31,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	But we knew that because the first time
EDL	00:00:31,583	00:00:33,291	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	they did it, they made an
EDL	00:00:33,291	00:00:34,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	error and then went back
EDL	00:00:34,791	00:00:35,916	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and did it again.
EDL	00:00:35,916	00:00:38,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	And then the phone communicated several
EDL	00:00:38,791	00:00:40,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	times with a server
EDL	00:00:40,000	00:00:42,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	that we know is part of NSO
EDL	00:00:42,750	00:00:45,416	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	group, the manufacturer of this spyware,
EDL	00:00:45,416	00:00:45,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:00:45,833	00:00:47,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	their command and control infrastructure.
EDL	00:00:47,708	00:00:48,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:00:48,583	00:00:52,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	She had been detained in Dubai, traveling
EDL	00:00:52,041	00:00:54,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	there from Toronto at the time?
EDL	00:00:54,583	00:00:55,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	That's correct.
EDL	00:00:55,041	00:00:55,625	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:55,625	00:00:58,250	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	She's a flight attendant and had been
EDL	00:00:58,250	00:00:59,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	flying from Toronto
EDL	00:00:59,708	00:01:02,625	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	to Dubai in April 2018.
EDL	00:01:02,625	00:01:03,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:01:03,375	00:01:06,250	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	When she arrived, several security
EDL	00:01:06,250	00:01:08,083	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	officials took her aside
EDL	00:01:08,083	00:01:10,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and then arrested her, took
EDL	00:01:10,833	00:01:13,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	her to a prison outside of the city,
EDL	00:01:13,750	00:01:14,291	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:14,291	00:01:15,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	interrogated her for a
EDL	00:01:15,708	00:01:18,166	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	couple of days, took her devices
EDL	00:01:18,166	00:01:18,541	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:18,541	00:01:23,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and we analyzed them in December 2021.
EDL	00:01:23,708	00:01:24,666	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:01:24,666	00:01:26,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	And you can pinpoint the exact timing
EDL	00:01:26,458	00:01:28,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	when the spyware was put
EDL	00:01:28,041	00:01:29,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	on her phone to that time
EDL	00:01:29,375	00:01:30,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	that she was there.
EDL	00:01:30,000	00:01:30,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:01:30,708	00:01:32,250	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Yeah, we can do it right down to the
EDL	00:01:32,250	00:01:33,208	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	second because we're
EDL	00:01:33,208	00:01:36,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	forensically analyzing the phone
EDL	00:01:36,750	00:01:38,958	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	itself and the crash logs and all of the
EDL	00:01:38,958	00:01:40,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	commands that are sent back and forth.
EDL	00:01:40,833	00:01:43,541	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	So we can, in effect, go back in time and
EDL	00:01:43,541	00:01:46,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	actually see exactly when it happened.
EDL	00:01:46,041	00:01:49,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	In this case, the person entering the
EDL	00:01:49,375	00:01:50,541	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	website address on her
EDL	00:01:50,541	00:01:52,166	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Chrome browser did it, I think
EDL	00:01:52,166	00:01:57,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	it was 10.18 a.m., April 22nd, which is
EDL	00:01:57,375	00:02:00,500	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	according to Hanan when the phones
EDL	00:02:00,500	00:02:01,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	weren't in her possession
EDL	00:02:01,583	00:02:03,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and she was being interrogated.
EDL	00:02:03,041	00:02:04,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:02:04,750	00:02:06,875	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	She was detained before
EDL	00:02:06,875	00:02:08,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Jamal Khashoggi's murder.
EDL	00:02:08,708	00:02:09,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:02:09,458	00:02:12,166	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Is the assertion that she was detained to
EDL	00:02:12,166	00:02:13,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	put this spyware on
EDL	00:02:13,583	00:02:15,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	her phone, why was she held?
EDL	00:02:15,000	00:02:16,708	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:02:16,708	00:02:17,916	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Yeah, she was both
EDL	00:02:17,916	00:02:20,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	questioned about Jamal.
EDL	00:02:20,583	00:02:21,666	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:02:21,666	00:02:22,333	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	What is he doing?
EDL	00:02:22,333	00:02:22,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:22,750	00:02:25,291	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	What type of activism is he involved in
EDL	00:02:25,291	00:02:26,500	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and that sort of thing?
EDL	00:02:26,500	00:02:30,041	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	And then, yes, they planted spyware on
EDL	00:02:30,041	00:02:31,416	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	her phone in order,
EDL	00:02:31,416	00:02:33,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	presumably, to capture both
EDL	00:02:33,833	00:02:34,875	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	whatever she is doing
EDL	00:02:34,875	00:02:36,083	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	that might be of interest.
EDL	00:02:36,083	00:02:38,666	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	But more importantly, I presume all of
EDL	00:02:38,666	00:02:40,958	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	her communications with Jamal Khashoggi.
EDL	00:02:40,958	00:02:41,416	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:41,416	00:02:44,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	I should say that we at the Citizen Lab
EDL	00:02:44,000	00:02:46,083	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	and other groups have
EDL	00:02:46,083	00:02:47,958	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	subsequently confirmed since
EDL	00:02:47,958	00:02:49,333	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:49,333	00:02:52,416	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	his murder that at least five people who
EDL	00:02:52,416	00:02:53,750	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	are close confidants
EDL	00:02:53,750	00:02:55,125	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	also had their phones
EDL	00:02:55,125	00:02:56,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	hacked in this manner.
EDL	00:02:56,375	00:02:56,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:56,833	00:02:58,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	In other words, there was a surveillance
EDL	00:02:58,375	00:03:02,291	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	net all around Jamal Khashoggi using this type
EDL	00:03:02,291	00:03:04,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	of very powerful mercenary spyware.

EDL	00:03:10,750	00:03:11,916	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	murder, as well as
EDL	00:03:11,916	00:03:13,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	what Ms. El-Ather alleges.

EDL	00:03:14,041	00:03:16,250	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	From your analysis, though, you're saying
EDL	00:03:16,250	00:03:16,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	you're confident
EDL	00:03:16,833	00:03:18,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	there is forensic evidence

EDL	00:03:18,333	00:03:19,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	that contradicts what

EDL	00:03:20,416	00:03:21,375	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:03:21,375	00:03:23,833	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Well, there's no disputing the fact that
EDL	00:03:23,833	00:03:25,000	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	these people had their

EDL	00:03:28,791	00:03:30,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab

EDL	00:03:35,875	00:03:38,083	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	And using that technology, they were able
EDL	00:03:38,083	00:03:39,458	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	to eavesdrop on
EDL	00:03:39,458	00:03:42,583	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Jamal's side of all of those conversations.

EDL	00:03:43,541	00:03:46,791	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	Among them is Omar Abdulaziz, a Canadian

EDL	00:03:52,125	00:03:55,208	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	He was a very close confidant of Jamal.
EDL	00:03:55,208	00:03:57,250	| Ron-on-CBC-As-it-happens-June-16 |	They were communicating regularly about
