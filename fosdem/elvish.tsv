EDL	00:00:06,460	00:00:08,650	| elvish |	okay so let's welcome our next speaker
EDL	00:00:08,650	00:00:11,469	| elvish |	Keesha and he will talk about his
EDL	00:00:11,469	00:00:22,630	| elvish |	experimental unit cell okay hello hi I'm
EDL	00:00:22,630	00:00:25,750	| elvish |	here to talk about extend experiment to
EDL	00:00:25,750	00:00:27,250	| elvish |	make sure that I'm doing as a side
EDL	00:00:27,250	00:00:30,340	| elvish |	project it's called elvish some of them
EDL	00:00:30,340	00:00:32,469	| elvish |	may have thinners because this is once
EDL	00:00:32,469	00:00:35,520	| elvish |	being posted on a hacker news
EDL	00:00:35,520	00:00:38,890	| elvish |	well the reason I developed this gel is
EDL	00:00:38,890	00:00:40,930	| elvish |	driven by two motivations wanting some
EDL	00:00:40,930	00:00:44,140	| elvish |	more serious language because can see
EDL	00:00:44,140	00:00:46,930	| elvish |	the code here is so it's real code it's
EDL	00:00:46,930	00:00:49,540	| elvish |	real visual code from thee from Chapter
EDL	00:00:49,540	00:00:51,280	| elvish |	five of the visual user guide
EDL	00:00:51,280	00:00:54,940	| elvish |	I won't call a language that allows you
EDL	00:00:54,940	00:00:56,860	| elvish |	to write something like this a serious
EDL	00:00:56,860	00:00:59,379	| elvish |	language is more ridiculous than Perl
EDL	00:00:59,379	00:01:05,560	| elvish |	even it and also a more friendly user
EDL	00:01:05,560	00:01:08,259	| elvish |	interface and by friendly I actually
EDL	00:01:08,259	00:01:10,780	| elvish |	mean two things why it's friendly for
EDL	00:01:10,780	00:01:14,350	| elvish |	newbies it's OOP so it has to have same
EDL	00:01:14,350	00:01:18,420	| elvish |	defaults so like we all know with some
EDL	00:01:18,420	00:01:22,930	| elvish |	some some shall we the default is almost
EDL	00:01:22,930	00:01:26,200	| elvish |	sound useable like some unnamed editor
EDL	00:01:26,200	00:01:30,159	| elvish |	so and also the another another expect
EDL	00:01:30,159	00:01:32,470	| elvish |	of friendliness I find is also friend is
EDL	00:01:32,470	00:01:36,970	| elvish |	for for for the for this event uses so
EDL	00:01:36,970	00:01:42,189	| elvish |	as to be very customizable okay so now
EDL	00:01:42,189	00:01:45,159	| elvish |	we come to the language so this still
EDL	00:01:45,159	00:01:49,329	| elvish |	works in elvish so you can now believe
EDL	00:01:49,329	00:01:52,090	| elvish |	that it's actually a shell it's not some
EDL	00:01:52,090	00:01:55,180	| elvish |	other kind of language so this stuff I
EDL	00:01:55,180	00:01:57,310	| elvish |	need to explain this stuff it basically
EDL	00:01:57,310	00:02:00,880	| elvish |	gets the output of the curled message
EDL	00:02:00,880	00:02:03,189	| elvish |	ring and sign four lines that contain a
EDL	00:02:03,189	00:02:06,689	| elvish |	and sordin and remove the application
EDL	00:02:06,689	00:02:11,110	| elvish |	put it to a file yep also our
EDL	00:02:11,110	00:02:14,529	| elvish |	mathematics so every time I have when I
EDL	00:02:14,529	00:02:16,659	| elvish |	have to do some quick calculation with
EDL	00:02:16,659	00:02:18,159	| elvish |	my computer I always have to struggle
EDL	00:02:18,159	00:02:19,150	| elvish |	with an eye
EDL	00:02:19,150	00:02:21,430	| elvish |	Python NBC because I patent take one
EDL	00:02:21,430	00:02:24,010	| elvish |	minute to start and BC has their limited
EDL	00:02:24,010	00:02:26,890	| elvish |	capability so nobody Elvis you don't
EDL	00:02:26,890	00:02:27,909	| elvish |	have to struggle for this anymore
EDL	00:02:27,909	00:02:31,170	| elvish |	because it has arithmetic so this is the
EDL	00:02:31,170	00:02:34,060	| elvish |	division to division instead of integer
EDL	00:02:34,060	00:02:37,359	| elvish |	division and the second example looks
EDL	00:02:37,359	00:02:42,340	| elvish |	pretty like Lisp yes it is and you can
EDL	00:02:42,340	00:02:46,150	| elvish |	have functions can does anybody know
EDL	00:02:46,150	00:02:50,109	| elvish |	what that he is supposed to me yeah it's
EDL	00:02:50,109	00:02:52,629	| elvish |	determinants for calculating
EDL	00:02:52,629	00:02:56,230	| elvish |	determinants of 2 times 2 matrix which
EDL	00:02:56,230	00:03:01,629	| elvish |	is something I do every day and tables
EDL	00:03:01,629	00:03:04,269	| elvish |	and closures yeah I told you it's a
EDL	00:03:04,269	00:03:06,519	| elvish |	serious language so he has datatypes
EDL	00:03:06,519	00:03:10,049	| elvish |	beyond simple strings so we have tables
EDL	00:03:10,049	00:03:13,359	| elvish |	tables is basically a hybrid of a list
EDL	00:03:13,359	00:03:17,040	| elvish |	and the dictionary I love the one and
EDL	00:03:17,040	00:03:20,439	| elvish |	actually the reason I have to combine
EDL	00:03:20,439	00:03:23,799	| elvish |	them is that I run out of brackets we
EDL	00:03:23,799	00:03:25,870	| elvish |	have this you know we have square
EDL	00:03:25,870	00:03:28,060	| elvish |	brackets round brackets and curly
EDL	00:03:28,060	00:03:30,549	| elvish |	brackets but I've run out of there I
EDL	00:03:30,549	00:03:32,379	| elvish |	cannot come up with more brackets so I
EDL	00:03:32,379	00:03:36,549	| elvish |	just use the square brackets for both if
EDL	00:03:36,549	00:03:39,099	| elvish |	anybody has a cool suggestion please
EDL	00:03:39,099	00:03:44,650	| elvish |	tell me so you see this is these two big
EDL	00:03:44,650	00:03:46,590	| elvish |	hybrids so it can be indexed with either
EDL	00:03:46,590	00:03:51,879	| elvish |	number or a stream and we have closures
EDL	00:03:51,879	00:03:55,269	| elvish |	and now here I would present you the
EDL	00:03:55,269	00:03:59,229	| elvish |	hello world program in elvish it's the
EDL	00:03:59,229	00:04:03,400	| elvish |	it's a pretty Java SH way that - hello
EDL	00:04:03,400	00:04:06,129	| elvish |	the world you actually first construct a
EDL	00:04:06,129	00:04:11,190	| elvish |	lower Factory and it rings like this I
EDL	00:04:11,190	00:04:14,680	| elvish |	explain that later and then you give a
EDL	00:04:14,680	00:04:16,599	| elvish |	parameter to the factory which gives you
EDL	00:04:16,599	00:04:19,449	| elvish |	a lower and it's a lower of the world
EDL	00:04:19,449	00:04:23,070	| elvish |	and then you call the whole lower well I
EDL	00:04:23,070	00:04:25,300	| elvish |	was actually joking because this is
EDL	00:04:25,300	00:04:26,590	| elvish |	another way you actually write hello
EDL	00:04:26,590	00:04:30,279	| elvish |	world and to understand this code too
EDL	00:04:30,279	00:04:32,680	| elvish |	we can simply come compare it to the
EDL	00:04:32,680	00:04:36,280	| elvish |	you JavaScript equivalent so you can see
EDL	00:04:36,280	00:04:40,289	| elvish |	that we do have serious constructs like
EDL	00:04:40,289	00:04:44,530	| elvish |	closures so closures are also first
EDL	00:04:44,530	00:04:49,060	| elvish |	value first-class values as our tables
EDL	00:04:49,060	00:04:51,430	| elvish |	and in traditional shells that believes
EDL	00:04:51,430	00:04:57,250	| elvish |	you only have strings and yes I've
EDL	00:04:57,250	00:04:59,770	| elvish |	talked about this we have many kind of
EDL	00:04:59,770	00:05:01,600	| elvish |	first-class values strings tables
EDL	00:05:01,600	00:05:04,389	| elvish |	closures boolean's and and they are
EDL	00:05:04,389	00:05:07,660	| elvish |	actually some more and the extraordinary
EDL	00:05:07,660	00:05:10,030	| elvish |	thing maybe about average is that
EDL	00:05:10,030	00:05:11,740	| elvish |	command output may contain values
EDL	00:05:11,740	00:05:13,870	| elvish |	instead of just pipes like the
EDL	00:05:13,870	00:05:16,930	| elvish |	traditional pipeline so here's an
EDL	00:05:16,930	00:05:21,190	| elvish |	example we find out the oldest articles
EDL	00:05:21,190	00:05:24,789	| elvish |	of valve issues login names has the
EDL	00:05:24,789	00:05:28,090	| elvish |	string broke we can see a combination of
EDL	00:05:28,090	00:05:31,599	| elvish |	the traditional pipe line and the pipe
EDL	00:05:31,599	00:05:33,430	| elvish |	line that actually carries discrete
EDL	00:05:33,430	00:05:36,160	| elvish |	values here because we all know the curl
EDL	00:05:36,160	00:05:39,760	| elvish |	command you just pulls out some some
EDL	00:05:39,760	00:05:42,280	| elvish |	URLs or added content to stand out and
EDL	00:05:42,280	00:05:48,010	| elvish |	to and then the past Jason command will
EDL	00:05:48,010	00:05:50,680	| elvish |	take these bytes and convert them to
EDL	00:05:50,680	00:05:54,280	| elvish |	values but it turns out that the this
EDL	00:05:54,280	00:05:56,800	| elvish |	URL will actually give an array instead
EDL	00:05:56,800	00:06:00,099	| elvish |	of many Jason's so we use unpacked
EDL	00:06:00,099	00:06:02,560	| elvish |	command in elvish which turns an array
EDL	00:06:02,560	00:06:05,800	| elvish |	of stuff into just Stringham stuff and
EDL	00:06:05,800	00:06:10,120	| elvish |	we iterate through the stream and we
EDL	00:06:10,120	00:06:12,880	| elvish |	strategize gnorga name and now we are
EDL	00:06:12,880	00:06:15,460	| elvish |	getting back to bite again so to find
EDL	00:06:15,460	00:06:18,520	| elvish |	out all the lines contain both which as
EDL	00:06:18,520	00:06:24,880	| elvish |	described I'm getting a little bit crazy
EDL	00:06:24,880	00:06:28,990	| elvish |	I have only two slides left allow the
EDL	00:06:28,990	00:06:31,479	| elvish |	user interface it's not much because
EDL	00:06:31,479	00:06:32,919	| elvish |	I've been working on the language
EDL	00:06:32,919	00:06:35,380	| elvish |	recently but this there's still
EDL	00:06:35,380	00:06:37,479	| elvish |	something pretty cool to show off I
EDL	00:06:37,479	00:06:39,310	| elvish |	think it's called the navigation mode
EDL	00:06:39,310	00:06:42,040	| elvish |	and because
EDL	00:06:42,040	00:06:43,930	| elvish |	I believe some of you have some of you
EDL	00:06:43,930	00:06:46,960	| elvish |	have used some software called Ranger it
EDL	00:06:46,960	00:06:49,000	| elvish |	allows you to use your arrow keys to
EDL	00:06:49,000	00:06:52,480	| elvish |	navigate in them in the console which is
EDL	00:06:52,480	00:06:55,060	| elvish |	pretty cool I think and I believe that
EDL	00:06:55,060	00:06:57,220	| elvish |	these functionalities better built into
EDL	00:06:57,220	00:07:00,790	| elvish |	the shell so I did it and it actually
EDL	00:07:00,790	00:07:05,580	| elvish |	works unlike many other things in elvish
EDL	00:07:05,580	00:07:09,880	| elvish |	so well the project self is it's not
EDL	00:07:09,880	00:07:12,220	| elvish |	ready and that will only call it ready
EDL	00:07:12,220	00:07:14,530	| elvish |	when I use it as my own login shell a
EDL	00:07:14,530	00:07:17,530	| elvish |	lot of stuff I'm missing and a lot of
EDL	00:07:17,530	00:07:23,020	| elvish |	stuff are wrong yeah yeah welcome to
EDL	00:07:23,020	00:07:27,070	| elvish |	contribute yes
EDL	00:07:27,070	00:07:29,260	| elvish |	last time when I talked I suggest
EDL	00:07:29,260	00:07:32,650	| elvish |	against putting on a hacker newspad the
EDL	00:07:32,650	00:07:36,610	| elvish |	next day I saw it so if you want to do
EDL	00:07:36,610	00:07:39,940	| elvish |	it go ahead oh that's the end of my
EDL	00:07:39,940	00:07:42,190	| elvish |	presentation so I guess it's now time
EDL	00:07:42,190	00:07:49,240	| elvish |	for questions okay thank you for your
EDL	00:07:49,240	00:07:50,770	| elvish |	great presentation and sharing your
EDL	00:07:50,770	00:07:52,870	| elvish |	great code with us so does anybody have
EDL	00:07:52,870	00:07:57,660	| elvish |	any questions and yeah
EDL	00:07:57,660	00:08:06,630	| elvish |	[ SPACE 9.0 secs ]
EDL	00:08:06,630	00:08:09,630	| elvish |	is
EDL	00:08:09,630	00:08:14,039	| elvish |	[ SPACE 4.4 secs ]
EDL	00:08:14,039	00:08:17,910	| elvish |	you said you integrated Ranger features
EDL	00:08:17,910	00:08:20,669	| elvish |	is it actual Ranger code or is now your
EDL	00:08:20,669	00:08:24,169	| elvish |	own implementation now I cloned it okay
EDL	00:08:24,169	00:08:27,419	| elvish |	this Ranger is written Python and this
EDL	00:08:27,419	00:08:30,620	| elvish |	stuff is actually written in gold
EDL	00:08:30,620	00:08:32,630	| elvish |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:08:32,630	00:08:44,850	| elvish |	sorry it's written in gold question so
EDL	00:08:44,850	00:08:59,399	| elvish |	anybody in your shell you can cost not
EDL	00:08:59,399	00:09:02,160	| elvish |	just strings yes between different
EDL	00:09:02,160	00:09:07,260	| elvish |	grammatical objects I am how do you make
EDL	00:09:07,260	00:09:08,970	| elvish |	the distinction between strings and
EDL	00:09:08,970	00:09:10,200	| elvish |	objects and how can you call that
EDL	00:09:10,200	00:09:12,750	| elvish |	program to return objects rather than
EDL	00:09:12,750	00:09:15,120	| elvish |	strings yeah actually the two channels
EDL	00:09:15,120	00:09:17,850	| elvish |	are always present both of them so you
EDL	00:09:17,850	00:09:19,950	| elvish |	can in principle you can have a command
EDL	00:09:19,950	00:09:22,890	| elvish |	that that outputs both the stream and
EDL	00:09:22,890	00:09:30,240	| elvish |	discrete values that's my solution at
EDL	00:09:30,240	00:09:32,970	| elvish |	the idea that the pipeline carries
EDL	00:09:32,970	00:09:35,910	| elvish |	values is actually stolen from from a
EDL	00:09:35,910	00:09:39,870	| elvish |	Microsoft Project PowerShell but I think
EDL	00:09:39,870	00:09:43,970	| elvish |	PowerShell has it tries to blur the
EDL	00:09:43,970	00:09:46,980	| elvish |	boundary between the values and return
EDL	00:09:46,980	00:09:48,810	| elvish |	the value pipeline and the stream
EDL	00:09:48,810	00:09:50,399	| elvish |	pipeline which I think it's really bad I
EDL	00:09:50,399	00:09:54,029	| elvish |	think is the best solution I've found so
EDL	00:09:54,029	00:09:56,430	| elvish |	far is to make these two pipelines
EDL	00:09:56,430	00:09:58,920	| elvish |	always to make these two pipes always
EDL	00:09:58,920	00:10:02,070	| elvish |	present so you're actually every command
EDL	00:10:02,070	00:10:07,050	| elvish |	has two inputs and two outputs sounds
EDL	00:10:07,050	00:10:09,709	| elvish |	awesome thank you
EDL	00:10:09,709	00:10:16,970	| elvish |	[ SPACE 7.3 secs ]
EDL	00:10:16,970	00:10:21,290	| elvish |	so does anybody have any more questions
EDL	00:10:21,290	00:10:25,440	| elvish |	okay so yeah once again thank you see
EDL	00:10:25,440	00:10:26,790	| elvish |	for your great presentation
EDL	00:10:26,790	00:10:32,650	| elvish |	[Applause]
