00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,210
Hello imarband‚ this is Xian Jun from Open WiFi Project． 

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,470
Open WiFi is an open source WiFi cheap design that was announced in first time 2020． 

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,420
This year we are here again． 

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,860
Nice to see you all． 

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Although I cannot see you actually． 

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,460
Anyway‚ let's get started． 

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:36,390
We are a small software defined radio group in the various group of ID Lab iMac Gent University Belgium． 

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,140
This is the agenda of my presentation． 

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,870
First‚ the open WiFi project． 

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:51,830
Progress in the first year after online will be introduced‚ then with some further explanations and highlights． 

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,460
Next‚ I will talk about our community growth situation． 

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,970
Then is the idea of low cost hardware‚ which I believe will boost our community a lot． 

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,710
The last one is the road map of 2021． 

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,740
Come on． 

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,160
Some of you might think this presentation is not as interesting as last year‚ right? 

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,700
No worry． 

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,660
Let me show you something cool． 

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,010
I remind you‚ this is not a go． 

19
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,690
Okay‚ that's all for today． 

20
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,360
Thank you． 

21
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,420
Any questions? 

22
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,670
I'm joking． 

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,920
Let's get started． 

24
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,060
The boring part． 

25
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,560
And you can prepare questions． 

26
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:53,830
Meanwhile‚ the first thing is about how do we decide the release name gentyuan and luwen actually before the project online at the end of 2019‚ we 3 developers agreed that for each release‚ a developer will pick a name of a place on the earth to assign it at the code name． 

27
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,100
Wait on the earth or in the universe? 

28
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,340
I can't remember clearly． 

29
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,950
Maybe it should be in the universe after all． 

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,790
Elo mask is going to live on the mouths‚ but the first three releases will be named by me Wei and mihail‚ which is the order of joining the project． 

31
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:25,740
I create the project at first‚ then we help you a lot on open OFDM project porting and testing‚ and many other stuffs mihail wrote the OFDM transmitter and also did lots of work to enable the 11 end feature． 

32
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,580
So the first release name hint is chosen by me． 

33
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,410
Ghent is the beautiful city in Belgium where we work． 

34
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,550
The open WiFi was born in Technology Park‚ Ghent‚ where our office located． 

35
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,100
The second release name Taiyuan is chosen by Wei． 

36
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,540
Taiyuan is her hometown and also the capital of Shaanxi province of China． 

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:56,520
The third release name luwen‚ is chosen by mihail because he lives in louven‚ which is another beautiful city in Belgium and close to Brussels． 

38
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,990
The future release will be decided by the developer who contribute the most to the release． 

39
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,540
This will show respect to the people who actually did the job． 

40
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,710
Talk is cheap． 

41
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
Show me the code． 

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:22,630
Next‚ highlight CS ICSI means channel state information for physical year researcher is also called frequency response or channel transformation function． 

43
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:41,090
Anyhow‚ the CS I believe it's available in all the WiFi chips‚ but few of them exposed the CSI to you as open WiFi is designed by us‚ so we can expose CSI definitely to external environment． 

44
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,600
For instance‚ now you can access CSI very easily on open WiFi． 

45
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,730
Why our set China? 

46
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,790
Actually we can expose modern CSI． 

47
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,960
So here I can call CSI cheap state information． 

48
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,690
A typical usage of the CSI is to detect the object in the environment． 

49
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,900
For instance‚ human movement‚ human gesture‚ people falling down． 

50
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,390
For instance‚ in this picture． 

51
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
And the link is here． 

52
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
This is a paper． 

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,230
You can find lots of paper about CSI application． 

54
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,640
They collect the CSI‚ from the transmitter to the receiver． 

55
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,340
The transmitter could be the AP in your home‚ right? 

56
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:35,590
And they collect CSI and receiver and running machine learning or classification algorithm to estimate or detect what is in between the transmitter and receiver． 

57
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,330
Here‚ the human gesture is an example． 

58
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,940
I think it's a very interesting application and lots of company are working on this to count people‚ detect people． 

59
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,370
But apparently there will be some privacy concern‚ as you can imagine． 

60
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:03,890
If I am a bad guy‚ I can receive your AB signal from outside your house and try to detect something inside‚ right? 

61
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,260
So CSI is just a tool． 

62
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,180
Use it in a good way‚ bad way． 

63
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,260
Depends on people． 

64
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:19,500
So how can we protect people from the bad usage of the CSI here? 

65
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,070
You can find a work from one of our experimenter in the Oka project is called CSI murder murder the CSI here is the link． 

66
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,950
You can check all the details online． 

67
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:44,560
Basic principle is also not difficult Since the Oklahoma chip is designed by us‚ we can had some random or fake CSI before the signal lift antenna of the transmitter． 

68
00:07:45,630 --> 00:08:05,990
Then in this way‚ when you try to collect CR CSI via the receiver‚ actually‚ you collect the combined CSI of the actual CSI and the fixed CSI‚ so with this fake unknown CSI‚ your machine learning or classification won't work anymore． 

69
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:19,290
So if a WiFi‚ AP‚ or some transmitter could give people this option‚ then people will have right to‚ let the CSI work or not． 

70
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,490
I think that would be a good progress of the CSI technology actually follow this direction． 

71
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,240
You can imagine lots of interesting papers or research‚ right? 

72
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,740
Because it's attack defense‚ attack defense． 

73
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,880
There will be an endless work． 

74
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,960
I think next highlight is about the IQ sample． 

75
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,360
I guess all the people in this room know what is IQ sample． 

76
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:56,060
Because most of the SDR device offer you IQ sample streaming from antenna to your computer or from your computer to the antenna with open WiFi design． 

77
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,760
Definitely we can also do that． 

78
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:10,640
But here we hasn't you IQ sample in a different or in a clever way because our IQ sample capture function is under a trigger condition． 

79
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,700
We won't do a streaming to the computer． 

80
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:33,440
Our IQ sample capture is triggered by the signal inside IP G by the event‚ for instance‚ the event of decoding success‚ the event of preamble de detection‚ the event of the channel from idle to busy‚ the event of the channel from B d to idle． 

81
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,100
We have defined a 32 event for you to select when you capture the IQ sample． 

82
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,710
So what‚ why do we develop this feature? 

83
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,740
The original purpose is for ourselves to debark our design． 

84
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,930
Because at the beginning‚ phase‚ we realize how lowlevel Mac is not ideal． 

85
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,570
We generate a lot of a collision in the air． 

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,870
So the question is‚ how can we come capture the collision moment and then deduct further of our I PJ design? 

87
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Then we find out this ID capture． 

88
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,020
For instance‚ how do we use the capture to capture the collision? 

89
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,940
We do it like this． 

90
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,070
We set up normal communication between open WiFi and pier WiFi station via the men attend‚ right? 

91
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,290
But on our platform‚ there is a secondary antenna． 

92
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,400
We call it a monitoring antenna． 

93
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,500
We can put this antenna via cable close to the PR WiFi station． 

94
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:42,130
Then we set the agriculture event be that we are transmitting． 

95
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,730
Meanwhile‚ we detect the SSI from the monitoring antenna above a threshold． 

96
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,370
Actually‚ this means when we are transmitting‚ the other side is also trying to transmit． 

97
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,780
That means a collision in the air because the packet will be overlap in the air． 

98
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,940
So in this way‚ we capture the collision． 

99
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,410
We analyze what happens in our IP GA‚ analyze the time before‚ time after． 

100
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,480
You know that you can define the capture position‚ How many pre IQ sample could be stored? 

101
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,520
It's a powerful tool． 

102
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,830
And the secondary usage could be‚ that help you debug your receiver． 

103
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:43,530
For instance‚ if you set the trigger condition to the CRC fail‚ then you can capture all the WiFi packet‚ that is not decoded successfully by our I PJ‚ then we do analyze offline on those IQ sample in Python to optimize or improve our receiver algorithm． 

104
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,470
And the third usage‚ apparently there are two attenders． 

105
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:58,830
You can already‚ capture two attender A Q samples and to develop or verify your mymo algorithm in the early phase‚ prepare for the mymo development． 

106
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,580
Okay‚ the next highlight is application notes． 

107
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:17,540
Actually‚ we learn this from those IC company and S R S LTE cause we noticed that s RSL t also prepare lots of‚ application notes document online． 

108
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,520
We have set up the application notes document directory in the GitHub． 

109
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:33,280
Currently‚ there are 9 application nodes covered from basic usage in different mode until the WiFi for introduction and the packaging injection． 

110
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,770
It's very useful for test and apparently also the CSI ACU capture stuff． 

111
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:50,840
Definitely if you want to explore those potential areas potential usage of our platform‚ do check out the application notes Notes． 

112
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,490
These highlights cover lots of things． 

113
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,320
Essential update． 

114
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,330
As you can see in the video‚ I cannot go through them or in this meeting． 

115
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,870
What I want to say is that they are really‚ really important． 

116
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,270
For instance‚ at the beginning‚ user keep telling us sometimes in they encounter the colonel crash‚ colonel panic‚ or the driver dress． 

117
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,260
And we spent lots of effort on this． 

118
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:27,670
Finally‚ it push us to do a better design for the FPG arm in interaction mechanism． 

119
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:39,380
Because when the for processor system‚ you can never assume the processor will handle the interrupt in time． 

120
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:45,710
The interrupt sometimes is handled in time by the processor‚ but sometimes several interrupt． 

121
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:55,700
They are cute and they are delayed and they and they arrive the CPU or wake up CPU suddenly in a very short time． 

122
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,730
So lots of state information have to be stored somewhere． 

123
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,240
You cannot drop them because you don't know when the processor will process them． 

124
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,410
Anyhow‚ lots of lots of details between the WiFi driver and IPG hardware． 

125
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:20,840
You can feel the big improvement if you run our current design‚ versus the beginning‚ initial design． 

126
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,460
Okay‚ next topic is about the community engagement or the community growth situation． 

127
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,690
I would say we did a good job regarding this． 

128
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:40,550
If you check the open up by GitHub in the one year period‚ we got 1．6K stars． 

129
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,640
That's already a lot‚ I would say‚ in this very narrow or professional domain． 

130
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,540
And 200 folks around 100 watch and several issues still open． 

131
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:01,080
Three internal developers you have known before and with also three external contributors． 

132
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,580
Surprisingly‚ although their code hasn't been merged yet． 

133
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,070
But I believe some of those code will be merged in this year． 

134
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:32,310
But if you compare our project to another very hot ipga project in the processor domain‚ the rocket chip‚ the leading‚ cheap design project of the Risk 5 domain on GitHub‚ they are online for two years and some company‚ I think‚ already take out the lucky chip． 

135
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:49,700
They have 1．7K stars‚ more or less the same‚ but they have much more folks watch issues and contributors‚ apparently their communities much bigger and more active than ours． 

136
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,340
I think the reason could be related to the question I raised to you last year． 

137
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:02,900
Why the computer science for me is so open and activity‚ domain is so close． 

138
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,630
I don't know why‚ why‚ but there could be also some other reasons． 

139
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:13,430
For instance‚ people maybe are so satisfied with the commercial WiFi． 

140
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,850
Cheap to play with‚ no matter for hacking‚ for security research of false IoT application． 

141
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:33,920
They are quite happy why they will use open WiFi and maybe because we are lacking the killer application of features that can only be done by open WiFi． 

142
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,370
Actually‚ we are offering some of them like the CS ICSI murder IQ sample． 

143
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,520
I think more will come． 

144
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,400
For this part I we are also eagerly want to hear from you． 

145
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,980
The third reason could be that the Linux driver staff． 

146
00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:16,030
As I mentioned before‚ the processor IPG interruption and IPG development are too difficult for many developers because I think‚ maybe the user space program is a bit easier for most of the developers because you software run in the pure CPU environment‚ no external interaction． 

147
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,400
And the last reason could be that the hardware is too expensive． 

148
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,671
Although we have try hard to push our design to a cheaper platform． 

149
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:34,660
For instance‚ at the beginning of design run on the SC 7 O 6‚ which cost you around 404‚ $4000． 

150
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,220
Now we can run on that port plus RF cost you only $900． 

151
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:51,050
It's already a big push‚ but WiFi cheap only cost you half dollar‚ even less that there's still a huge difference． 

152
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,750
I think this huge difference sometimes make‚ make the people difficult to make decision． 

153
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,650
So if you have any idea or theory about the reason‚ do come and tell us． 

154
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,230
We really want to grow the community． 

155
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,110
Okay‚ regarding the local hardware‚ I have been looking at the possibility for a long time． 

156
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,950
The final conclusion is like this‚ not final conclusion‚ initial conclusion． 

157
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:35,850
I believe the open WiFi‚ the cheap open WiFi platform could be the price could be as low as $200． 

158
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:46,230
Some of you already seen a long discussion‚ long several days discussion on Twitter about the cheap and hardware price． 

159
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,760
At the end of 2020． 

160
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,820
I guess during that time‚ lots of people had holidays． 

161
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,050
So we have time to do the discussion anyway． 

162
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,540
I also discuss in person with many hardware makers in Western and in China． 

163
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,520
I feel that in the future there will be a cheaper open WiFi platform． 

164
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,170
The price would be around $200‚ even cheaper． 

165
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,910
Let's see． 

166
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,910
New feature plant? 

167
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:25,800
Well‚ we have spent one year to realize there isn't any feature that is easy‚ even a small feature． 

168
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,350
A back weeks． 

169
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,850
All things are not easy actually． 

170
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:39,240
So we will be very careful to plan a new features regarding the difficulty and the resource we have． 

171
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,260
So in this year‚ we will start to work on the WiFi 6 or 11 a X standard． 

172
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:55,290
This year‚ maybe the basic physical layer transmitter receiver‚ will be developed． 

173
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:06,720
And also the Mimo‚ since we have prepared some basic tools like the dual autono agriculture‚ and we also have some masterthesis working on that． 

174
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:20,780
So mymo will also be started start from the atenna switch of diversity receiver and let's see‚ what can we achieve in this year? 

175
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:30,620
Maybe during summer‚ we could also make a proposal to Google to hire some students via the Google Summer of Code． 

176
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,590
I don't know． 

177
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,220
Let's see． 

178
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,420
Breaking news． 

179
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,870
I think this is the big news this year． 

180
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,400
Always big news comes at the end of each year‚ right? 

181
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,490
Last year‚ open my 5． 

182
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,560
This year the blade I blade I've． 

183
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:55,970
They also released the WiFi design for their ipga on their SBR down a board． 

184
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,760
Although their design and our our design‚ there are lots of difference． 

185
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,430
I think basically we do the same domain． 

186
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,440
Design the WiFi hardware． 

187
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,280
The cheap via the IP GI think this is a good sign also for us． 

188
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:23,760
That means in this community‚ the WiFi IPG design is an actual need from the community‚ not only our imagination． 

189
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,100
So we will keep watching and well‚ let's see． 

190
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:38,370
We hope this could encourage more and more people to think about playing the WiFi in a very deep level． 

191
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:46,430
Deep into Driver and IPG to come up with much‚ much‚ much wild‚ more wild ideas． 

192
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,180
A quick recap of today's‚ presentation． 

193
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:02,030
First one is that we have made lots of progress on different aspect aspect in the first year online‚ online‚ I'm proud of the project and our developers． 

194
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:11,700
We will push further for the advanced features like the WiFi 6 and my more‚ but we realized they cannot be done in one night． 

195
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,020
But we will keep moving． 

196
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,180
And for the community‚ we will also try harder to grow it． 

197
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,180
Regarding this point‚ we do need your help． 

198
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,180
No help is very‚ very welcome． 

199
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,580
Even you． 

200
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,850
You never use our design‚ but you can mention it‚ right? 

201
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,560
To some other people． 

202
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,350
You think our design might help them? 

203
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,480
That's also a very good help． 

204
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,800
And thank you in advance． 

205
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,920
And finally‚ if the break news‚ another WiFi． 

206
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:49,786
IPG design‚ I think that means more people will join this deep player． 

207
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,620
Deep WiFi playing domain‚ domain domain domain domain． 

208
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,230
We will keep moving‚ moving‚ keep voting． 

209
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,610
Sometimes competition is good for the ecosystem． 

210
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,260
Alright‚ this time‚ this is the real end of my presentation． 

211
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,170
Any questions? 

212
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,360
Please do communicate with us． 

213
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,710
My bye． 

214
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,030
Tie‚ so on． 

215
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,940
Okay‚ most devoted questions from Daniel about the CSI functionality． 

216
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,710
Yeah‚ this is quite good question． 

217
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,620
So the basic concept is that we involve‚ a fake‚ channel response at the transmitter． 

218
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:07,194
So if you consider a very simple single attender communication‚ scenario‚ if‚ if the real channel is a WGN‚ right? 

219
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:22,300
If you add the fake frequency selective‚ channel on the signal‚ then the‚ I guess the whole link will be degradated After all‚ it‚ it turns from a WGN to a frequency selective channel． 

220
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,590
But the real case is like this． 

221
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:34,190
If you monitor CSI for a normal WiFi link‚ the there's always frequency selectivity‚ either caused by the arch or caused by the multi part． 

222
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:47,380
So in this case‚ when we add‚ some slight‚ frequency selectivity at the transmitter‚ I don't think it will be bring a big degradation to the whole system． 

223
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:57,550
So the basic principle is that‚ we make sure our fake‚ CSI is added after all the processing． 

224
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:10,380
Just maybe‚ be before the I FFT‚ we add‚ the frequency selectivity on each sub carrier or after f I FFT in the time domain‚ add a filter． 

225
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:22,470
Then the receiver site doesn't need to know this receiver or the whole bunch of receiver algorithm will treat the fake channel plus real channel as a whole‚ right? 

226
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:32,860
So receiver don't need to aware that receiver don't need to modify Modi modified work with the fake CSI so‚ yeah． 

227
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,920
But I believe for the mymo case‚ could be more complicated． 

228
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:53,690
But the basic principle we should follow is that we add the fake channel after all the precoding‚ the informing operation‚ then let the whole‚ inner‚ inner part of the whole system‚ as a whole‚ right? 

229
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,760
The fake channel plus real channel as a whole． 

230
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,070
If you follow this principle‚ the receiver‚ Don't need to be changed． 

231
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,470
There's one situation． 

232
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:15,260
If the if the transmitter need receiver to do the feedback of the channel state information to help transmitter to come up with the optimal precoding． 

233
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:28,610
In that case‚ I think the transmitter need to consider this fake channel added at the transmitter site because the feedback‚ the feedback from receiver will include the fake channel response． 

234
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,710
And yeah． 

235
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,030
But then the signal transmit‚ transmit will transmitted will also include that． 

236
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:42,620
I think lots of things could be down there in this‚ anti antisensing or channel stuff． 

237
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:56,490
So a second question came up just right now‚ the from young‚ don't devices like plural SDR‚ hacker f repita and others have an FPJ that could be suitable for open WiFi． 

238
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,940
And what is holding you back reporting to do those platform? 

239
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:07,298
The basic reason is that IPG on those platform is‚ too small for our current design． 

240
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:20,840
Our current design is a basic single A 10 to 2011 n design 11 AGN the smallest IPG currently we are working on is 7 0 20 on Bluetooth is 7 0 10． 

241
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,040
IP GA high even much smaller． 

242
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,050
So so we need figure RPG? 

243
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,070
Yeah‚ that's the reason． 

244
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,040
Okay‚ perfect． 

245
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:38,630
And then‚ the probably last question that we can ask is‚ what is the main motivation to work on open WiFi? 

246
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,240
Like even after these‚ awesome． 

247
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,180
After the awesome work you did the last year‚ what is is the main motivation for open WiFi to exist? 

248
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,180
I think men motivation． 

249
00:27:49,420 --> 00:28:08,510
Well‚ the first motivation is that we realize‚ before our project‚ when people want to work on the cheap level of the WiFi‚ design‚ if they want to test the‚ their new ideas on the cheap level‚ they don't have‚ so much freedom‚ of‚ of free choices． 

250
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:21,080
They need the National Instruments WiFi application framework or they need the bar design or for the reference design design for Mango communication with the we the license condition with some license fee． 

251
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:35,370
So we will​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ decide to come up with a free software design on this‚ to help people‚ have have a more‚ more choice‚ more free choices． 

252
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:43,310
And in this action‚ we also‚ I think lower the whole bunch of the whole reference design software plus hardware． 

253
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,310
We lower the price a lot． 

254
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,220
So this could encourage‚ more lab‚ lab or universal city． 

255
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,130
A group could jump into this field‚ if they have a limit．
