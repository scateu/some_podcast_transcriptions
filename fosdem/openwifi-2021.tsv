EDL	00:00:05,600	00:00:09,210	| openwifi-2021 |	Hello imarband‚ this is Xian Jun from Open WiFi Project． 
EDL	00:00:09,210	00:00:09,730	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:09,730	00:00:16,470	| openwifi-2021 |	Open WiFi is an open source WiFi cheap design that was announced in first time 2020． 
EDL	00:00:16,470	00:00:16,930	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:16,930	00:00:19,470	| openwifi-2021 |	This year we are here again．

EDL	00:00:23,600	00:00:24,270	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:00:24,270	00:00:25,460	| openwifi-2021 |	Anyway‚ let's get started． 
EDL	00:00:25,460	00:00:28,030	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:28,030	00:00:36,390	| openwifi-2021 |	We are a small software defined radio group in the various group of ID Lab iMac Gent University Belgium． 
EDL	00:00:36,390	00:00:37,450	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:00:37,450	00:00:41,140	| openwifi-2021 |	This is the agenda of my presentation． 
EDL	00:00:41,140	00:00:41,720	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:41,720	00:00:43,910	| openwifi-2021 |	First‚ the open WiFi project． 
EDL	00:00:43,910	00:00:51,830	| openwifi-2021 |	Progress in the first year after online will be introduced‚ then with some further explanations and highlights． 
EDL	00:00:51,830	00:00:52,300	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:52,300	00:00:56,640	| openwifi-2021 |	Next‚ I will talk about our community growth situation． 
EDL	00:00:56,640	00:01:02,970	| openwifi-2021 |	Then is the idea of low cost hardware‚ which I believe will boost our community a lot． 
EDL	00:01:02,970	00:01:03,620	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:01:03,620	00:01:07,710	| openwifi-2021 |	The last one is the road map of 2021． 
EDL	00:01:07,710	00:01:09,930	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:01:09,930	00:01:10,750	| openwifi-2021 |	Come on． 
EDL	00:01:10,750	00:01:15,160	| openwifi-2021 |	Some of you might think this presentation is not as interesting as last year‚ right? 
EDL	00:01:15,160	00:01:15,730	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:01:15,730	00:01:16,710	| openwifi-2021 |	No worry． 
EDL	00:01:16,710	00:01:18,660	| openwifi-2021 |	Let me show you something cool． 
EDL	00:01:18,660	00:01:32,600	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 13.9 secs ]
EDL	00:01:32,600	00:01:35,010	| openwifi-2021 |	I remind you‚ this is not a go． 
EDL	00:01:35,010	00:03:16,140	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 101.1 secs ]
EDL	00:03:16,140	00:03:17,700	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ that's all for today． 
EDL	00:03:17,700	00:03:18,500	| openwifi-2021 |	Thank you． 
EDL	00:03:18,500	00:03:19,420	| openwifi-2021 |	Any questions? 
EDL	00:03:19,420	00:03:22,870	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 3.5 secs ]
EDL	00:03:22,870	00:03:23,680	| openwifi-2021 |	I'm joking． 
EDL	00:03:23,680	00:03:24,920	| openwifi-2021 |	Let's get started． 
EDL	00:03:24,920	00:03:26,060	| openwifi-2021 |	The boring part． 
EDL	00:03:26,060	00:03:26,420	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:03:26,420	00:03:28,570	| openwifi-2021 |	And you can prepare questions． 
EDL	00:03:28,570	00:03:53,830	| openwifi-2021 |	Meanwhile‚ the first thing is about how do we decide the release name gentyuan and luwen actually before the project online at the end of 2019‚ we 3 developers agreed that for each release‚ a developer will pick a name of a place on the earth to assign it at the code name． 
EDL	00:03:53,830	00:03:54,280	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:03:54,280	00:03:56,100	| openwifi-2021 |	Wait on the earth or in the universe? 
EDL	00:03:56,100	00:03:57,210	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:03:57,210	00:03:58,360	| openwifi-2021 |	I can't remember clearly． 
EDL	00:03:58,360	00:04:01,000	| openwifi-2021 |	Maybe it should be in the universe after all． 
EDL	00:04:01,000	00:04:11,800	| openwifi-2021 |	Elo mask is going to live on the mouths‚ but the first three releases will be named by me Wei and mihail‚ which is the order of joining the project． 
EDL	00:04:11,800	00:04:25,840	| openwifi-2021 |	I create the project at first‚ then we help you a lot on open OFDM project porting and testing‚ and many other stuffs mihail wrote the OFDM transmitter and also did lots of work to enable the 11 end feature． 
EDL	00:04:25,840	00:04:29,590	| openwifi-2021 |	So the first release name hint is chosen by me． 
EDL	00:04:29,590	00:04:33,470	| openwifi-2021 |	Ghent is the beautiful city in Belgium where we work． 
EDL	00:04:33,470	00:04:38,550	| openwifi-2021 |	The open WiFi was born in Technology Park‚ Ghent‚ where our office located． 
EDL	00:04:38,550	00:04:38,920	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:38,920	00:04:42,240	| openwifi-2021 |	The second release name Taiyuan is chosen by Wei． 
EDL	00:04:42,240	00:04:46,540	| openwifi-2021 |	Taiyuan is her hometown and also the capital of Shaanxi province of China． 
EDL	00:04:46,540	00:04:46,960	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:46,960	00:04:56,520	| openwifi-2021 |	The third release name luwen‚ is chosen by mihail because he lives in louven‚ which is another beautiful city in Belgium and close to Brussels． 
EDL	00:04:56,520	00:04:57,140	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:04:57,140	00:05:03,150	| openwifi-2021 |	The future release will be decided by the developer who contribute the most to the release． 
EDL	00:05:03,150	00:05:07,640	| openwifi-2021 |	This will show respect to the people who actually did the job． 
EDL	00:05:07,640	00:05:08,720	| openwifi-2021 |	Talk is cheap． 
EDL	00:05:08,720	00:05:10,120	| openwifi-2021 |	Show me the code． 
EDL	00:05:10,120	00:05:11,240	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:05:11,240	00:05:22,630	| openwifi-2021 |	Next‚ highlight CS ICSI means channel state information for physical year researcher is also called frequency response or channel transformation function． 
EDL	00:05:22,630	00:05:23,480	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:05:23,480	00:05:41,090	| openwifi-2021 |	Anyhow‚ the CS I believe it's available in all the WiFi chips‚ but few of them exposed the CSI to you as open WiFi is designed by us‚ so we can expose CSI definitely to external environment． 
EDL	00:05:41,090	00:05:41,510	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:41,510	00:05:44,600	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ now you can access CSI very easily on open WiFi． 
EDL	00:05:44,600	00:05:45,260	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:05:45,260	00:05:46,730	| openwifi-2021 |	Why our set China? 
EDL	00:05:46,730	00:05:48,160	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:05:48,160	00:05:50,800	| openwifi-2021 |	Actually we can expose modern CSI． 
EDL	00:05:50,800	00:05:53,960	| openwifi-2021 |	So here I can call CSI cheap state information． 
EDL	00:05:53,960	00:05:55,420	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:55,420	00:06:01,700	| openwifi-2021 |	A typical usage of the CSI is to detect the object in the environment． 
EDL	00:06:01,700	00:06:05,900	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ human movement‚ human gesture‚ people falling down． 
EDL	00:06:05,900	00:06:06,940	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:06:06,940	00:06:08,400	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ in this picture． 
EDL	00:06:08,400	00:06:09,520	| openwifi-2021 |	And the link is here． 
EDL	00:06:09,520	00:06:10,360	| openwifi-2021 |	This is a paper． 
EDL	00:06:10,360	00:06:14,230	| openwifi-2021 |	You can find lots of paper about CSI application． 
EDL	00:06:14,230	00:06:14,850	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:14,850	00:06:19,650	| openwifi-2021 |	They collect the CSI‚ from the transmitter to the receiver． 
EDL	00:06:19,650	00:06:22,340	| openwifi-2021 |	The transmitter could be the AP in your home‚ right? 
EDL	00:06:22,340	00:06:22,910	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:22,910	00:06:35,590	| openwifi-2021 |	And they collect CSI and receiver and running machine learning or classification algorithm to estimate or detect what is in between the transmitter and receiver． 
EDL	00:06:35,590	00:06:36,580	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:06:36,580	00:06:39,330	| openwifi-2021 |	Here‚ the human gesture is an example． 
EDL	00:06:39,330	00:06:40,950	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:40,950	00:06:46,940	| openwifi-2021 |	I think it's a very interesting application and lots of company are working on this to count people‚ detect people． 
EDL	00:06:46,940	00:06:48,300	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:48,300	00:06:54,460	| openwifi-2021 |	But apparently there will be some privacy concern‚ as you can imagine． 
EDL	00:06:54,460	00:07:03,890	| openwifi-2021 |	If I am a bad guy‚ I can receive your AB signal from outside your house and try to detect something inside‚ right? 
EDL	00:07:03,890	00:07:05,300	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:05,300	00:07:08,430	| openwifi-2021 |	So CSI is just a tool． 
EDL	00:07:08,430	00:07:10,380	| openwifi-2021 |	Use it in a good way‚ bad way． 
EDL	00:07:10,380	00:07:11,260	| openwifi-2021 |	Depends on people． 
EDL	00:07:11,260	00:07:11,850	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:07:11,850	00:07:19,500	| openwifi-2021 |	So how can we protect people from the bad usage of the CSI here? 
EDL	00:07:19,500	00:07:29,070	| openwifi-2021 |	You can find a work from one of our experimenter in the Oka project is called CSI murder murder the CSI here is the link． 
EDL	00:07:29,070	00:07:31,230	| openwifi-2021 |	You can check all the details online． 
EDL	00:07:31,230	00:07:44,560	| openwifi-2021 |	Basic principle is also not difficult Since the Oklahoma chip is designed by us‚ we can had some random or fake CSI before the signal lift antenna of the transmitter． 
EDL	00:07:44,560	00:07:45,630	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:07:45,630	00:08:05,990	| openwifi-2021 |	Then in this way‚ when you try to collect CR CSI via the receiver‚ actually‚ you collect the combined CSI of the actual CSI and the fixed CSI‚ so with this fake unknown CSI‚ your machine learning or classification won't work anymore． 
EDL	00:08:05,990	00:08:06,740	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:08:06,740	00:08:19,290	| openwifi-2021 |	So if a WiFi‚ AP‚ or some transmitter could give people this option‚ then people will have right to‚ let the CSI work or not． 
EDL	00:08:19,290	00:08:19,840	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:08:19,840	00:08:26,770	| openwifi-2021 |	I think that would be a good progress of the CSI technology actually follow this direction． 
EDL	00:08:26,770	00:08:31,250	| openwifi-2021 |	You can imagine lots of interesting papers or research‚ right? 
EDL	00:08:31,250	00:08:33,900	| openwifi-2021 |	Because it's attack defense‚ attack defense． 
EDL	00:08:33,900	00:08:35,890	| openwifi-2021 |	There will be an endless work． 
EDL	00:08:35,890	00:08:40,960	| openwifi-2021 |	I think next highlight is about the IQ sample． 
EDL	00:08:40,960	00:08:41,860	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:08:41,860	00:08:45,370	| openwifi-2021 |	I guess all the people in this room know what is IQ sample． 
EDL	00:08:45,370	00:08:56,070	| openwifi-2021 |	Because most of the SDR device offer you IQ sample streaming from antenna to your computer or from your computer to the antenna with open WiFi design． 
EDL	00:08:56,070	00:08:57,810	| openwifi-2021 |	Definitely we can also do that． 
EDL	00:08:57,810	00:09:10,640	| openwifi-2021 |	But here we hasn't you IQ sample in a different or in a clever way because our IQ sample capture function is under a trigger condition． 
EDL	00:09:10,640	00:09:11,680	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:09:11,680	00:09:14,700	| openwifi-2021 |	We won't do a streaming to the computer． 
EDL	00:09:14,700	00:09:15,480	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:09:15,480	00:09:33,740	| openwifi-2021 |	Our IQ sample capture is triggered by the signal inside IP G by the event‚ for instance‚ the event of decoding success‚ the event of preamble de detection‚ the event of the channel from idle to busy‚ the event of the channel from B d to idle． 
EDL	00:09:33,740	00:09:40,100	| openwifi-2021 |	We have defined a 32 event for you to select when you capture the IQ sample． 
EDL	00:09:40,100	00:09:40,970	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:09:40,970	00:09:43,710	| openwifi-2021 |	So what‚ why do we develop this feature? 
EDL	00:09:43,710	00:09:44,310	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:09:44,310	00:09:48,740	| openwifi-2021 |	The original purpose is for ourselves to debark our design． 
EDL	00:09:48,740	00:09:49,130	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:49,130	00:09:55,020	| openwifi-2021 |	Because at the beginning‚ phase‚ we realize how lowlevel Mac is not ideal． 
EDL	00:09:55,020	00:09:57,570	| openwifi-2021 |	We generate a lot of a collision in the air． 
EDL	00:09:57,570	00:09:58,000	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:09:58,000	00:10:04,870	| openwifi-2021 |	So the question is‚ how can we come capture the collision moment and then deduct further of our I PJ design? 
EDL	00:10:04,870	00:10:05,340	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:10:05,340	00:10:09,600	| openwifi-2021 |	Then we find out this ID capture． 
EDL	00:10:09,600	00:10:15,110	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ how do we use the capture to capture the collision? 
EDL	00:10:15,110	00:10:15,940	| openwifi-2021 |	We do it like this． 
EDL	00:10:15,940	00:10:22,070	| openwifi-2021 |	We set up normal communication between open WiFi and pier WiFi station via the men attend‚ right? 
EDL	00:10:22,070	00:10:22,660	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:22,660	00:10:25,290	| openwifi-2021 |	But on our platform‚ there is a secondary antenna． 
EDL	00:10:25,290	00:10:27,400	| openwifi-2021 |	We call it a monitoring antenna． 
EDL	00:10:27,400	00:10:27,960	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:27,960	00:10:32,500	| openwifi-2021 |	We can put this antenna via cable close to the PR WiFi station． 
EDL	00:10:32,500	00:10:33,310	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:10:33,310	00:10:42,140	| openwifi-2021 |	Then we set the agriculture event be that we are transmitting． 
EDL	00:10:42,140	00:10:48,730	| openwifi-2021 |	Meanwhile‚ we detect the SSI from the monitoring antenna above a threshold． 
EDL	00:10:48,730	00:10:49,700	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:10:49,700	00:10:55,600	| openwifi-2021 |	Actually‚ this means when we are transmitting‚ the other side is also trying to transmit． 
EDL	00:10:55,600	00:11:00,010	| openwifi-2021 |	That means a collision in the air because the packet will be overlap in the air． 
EDL	00:11:00,010	00:11:01,940	| openwifi-2021 |	So in this way‚ we capture the collision． 
EDL	00:11:01,940	00:11:07,410	| openwifi-2021 |	We analyze what happens in our IP GA‚ analyze the time before‚ time after． 
EDL	00:11:07,410	00:11:13,480	| openwifi-2021 |	You know that you can define the capture position‚ How many pre IQ sample could be stored? 
EDL	00:11:13,480	00:11:14,880	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:11:14,880	00:11:16,520	| openwifi-2021 |	It's a powerful tool． 
EDL	00:11:16,520	00:11:17,140	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:11:17,140	00:11:22,920	| openwifi-2021 |	And the secondary usage could be‚ that help you debug your receiver． 
EDL	00:11:22,920	00:11:43,530	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ if you set the trigger condition to the CRC fail‚ then you can capture all the WiFi packet‚ that is not decoded successfully by our I PJ‚ then we do analyze offline on those IQ sample in Python to optimize or improve our receiver algorithm． 
EDL	00:11:43,530	00:11:44,690	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:11:44,690	00:11:47,660	| openwifi-2021 |	And the third usage‚ apparently there are two attenders． 
EDL	00:11:47,660	00:11:58,830	| openwifi-2021 |	You can already‚ capture two attender A Q samples and to develop or verify your mymo algorithm in the early phase‚ prepare for the mymo development． 
EDL	00:11:58,830	00:12:01,290	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:01,290	00:12:05,610	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ the next highlight is application notes． 
EDL	00:12:05,610	00:12:17,540	| openwifi-2021 |	Actually‚ we learn this from those IC company and S R S LTE cause we noticed that s RSL t also prepare lots of‚ application notes document online． 
EDL	00:12:17,540	00:12:19,400	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:12:19,400	00:12:23,530	| openwifi-2021 |	We have set up the application notes document directory in the GitHub． 
EDL	00:12:23,530	00:12:33,280	| openwifi-2021 |	Currently‚ there are 9 application nodes covered from basic usage in different mode until the WiFi for introduction and the packaging injection． 
EDL	00:12:33,280	00:12:33,990	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:12:33,990	00:12:39,770	| openwifi-2021 |	It's very useful for test and apparently also the CSI ACU capture stuff． 
EDL	00:12:39,770	00:12:40,300	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:40,300	00:12:50,840	| openwifi-2021 |	Definitely if you want to explore those potential areas potential usage of our platform‚ do check out the application notes Notes． 
EDL	00:12:50,840	00:12:52,690	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:12:52,690	00:12:55,500	| openwifi-2021 |	These highlights cover lots of things． 
EDL	00:12:55,500	00:12:56,520	| openwifi-2021 |	Essential update． 
EDL	00:12:56,520	00:13:02,330	| openwifi-2021 |	As you can see in the video‚ I cannot go through them or in this meeting． 
EDL	00:13:02,330	00:13:03,700	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:13:03,700	00:13:06,880	| openwifi-2021 |	What I want to say is that they are really‚ really important． 
EDL	00:13:06,880	00:13:15,270	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ at the beginning‚ user keep telling us sometimes in they encounter the colonel crash‚ colonel panic‚ or the driver dress． 
EDL	00:13:15,270	00:13:16,240	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:13:16,240	00:13:19,270	| openwifi-2021 |	And we spent lots of effort on this． 
EDL	00:13:19,270	00:13:27,670	| openwifi-2021 |	Finally‚ it push us to do a better design for the FPG arm in interaction mechanism． 
EDL	00:13:27,670	00:13:28,630	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:13:28,630	00:13:39,380	| openwifi-2021 |	Because when the for processor system‚ you can never assume the processor will handle the interrupt in time． 
EDL	00:13:39,380	00:13:39,710	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:13:39,710	00:13:45,710	| openwifi-2021 |	The interrupt sometimes is handled in time by the processor‚ but sometimes several interrupt． 
EDL	00:13:45,710	00:13:46,210	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:13:46,210	00:13:55,740	| openwifi-2021 |	They are cute and they are delayed and they and they arrive the CPU or wake up CPU suddenly in a very short time． 
EDL	00:13:55,740	00:13:59,730	| openwifi-2021 |	So lots of state information have to be stored somewhere． 
EDL	00:13:59,730	00:14:00,100	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:14:00,100	00:14:04,240	| openwifi-2021 |	You cannot drop them because you don't know when the processor will process them． 
EDL	00:14:04,240	00:14:04,850	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:04,850	00:14:10,410	| openwifi-2021 |	Anyhow‚ lots of lots of details between the WiFi driver and IPG hardware． 
EDL	00:14:10,410	00:14:12,730	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:14:12,730	00:14:20,840	| openwifi-2021 |	You can feel the big improvement if you run our current design‚ versus the beginning‚ initial design． 
EDL	00:14:20,840	00:14:23,840	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 3.0 secs ]
EDL	00:14:23,840	00:14:29,460	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ next topic is about the community engagement or the community growth situation． 
EDL	00:14:29,460	00:14:30,500	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:14:30,500	00:14:33,990	| openwifi-2021 |	I would say we did a good job regarding this． 
EDL	00:14:33,990	00:14:40,550	| openwifi-2021 |	If you check the open up by GitHub in the one year period‚ we got 1．6K stars． 
EDL	00:14:40,550	00:14:41,000	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:14:41,000	00:14:46,770	| openwifi-2021 |	That's already a lot‚ I would say‚ in this very narrow or professional domain． 
EDL	00:14:46,770	00:14:53,540	| openwifi-2021 |	And 200 folks around 100 watch and several issues still open． 
EDL	00:14:53,540	00:14:54,350	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:14:54,350	00:15:01,370	| openwifi-2021 |	Three internal developers you have known before and with also three external contributors． 
EDL	00:15:01,370	00:15:05,650	| openwifi-2021 |	Surprisingly‚ although their code hasn't been merged yet． 
EDL	00:15:05,650	00:15:09,070	| openwifi-2021 |	But I believe some of those code will be merged in this year． 
EDL	00:15:09,070	00:15:09,740	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:15:09,740	00:15:32,310	| openwifi-2021 |	But if you compare our project to another very hot ipga project in the processor domain‚ the rocket chip‚ the leading‚ cheap design project of the Risk 5 domain on GitHub‚ they are online for two years and some company‚ I think‚ already take out the lucky chip． 
EDL	00:15:32,310	00:15:34,090	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:15:34,090	00:15:49,700	| openwifi-2021 |	They have 1．7K stars‚ more or less the same‚ but they have much more folks watch issues and contributors‚ apparently their communities much bigger and more active than ours． 
EDL	00:15:49,700	00:15:50,860	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:15:50,860	00:15:56,350	| openwifi-2021 |	I think the reason could be related to the question I raised to you last year． 
EDL	00:15:56,350	00:16:02,900	| openwifi-2021 |	Why the computer science for me is so open and activity‚ domain is so close． 
EDL	00:16:02,900	00:16:07,780	| openwifi-2021 |	I don't know why‚ why‚ but there could be also some other reasons． 
EDL	00:16:07,780	00:16:13,620	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ people maybe are so satisfied with the commercial WiFi． 
EDL	00:16:13,620	00:16:20,850	| openwifi-2021 |	Cheap to play with‚ no matter for hacking‚ for security research of false IoT application． 
EDL	00:16:20,850	00:16:21,160	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:16:21,160	00:16:33,920	| openwifi-2021 |	They are quite happy why they will use open WiFi and maybe because we are lacking the killer application of features that can only be done by open WiFi． 
EDL	00:16:33,920	00:16:34,850	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:16:34,850	00:16:39,370	| openwifi-2021 |	Actually‚ we are offering some of them like the CS ICSI murder IQ sample． 
EDL	00:16:39,370	00:16:40,130	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:16:40,130	00:16:41,520	| openwifi-2021 |	I think more will come． 
EDL	00:16:41,520	00:16:42,650	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:16:42,650	00:16:48,400	| openwifi-2021 |	For this part I we are also eagerly want to hear from you． 
EDL	00:16:48,400	00:16:49,090	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:16:49,090	00:16:52,990	| openwifi-2021 |	The third reason could be that the Linux driver staff． 
EDL	00:16:52,990	00:17:16,030	| openwifi-2021 |	As I mentioned before‚ the processor IPG interruption and IPG development are too difficult for many developers because I think‚ maybe the user space program is a bit easier for most of the developers because you software run in the pure CPU environment‚ no external interaction． 
EDL	00:17:16,030	00:17:17,270	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:17:17,270	00:17:21,400	| openwifi-2021 |	And the last reason could be that the hardware is too expensive． 
EDL	00:17:21,400	00:17:21,950	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:21,950	00:17:26,671	| openwifi-2021 |	Although we have try hard to push our design to a cheaper platform． 
EDL	00:17:26,671	00:17:34,790	| openwifi-2021 |	For instance‚ at the beginning of design run on the SC 7 O 6‚ which cost you around 404‚ $4000． 
EDL	00:17:34,790	00:17:39,220	| openwifi-2021 |	Now we can run on that port plus RF cost you only $900． 
EDL	00:17:39,220	00:17:39,690	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:39,690	00:17:51,050	| openwifi-2021 |	It's already a big push‚ but WiFi cheap only cost you half dollar‚ even less that there's still a huge difference． 
EDL	00:17:51,050	00:17:52,820	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:17:52,820	00:18:00,750	| openwifi-2021 |	I think this huge difference sometimes make‚ make the people difficult to make decision． 
EDL	00:18:00,750	00:18:03,000	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:18:03,000	00:18:09,650	| openwifi-2021 |	So if you have any idea or theory about the reason‚ do come and tell us． 
EDL	00:18:09,650	00:18:10,560	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:18:10,560	00:18:12,230	| openwifi-2021 |	We really want to grow the community． 
EDL	00:18:12,230	00:18:14,530	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:14,530	00:18:21,110	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ regarding the local hardware‚ I have been looking at the possibility for a long time． 
EDL	00:18:21,110	00:18:22,600	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:18:22,600	00:18:26,950	| openwifi-2021 |	The final conclusion is like this‚ not final conclusion‚ initial conclusion． 
EDL	00:18:26,950	00:18:27,670	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:18:27,670	00:18:35,850	| openwifi-2021 |	I believe the open WiFi‚ the cheap open WiFi platform could be the price could be as low as $200． 
EDL	00:18:35,850	00:18:37,010	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:18:37,010	00:18:46,330	| openwifi-2021 |	Some of you already seen a long discussion‚ long several days discussion on Twitter about the cheap and hardware price． 
EDL	00:18:46,330	00:18:47,760	| openwifi-2021 |	At the end of 2020． 
EDL	00:18:47,760	00:18:50,950	| openwifi-2021 |	I guess during that time‚ lots of people had holidays． 
EDL	00:18:50,950	00:18:55,050	| openwifi-2021 |	So we have time to do the discussion anyway． 
EDL	00:18:55,050	00:19:01,540	| openwifi-2021 |	I also discuss in person with many hardware makers in Western and in China． 
EDL	00:19:01,540	00:19:02,780	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:19:02,780	00:19:07,520	| openwifi-2021 |	I feel that in the future there will be a cheaper open WiFi platform． 
EDL	00:19:07,520	00:19:08,130	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:19:08,130	00:19:11,180	| openwifi-2021 |	The price would be around $200‚ even cheaper． 
EDL	00:19:11,180	00:19:11,910	| openwifi-2021 |	Let's see． 
EDL	00:19:11,910	00:19:13,950	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:13,950	00:19:14,910	| openwifi-2021 |	New feature plant? 
EDL	00:19:14,910	00:19:16,920	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:16,920	00:19:25,800	| openwifi-2021 |	Well‚ we have spent one year to realize there isn't any feature that is easy‚ even a small feature． 
EDL	00:19:25,800	00:19:26,370	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:19:26,370	00:19:27,350	| openwifi-2021 |	A back weeks． 
EDL	00:19:27,350	00:19:28,340	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:28,340	00:19:29,850	| openwifi-2021 |	All things are not easy actually． 
EDL	00:19:29,850	00:19:31,100	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:19:31,100	00:19:39,240	| openwifi-2021 |	So we will be very careful to plan a new features regarding the difficulty and the resource we have． 
EDL	00:19:39,240	00:19:39,700	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:19:39,700	00:19:47,260	| openwifi-2021 |	So in this year‚ we will start to work on the WiFi 6 or 11 a X standard． 
EDL	00:19:47,260	00:19:48,210	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:48,210	00:19:55,290	| openwifi-2021 |	This year‚ maybe the basic physical layer transmitter receiver‚ will be developed． 
EDL	00:19:55,290	00:19:57,500	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:19:57,500	00:20:06,720	| openwifi-2021 |	And also the Mimo‚ since we have prepared some basic tools like the dual autono agriculture‚ and we also have some masterthesis working on that． 
EDL	00:20:06,720	00:20:08,860	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:20:08,860	00:20:20,780	| openwifi-2021 |	So mymo will also be started start from the atenna switch of diversity receiver and let's see‚ what can we achieve in this year? 
EDL	00:20:20,780	00:20:21,520	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:20:21,520	00:20:30,620	| openwifi-2021 |	Maybe during summer‚ we could also make a proposal to Google to hire some students via the Google Summer of Code． 
EDL	00:20:30,620	00:20:30,930	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:20:30,930	00:20:31,600	| openwifi-2021 |	I don't know． 
EDL	00:20:31,600	00:20:32,220	| openwifi-2021 |	Let's see． 
EDL	00:20:32,220	00:20:33,720	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:33,720	00:20:34,420	| openwifi-2021 |	Breaking news． 
EDL	00:20:34,420	00:20:35,130	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:20:35,130	00:20:37,870	| openwifi-2021 |	I think this is the big news this year． 
EDL	00:20:37,870	00:20:38,410	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:38,410	00:20:41,410	| openwifi-2021 |	Always big news comes at the end of each year‚ right? 
EDL	00:20:41,410	00:20:42,490	| openwifi-2021 |	Last year‚ open my 5． 
EDL	00:20:42,490	00:20:48,570	| openwifi-2021 |	This year the blade I blade I've． 
EDL	00:20:48,570	00:20:55,970	| openwifi-2021 |	They also released the WiFi design for their ipga on their SBR down a board． 
EDL	00:20:55,970	00:20:57,220	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:20:57,220	00:21:00,760	| openwifi-2021 |	Although their design and our our design‚ there are lots of difference． 
EDL	00:21:00,760	00:21:04,430	| openwifi-2021 |	I think basically we do the same domain． 
EDL	00:21:04,430	00:21:05,190	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:05,190	00:21:07,440	| openwifi-2021 |	Design the WiFi hardware． 
EDL	00:21:07,440	00:21:13,280	| openwifi-2021 |	The cheap via the IP GI think this is a good sign also for us． 
EDL	00:21:13,280	00:21:14,110	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:14,110	00:21:23,760	| openwifi-2021 |	That means in this community‚ the WiFi IPG design is an actual need from the community‚ not only our imagination．

EDL	00:21:47,890	00:21:51,190	| openwifi-2021 |	A quick recap of today's‚ presentation． 
EDL	00:21:51,190	00:22:02,030	| openwifi-2021 |	First one is that we have made lots of progress on different aspect aspect in the first year online‚ online‚ I'm proud of the project and our developers． 
EDL	00:22:02,030	00:22:03,500	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:22:03,500	00:22:11,920	| openwifi-2021 |	We will push further for the advanced features like the WiFi 6 and my more‚ but we realized they cannot be done in one night． 
EDL	00:22:11,920	00:22:13,020	| openwifi-2021 |	But we will keep moving． 
EDL	00:22:13,020	00:22:14,520	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:22:14,520	00:22:19,180	| openwifi-2021 |	And for the community‚ we will also try harder to grow it． 
EDL	00:22:19,180	00:22:20,560	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]

EDL	00:22:40,530	00:22:43,930	| openwifi-2021 |	And finally‚ if the break news‚ another WiFi． 
EDL	00:22:43,930	00:22:49,786	| openwifi-2021 |	IPG design‚ I think that means more people will join this deep player． 
EDL	00:22:49,786	00:22:53,620	| openwifi-2021 |	Deep WiFi playing domain‚ domain domain domain domain．

EDL	00:22:57,870	00:23:02,610	| openwifi-2021 |	Sometimes competition is good for the ecosystem． 
EDL	00:23:02,610	00:23:04,900	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:23:04,900	00:23:08,260	| openwifi-2021 |	Alright‚ this time‚ this is the real end of my presentation． 
EDL	00:23:08,260	00:23:09,030	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:23:09,030	00:23:10,250	| openwifi-2021 |	Any questions? 
EDL	00:23:10,250	00:23:12,360	| openwifi-2021 |	Please do communicate with us． 
EDL	00:23:12,360	00:23:12,930	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:23:12,930	00:23:13,710	| openwifi-2021 |	My bye． 
EDL	00:23:13,710	00:23:36,400	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 22.7 secs ]
EDL	00:23:36,400	00:23:39,030	| openwifi-2021 |	Tie‚ so on． 
EDL	00:23:39,030	00:23:40,240	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:23:40,240	00:23:45,940	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ most devoted questions from Daniel about the CSI functionality． 
EDL	00:23:45,940	00:23:46,280	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:23:46,280	00:23:49,710	| openwifi-2021 |	Yeah‚ this is quite good question． 
EDL	00:23:49,710	00:23:50,140	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:23:50,140	00:23:56,620	| openwifi-2021 |	So the basic concept is that we involve‚ a fake‚ channel response at the transmitter． 
EDL	00:23:56,620	00:23:57,050	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:23:57,050	00:24:07,194	| openwifi-2021 |	So if you consider a very simple single attender communication‚ scenario‚ if‚ if the real channel is a WGN‚ right? 
EDL	00:24:07,194	00:24:07,521	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:24:07,521	00:24:22,300	| openwifi-2021 |	If you add the fake frequency selective‚ channel on the signal‚ then the‚ I guess the whole link will be degradated After all‚ it‚ it turns from a WGN to a frequency selective channel． 
EDL	00:24:22,300	00:24:22,740	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:24:22,740	00:24:24,590	| openwifi-2021 |	But the real case is like this． 
EDL	00:24:24,590	00:24:25,110	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:24:25,110	00:24:34,190	| openwifi-2021 |	If you monitor CSI for a normal WiFi link‚ the there's always frequency selectivity‚ either caused by the arch or caused by the multi part． 
EDL	00:24:34,190	00:24:34,500	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:24:34,500	00:24:47,380	| openwifi-2021 |	So in this case‚ when we add‚ some slight‚ frequency selectivity at the transmitter‚ I don't think it will be bring a big degradation to the whole system． 
EDL	00:24:47,380	00:24:48,120	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:24:48,120	00:24:57,590	| openwifi-2021 |	So the basic principle is that‚ we make sure our fake‚ CSI is added after all the processing． 
EDL	00:24:57,590	00:25:10,380	| openwifi-2021 |	Just maybe‚ be before the I FFT‚ we add‚ the frequency selectivity on each sub carrier or after f I FFT in the time domain‚ add a filter． 
EDL	00:25:10,380	00:25:11,040	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:25:11,040	00:25:22,480	| openwifi-2021 |	Then the receiver site doesn't need to know this receiver or the whole bunch of receiver algorithm will treat the fake channel plus real channel as a whole‚ right? 
EDL	00:25:22,480	00:25:32,970	| openwifi-2021 |	So receiver don't need to aware that receiver don't need to modify Modi modified work with the fake CSI so‚ yeah． 
EDL	00:25:32,970	00:25:36,930	| openwifi-2021 |	But I believe for the mymo case‚ could be more complicated． 
EDL	00:25:36,930	00:25:53,700	| openwifi-2021 |	But the basic principle we should follow is that we add the fake channel after all the precoding‚ the informing operation‚ then let the whole‚ inner‚ inner part of the whole system‚ as a whole‚ right? 
EDL	00:25:53,700	00:25:55,790	| openwifi-2021 |	The fake channel plus real channel as a whole． 
EDL	00:25:55,790	00:26:02,070	| openwifi-2021 |	If you follow this principle‚ the receiver‚ Don't need to be changed． 
EDL	00:26:02,070	00:26:04,110	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:26:04,110	00:26:05,640	| openwifi-2021 |	There's one situation． 
EDL	00:26:05,640	00:26:15,260	| openwifi-2021 |	If the if the transmitter need receiver to do the feedback of the channel state information to help transmitter to come up with the optimal precoding． 
EDL	00:26:15,260	00:26:15,610	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:26:15,610	00:26:28,610	| openwifi-2021 |	In that case‚ I think the transmitter need to consider this fake channel added at the transmitter site because the feedback‚ the feedback from receiver will include the fake channel response． 
EDL	00:26:28,610	00:26:29,360	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:26:29,360	00:26:31,720	| openwifi-2021 |	And yeah． 
EDL	00:26:31,720	00:26:35,030	| openwifi-2021 |	But then the signal transmit‚ transmit will transmitted will also include that． 
EDL	00:26:35,030	00:26:35,850	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:26:35,850	00:26:42,620	| openwifi-2021 |	I think lots of things could be down there in this‚ anti antisensing or channel stuff． 
EDL	00:26:42,620	00:26:43,800	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:26:43,800	00:26:56,630	| openwifi-2021 |	So a second question came up just right now‚ the from young‚ don't devices like plural SDR‚ hacker f repita and others have an FPJ that could be suitable for open WiFi． 
EDL	00:26:56,630	00:26:59,940	| openwifi-2021 |	And what is holding you back reporting to do those platform? 
EDL	00:26:59,940	00:27:00,888	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:27:00,888	00:27:07,298	| openwifi-2021 |	The basic reason is that IPG on those platform is‚ too small for our current design． 
EDL	00:27:07,298	00:27:20,850	| openwifi-2021 |	Our current design is a basic single A 10 to 2011 n design 11 AGN the smallest IPG currently we are working on is 7 0 20 on Bluetooth is 7 0 10． 
EDL	00:27:20,850	00:27:24,040	| openwifi-2021 |	IP GA high even much smaller． 
EDL	00:27:24,040	00:27:25,220	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:27:25,220	00:27:27,050	| openwifi-2021 |	So so we need figure RPG? 
EDL	00:27:27,050	00:27:27,740	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:27:27,740	00:27:29,070	| openwifi-2021 |	Yeah‚ that's the reason． 
EDL	00:27:29,070	00:27:29,790	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:27:29,790	00:27:31,290	| openwifi-2021 |	Okay‚ perfect． 
EDL	00:27:31,290	00:27:38,880	| openwifi-2021 |	And then‚ the probably last question that we can ask is‚ what is the main motivation to work on open WiFi? 
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,250	| openwifi-2021 |	Like even after these‚ awesome． 
EDL	00:27:41,250	00:27:46,180	| openwifi-2021 |	After the awesome work you did the last year‚ what is is the main motivation for open WiFi to exist? 
EDL	00:27:46,180	00:27:47,460	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:27:47,460	00:27:49,420	| openwifi-2021 |	I think men motivation． 
EDL	00:27:49,420	00:28:08,510	| openwifi-2021 |	Well‚ the first motivation is that we realize‚ before our project‚ when people want to work on the cheap level of the WiFi‚ design‚ if they want to test the‚ their new ideas on the cheap level‚ they don't have‚ so much freedom‚ of‚ of free choices． 
EDL	00:28:08,510	00:28:08,860	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:28:08,860	00:28:21,080	| openwifi-2021 |	They need the National Instruments WiFi application framework or they need the bar design or for the reference design design for Mango communication with the we the license condition with some license fee． 
EDL	00:28:21,080	00:28:23,250	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:28:23,250	00:28:35,370	| openwifi-2021 |	So we will​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ decide to come up with a free software design on this‚ to help people‚ have have a more‚ more choice‚ more free choices． 
EDL	00:28:35,370	00:28:35,970	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:28:35,970	00:28:43,400	| openwifi-2021 |	And in this action‚ we also‚ I think lower the whole bunch of the whole reference design software plus hardware． 
EDL	00:28:43,400	00:28:45,340	| openwifi-2021 |	We lower the price a lot． 
EDL	00:28:45,340	00:28:50,220	| openwifi-2021 |	So this could encourage‚ more lab‚ lab or universal city． 
EDL	00:28:50,220	00:28:51,040	| openwifi-2021 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:28:51,040	00:28:56,130	| openwifi-2021 |	A group could jump into this field‚ if they have a limit． \N
