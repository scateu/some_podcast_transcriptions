EDL	00:00:17,006	00:00:19,330	| openwifi-2022 |	In the software‚ radio‚ radio‚ dapp room． 
EDL	00:00:19,330	00:00:21,020	| openwifi-2022 |	First time 2022． 
EDL	00:00:21,020	00:00:21,350	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:00:21,350	00:00:22,120	| openwifi-2022 |	Good morning． 
EDL	00:00:22,120	00:00:24,440	| openwifi-2022 |	Good afternoon and good evening．

---	00:00:25,150	00:00:31,240	| openwifi-2022 |	My name is Xian junjiao and I'm from ID Lab iMac and Gent University Belgium． 
EDL	00:00:31,240	00:00:32,170	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:00:32,170	00:00:36,780	| openwifi-2022 |	Let's talk about the open WiFi project again‚ like we did in every year． 
EDL	00:00:36,780	00:00:39,000	| openwifi-2022 |	First time since 2020． 
EDL	00:00:39,000	00:00:40,590	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:40,590	00:00:43,820	| openwifi-2022 |	It's the yearly update of the open WiFi project． 
EDL	00:00:43,820	00:00:44,180	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:00:44,180	00:00:46,950	| openwifi-2022 |	If you also talk about the future plan‚ plan． 
EDL	00:00:46,950	00:00:47,870	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:00:47,870	00:00:49,740	| openwifi-2022 |	In case there are new audiences． 
EDL	00:00:49,740	00:00:50,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:00:50,560	00:00:53,080	| openwifi-2022 |	Let me tell you what open WiFi is． 
EDL	00:00:53,080	00:00:53,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:53,560	00:00:58,040	| openwifi-2022 |	It is an open source WiFi chip design project written in verylog． 
EDL	00:00:58,040	00:00:58,690	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:58,690	00:01:05,170	| openwifi-2022 |	It's already functioning on the IPG board and can be used like a real WiFi card． 
EDL	00:01:05,170	00:01:16,750	| openwifi-2022 |	On the Linux‚ for instance‚ you can log in to the FPG board via SSH over Internet and operate the WiFi card like you do on resperry pie． 
EDL	00:01:16,750	00:01:17,270	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:17,270	00:01:20,070	| openwifi-2022 |	Just search Open my phone on the internet． 
EDL	00:01:20,070	00:01:22,760	| openwifi-2022 |	I believe you will find our project． 
EDL	00:01:22,760	00:01:23,730	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:01:23,730	00:01:27,460	| openwifi-2022 |	The project was online at the end of 2019． 
EDL	00:01:27,460	00:01:27,950	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:27,950	00:01:32,150	| openwifi-2022 |	After that‚ it keeps attracting attention along with time． 
EDL	00:01:32,150	00:01:32,640	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:01:32,640	00:01:37,770	| openwifi-2022 |	As in this star history figure‚ it increases almost linearly． 
EDL	00:01:37,770	00:01:39,710	| openwifi-2022 |	In the past two years． 
EDL	00:01:39,710	00:01:40,310	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:01:40,310	00:01:42,760	| openwifi-2022 |	There are two leaps in the figure． 
EDL	00:01:42,760	00:01:52,610	| openwifi-2022 |	Probably the first leap was due to the report by CN X Software News‚ and the second one was because of Hacker News Report report． 
EDL	00:01:52,610	00:01:54,630	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:01:54,630	00:01:58,890	| openwifi-2022 |	The first part is about the features and optimizations． 

Note: this is really cool! Well done!

* Chapter 3
EDL	00:01:58,890	00:02:00,270	| openwifi-2022 |	In the past year． 
EDL	00:02:00,270	00:02:01,050	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:02:01,050	00:02:11,280	| openwifi-2022 |	I have to admit that some of them are more complicated than our imagination‚ so the planned release was delayed several times． 
EDL	00:02:11,280	00:02:19,710	| openwifi-2022 |	Actually‚ no formal release in the past year‚ except some bug fixes and some small improvements． 
EDL	00:02:19,710	00:02:20,710	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:02:20,710	00:02:23,340	| openwifi-2022 |	Maybe at the presentation moment． 
EDL	00:02:23,340	00:02:23,680	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:23,680	00:02:38,340	| openwifi-2022 |	These works are still not released yet‚ but we have confidence to release these works in February 2022 because we have solved most of the issues after struggling more than one year． 
EDL	00:02:38,340	00:02:39,420	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:02:39,420	00:02:43,890	| openwifi-2022 |	The first feature is about the ampdu and block arc． 
EDL	00:02:43,890	00:02:45,500	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:45,500	00:02:56,860	| openwifi-2022 |	A M PDU stands for aggregated Mac P U‚ it allows the WiFi card to put multiple micro Pdus to a single physical layer packet． 
EDL	00:02:56,860	00:02:57,420	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:02:57,420	00:03:03,750	| openwifi-2022 |	So the gap and acknowledgment procedure after each macpdu is eliminated． 
EDL	00:03:03,750	00:03:04,980	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:03:04,980	00:03:09,830	| openwifi-2022 |	Apparently‚ because of this‚ transmission efficiency can be increased a lot． 
EDL	00:03:09,830	00:03:10,990	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:03:10,990	00:03:17,040	| openwifi-2022 |	This is an important feature introduced in WiFi 4 8 O2 dot 11 n． 
EDL	00:03:17,040	00:03:17,800	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:03:17,800	00:03:41,880	| openwifi-2022 |	It is optional in WiFi 4‚ but it has become mandatory since WiFi 5 8 O2 dot 11 AC‚ even if there's only one Mac PDU to be sent in WiFi 5‚ it has to be encapsulated in the A M PDU format‚ which is called single packet A m PDU． 
EDL	00:03:41,880	00:03:43,460	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:03:43,460	00:03:49,160	| openwifi-2022 |	Accordingly‚ the block act block acknowledgment was introduced as well． 
EDL	00:03:49,160	00:04:05,420	| openwifi-2022 |	In WiFi 4‚ it allows the WiFi card to aggregate the multiple acknowledgments into one big acknowledgment packet so that the acknowledgment for every single Mac PDU is not needed anymore． 
EDL	00:04:05,420	00:04:06,350	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:04:06,350	00:04:16,230	| openwifi-2022 |	Apparently‚ this will also increase the transmission efficiency‚ especially when it is used together with the amptu． 
EDL	00:04:16,230	00:04:18,350	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:04:18,350	00:04:28,590	| openwifi-2022 |	In the actual implementation‚ when Linux handles a Mac PDU to WiFi card‚ it only labels the packet that it can be aggregated or not． 
EDL	00:04:28,590	00:04:29,100	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:04:29,100	00:04:36,420	| openwifi-2022 |	Whether the packet will actually be aggregated and how many my Pdus will be aggregated． 
EDL	00:04:36,420	00:04:36,990	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:04:36,990	00:04:52,830	| openwifi-2022 |	It is the WiFi car's decision‚ not Linux‚ because only the card knows the exact transmission opportunity and how many specific packets in specific queues at that moment in the card． 
EDL	00:04:52,830	00:04:53,180	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:53,180	00:05:01,670	| openwifi-2022 |	So the A m PDU implementation involves quite a lot of FPJ work and not as simple as the concept． 
EDL	00:05:01,670	00:05:03,290	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:03,290	00:05:12,460	| openwifi-2022 |	And because of the aggregation capability‚ more packets can come in and go out in a short period of time for WiFi cards． 
EDL	00:05:12,460	00:05:13,150	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:05:13,150	00:05:22,420	| openwifi-2022 |	So it triggered some hidden box of our design‚ which is not seen before when the packet density is not that high． 
EDL	00:05:22,420	00:05:22,990	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:22,990	00:05:28,650	| openwifi-2022 |	Next‚ let's talk about a feature about WiFi privacy and security． 
EDL	00:05:28,650	00:05:29,320	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:05:29,320	00:05:40,050	| openwifi-2022 |	The CSI father CSI means the channel state information‚ which is available in the channel estimation module inside the WiFi receiver． 
EDL	00:05:40,050	00:05:41,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:05:41,560	00:05:50,640	| openwifi-2022 |	This is a refined and reflected feature based on the CSI Murder work we reported last year together with our partner． 
EDL	00:05:50,640	00:05:51,790	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:05:51,790	00:05:57,020	| openwifi-2022 |	Now you can use this feature with the open WiFi public release out of the box． 
EDL	00:05:57,020	00:05:57,740	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:05:57,740	00:05:59,240	| openwifi-2022 |	The idea is simple． 
EDL	00:05:59,240	00:06:00,010	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:06:00,010	00:06:07,310	| openwifi-2022 |	You can configure an artificial channel state information to the WiFi signal before it leaves the transmitter antenna． 
EDL	00:06:07,310	00:06:08,250	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:06:08,250	00:06:17,280	| openwifi-2022 |	Actually‚ it is a configurable F IR filter in between the WiFi baseband OFDM transmitter and the antenna． 
EDL	00:06:17,280	00:06:18,460	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:06:18,460	00:06:40,260	| openwifi-2022 |	And this operation won't destroy the normal WiFi communication because the receiver will do channel estimation and equalization anyway‚ no matter if the channel is the real environment channel or real environment channel combined with the artificial channel added inside the transmitter． 
EDL	00:06:40,260	00:06:41,430	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:06:41,430	00:07:24,130	| openwifi-2022 |	But for those sensing receivers that rely on the CSI reflecting‚ reflecting the real environment‚ the sensing won't work anymore because they don't know what kind of artificial CSI is added at the transmitter and only see a combined CSI and a receiver‚ which never reflect the real environment channel for authorized sensing receiver who knows the artificial CSI‚ they can recover the environment CSI from the combined CSI observed in the receiver． 
EDL	00:07:24,130	00:07:25,020	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:07:25,020	00:07:30,720	| openwifi-2022 |	You can find our Y SEC 21 paper‚ and the application note on GitHub． 
EDL	00:07:30,720	00:07:32,830	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:07:32,830	00:07:58,070	| openwifi-2022 |	The CSI father is actually manipulating the signal in the traditional security research fuzzing area‚ where people manipulate the bit in the WiFi PDU‚ there is an open WiFi based father called O W Fuss‚ which is developed by researchers in Alipay‚ which is part of Alibaba． 
EDL	00:07:58,070	00:08:00,220	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:08:00,220	00:08:06,540	| openwifi-2022 |	As you can see on their website‚ some CDS are disclosed already． 
EDL	00:08:06,540	00:08:08,460	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:08:08,460	00:08:12,140	| openwifi-2022 |	Next thing is about simple TX diversity． 
EDL	00:08:12,140	00:08:13,020	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:08:13,020	00:08:23,890	| openwifi-2022 |	Since many platforms have two TX attenders‚ a simple door alternative X diversity can be achieved with a tiny extra footprint． 
EDL	00:08:23,890	00:08:24,900	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:08:24,900	00:08:32,340	| openwifi-2022 |	It is almost identical to the CSD cyclic shift diversity defined in the WiFi standard． 
EDL	00:08:32,340	00:08:34,120	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:08:34,120	00:08:41,920	| openwifi-2022 |	To explain how it works‚ let's think about what happens if we fit the same or FDM symbol． 
EDL	00:08:41,920	00:08:45,270	| openwifi-2022 |	A signal to 2 attendance directly． 
EDL	00:08:45,270	00:08:46,120	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:08:46,120	00:08:48,970	| openwifi-2022 |	This is the simplest been forming case． 
EDL	00:08:48,970	00:08:50,240	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:08:50,240	00:08:58,730	| openwifi-2022 |	If the attendance bacing is appropriate‚ it could form a beam towards the right direction in the figure． 
EDL	00:08:58,730	00:09:00,030	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:00,030	00:09:12,020	| openwifi-2022 |	Then the problem is that for those stations in other directions‚ bad signals will be experienced because they are not in the main loop‚ they are in the side lobe． 
EDL	00:09:12,020	00:09:13,180	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:09:13,180	00:09:21,470	| openwifi-2022 |	What happens if we simply had a fixed time domain delay before the signal is sent to one of the attenders? 
EDL	00:09:21,470	00:09:22,960	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:09:22,960	00:09:37,700	| openwifi-2022 |	Amazing things will happen as we know that the OFDM signal includes multiple subcarriers‚ and different sub carriers actually means different frequencies． 
EDL	00:09:37,700	00:09:38,720	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:09:38,720	00:09:45,900	| openwifi-2022 |	The fixed time domain delay for different frequencies actually means different phase shifts． 
EDL	00:09:45,900	00:09:46,760	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:09:46,760	00:09:55,400	| openwifi-2022 |	Think about the fixed delay versus different or nonfixed period of different subcarriers． 
EDL	00:09:55,400	00:09:57,280	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:09:57,280	00:10:10,860	| openwifi-2022 |	According to the beam forming principle‚ the different face shift will generate beams towards different directions‚ So energy is delivered the different directions by different sub carriers． 
EDL	00:10:10,860	00:10:11,890	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:10:11,890	00:10:23,270	| openwifi-2022 |	In this case‚ no matter where the station is‚ it will have more or less the same signal strength‚ except that different sub carriers are received in different power levels． 
EDL	00:10:23,270	00:10:24,320	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:10:24,320	00:10:25,720	| openwifi-2022 |	But it is okay． 
EDL	00:10:25,720	00:10:26,170	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:10:26,170	00:10:35,670	| openwifi-2022 |	The WiFi receiver is supposed to work in frequency selective situations and it is the nature of the multipass environment． 
EDL	00:10:35,670	00:10:36,890	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:10:36,890	00:10:49,370	| openwifi-2022 |	The four color subcarriers and beams are just an inaccurate example here in the figure‚ the accurate analysis need to consider the multi plus fading in the environment． 
EDL	00:10:49,370	00:10:51,090	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:10:51,090	00:10:57,490	| openwifi-2022 |	There are also lots of enhancements and optimizations in architectural and low level． 
EDL	00:10:57,490	00:11:04,990	| openwifi-2022 |	For instance‚ the receiver has improved a lot for better demodulation capability sensitivity． 
EDL	00:11:04,990	00:11:05,910	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:11:05,910	00:11:08,690	| openwifi-2022 |	Also‚ the clocking scheme has been improved． 
EDL	00:11:08,690	00:11:09,810	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:11:09,810	00:11:38,260	| openwifi-2022 |	This is the clocking scheme before the RF clock ends at the baseband 5‚ and the baseband has its own clock‚ which is generated in the clock unit unit inside the arm processor A 5 4 writing reading rate control is needed to avoid IQ sample overflow or underflow due to the slight clocking speed difference between RF and IPG base baseband． 
EDL	00:11:38,260	00:11:39,190	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:11:39,190	00:11:43,550	| openwifi-2022 |	They have totally‚ totally independent crystal． 
EDL	00:11:43,550	00:11:44,680	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:11:44,680	00:11:54,930	| openwifi-2022 |	No‚ the RF clock drives everything from RFA‚ DCD AC to the open FA base band‚ till the DMA to the arm． 
EDL	00:11:54,930	00:11:55,780	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:11:55,780	00:12:04,910	| openwifi-2022 |	This leads to a more simplified cross clock domain design in the baseband and lower the timing jitter． 
EDL	00:12:04,910	00:12:05,790	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:12:05,790	00:12:11,280	| openwifi-2022 |	The actual cross clock domain happens inside the unprocessor DMA controller． 
EDL	00:12:11,280	00:12:11,670	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:11,670	00:12:14,130	| openwifi-2022 |	So it's not our business anymore． 
EDL	00:12:14,130	00:12:15,490	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:15,490	00:12:24,580	| openwifi-2022 |	Other optimizations are for helping people generate the project use and use the open WiFi card in a more easy way．

EDL	00:12:45,460	00:12:46,100	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:12:46,100	00:12:59,820	| openwifi-2022 |	We also add test mode to the driver for easy experimental feature test and benchmarking by avoiding recompile the driver to switch between normal and experimental． 
EDL	00:12:59,820	00:13:01,990	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:13:01,990	00:13:13,430	| openwifi-2022 |	More importantly‚ after having all about features and optimizations‚ the whole design consumes less MP G resources than the previous release release． 
EDL	00:13:13,430	00:13:14,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:13:14,560	00:13:23,660	| openwifi-2022 |	Because we have put lots of effort into optimizing the design footprint to make sure it can fit into the entry level． 
EDL	00:13:23,660	00:13:34,460	| openwifi-2022 |	Zinc 7 or 20 IP GA‚ we really care about the entry level IPD board support because it is essential to help more users． 
EDL	00:13:34,460	00:13:35,820	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:13:35,820	00:13:42,620	| openwifi-2022 |	The name of the new release will be will seller‚ which is a beautiful place next to Leuven Belgium． 
EDL	00:13:42,620	00:13:43,330	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:13:43,330	00:14:13,820	| openwifi-2022 |	It is chosen by the main developer of the A M PDU feature mihail mahari from the vivado report for the entry level Z board‚ which has the zinc‚ some O 20 ipga‚ there are 10% reduction for the lookout table resource‚ 21% reduction for the flip flop‚ 6% reduction for the block Ram‚ and 26% reduction for the DSP blocks． 
EDL	00:14:13,820	00:14:14,470	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

EDL	00:14:24,180	00:14:28,310	| openwifi-2022 |	Now let's talk about the bug fixes in the past year． 
EDL	00:14:28,310	00:14:43,360	| openwifi-2022 |	There are bugs about the duration field contention window increment mechanism too fast‚ 5 TX start signal time stamp issue with the IQ sample capture‚ which is reported by our user． 
EDL	00:14:43,360	00:14:43,970	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:14:43,970	00:15:10,110	| openwifi-2022 |	The short training frame‚ power level issue‚ and of course‚ the hidden bug seen by the high packet density brought by the a m PTU The complication is mainly due to the asynchronous nature of the CPU interrupt and IPG operation and effort of maintaining the related buffers and queues． 
EDL	00:15:10,110	00:15:15,980	| openwifi-2022 |	Lots of corner cases there in asynchronous system running in real time． 
EDL	00:15:15,980	00:15:17,200	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:15:17,200	00:15:19,390	| openwifi-2022 |	Let's take a look at the duration field． 
EDL	00:15:19,390	00:15:20,010	| openwifi-2022 |	Field issue． 
EDL	00:15:20,010	00:15:20,820	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:15:20,820	00:15:37,360	| openwifi-2022 |	The duration field in the WiFi packet indicates how much time occupation left is expected for the ongoing transaction‚ so other knows can predict when the channel will be released by the current traffic． 
EDL	00:15:37,360	00:15:38,090	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:15:38,090	00:16:00,240	| openwifi-2022 |	The Linux kernel Mag 8 to 11 module‚ as shown in the Linux kernel source code on this slide‚ calculates the value for this field only for 11 A and G‚ starting from 11 n‚ it assumes hardware handle this‚ which means starting from WiFi． 
EDL	00:16:00,240	00:16:11,540	| openwifi-2022 |	Four more functionalities are pushed to the chip instead of doing it at the kernel level‚ as you can see in the function． 
EDL	00:16:11,540	00:16:12,430	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:16:12,430	00:16:15,780	| openwifi-2022 |	If it's wi fi for and above the function‚ return immediately． 
EDL	00:16:15,780	00:16:16,800	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:16:16,800	00:16:26,380	| openwifi-2022 |	That's why at the beginning we weren't aware of this and always see the 11 N packet transmitted by open WiFi has duration field value 0． 
EDL	00:16:26,380	00:16:27,390	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:16:27,390	00:16:31,680	| openwifi-2022 |	Now we have implemented the calculation in open WiFi correctly． 
EDL	00:16:31,680	00:16:33,840	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.2 secs ]
EDL	00:16:33,840	00:16:38,190	| openwifi-2022 |	Now‚ let's see some test results by a decent WiFi tester．

EDL	00:16:41,630	00:16:42,110	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:42,110	00:16:51,670	| openwifi-2022 |	It's probably the most advanced tester‚ which supports all WiFi standards and all subsix gigers frequencies． 
EDL	00:16:51,670	00:16:54,910	| openwifi-2022 |	Even those frequencies other than 2．4 and 5 gigers． 
EDL	00:16:54,910	00:16:56,330	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:16:56,330	00:17:05,330	| openwifi-2022 |	This is the basic test test set up on the left are the tester and open WiFi board‚ connected via Co X cable． 
EDL	00:17:05,330	00:17:09,000	| openwifi-2022 |	On the right are those are some screenshots． 
EDL	00:17:09,000	00:17:09,350	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:17:09,350	00:17:13,550	| openwifi-2022 |	The spectrum mask‚ EBM‚ time‚ time‚ domain‚ power‚ etcetera． 
EDL	00:17:13,550	00:17:14,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:17:14,560	00:17:23,330	| openwifi-2022 |	We have tested the open WiFi R sensitivity via the tester after our efforts of optimizing the baseband I PJ receiver． 
EDL	00:17:23,330	00:17:24,270	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:17:24,270	00:17:34,310	| openwifi-2022 |	The main conclusion is that the sensitivity is much better than the standard required‚ and similar to those typical commercial WiFi for chips． 
EDL	00:17:34,310	00:17:35,320	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:17:35,320	00:17:37,530	| openwifi-2022 |	EDM is also quite good． 
EDL	00:17:37,530	00:17:38,120	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:17:38,120	00:17:43,890	| openwifi-2022 |	It achieves -39 d B with a big spectrum mask margin． 
EDL	00:17:43,890	00:17:44,710	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:17:44,710	00:18:20,340	| openwifi-2022 |	It is as expected since 89 3 6 1 is a quite good and also quite expensive RF chip‚ and there is no external power amplifier in our test‚ which is‚ usually harmful for EDM‚ but we don't have PA if we sacrifice some spectrum mask margin further‚ the EDM can even achieve -41 d B‚ which is already capable of running 4K core modulation of WiFi 7． 
EDL	00:18:20,340	00:18:22,680	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:22,680	00:18:29,280	| openwifi-2022 |	Regarding the community‚ we are very happy to see new hardwares emerging in the past year．

EDL	00:18:37,380	00:18:40,110	| openwifi-2022 |	The phone factor is quite small． 
EDL	00:18:40,110	00:18:42,700	| openwifi-2022 |	I guess that's why it's called an ant． 
EDL	00:18:42,700	00:18:44,060	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:18:44,060	00:18:50,050	| openwifi-2022 |	The main tips on board are 89 3 6 1 and zinc 7 O 20．

EDL	00:18:54,410	00:18:59,710	| openwifi-2022 |	Instead‚ its support has been merged into Open A five mainline． 
EDL	00:18:59,710	00:19:00,080	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:19:00,080	00:19:05,700	| openwifi-2022 |	The price was only about $300 at the beginning on Aliexpress． 
EDL	00:19:05,700	00:19:06,350	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:19:06,350	00:19:11,650	| openwifi-2022 |	It's more expensive now due to the tip shortage during the past two years． 
EDL	00:19:11,650	00:19:13,750	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.1 secs ]
EDL	00:19:13,750	00:19:28,170	| openwifi-2022 |	The second one is an 89 3 6 1 SDR hat for zylinx Pine Q board‚ which is quite cheap and widely used for Python based machine learning with IPG acceleration． 
EDL	00:19:28,170	00:19:29,100	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

EDL	00:19:44,510	00:19:45,540	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:19:45,540	00:20:01,780	| openwifi-2022 |	The interesting thing about this design is that the HDM I and P mode IOP of the Pine Q board are converted to LVDS pairs to transfer the high speed IQ sample between the pan Q board and 89 3 6 1． 
EDL	00:20:01,780	00:20:03,630	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]

EDL	00:22:29,430	00:22:41,110	| openwifi-2022 |	We have built the WiFi 6 transmitter which is under testing and optimization with the help of the RN SC MW 270 tester． 
EDL	00:22:41,110	00:22:41,850	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:22:41,850	00:22:57,920	| openwifi-2022 |	WiFi 6 defines different types of physical layer PDU for the first time in the WiFi standard‚ we have implemented the single user Phi PDU‚ which can be used for single user uplink and down link． 
EDL	00:22:57,920	00:22:58,500	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:22:58,500	00:23:22,310	| openwifi-2022 |	The multi user 5 PDU‚ which is for AP to multiple stations simultaneously via OFDM a‚ the trigger based 5 PDU‚ which is for multiple stations to AP simultaneously via OFDM a‚ we will start to implement the receiver in 2022．

EDL	00:23:56,150	00:23:58,690	| openwifi-2022 |	That is all for the presentation． 
EDL	00:23:58,690	00:24:01,490	| openwifi-2022 |	But don't leave not finish yet． 
EDL	00:24:01,490	00:24:07,140	| openwifi-2022 |	I have made a short video to recap the exciting moment of open WiFi in the past year． 
EDL	00:24:07,140	00:24:07,670	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:24:58,590	00:24:59,190	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:24:59,190	00:25:01,480	| openwifi-2022 |	Hey‚ very yes． 
EDL	00:25:01,480	00:25:02,000	| openwifi-2022 |	And you will be． 
EDL	00:25:02,000	00:25:02,570	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:25:02,570	00:25:04,880	| openwifi-2022 |	Yes‚ but I think we are live． 
EDL	00:25:04,880	00:25:05,230	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:25:05,230	00:25:11,450	| openwifi-2022 |	Well‚ first of all‚ thank you very much for this‚ very interesting update on a very interesting project． 
EDL	00:25:11,450	00:25:15,430	| openwifi-2022 |	I'm all interested‚ I'm always looking a lot forward to your work． 
EDL	00:25:15,430	00:25:16,400	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:25:16,400	00:25:16,590	| openwifi-2022 |	Yes． 
EDL	00:25:16,590	00:25:17,050	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:25:17,050	00:25:20,520	| openwifi-2022 |	I mean yes‚ but I think we are live． 
EDL	00:25:20,520	00:25:22,280	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:25:22,280	00:25:24,310	| openwifi-2022 |	I have‚ I have some echoes． 
EDL	00:25:24,310	00:25:25,970	| openwifi-2022 |	Anybody else having those echoes? 
EDL	00:25:25,970	00:25:29,170	| openwifi-2022 |	I think now it's okay because I have two windows． 
EDL	00:25:29,170	00:25:30,250	| openwifi-2022 |	Okay‚ perfect． 
EDL	00:25:30,250	00:25:31,560	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:25:31,560	00:25:32,010	| openwifi-2022 |	Yeah． 
EDL	00:25:32,010	00:25:33,800	| openwifi-2022 |	Always looking forward to your talks． 
EDL	00:25:33,800	00:25:35,220	| openwifi-2022 |	Always very interesting． 
EDL	00:25:35,220	00:25:38,140	| openwifi-2022 |	So we have a couple of questions lined up here． 
EDL	00:25:38,140	00:25:40,520	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]
EDL	00:25:40,520	00:25:42,330	| openwifi-2022 |	First one is by Andre． 
EDL	00:25:42,330	00:25:42,930	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:25:42,930	00:25:49,620	| openwifi-2022 |	He's asking‚ how does the performance and functionality of open WiFi compared to regular commercial ship sets? 
EDL	00:25:49,620	00:25:51,070	| openwifi-2022 |	Now‚ I guess you will answer it． 
EDL	00:25:51,070	00:25:52,040	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:25:52,040	00:25:53,470	| openwifi-2022 |	Quite a bit of that already in your talk． 
EDL	00:25:53,470	00:25:57,530	| openwifi-2022 |	Or maybe you can elaborate a little bit more for the art performance． 
EDL	00:25:57,530	00:26:02,000	| openwifi-2022 |	I think‚ is similar‚ but we don't have PA‚ so the TX power is low． 
EDL	00:26:02,000	00:26:07,200	| openwifi-2022 |	Regarding the throughput‚ I think we are also similar in the release． 
EDL	00:26:07,200	00:26:07,760	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:26:07,760	00:26:09,070	| openwifi-2022 |	We will release soon． 
EDL	00:26:09,070	00:26:09,580	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:26:09,580	00:26:24,580	| openwifi-2022 |	I think the physical layer could achieve‚ around 70 mega BPS if you run a perf‚ considering all the overhead‚ you can have around 50 BPS more or less similar to the commercial WiFi for a single attendance chip‚ I think． 
EDL	00:26:24,580	00:26:25,800	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:26:25,800	00:26:27,540	| openwifi-2022 |	Okay‚ that sounds really good． 
EDL	00:26:27,540	00:26:27,880	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:26:27,880	00:26:33,870	| openwifi-2022 |	And I guess that also answers Johannes question‚ who was asking which speeds are supported so far? 
EDL	00:26:33,870	00:26:35,420	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:26:35,420	00:26:39,600	| openwifi-2022 |	We have another question lined up‚ by Jimin． 
EDL	00:26:39,600	00:26:40,950	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:26:40,950	00:26:49,750	| openwifi-2022 |	He's asking why basic WiFi chips looks so small‚ but all WiFi requires roughly eightyfive elements． 
EDL	00:26:49,750	00:27:02,830	| openwifi-2022 |	Actually‚ eightyfive loot‚ includes lots of‚ not necessary and logic like those‚ 89 3 6 1 interfacing‚ etcetera for the core open life and logic． 
EDL	00:27:02,830	00:27:08,040	| openwifi-2022 |	If you look at the vivado report it consume‚ I think less than 20K route． 
EDL	00:27:08,040	00:27:09,250	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:27:09,250	00:27:12,950	| openwifi-2022 |	Okay‚ so it's‚ it's actually a logo number． 
EDL	00:27:12,950	00:27:15,329	| openwifi-2022 |	And then we have one from Daniel． 
EDL	00:27:15,329	00:27:21,409	| openwifi-2022 |	Daniel is asking‚ do you use the P L 3‚ 3‚ 0 DMA in the zoom? 
EDL	00:27:21,409	00:27:26,080	| openwifi-2022 |	Or do you have ADMA implemented‚ and FGA fabric? 
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:35,320	| openwifi-2022 |	Well‚ I don't think we are using PR social 0 DMA‚ because I'm using the A X I streaming DMA in the IPG site． 
EDL	00:27:35,320	00:27:42,680	| openwifi-2022 |	We have the a x I streaming DMA block‚ and it connects to the zinc arm processor HP port． 
EDL	00:27:42,680	00:27:48,420	| openwifi-2022 |	There are HP 0 to HP 3‚ and some of them also connect to the ACP port． 
EDL	00:27:48,420	00:27:48,730	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:27:48,730	00:27:55,210	| openwifi-2022 |	I think PLL‚ p L 3 3 is 0 DMA is another DMA module‚ not the one we are using． 
EDL	00:27:55,210	00:27:56,400	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:27:56,400	00:27:58,010	| openwifi-2022 |	Okay‚ okay‚ I see． 
EDL	00:27:58,010	00:28:01,510	| openwifi-2022 |	I guess that's the well then with another remark． 
EDL	00:28:01,510	00:28:01,970	| openwifi-2022 |	Okay‚ yeah． 
EDL	00:28:01,970	00:28:02,670	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:28:02,670	00:28:04,180	| openwifi-2022 |	But I guess that's the questions． 
EDL	00:28:04,180	00:28:06,610	| openwifi-2022 |	Your honor's question was basically answered． 
EDL	00:28:06,610	00:28:08,840	| openwifi-2022 |	Which speeds are supported so far? 
EDL	00:28:08,840	00:28:09,560	| openwifi-2022 |	Let me check． 
EDL	00:28:09,560	00:28:10,000	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:28:10,000	00:28:12,062	| openwifi-2022 |	Any other questions? 
EDL	00:28:12,062	00:28:13,240	| openwifi-2022 |	Yes‚ for the WiFi． 
EDL	00:28:13,240	00:28:17,660	| openwifi-2022 |	4 speed indeed is close to the WiFi 14． 
EDL	00:28:17,660	00:28:23,670	| openwifi-2022 |	The 5‚ 5‚ 6 we are doing‚ we target‚ still the 20 micros as well． 
EDL	00:28:23,670	00:28:24,050	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:28:24,050	00:28:31,710	| openwifi-2022 |	So the peak speed won't be increase a lot because the bandwidth is there． 
EDL	00:28:31,710	00:28:33,680	| openwifi-2022 |	Yeah‚ I see． 
EDL	00:28:33,680	00:28:34,220	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:28:34,220	00:28:35,780	| openwifi-2022 |	And we have to like 30 seconds． 
EDL	00:28:35,780	00:28:36,270	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:28:36,270	00:28:37,960	| openwifi-2022 |	Left me 1 question for my set． 
EDL	00:28:37,960	00:28:41,540	| openwifi-2022 |	Like‚ how big is the team that's currently working on the project? 
EDL	00:28:41,540	00:28:42,580	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:28:42,580	00:28:51,940	| openwifi-2022 |	I think‚ in the past few years‚ we have‚ like 2‚ PhD‚ and‚ 2 postdoc now． 
EDL	00:28:51,940	00:28:54,210	| openwifi-2022 |	One of the P H D's already postdoc． 
EDL	00:28:54,210	00:28:54,520	| openwifi-2022 |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:28:54,520	00:28:59,710	| openwifi-2022 |	And now last year we have new a fresh PhD joined from Netherlands‚ actually 20． \N
