Because those who love you and care for you the most like your mother like your best friend

Don't give you the worst damn advice in the world you need to get a job

00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
The Florida sleeping bag

19
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
From NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

20
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
Stories behind the movements

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
I'm Gyros and white Cathy Hughes refuses to take no for an answer

22
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,600
And how that helped build one of the biggest African American-owned businesses in the country

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
So you might have never heard of Kathy

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
He is but

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
The company she started

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Radio one

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,056
It's the largest African-American owned broadcaster in the US and it now has

28
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
More than 50 radio stations and media Outlets

29
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
All across the US

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Kathy didn't

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
Exactly stumble into this line of work

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Screw up in 1950s

33
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Omaha Nebraska

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
And even when she was little

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
She couldn't stop talking about

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
What it was

37
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
But you wanted to do

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
I wanted to be the first African-American

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
To have a syndicated radio show

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
I've had that desire since

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
I was 8 9 10 years ago out

42
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
But that's what you want to do for me

43
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Childhood

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
It's so interesting

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
When I go back to the high school that I graduated from that every single solitary weeks in a note home to me

46
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
My mother saying she talks

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Too much

48
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
Like I'm practicing for my future career

49
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
Eye of

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
Grew up in a household where there were six

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
One back

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,704
And I did my radio show every morning

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
In the mirror with a tooth

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
And no matter how many blows my brothers and sister with get old Heap upon my head when I finally opened the bathroom

55
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
So they can get ready for school

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
I never

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Came out of that bathroom every morning

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Until I finish my radio show

59
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
Everyone thought at that time there was something wrong with me

60
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
I mean

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
There are no black people in radio particular no black women cuz it getting remember we're isolated in the middle of the United

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
The 1950s

63
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
If it 1950s exactly

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
And so they thought I had a pipe dream by nuns at my school described it as delusions

65
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Is a branch of

66
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Tell my mother that she perhaps you see

67
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
Counseling for me because I had this vision

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,832
I being on the radio and people hearing me from coast to coast

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,000
OKC have a stream and a lot of people think you're crazy but you

70
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
I want to pursue it

71
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
But then

72
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
As a teenager I guess your

73
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
18 to get

74
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
First sexually

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Experience

76
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,312
I'm in the doctor's office he tells me I'm pregnant as I couldn't be able to have sex one time

77
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
He's a hate to surprise you Kathy but it only takes one time.

78
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
Arranged it that way

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Arrested Development

80
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,880
No question about it I went into a sadist a State of shock but I realized

81
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
That I had

82
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,768
Mission I had an obligation to someone greater than myself

83
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
And I was determined that he wouldn't be a black suit

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Statistic

85
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,191
I was determined that he and I would not grow up in the public housing

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
That I have grown up in

87
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
I was determined

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,615
That he was going to have an opportunity which meant that I had to be very serious

89
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Purpose

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Why was still

91
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Young teenager a child myself

92
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Stop

93
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Ricardo Medina

94
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
Support yourself and your inner child

95
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,135
Yes but I'm third-generation entrepreneur

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,975
So I grew up having to work in a family business

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
110 years ago my grandfather started

98
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
School after being the first black

99
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
To get his EDD

100
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Comparable to a PhD

101
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
And my father was the first

102
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
African American to graduate from Creighton University with a degree in accounting

103
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
He opened up a tax service

104
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
And I was in charge of the Prentice Hall Ledger switch were all the tax regulations that changed every week

105
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
I

106
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Typing

107
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
10 years old I was taking shorthand by the time I was

108
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
12 and having to be proficient at it because

109
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
I was a staff person

110
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:26,655
My family kept imposing upon me to come to work okay so even though you know pregnant

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
16 a mother at 17

112
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
Sounds like how did you do it financially while I was already working

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
And I was very blessed

114
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,503
I know I say this too young but there's this easy to be a teenage mama when the baby still in

115
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Infancy

116
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Because

117
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
All they do is

118
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,695
Go to the bathroom and sleep that's all they doing cry little in between

119
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
And so I could take him to class with me

120
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
You when you enrolled you enroll the University

121
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,935

I have put him right he be riding a carriage on the floor

123
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
Add but it became a problem once he got up and start walking

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
An Institute you work at like the College radio

And you're wasting your talents in Omaha Nebraska

140
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
You need to be

141
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Where you can really have an opportunity

142
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Need to do

He asked me if I was interested in coming to Washington DC

149
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,423
So you move halfway across the country we enter by guess for 5 year old son

00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
Piece of Pharoah Sanders

187
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
And I think he held the note the entire time

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Okay

189
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
18 minute jazz song all you heard was this one

190
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
And I was like

191
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
I can't sell this

192
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
So your job was to find advertisers to f

193
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Ties on house but also to help

194
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Define

195
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
How the radio

196
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Relationship Bistro

197
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Annexation

198
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Oh my God

199
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Was it sounds like the kind of place

200
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Because it was a mess

201
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
A young person like you an opportunity in your 20s

202
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
Could take it over absolutely and the fact

203
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
That then Dean

204
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
With a big fan

205
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
Of my work ethic

206
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,247
He said you need to see can you teach these kids how to work like you folks or Nebraska work

207
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
I always believed that rising at 4 a.m.

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
And then getting dressed and leaving

209
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,743
By 5:15 5:30 for the office that was just my lifestyle

210
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
And Stingley

211
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
I've have been reared

212
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,167
To believe the witch again so critical for entrepreneurs

213
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
That you don't stop

214
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Based on what the clock says

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
You stopped based on the accomplishment of the task

216
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Yuan

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,943
Cheer in DC with your son by the way how are you doing all this is a single mom

218
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
We have

219
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,647
Often times people ask me do I get if I had anything to do over what would it be it would be to have more children

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,743
It was easy with him remember I told you start off taking him to college with me

221
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
So

222
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:15,167
He had his first little tuxedo before he was at a great school cuz he was my date I took him everywhere

223
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
I had a sleeping bag in my office

224
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
We have dinner together we would do his homework

225
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,383
Then I put him in the sleeping bag until it was time for me to take him home

226
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
I didn't know anybody I didn't have anyone to leave him with

227
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
So what were you able to do at the station

228
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,391
At that time you get there as early 70s the first thing was to create straw

229
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,767
Guy realize that the first thing they needed was an understanding of the eye

230
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Epidural

231
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
Community giving them

232
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
So how are you

233
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
The Quiet Storm

234
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
Tell me about The Quiet Storm

235
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
It was simply

236
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Recognition of the fact

237
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
The city had a sizable population of single

238
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Unattached

239
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Human beings who

240
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,503
Still wanted to feel good about a Friday night or Saturday night

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
All they were missing

242
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
Was the entertainment so I structured

243
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
My format called

244
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Quiet Storm

245
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
Sticks and stones

246
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
The basically was a 5-hour

247
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Presentation

248
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
Of entertaining you at home by yourself and Company

249
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
With the selection of music

250
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
Before Hip Hop

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,943
If you were going to be successful in the world of black music you had to tell a story with your music

252
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
And so all I did was weave

253
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Ghost stories to get

254
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Oh

255
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,927
Sam Cooke

256
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Carmen McRae the ballot

257
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
Basically

258
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
How did that show takeoff how did it become popular

259
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Well I hit the right target demo

260
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
And I guess we should mention that

261
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
The audience's pradamalia

262
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
African American

263
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Interesting Lee enough my first

264
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Audience with

265
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
Escape predominantly gay

266
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
I put the first openly gay are personality on the are at Howard and almost lost the top of my head because

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
So the gay community

268
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Absolutely love the quiet storm and then the black community migrated

269
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
Yes absolutely it was strictly Word of Mouth

270
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
And it went from like number 36 in the ratings to like top 5 and it when I left we were

271
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,711
Number three so you have this incredibly successful career at WHUR

272
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
You know I

273
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,575
I think I can do this on my own like no no not at all not at all

274
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,671
There was a group of investors called the Washington broadcaster

275
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
And it's 32 board members and investors they included some of the most distinguished

276
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,119
Black and white Washingtonian

277
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
They had tried for

278
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Well over a decade

279
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
To get a

280
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
Signal that was dark back on the air

281
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,175
They've gone through millions of dollars and they could not get the signal

282
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
Only are they wanted to revive a radio station yes they wanted this dark signal they had lka Tabitha hits

283
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
They spent their money in all the wrong places

284
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
They approached me

285
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
And offered me

286
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,119
Double quit Howard University was paying me but more importantly they offered me the opportunity to

287
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
A station from the ground up

288
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
So these owners they bought the station and they hired you to run it

289
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Yes

290
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
They hired me to get it on the air

291
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Then they hired me to run it

292
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,223
Then they ran out of money today so they told me to shop a package for finance

293
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
And I said to them that that's not the responsibility of a general manager

294
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Did I will do that

295
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
If you give me an equity position

296
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
In your company

297
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
And one of the members said to me

298
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
If you think that your

299
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,191
Smart enough to own a radio station you should do it for yourself we're not giving you any equity in our station

300
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
He was being facetious but I took it verbatim seriously

301
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
I was like oh my God

302
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
He was right I should do it for myself. I'm not exaggerate

303
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
It was like a charge went through me oh my goodness this person who's a multi-millionaire who I

304
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,279
I've been mired who's now probably in their 70s is saying to me here I'm Juno

305
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Billy 30

306
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,119
That I'm smart enough to do this with them

307
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:34,239
And he's challenging me if I think I should own part of their station do it for myself

308
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,823
Thank you Lord I hear you I hear you I literally

309
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103

310
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
Put all my papers in my case

311
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175

312
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Not walking

Skip down the hallway from the board meeting

314
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
I mean like what just happened

315
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
Did she have a nervous breakdown or something

316
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
I knew what I was destined to do

317
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,167
Cathy Hughes founder of radio one coming up the story of how she did end up buying a first radio station

318
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567

Gyros

349
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,423
It's late 1970s and caffe uses

350
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Just walked away from her

351
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Her job managing a radio station

352
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
How to restart a router

353
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
And she's looking for stations that are

And she happens to find one up a black AM station in Washington DC

00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
It has fallen on Hard Times

357
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
So

358
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
She decides to buy it

359
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855

The station

364
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
You have to come up with a million dollars how much money did you have in your bank account

365

So that's what you had. That's what I had was anyone else

367
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
There was everyone at that time Senator Edward Brooke had just left the United States ended the first time since

368
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
Encino reconstruction date

369
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
He was a bitter Muhammad Ali was bidding for and everybody wanted to do our nation's where you were busy

370
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
The station again

373
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
So how did you get it

374
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
I had

375
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
An angel

376
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
Dewey Hughes and I were married at that time and he at worked at the station

377
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
So when do we

378
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Went to the owner and said

379
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
My wife and I would like to buy the station

380
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735

382
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Where did you get them

383
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Did you get a bankson

384
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879

30/30 lending Institution

387
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
And all of them said no

388
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,095
We're not going to give you a million dollars and you should because none of them have them

389
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Exactly how you were

390
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
And all of them said no

391
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
We're not going to give you a million dollars

392
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,287
They asked me questions like that I plan to have any more children

393
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
They asked

394
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Me if

395
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Did not think that I was

396
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,711
It's too young to be doing just taking on that level of responsibility

397
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
They asked me questions

398
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,063
It had nothing to do more often than not

399
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
How did you go to

400
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
32 Banks

401
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927

407
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191

408
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Oh

00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,551
Puerto Rican and she probably guessed that it would be a male cuz she was for the

415
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
She said yes and I just kept by now

416
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
My

417
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Presentation

418
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Should have been taught

419
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Oncologist

420
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
Kathy was flawless I mean after 32 times are perfect. Okay

421
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679

00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Condensing

423
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
And she said something to me that I teach you all myself

424
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Deeper she said

425
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
Please don't sell pass

426
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Close

427
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
And I never forgot that cuz that was another one of those slap-in-the-face is I was like wow she's absolutely correct she said

428
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
I couldn't believe she is

429
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,671
What she said yes

430
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,023
I kept trying to convince

431
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,863
Can you get the money

432
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Can you buy this

433
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
The station

434
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Where was it

435
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
1680 Wisconsin Avenue part of Georgetown in the highest rent district of the sea

436
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
So that's why I moved into it

437
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:07,551
Wheatley sorry sir I lived in the radio station

438
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
I live there

439
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
You because I had to pay rent in Georgetown

440
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,511
And 1680 Wisconsin was then and still is a beautiful

441
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Valuable diagonally set on the corner piece of property made it real convenient to go to work in the morning at waughtown

442
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
So you moved in there with your son and husband

443
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
I know I moved in there with my

444
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Send by then my husband was like

445
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Enough

446
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
I don't want to do this as your marriage

447
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
Fell apart absolutely the station brokers

448
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
The debt

449
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Was just

450
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,623
Overwhelming for him kid never been an entrepreneur never having been in business before even

451
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
So it's just me and the kid

452
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
How many years did you guys

453
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Junior Summer

454
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Almost three

455
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
No

456
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,191
Number one that can remember the part of the story I told you that I was just in awe of Washington

457
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,591
See I'm in Georgetown I've been able to move back there yet okay during my struggling days

458
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
I had

459
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
A prime Corners you would see the president having dinner at one of the restaurants and you must have been under a lot of fun

460
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Ankle pressure right

461
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
So how did you deal with it

462
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
When you have overwhelming Financial

463
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Applications

464
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
The first natural

465
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Human impulse

466
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,048
Sister hides to recoil not return the call

467
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
What would I have been trained to do

468
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Is play offense

469
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Not defeat

470
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
So I would call

471
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
And I would say

472
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Play I know I owe you ten

473
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
All I have is

474
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Is $1,250

475
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
I'm sending it to you

476
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
The token of good faith

477
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,296
That I will repay you every cent that I owe you but right now this is

478
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Is all I have

479
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
And most of them

480
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Said that

481
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,744
They had never ever interacted with anyone who let them know upfront

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
That they could not make payment

483
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,704
I think that is the reason I've never been foreclosed on I've never had to file for bankruptcy and thank God

484
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,800
God I have never had a paycheck bounced I've never had a business check

485
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Nor personal check balance

486
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,152
Because I tried to stay ahead

487
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,504
Of the issue of not being able to pay the debt

488
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Are you at people

489
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Like we're depending on you

490
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
4 salary

491
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,208
I was running a 24-hour seven-day-a-week broadcasting for

492
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Facility with

493
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
14

494
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,792
Full and part-time employees

495
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
14 of us

496
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,472
And you were one of the people who went on the only thing I don't know how to do a spider up the transmitter who had to go on the air

497
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Because you didn't happen

498
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
And what did you do just opened up the mics

499
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Start talking

500
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Well it started off because

501
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
We did for they call

502
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Formats

503
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,528
And we found out that what was missing in Washington DC

504
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Was Newstalk

505
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
From a black perspective

506
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Put that research did not tell

507
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
As you well know here hippie

508
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
PRS the most expensive format that you can do

509
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,840
All right music is one person

510
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
Play the music read the news to every

511
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
It's a one-person

512
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Austin show

513
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Music

514
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,056
When you talk about news

515
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
And our talk and information

516
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Research is critical

517
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
There's always some

518
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
When your listening audio

519
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
And who knows more than you and just

520
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
Waiting in the cut

521
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
Oh no that's not good

522
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
Correct okay

523
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
You can't do it by yourself in this

524
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Text format how are you able to

525
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
To run the station

526
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Administer the state

527
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Deal with the

528
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Stress of all that debt

529
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
And raise a kid and

530
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704

Do all of that

00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Because it was exciting

534
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
But that's

535
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
When you said the stress

536
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
So the debt it wasn't

537
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760

You will make more money off me and Mike

547
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032

Anyone now this is what I'm also telling them that I can't make my payment this month

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
I've got all this

551
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,368
Sell anything I'm working 18 20 hours a day

552
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Then it's too hard

553
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
You can't do it

554
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
But when you know

555
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
The day is going to arrive

556
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
When you're going to have enough money to pay everyone

557
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
That's what you have to

558
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
See in your mind's eye that's what you have to believe

559
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
Yeah I knew it I could feel it

560
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
And that's when I was in the sleeping bag cooking on a hot plate and washing up in the public bathroom in the radio

561
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
Rio station at 1680 Wisconsin

562
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
I don't it I knew it

563
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
I just knew I had to hold on

564
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
And when

565
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
You're starting off in business

566
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
Have to be so very cure

567
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
About who

568
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
You discuss your hard times

569
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Because those who love you and care for

570
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
Are you the most like your mother

571
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,984
Like your best friend don't give you the worst damn advice in the world

572
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
You need to get a job

573
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
You shouldn't be sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag

574
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
What type of environment is that for a child

575
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Kathy was

576
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
The station

577
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Profitable

578
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Quickly

579
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
7 years

580
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
So what was it that made you

581
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
You guys profitable how did you get

582
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Keep sweeping the

583
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Floor ever

584
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Date

585
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
To the best of your

586
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
TM 1 day

587
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
The world is going to

588
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Say nobody Sleeps

589
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
The floor better than her

590
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
So it is that when you started

591
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
To to expand

592
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
Yes I realize that

593
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
I could not

594
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
Survive we just a little thousand watt 8

595
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
Did I had to grow I either had to grow or I have to go

596
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
In Richmond

597
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Yes because

598
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
Our specialty is where turnaround artist

599
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,352
What they all have in common

600
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Station Garden

601
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
We took the stress properties and turn them around

602
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Because we could afford them

603
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
Did you get the money to buy them

604
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,360
Again if your lenders know that their money is good with you they give you more

605
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
All right

606
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Lenders don't invest

607
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
And ideas everybody's got ideas

608
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
The invest in you

609
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
People loan money to the person not to the

610
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
The Disney hot to the idea

611
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
They have to feel good about you

612
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
How many stations

613
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Did you eventually

614
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Bye

615
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Fake that we were up to think 35

616
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
So

617
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
What

618
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Was the

619
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Point where you sad

620
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Let's go public

621
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:56,384
Let's make this and that you've 38.5 I did my son went to Wharton and got his MBA

622
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
And walking across the

623
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
The campus

624
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Of UPenn

625
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
My son says to me

626
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Do you still believe that we have to

627
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Negro Largo

628
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
List of course I believe we got a girl Grace

629
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
He said we have to go potty

630
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Because we've got a

631
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Add

632
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
With the deregulation

633
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,168
11% of all radio stations in the United States of America are owned by one company

634
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,592
It's kind of hard to compete with your over here with two or three I mean they would come into a market they have five

635
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
5 Powerhouse radio stations with one format

636
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
Eliminated all the competition

637
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,016
So we knew we would that we had to grow into

638
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
We had to get much larger

639
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,904
So you had the answer yes we had to go public we had no choice

640
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,768
A lot of people to list it they didn't think that they would be a wise decision

641
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,376
For us I tried to discourage us we had a couple fall starts

642
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
But

643
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
It was the best thing that could have happened ad

644
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
The other thing that we have done

645
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
In our company as we stay in our Lane

646
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
We're not trying to open a restaurant

647
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
You're not trying to go into concert promotion we stay

648
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
In

649
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,576
The Telecommunications Indus

650
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,976
Soup at the height of a radio one how many how many stations did you guys actually have

651
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
75 stations which was the height when we bought

652
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
A package of stations from Clear Channel

653
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:27,008
75 that had never been done and urban broadcasting before were you able to retain a significant

654
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Share of the ownership

655
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Yes

656
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,944
Not just own but also the voting

657
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
Which owl has again been a blessing

658
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,576
The same syndicated Communications

659
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,928
37 years ago who sit down and showed me how to write my first business

660
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
They're still in business

661
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
With me

662
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
You haven't really talked about

663
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,584
Is is discrimination because

664
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
You must have

665
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
A lot of it

666
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,448
Not only is woman but

667
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Is an African American woman

668
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,104
Yes one of the the issues that has always face

669
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Entrepreneurs

670
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Is

671
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
The

672
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,040
Lack of available

673
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Capital

674
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
Them to go into business

675
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
Start to maintain their business

676
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
I remember

677
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
It was a bank

678
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
NDC rigs

679
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
And I had a big contract

680
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
But the payment

681
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Who's coming in

682
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
And

683
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
It was so interesting because a black Banker

684
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,312
Of that bank said to me you would loan her $15,000

685
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Where to buy a car

686
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
But you won't loan her $10,000 to make her payroll

687
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
And yet she has

688
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,784
The contracts showing that the money will be coming in

689
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,904
So often has been easier for entrepreneur to buy

690
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
A new flashy car and it's been

691
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
For them to meet payroll which is a tragedy of us not having as many lending institutions in our

692
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
BTS we need and want

693
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
It looks like I still

694
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
Which is

695
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
You faced all these challenges

696
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
And you kept

697
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,640
Going

698
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
What was it that kept you going

699
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
A belief in God

700
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
Because when you really believe in God

701
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
You can believe in yourself

702
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
As I said

703
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Becky I quit my job

704
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
Not knowing where the next

705
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,584
Piece of money was going to come from where the next check was going to come from I knew that I would be sitting here today talking to

706
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,680
I believed it because I believe in the power

707
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
The Creator

708
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
And

709
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
I used to never ever

710
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Give a speech or accept an award writing first

711
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Thank God

712
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
And I still do but back then when I first started

713
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,112
They said to me that nobody's interested in all that religious I said that's not religion

714
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,696
That spirituality there's a big difference in my book

715
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
Between being loyal and understanding yourself in relationship to Creation

716
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
I have one last question

717
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
This energy this

718
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Glow the

719
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Destroy this

720
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Passionate

721
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Intensity that you

722
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
And in this unshakable

723
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Belief

724
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
It will work out

725
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Is it something that

726
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
You have

727
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
That is

728
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,832
Specific to you or do you think it's something

729
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Definitely an acquired skill

730
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
If you

731
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
Allow yourself

732
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,608
To be bogged down and lose your enthusiasm

733
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,168
Then you're dead in the water

734
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,752
But if you remain optimistic

735
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
Cheerful and committed

736
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
To your goal

737
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
There's nothing that can stop you
