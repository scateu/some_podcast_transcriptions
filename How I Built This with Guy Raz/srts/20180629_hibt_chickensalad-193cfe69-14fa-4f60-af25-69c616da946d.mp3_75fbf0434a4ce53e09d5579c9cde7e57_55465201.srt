Aunt the show

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
We hit the ground running on what we called our Southeastern fundraising

19
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
And packed up coolers full of chicken salad to hand out to opossum

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Investors and we pitched to anyone that would listen every single

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
Meeting that we had we heard you want us to invest this much money for a

22
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Minority share of a business that does not have a single franchise open

23
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:29,088

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
How I built this

26
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

27
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Stories behind the movements

28
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:53,408
I was stay at home mom went from selling homemade chicken salad

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
The building where the fastest-growing restaurant chains in America

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
How's it

31
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Chicken salad

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Check

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
Okay so chicken salad

34
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
Never really had strong thoughts on it

35
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Either way

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Totally solid lunchtime option

37
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,912
But if you live in most parts of the Southern United States

38
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
Then you know that much more than

39
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
Just a salad option

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,944
It's like a lobster roll in Maine where it might seem like it's the same thing everywhere

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Nuances

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Delicate differences

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,368
Fuel passionate debate over which Lobster Shack is the best Lobster Shack

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,208
What kind of bait Southerners have over chicken salad

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
These are the kinds of debate Stacy Brown would have with her friends

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
She happened to make really great

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Chicken salad

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,264
Chicken Salad Chick is one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in America

49
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
It was a struggle just to make ends meet.

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Will get there

51
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
What you need to know for now is that Stacy grew up in Rome Georgia

52
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,624
Ended up at Auburn University in Auburn Alabama where she eventually settled with her first husband

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
He worked

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
Full-time

55
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Lost AC stayed home to raise the kids

56
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
But always knew I was going to start a business

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Always

58
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
But

59
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Also knew that

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
You can't do everything at once

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
And it was my time

62
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
To be

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
A full-time mother

64
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
And

65
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
It happened that

66
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
The Perfect Storm for when

67
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
I would start that business

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Came in the shape of a divorce

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
And at that time

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Carson my oldest was sick

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
Jack

72
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
What's 3 + Lydia

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Was to

74
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Wow

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
And you've got to figure this out

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Yes to no

77
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Okay I'll have these three children

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
I've got to make ends meet I have to

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Support them

80
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
In a divorce is a disaster

81
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,152
It's a financial disaster it's an emotional disaster

82
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
But when you know you have

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Small children to take care of

84
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
The instinct to take care of them first

85
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Lets you push through that b

86
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Because you know

87
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
You have to take care of these kids

88
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
So all that other emotional stuff really

89
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
It's pushed to the back until you can

90
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Get through this survival

91
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Because

92
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
There's really no time to sit down and cry

93
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Kcur

94
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Trying to figure out what

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
To do and what

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
What did you start to think

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
So

98
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
When I was in school dinner time

99
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
In my homework

100
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Really sacred time

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
My mother cooked every meal

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
And the four of us

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
Sat around the dinner table every night

104
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
And

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
Remember that my father

106
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Started conversation

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
That

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Revolved around what

109
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Problems

110
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
Did you come across today

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
And

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Our dinner table conversations were about

113
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Solutions and how could we solve everyday problems

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Just started

115
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
I think ahead before dinner time

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
What am I going to present tonight

117
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
To Dad yes

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
And that really was

119
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Started

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
My entrepreneurial spirit that

121
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Question process of

122
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
What problems can I solve

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,375
When the divorce happened and I was in this situation and all of a sudden

124
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
What

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Do I have to offer the world

126
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
What am I an expert on

127
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,615
What have I perfected over these last years as a stay-at-home mom pit people would value

128
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Well I knew that I was a good cook

129
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
And I happened to be obsessed

130
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
With chicken salad

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Obsessed with chicken salad absceso by abscess what I mean by that is first Falls of

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
Obsessed with eating at not making it

133
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
So every restaurant

134
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
That I

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Frequented if they had

136
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,727
The chicken salad on the menu which everybody should note that anybody that serves lunch

137
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
There is chicken salad on the menu which should have told somebody something

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
And I was so fascinated by how different it all was and who was going to have

139
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
The best recipe and I was always in search of

140
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
The best recipe because as a southern woman if you found a great chicken salad do you want to share that information

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,327
With your friends and you won't be able to tell people where to go get the gold because it is a southern staple

142
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
So it was just

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
A silly little Quest

144
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Do you know that just

145
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
If it was on a menu then

146
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
I ordered it

147
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
I had

148
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
My hometown favorite I had a favorite in

149
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,247
Dalton Georgia Columbus Georgia Auburn Alabama where I attended school all the towns that I lived in

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,855
So I knew that I could cook and I felt like I was a connoisseur

151
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
A chicken salad

152
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
So you thought

153
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
How to make chicken salad

154
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
If I could come up with a really good recipe

155
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
I could just make it from home

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,031
And I could sell it door-to-door then I could be with the kids just like I've always been

157
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
And maybe it's going to be enough to make ends meet

158
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,711
What was your basic chicken salad recipe at the time

159
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Well when it started

160
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
I

161
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
Didn't have a recipe you not eating a lot I didn't have a ride

162
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
So I thought well

163
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
I loved

164
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
The depth of flavor

165
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
From my hometown

166
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
I love the texture

167
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
From my Auburn

168
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
I love

169
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Date moisture content

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
From my Dalton paper if I could take

171
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,567
What I love about all of these different recipes and put it into make mine

172
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Maybe this is going to be the

173
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Perfect recipe so

174
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
I start

175
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Doing that it's just like a science

176
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
Experiment and oh my gosh I went through

177
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Cooking

178
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Whole chickens on the bone I cooked

179
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Chicken breast on the bone

180
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
I cook boneless breast I cook tenderloin

181
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
All different

182
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,047
Types of chicken would yield different amounts which

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Effects

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Everything

185
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,703
Side effects the recipe it affects the food cost all of it where you like roasting chickens and then

186
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
Mixing it up with mayonnaise and celery and

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Epsom salt and spices in

188
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
That was basically it

189
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
So I boiled chicken

190
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Whole chicken

191
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
Well I started with holes

192
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Chickens I moved

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Breast on the bone at

194
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
Skinless breasts and I ended up with tenderloins

195
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
And I found the

196
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
All white meat tenderloins

197
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
Yield the most consistent

198
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Product

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
And when you're doing things by weight

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
You need the most

201
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Consistent end result

202
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
That when you said what's in your chicken salad

203
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
So I had

204
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Just this one recipe right

205
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
Well as I am

206
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Making this recipe

207
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
I thought you

208
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Elizabeth down the street

209
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,295
We had a conversation about chicken salad and she loves fruit

210
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
And nuts

211
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
In hers

212
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
I'm going to make one for her

213
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Now

214
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Julia cross

215
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Straight she loves spicy

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
I'm going to make one

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
And then if I'm going to have one with fruits and nuts a lot of people are allergic

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
A nuts

219
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
So

220
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Just fruit

221
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
It's all of a sudden

222
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
I had different flavors

223
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
And

224
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
I started

225
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Making recipes and I would

226
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Package up little Tupperware containers

227
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Of what I thought was a good recipe

228
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
And I would

229
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Take these little Tupperware containers

230
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Two people that I did business with in town

231
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
That you do business with

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
For what so

233
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Hair Style

234
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
And in grocery stores

235
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
So anybody that I came across

236
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
You know that I would normally say

237
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
So I said would you please

238
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Sample this and tell me what you think

239
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
And they would say

240
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
To dry

241
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Too soupy

242
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Too salty

243
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Little Bland

244
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
An answer I received this

245
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Feedback

246
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Go back to the kitchen

247
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Can't wait till we can't wait

248
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
And then one day

249
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
I handed

250
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
This

251
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Recipe to somebody

252
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
I watched their reaction

253
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
Something I had not seen yet

254
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
And they close their eyes

255
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,615
And their head went back and they may just the strangest noise it was just old

256
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Wow

257
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
It said that was a real reaction when that was

258
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Impressive

259
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,391
So I took that recipe and continue to sample that recipe on neighbors and Friends

260
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
Anybody I came across and said tell me what you think of this

261
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Until

262
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
I had a wide range of people that I have sampled this one recipe but they all had the same

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
So that told me that

264
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
This was the recipe

265
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
Citricide dresses of the time you

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
You separated from your husband

267
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
The time

268
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
You got

269
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
The recipe down ready to sell

270
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Roughly how long is that

271
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
A few months

272
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Say it was probably a few months

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
And why you were experimenting

274
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Making chicken salad like

275
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,303
Was anybody any friends or what people cared about you

276
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Cheapest price I hate you may want to just get a

277
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
Can't just get a day job at a really good at

278
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
This is not a sustainable

279
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,895
Way to make a living selling chicken salad door-to-door liked it anybody say that two or four people just

280
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Quiet

281
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Yes now my parents

282
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
They

283
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Did not help back with that

284
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Except

285
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
This is

286
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Silly

287
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
You have got to go get a Dependable job

288
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
And support these kids

289
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
And I said please just

290
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Just hang on

291
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Let me give this

292
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Scribe

293
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Now I had friends that told me later

294
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Did they were saying that they did not tell me to my face

295
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,567
They did say all good

296
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah good luck sounds good that you sent that from them

297
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
No

298
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
I was so determined

299
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
I was

300
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Blind as a bat I was just going to make this way

301
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
See you are determined you don't Ruby Lee

302
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Hair people think you're kind of

303
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
They're honestly there there probably were people

304
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Call telling me that I was

305
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Is crazy in a very soft

306
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Southern way

307
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Is it soft

308
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Southern way like

309
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
A little bit

310
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Polite but a little bit passive aggressive

311
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Absolute

312
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Absol it's an art

313
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
It is an art form

314
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Imagine you

315
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Making chicken stock

316
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
First of all you three kids

317
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
Two little kids did they demand a lot of attention

318
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,023
And you were trying to make chicken salad and sell it and so what are you doing this like at night like

319
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
What are you doing

320
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
So I would be with the kids

321
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
During the day and when I would put them to bed

322
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Start cooking

323
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
And then we would get up in the morning

324
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
And I would

325
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,407
Start to panic because I had all this fresh product that I needed to sell

326
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Quickly

327
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
And put kids in the car

328
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
And we would go knocking on doors they would sit in the car

329
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,159
And I would go knocking on a door with a basket and

330
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,767
Ask them if they would like to buy some chicken salad how much were you selling liquor

331
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
What's it like a quart of chicken

332
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
A pint is a pound again how much were you selling it for

333
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
It was $8

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
And

335
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
I really thought that I was

336
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,871
An aggressive salesperson and that I was ingenious and when I look back I think

337
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,711
They were thinking of here comes that poor pitiful woman

338
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,551
Here she comes pedaling that chicken salad lock the door and shut the blinds

339
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
But they've bought it

340
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
And then they play standing orders

341
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
And the word group

342
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
And

343
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
I needed

344
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
A name because I knew I was going to sell it door-to-door

345
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
And I thought the key to my sick

346
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
That

347
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
It's going to be

348
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Car magnet

349
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
I thought the only way people are going to find out what I do for my

350
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Home

351
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Is to put a car magnet on my car

352
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
And as I drive around town

353
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
And I sit at red lights

354
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
People will be able to see what I do

355
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
So chicken salad

356
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Has to be in the night

357
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
And I'm the chick

358
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
It's going to bring it to you

359
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,607
Chicken Salad Chick is catchy so.

360
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Became the name of the business

361
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
And

362
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
At this point

363
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
I reach out to

364
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Kevin Brown

365
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Who had been

366
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
A family friend for

367
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
10 years

368
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
And

369
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
He was a computer software salesman

370
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
I knew

371
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
He

372
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Was very business

373
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
And I didn't really know what I was doing

374
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
I come up with a good recipe

375
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
I had a name but I needed help

376
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Understanding

377
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Really the ins-and-outs

378
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
Of running an effective business from home

379
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
So I reached out to Kevin

380
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
The place come help me I don't know what I'm doing

381
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
And he agreed

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
To come and consult

383
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
With mate

384
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
So

385
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Tell me about my name

386
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,991
Had him try the recipe he was over the moon about the rest

387
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
And

388
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
Kevin said you know if you're going to have different flavors

389
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
You really need to differentiate them somehow

390
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
Like I don't know give them like

391
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Girly names are some

392
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
And not only am I going to name them after

393
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Chick

394
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
I'm going to name them after

395
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Real

396
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,639
Chicks chicks that have influenced who I am today

397
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,991
Best friend since kindergarten college roommate mother

398
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Mother-in-law

399
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
Aunts friends Neighbors

400
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
They all eventually

401
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Had named sex in days

402
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Chicken salad came to life

403
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
So I was delivering

404
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Fancy Nancy fruity Fran

405
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Classic Carol

406
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
And Jazzy Julie

407
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
You're my flavor

408
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,287
What's delivering these around the neighborhood and I thought you know

409
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
The Gateway

410
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
2 communities

411
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Are hair stylist

412
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Anteater

413
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
If you can get a good product

414
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,599
In the mouth of hair stylist and teachers you will be connected to every family in town

415
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
So I went and put

416
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
A large bowl of classic Carol

417
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
And my children

418
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,607
School in the Teachers Lounge giant bowl of chicken salad

419
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Yes

420
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,471
I'll put business cards out I put crackers around this giant Bowl

421
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
And the phone started ringing off the hook

422
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Because everybody was like this

423
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Perfect I can go home and make dinner

424
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,455
Or lunches for my kids is going to be ready made

425
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Fresh chicken salad in the fridge made from scratch made from scratch and that turns into me cooking

426
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Longer hours

427
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
And I find myself

428
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Crying a little bit

429
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
It's starting to be overwhelming

430
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
And

431
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
As fate would have it the next phone call that came

432
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Came from the health department

433
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
How do they find out about you

434
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Well

435
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
I don't really know it was an anonymous caller

436
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
That called out

437
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Apartment and said this person is doing what

438
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
They said this woman is

439
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Cooking chicken salad out of her

440
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Which was

441
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Illegal

442
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
Is it for like food safety reasons

443
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Yes because you have to

444
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
Conduct business out of a kitchen that is inspected by the health

445
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Department

446
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
Right okay

447
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
So you got this call from from

448
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Like an inspector at the

449
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Alta from where you freaked out are you scared

450
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Well

451
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
It was a little depressed

452
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
Because I worked my tail off it seem to be working

453
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
People were ordering this chicken salad do you know

454
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
And all of a sudden

455
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm shutdown

456
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
I'm back to square one

457
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
I'm back to now

458
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,439
I've got to leave the kids and go get a nine-to-five because

459
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743

Yeah

461
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
So it was a dark time it was a dark day that

462
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Wow this was working

463
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
This was really working and it's all over

464
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519

465
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Not so much

466
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,895
That they knew I had been shut down cuz I had to tell people no

467
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
And they would call anyway and they are go

468
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

508
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,935
It's 2007 and Stacy's homemade chicken salad operation has been shut down

509
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
By the health department

510
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
But

511
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Just when she's about to give up

512
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Her business partner Kevin

513
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Comes up with an idea

514
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,199
He said you know you've gotten a lot of attention here in this neighborhood

515
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
I bet

516
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
That we could find you a little

517
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Take out spot

518
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
Something small

519
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
And

520
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
Give this a go and it would pay your bills

521
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
And I'll help you do it

522
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,352
And we decided to partner on paper

523
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,472
That was 51% he was 49 and we were going to open up a little

524
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Make-out spot

525
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:36,384
So there was a drive-thru window in this tiny little 800 square foot Shack

526
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
And

527
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,272
That was going to be it that was going to be Chicken Salad Chick how much was your wreck by the way

528
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
$800

529
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Pretty good price for

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
A business

531
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
And what was Kevin's motivation

532
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
To help you and get a full-time job like

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Do you really believe in the business

534
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Yes

535
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
He was inspired by the

536
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
This crazy reaction that was happening

537
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
In town

538
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Eminence

539
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
Exciting that start a business and

540
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,640
We have been family friends and whenever all the families got together

541
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,992
He and I always had a meeting of the minds of what was going to be the next

542
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
Greatest big thing

543
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
So we already had that connection

544
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
And then all of a sudden

545
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
We're going to start this little chicken salad business together

546
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
But now

547
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
This is

548
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
2007

549
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Right before

550
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
The huge recession

551
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
He's still selling software

552
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
And his job

553
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
It's eliminate

554
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
So he was pretty devastated with that

555
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Because

556
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
He had

557
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
An ex-wife and a daughter too

558
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Support

559
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,248
And he said you know not to worry

560
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
I'm going to really put all my effort

561
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Into helping you start this chicken salad business

562
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
And then when I get

563
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Open Office

564
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
It's fate I don't go get a real

565
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Job

566
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
And I have never let him forget that he said that

567
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
So so

568
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Just to paint the picture for me

569
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,752
You guys are working out of an 800 square-foot

570
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Book stand

571
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
With a drive-thru window

572
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
And did you install an

573
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,920
A commercial oven in there and like her a commercial sinking

574
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,712
Did you have to do all that stuff

575
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
So

576
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
We are

577
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Building the

578
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
This little thing from

579
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Scratch and

580
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Neither one of us

581
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Had any money

582
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,720
We could not hire a contractor to come build this

583
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
So we were going to Home Depot

584
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,192
And we were buying flooring we're laying the flooring we work buying paint we're painting the walls we were

585
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Hanging drywall

586
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
And thankfully I had wonderful parents and they would come from Rome Georgia and they would stay at my little place

587
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
And keep the kids

588
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
While Kevin and I built

589
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
This restaurant

590
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Wow

591
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,344
And this was going to be such a tiny little thing we didn't need commercial equipment

592
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,416
We just need a residential cuz this is not that big a deal

593
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,256
So everything was absolutely Homespun

594
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
And we opened finally

595
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
January 7th of 2008

596
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
So

597
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Recession is

598
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,216
Here is there yeah

599
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
And end

600
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Did you submit this point your corporated you create an LLC like you've done all that stuff you are a bonus

601
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Fideism

602
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
That you're legit

603
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
We're legit gear legit okay and then

604
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
County Health Inspectors are like it by eulogy

605
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
Can you open the doors

606
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
And on day one or you're

607
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,976
Former customers like a whining at the door waiting for chicken salad

608
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
So on day one

609
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
We

610
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,096
Cooked 40 lb of chicken salad

611
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
So you could have it as

612
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,472
A sandwich or you could buy a pound

613
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
You would choose your flavors of chicken salad

614
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
We would complement those with our maid

615
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
From scratch side salads

616
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
And then every lunch got the cookie

617
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Because

618
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
My view is that you don't really know you're full

619
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
Until you have one little bites of sweet

620
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
It says you're done and happy

621
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
So that first day you make

622
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
40 lb of chicken salad

623
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
An

624
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
And we open up the doors

625
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
An

626
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,656
Our family and friends came to support us and

627
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:16,032
Please well-wishers and flowers and balloons and plants are being delivered and

628
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,872
The walls are lined with all family and friends

629
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
And you can say that in the middle of the room there's not a

630
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
Single custom

631
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
No one shows up

632
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
There's just such a

633
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Deep

634
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Since this

635
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Heaviness

636
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
Is the elephant in the room

637
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
It just feel everyone's thoughts like

638
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
I mean how could she think this

639
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
What kind of work

640
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
It was so heavy and I thought what if I

641
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Done what have I done after

642
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Just put every

643
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
Penny to my name

644
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Into a business that

645
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Only

646
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,944
Serves lunch only serves take out and only sells chicken salad we could not have made it anymore

647
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
More difficult for you to be a gif

648
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,624
Cute head to fit into a very slim demographic to Be Our Guest

649
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Yep

650
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
So I'm thinking

651
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Stupid ass stupid

652
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Doneness

653
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,048
And first guest walked in the door

654
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,632

00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240

656
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032

Like that kind of know it was like

661
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
It was just way too small.

662
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
And the people were

663
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
South everybody was hugging her and thank you

664
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
You just shut up

665
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,096
Chicken salad I know and guess what

666
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
She's never shown back LOL

667
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Okay listening

668
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Waze

669
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Start that woman

670
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Did she shows up for the chicken

671
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
For chicken salad

672
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
So she is

673
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,920
Stunned by all the attention that she's getting she orders

674
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
Her lunch

675
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
She leaves

676
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
And then

677
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
People

678
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Start coming

679
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
And

680
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
A line forms

681
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
The lion guard

682
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Out the door

683
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
Down the sidewalk and we sell out into our

684
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,120
What what do you attribute that to mean you you opened up and there were no customers and

685
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
In a couple hours

686
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
It just took lunch time

687
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:26,592
10 in the morning

688
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Nobody wants chicken salad until noon

689
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
I just wanted people to be there

690
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
And

691
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
So

692
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,832
Kevin and I looked at each other and said well let's make some more

693
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
So we made 80 lb

694
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
The second day

695
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
And here

696
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,792
Was a surreal moment of realization

697
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Every one of those faces

698
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
We saw

699
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
On the first day

700
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
Is there on the 2nd

701
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
And they brought a friend

702
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
And we sold out

703
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
In 2 hours again

704
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
With twice the amount

705
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
And very quickly

706
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:06,016
It turned into what always said look like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange

707
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,112
In that 800 square foot in an 800 square foot

708
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Building

709
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
And

710
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
I'm thinking okay people are liking this

711
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:20,608
And they wanted everything we had to cook we could not make it fast enough we were running out of food but we were

712
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Making a dime

713
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,752
My assumption would be the case for crushing at you making money hand-over-fist

714
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
And we weren't and you are at will why well we didn't know how much money we were spending on inven

715
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Cantore we didn't know how to project

716
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,112
How much we needed to cook and our way Suite have waste of one item and then not enough of others

717
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Yeah

718
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
So I remember very clearly this day

719
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
We were running out of food and

720
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,096
Kevin and I had busted out the backdoor we run down the production kitchen 2

721
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,936
Grab more broccoli salad more grape salad we're out we come back down

722
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,824
To the service kitchen and he turns around and barricades himself against the door he said Stacy

723
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Stop

724
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
So what

725
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
He said this isn't working

726
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
We are not making any

727
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Money

728
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,904
And nobody is going to work this hard we're working our tails off and we're not making any money it's not

729
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Can work

730
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Get out

731
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
That's the way I've got to feed these people

732
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
So he knew then

733
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
She's not going to give up

734
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
So he went in there

735
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
And he worked on our process

736
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,056
And every day he would say

737
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Today we did this in six steps

738
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
Tomorrow we're going to do it in five

739
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Today we didn't in 5 tomorrow we're going to do it in four

740
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,064
And he turned us into a well-oiled machine

741
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,648
And it didn't take him very long and the grand scheme of things

742
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
So

743
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
We open January 7th of 2008

744
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
And we were

745
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Making

746
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Money

747
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
About 2009

748
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
And we opened

749
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
Two more restaurants

750
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
In Auburn

751
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
To pull the chaos

752
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Away from that one little Shack

753
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
But I have to imagine you were working like

754
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Crazy

755
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Like morning till night

756
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
So

757
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
You know

758
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
The reason that I wanted to do this

759
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Was so that the children would have that stability

760
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
So it would not make sense

761
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
If I said

762
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
To heck with all that I'm going

763
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,256
To go open a restaurant that's going to have me working all hours

764
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
The night

765
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
And when we open the restaurant

766
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,632
We said we are going to run a restaurant

767
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,192
The restaurant is not going to run us

768
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
So

769
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
The first thing we did that was smart

770
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
We primarily serve lunch

771
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,872
So we're not going to be there at 4 in the morning

772
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,968
Preparing breakfast and we're not going to be there at 2 in the morning closing down a bar

773
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,016
And then Kevin made the commitment

774
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,392
He said I'll take the later hours you take the earlier hours so that you can be home with the kids

775
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
For the majority of the day

776
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
And he held true to that commitment

777
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
And

778
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
We got married

779
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
Bury the lede

780
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
During the time you were the two of you were both single parents and you were working together so

781
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
I guess you start to fall in love

782
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
I mean

783
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Crisis bonding

784
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,992
We were in the fire

785
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,064
Yeah I guess you'd say we fell in love over chicken salad

786
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
In that first year you open up a

787
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
Business and you also

788
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
To each other

789
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
So in November of 2008 weekly

790
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Lowe's

791
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
The restaurant

792
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,192
We hung a sign on the door that said the chicken the rooster have gone to get married

793
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,080
And we flew to Jamaica we got married we stay there for 4 days we came back

794
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
To the fire of the restaurants in a blended family

795
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Sonographer

796
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,248
Kevin had a daughter Olivia

797
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,832
About 2 at that time and so we

798
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
Came back to

799
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,464
Free restaurants for children in the cat and the dog ran away

800
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
It was

801
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
My mother says it was a festive life

802
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
So

803
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
This business really started

804
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
Take off in Auburn right I mean

805
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Who are the who is coming I mean

806
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
College students was it

807
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,920
Little lunchtime crowd was it just doesn't everybody

808
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
Well episode

809
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,528
When we open the restaurant I had no clue

810
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,624
But naming it Chicken Salad Chick might determine

811
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
And I found out

812
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Once we open the restaurant

813
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
We became known as a chicky place

814
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,608
Yeah this was a place for women

815
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,192
I had no clue you know good foods good food right

816
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
So

817
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Then it was

818
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,128
Really lots of fun to observe male behavior in the chicken salad

819
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
So I had

820
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
You know these names of the chicken salad

821
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Sassy Scotty Fancy Nancy

822
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Fruity friend nutty Nana

823
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
All these names

824
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
Well the men

825
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Would come up to the

826
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
The counter and they would say

827
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
Give me the one with the fruits in the nut

828
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
And

829
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
I would say

830
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
What's Fancy Nancy

831
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
Is that the one that you would like Fancy Nancy

832
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
I said Don't make me say it

833
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Names can't you just number them

834
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
Habit they came in the door

835
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,176
Oh they came in the door so the first time they would come in

836
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
They come in with a girlfriend or a wife

837
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
And I'd elbow her and I'd say you order

838
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Because they didn't want to have

839
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Say the name

840
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
And once they ate it

841
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,816
The girlfriends and wives didn't have to come anymore they were coming for the food and they didn't care about saying the names they were all

842
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
In

843
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,448
So as you as you grew in as you had more and more

844
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
Customers coming through the door how did you finance

845
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
The second third

846
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Locations

847
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Through

848
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,968
The revenue of the first restaurant so the cash flow is able to help you

849
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
Open up those other locations

850
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Yes

851
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
And because

852
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
Believe me every Bank

853
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Laugh

854
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
Us out

855
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,232
Of those office you could not get a loan

856
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Tattoo open up now

857
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
Incredibly successful business in the bank said no way

858
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,728
Right they said you had to be in business for over 2 years

859
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
And I woulda

860
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
Steady income

861
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
To show

862
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,128
That this was a sustainable business

863
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
The banks

864
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
Would not give you any money

865
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,296
What does around a time where you started

866
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
I think about the idea of

867
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
Possibly franchising

868
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
So we were in this college town

869
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,232
And all of the students

870
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:44,608
Would come and they would bring their families to Chicken Salad Chick because it was a unique

871
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Place to Auburn

872
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,216
In the moms and dads of these students would say

873
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
This is

874
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
Awesome what do I have to do to get one of these in Little Rock Arkansas

875
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,432
What do I have to do to get one of these in Virginia

876
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Because we're running these three restaurants in

877
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,064
You know still in somewhat survival mode

878
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
We would say are you kidding

879
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,928
Like we can barely breathe franchise are you kidding

880
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:14,816
I mean I would joke around and say I'm put on an apron and help out in the kitchen because

881
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
I can't do anymore

882
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
But yeah we got tired of saying no

883
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
So

884
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
We said

885
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Let's just put your name on a list

886
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
If we ever get to it

887
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Will give you a call

888
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
And that list

889
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,248
Quickly grew to over a hundred people that wanted franchises

890
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
And

891
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
About mm

892
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
10

893
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
We were starting

894
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,184
Even write the documents to franchise tag

895
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,792
And then found ourselves in the position of

896
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,840
How are we going to rent

897
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Franchise com

898
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
We have three restaurants

899
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
That it's taking every bit of every

900
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
Effort that we

901
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Can muster

902
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
We need to partner

903
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
How did you

904
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Start to look for partner

905
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Well we wanted to partner

906
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,224
With people that had franchising experience

907
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Because we had none

908
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
And

909
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
A couple

910
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Husband and wife

911
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Was introduced to us

912
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Think this was

913
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
2012

914
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,488
And the husband had franchising it

915
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
Experience with major brands

916
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
So that was very encouraging

917
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
But there was a little

918
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
Issue with how they wanted to partner

919
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
They wanted

920
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,752
51% of the biz

921
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
And

922
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Kevin was

923
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
You're completely no

924
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
That's not going to happen

925
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
But

926
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
You know I rationalized it out by saying

927
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
We really didn't have

928
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,320
Plans of getting into the franchising business

929
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:45,696
And so our exit strategy is probably going to be to sell out to these people anyway one day

930
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
So what's the harm

931
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
And

932
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
Selling them 51%

933
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,912
Because they're going to take the lead on the franchising part of this anyway

934
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
And they were also probably going to

935
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Put some passion

936
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Oh yes

937
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Which

938
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,664
For us was exciting that we had worked this hard and all of a sudden we were going to have a little realization of

939
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Mia some success

940
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
So you took the deal

941
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
So we took the deal

942
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
And and

943
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
If you had sound effects that will go womp womp womp

944
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
Very quickly

945
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
It went downhill

946
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,608
They had a very different vision for the brand

947
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Where it was going to go

948
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
And

949
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,800
We were not comfortable with that it was not a good working relationship and we knew

950
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
That if they took the lead on that it was going to be the end of the brand

951
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
So what did you do

952
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:38,944
So

953
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
We had a meeting with mr. and mrs. so-and-so

954
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
And Kevin said

955
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
We need to dissolve

956
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,160
This partnership because it's clearly not working

957
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
The husband said

958
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Well kid

959
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
This is not a partnership

960
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
We own 51% of this business

961
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
And we can fire you

962
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,008
With just cause and take your shares anytime we want

963
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Yeah wow

964
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
Felt like the blood left my body

965
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
We

966
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Have been

967
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
Purchased by shark

968
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Can't believe

969
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
How could we have been this wrong

970
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,440
And thankfully at that time we had a board of directors

971
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
And we took this

972
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
Situations are board of directors

973
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
And they said mr. and mrs. sew and sew you need to give the Browns the chance to buy you out because they're the founders of the biz

974
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
And I said okay will do that

975
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
And they said here's our price

976
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,896
Which was three times the amount that they had purchased four months earlier

977
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Wow

978
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,296
And not only is this is our price but you have 30 days to get it to us

979
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
How much were they asking for

980
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
OnPoint

981
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
3

982
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
Wow 1.3 million

983
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,304
And keep in mind that at this point we didn't have a single franchise

984
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Open

985
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:06,240
Kevin and I are determined to make this work we hit the ground running on what we called was ourselves

986
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
Eastern fundraising tour

987
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
He put together his best

988
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
Presentation

989
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
Best pitch and I

990
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Packed up

991
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
Coolers full of chicken salad to hand out

992
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Possible investors

993
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,368
And we pitched to anyone that would listen

994
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,720
Anybody that had a friend that could be interested please come and listen to us

995
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,536
So we traveled and held meetings in

996
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Hotel conference rooms

997
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
Chamber of Commerce conference room

998
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,704
And every single meeting that we had

999
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
We heard

1000
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
You want us to invest

1001
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
This much

1002
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Money

1003
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,384
For a minority share of a business

1004
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
That does not have a single franchise open

1005
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
Thanks but no thanks

1006
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Laughed out of the room

1007
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,416
And this whole time that 30-day clock

1008
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Ticking away

1009
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
So

1010
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
With two days

1011
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Left

1012
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
On that 30-day clock

1013
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Kevin

1014
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
Is telling me we're sitting on the back porch

1015
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
He said you have

1016
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Got

1017
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Ticket

1018
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
Grip on reality

1019
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
This Is the End

1020
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
It was a good thing

1021
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
But it

1022
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
Is the end

1023
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
And

1024
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
We'll figure out something else

1025
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
And

1026
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,064
I was not willing to face that

1027
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
But we go to work

1028
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,136
Into our

1029
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Tension-filled office

1030
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
And a lady in the office

1031
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
Slid me

1032
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
A piece of paper

1033
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
And on that piece of paper

1034
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Were the names

1035
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
5 people

1036
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
And she said

1037
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
Call these people

1038
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
It's all I've got

1039
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
But give him a try

1040
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Who was that lady in the office

1041
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,360
Her name was Claudia Isaac and she

1042
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
Was our receptionist

1043
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
She said

1044
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Call these people

1045
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
It might help

1046
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Yes

1047
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
So

1048
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
I called those gentlemen

1049
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
And I begged

1050
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
I begged with no shame

1051
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,256
I said I know it sounds crazy but will you please just come listen to what we have to say

1052
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
And they agreed

1053
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,144
So we went to a conference room at the Chamber of Commerce in Auburn

1054
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Kevin gave them his

1055
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Best for our pitch

1056
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,824
And we took them to lunch at Chicken Salad Chick

1057
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
I packed them up full of course of chicken salad we put them in their cars and we said goodbye.

1058
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Charles Esten

1059
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,808
And that was going to be it

1060
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
And very quietly Kevin and I got in our car and we were driving back to the office knowing

1061
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
That it was over

1062
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
And Kevin's phone right

1063
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
And one of the gentleman

1064
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,984
In that meeting his name was

1065
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Erlin mcquarter

1066
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
He said can you to come back to the restaurant and we said Shirley whipped the car around

1067
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,551
We get back to the restaurant and we sit in the booth with this

1068
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
Very kind gentleman

1069
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
And he said

1070
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:09,535
I believe in the two of you and this is a good thing and I don't want to see it die

1071
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,143
And I will write you a check for every penny that you need well

1072
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
And

1073
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
I'm sure he thought I was having a stroke because I

1074
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
Absolutely

1075
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
Falling apart

1076
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
Ears are blowing

1077
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,527
And I'm stunned and Kevin is nodding and say

1078
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:35,135
Yes sir yes sir and he became the most

1079
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,183
Wonderful partner we ever could have asked

1080
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
And he was just

1081
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
I mean we'll see what was his professional was his background

1082
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
So his background was in construction

1083
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
He

1084
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Open

1085
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Instructed over

1086
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
300 Lowes

1087
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
Are you friendly with Leisure course

1088
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Yes

1089
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
So he

1090
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,151
Was a self-made man from the ground up

1091
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
And he understood

1092
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
That people had helped him in his career

1093
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
And he

1094
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
Appreciated that

1095
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
And he was willing

1096
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
To help us out

1097
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
So you you're back on your feet

1098
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,535
And at that point where you able to start

1099
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Selling franchises

1100
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,655
Yes so eorlund infused Capital into the business

1101
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Wave

1102
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Got into

1103
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,031
A great office building and we were able to

1104
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Higher

1105
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,407
The most wonderful passionate people to build the infrastructure that could see

1106
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Port opening

1107
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
Franchise

1108
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Effectively

1109
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Where was the first location

1110
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
So the very first franchise location was Montgomery

1111
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
And it has to do there

1112
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
It's wonderful

1113
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
They came at us like we were not prepared

1114
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,327
So the expansion started in Alabama and and

1115
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Where did you go

1116
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
The first location outside of

1117
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
Well the Third location was

1118
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
Was Columbus Georgia

1119
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
See you guys were

1120
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
I mean

1121
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
This is like

1122
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
A timer

1123
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
But you're starting to you you can start to see where this is heading

1124
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Yes

1125
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Rattle exciting

1126
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,783
Oh my gosh it was amazing and

1127
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
As we're building our infrastructure

1128
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
We are selling an opening more restaurants

1129
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Everybody

1130
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
Is happy

1131
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
Amazing and the story

1132
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,535
I wish

1133
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
No

1134
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Sitting in there

1135
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
So after we had a number of owners

1136
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
And we were on fire and

1137
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
The line 2

1138
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Cell

1139
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Restaurants was long

1140
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Kevin said we need to have

1141
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Conference

1142
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:39,551
We are legit we need to get all these owners together and celebrate make a plan for future grow

1143
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
Growth we need to get together

1144
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
So we held our first conference in Destin Florida

1145
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
While we're there

1146
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
In between putting on these

1147
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
Segments annie's classes

1148
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Kevin what's this

1149
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
Just not like him at all was having to lay down

1150
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
In

1151
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Pain

1152
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
And we thought he had a

1153
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Gallbladder problems

1154
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,359
And he said I'm just going to go to the doctor when we get home but was get through this

1155
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Conference

1156
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,175
We got through the conference

1157
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Goes to the doctor

1158
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
And

1159
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,343
And I'm so at age 38

1160
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Kevin was diagnosed

1161
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
With

1162
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Stage 4

1163
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Colon cancer

1164
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,279
And it had metastasized to his liver

1165
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
So it was the beginning of another fight

1166
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
I can't even imagine

1167
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
I just can't

1168
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Imagine

1169
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
I would like

1170
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Well

1171
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
He was the toughest

1172
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Man

1173
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
I have ever

1174
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Known in my life

1175
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
And

1176
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
It took him

1177
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
About three days

1178
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,047
Anna Todd that he got the news

1179
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
To process

1180
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,887
What was happening to him

1181
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
And then

1182
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,983
She came out with a new purpose

1183
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
And a new mission

1184
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
His purpose

1185
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Came

1186
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
Helping other people

1187
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,687
With this disease that could not fight for themselves

1188
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Because he was a

1189
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Fighter

1190
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
And that was the beginning

1191
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Of the Chicken Salad Chick Foundation

1192
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,159
And this became a new part of our mission

1193
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
And

1194
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
He went that full force

1195
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,583
I had stage 4 colon cancer

1196
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
He was taking

1197
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Chemotherapy

1198
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
But he didn't miss a day of work

1199
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
If he

1200
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
Could stand up

1201
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
He was at work

1202
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
And he fought and fought

1203
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
For this foundation and he said

1204
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
We've got to make

1205
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
An impact on Research

1206
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Fast

1207
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,343
And he came up with the idea to hold

1208
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Concert

1209
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
In

1210
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,207
Jordan Hare Stadium which is our football stadium

1211
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Auburn's campus

1212
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,047
And he said not only

1213
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
Are we going to hold

1214
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,607
Concert in jordan-hare

1215
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
But we are going to have

1216
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
Kenny Chesney

1217
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
Headliner

1218
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
Like one of the biggest

1219
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
That's right

1220
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Biggest

1221
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,799
Name in country music

1222
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
The only person that could

1223
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,151
Fill that Stadium would be Kenny Chesney

1224
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
And

1225
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
He got Kenny Chesney

1226
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
And he got

1227
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
Unfortunately

1228
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
He passed away

1229
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
Before

1230
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
The concert

1231
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,279
He passed away November 21st

1232
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,559
2015

1233
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
And the concert was in April

1234
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
But on that night

1235
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,007
In April 50000 people

1236
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Walked

1237
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
Jordan Hare Stadium

1238
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,175
For Kenny Chesney concert and it was

1239
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
The most amazing

1240
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Unbelievable night you could imagine

1241
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Amazing

1242
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
He was just

1243
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
Such a tremendous

1244
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
Person and a tremendous presence

1245
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
And

1246
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,047
So now I have the honor

1247
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
Picking up the fight in his name

1248
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
In team

1249
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
At the Legacy

1250
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
The foundation

1251
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
But the legacy of this business that's growing

1252
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,479
Really really growing that you guys

1253
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
How many locations does Chicken Salad Chick

1254
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Now have

1255
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
So we have 85 locations now

1256
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
What

1257
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
What's

1258
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:33,023
The trajectory does it is there a certain point where it stops growing or

1259
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Are you just

1260
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Planning on

1261
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
Opening an opening opening opening

1262
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,447
Well our goal is to be America's favorite

1263
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,983
Place for chicken salad

1264
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,799
So that gives us a lot of ground

1265
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
To cover

1266
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
So we can't wait

1267
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Say

1268
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
How the rest

1269
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Set the country

1270

00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
To bring the taste of

1273
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
The South

1274
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
To the entire country

1275
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,135
I think that in 2017

1276
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,487
Your company was like number 37 out of 5000 of

1277
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
Fastest

1278
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:08,863
Growing businesses the country quarantine core Fortuner for Bruno's magazines

1279
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,703
Unbelievable insane

1280
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
Crazy annie's chicken salad

1281
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
And

1282
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
Always tickled me when I would hear

1283
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
People

1284
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
Investor type

1285
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
People say

1286
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,247
Really just chicken salad you think that's going to work

1287
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,295
The whole restaurant off of

1288
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
I'm just chicken salad

1289
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
Sounds like really

1290
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Pizza

1291
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,695
You think a restaurant work off of Just Pizza

1292
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
Herberger's you think that would work

1293
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
What's the difference

1294
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
Do you have a sense of how many

1295
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,679
People are employed by Chicken Salad Chick today

1296
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
300

1297
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
I'm thinking us like 1200

1298
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
1500

1299
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
And

1300
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:54,687
I've seen reports of Revenue figures in 2016

1301
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Glad you guys

1302
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,783
Are to talk about your Revenue at all is that private

1303
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,855
We do I mean it's out there and

1304
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,671
Whenever I speak at the University to classes

1305
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
Are students you know her so

1306
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,071
Attached to their phones and it's hard to get their heads up off of their phone or sometimes but

1307
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,887
It's so funny the one thing that raises heads

1308
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,935
Of the students are when

1309
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
I say remember

1310
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,519
About what you're capable of

1311
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
When your

1312
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
Passion is involved

1313
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
Because this was a business

1314
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,783
It only needed to make $500 a month to make ends meet is now making 75 million dollars a year

1315
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Wow

1316
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
How much of this

1317
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
Of the success of this

1318
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
Enterprise do you think has to us

1319
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,559
The skills that you and Kevin brought to it and how much of it

1320
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:50,495
I don't know it's been too hard for me to say it was luck

1321
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
We work really hard

1322
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
That would that's hard to accept

1323
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
Lucketts I don't think

1324
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
It's luck

1325
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
I think we have

1326
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
Paid

1327
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
Our dues I think

1328
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
We were good Learners I think we also

1329
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,111
New

1330
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
That we weren't it

1331
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
I know what I'm good at

1332
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,255
And I know what I'm not so

1333
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Gradle

1334
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,351
In every part of the business deserves

1335
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
To have an expert in their field

1336
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
For it to all

1337
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Work

1338
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
100% on all cylinders

1339
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
So

1340
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,383
Kevin and I are very early had to understand what we were great at

1341
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
And what we were not great at

1342
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,271
You don't have to be a Rockette

1343
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Scientist

1344
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
You don't have to have millions of dollars

1345
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
You just

1346
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
Have to have

1347
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Fashion

1348
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,767
And drive in the will to get up and go

1349
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,583
And when life knocks you down

1350
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
You just keep getting up

1351
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,519
Stacy Brown founder of Chicken Salad Chick

1352
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,127
To this day Stacy has stuck by her motto that she runs the business

1353
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
The business

1354
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Doesn't run her

1355
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,759
So every Sunday all employees get the day off

1356
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
To do whatever it is

1357
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
They want to do

1358
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
I keep thinking about how you

1359
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Boil the chicken just

1360
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,999
Mind-blowing because I'd always

1361
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Roast

1362
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
An entire chicken and then

1363
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,911
Take all the meat out and then make some mayonnaise and

1364
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:28,287
Dijon mustard some green onion celery there you go young salt I got my chicken salad

1365
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
You blow my mind you just described another hole recipe

1366
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,943
Probably perfect for you but you haven't tried mine yet

1367
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:44,415
Please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things your building

1368
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,511
The first quick thanks to one of our sponsors TD Ameritrade

1369
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:53,119
People who set defined financial goals are more likely to achieve them

1370
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
And TD Ameritrade

1371
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
Compucraft the planets aligned

1372
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
Your specific objective

1373
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,311
Tell TD Ameritrade about your goals

1374
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,639
And then you can start building towards something beautiful together

1375
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,711
Schedule a complimentary goal planning session

1376
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271

1377
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
Podcast

1378
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1379
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,463
Time now for how you built that

1380
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
And today story starts with

1381
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Beer

1382
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
Which if you've ever brewed at yourself you know it takes Just 4 ingredients

1383
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:34,079
You got your hops which everyone knows about and you've got your yeast which is going to where the magic happens but Wednesday

1384
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
Chris Rock Brothers on beer in college actually Grand play malted barley

1385
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,831
You take water and you mix it in with the grand kind of like making a batch of oatmeal

1386
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
And oatmeal is the key word here

1387
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:54,047
Because when Dan and his friends were making their own beer they noticed all the leftover piles of wet bar

1388
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,119
Smells kind of like breakfast

1389
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:02,495
It smells like Brad is very fragrant but none of the Brewing books told us

1390
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
What to do

1391
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
What does grin

1392
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,919
Put it in a dumpster all this is happening around 2009-2010

1393
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,991
A few years later Dan was in the Bay Area

1394
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
Where crack

1395
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
Breweries

1396
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,951
We started to notice that a lot of those breweries just like him we're turning out huge mounds of

1397
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,743
Leftover spent grain

1398
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,119
It smells like food it looked like food and so it was really pretty low-hanging fruit

1399
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,215
To think okay well maybe we can make food products out of this

1400
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
Get a friend named Jordan who would work in the food business

1401
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,383
And totally cleaned up and called a bunch of small breweries in the Bay Area

1402
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,223
And he starts to drive around with these big plastic tubs to

1403
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,111
Pick up all of this used grain threw out my back a few times

1404
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
Yeah it's heavy anyway they take those heavy tubs barley to Jordan's parents house

1405
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,911
Ascend just experiment they took my mother-in-law's recipe for loose granola

1406
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,239
Oats and flax honey

1407
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,639
Cinnamon went back and forth with the recipe and eventually they decided to turn the granola

1408
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,967
Into snack bars low sugar high fiber

1409
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
With a great eating experiences not a much bar at can I eat like a rice crispy treat

1410
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:28,767
Snack bars on friends and as farmers markets in. So great

1411
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:33,631
The bars to be a bit dry and to be a bit Pokey weight

1412
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:40,031
Hokey Pokey is

1413
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:46,431
Stuck in people's teeth and one of the mouthfeel descriptors that we got pretty consistently was Ho Chi Sao 2

1414
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
Eliminate the pokenest Dan Jordan decided to grind the beer grain into more

1415
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
And then from there that really solve the texture issue so we did launch and I we have a great product that selling really well we going to

1416
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:05,631
Another one on the way back bars are now on sale and Regional chains in many parts of the US and

1417
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:12,031
They're not profitable but damn and Jordan have both quit their day jobs and they're paying themselves East

1418
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:18,431
Small salary and I'm not buying a house anytime soon unless I take a down payment and then you know nutrition bars

1419
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,831
Play nothing on it.

1420
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
First do not taste like beer but they do have be renamed like chocolate coffee Stout

1421
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
Honey cinnamon IPA

1422
