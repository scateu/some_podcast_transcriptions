Get your tickets and hope to see you in San Francisco

35
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
I'm not one of those entrepreneurs that that thought he

36
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
He was going to be super successful and I was just trying to survive and I'm very

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,616
Very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done

38
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,200
You know the shows

39
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Message Debbie.

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Running PR

41
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Is how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist stories behind the movement

42
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
A Steve Madden tote high-end shoe design and prices turn his name into a

43
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
3 billion dollar shoe rack

44
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
So when I was a kid if you want to wear brand names

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
And you couldn't afford the prices

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,936
Eudora Mervyn's or Marshalls or Ross and you look for things called

47
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
Irregular items

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,104
Maybe it was a pair of Guess jeans missing a zipper or an asprey shirt with one arm

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Slightly longer than the other

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,528
It was no big deal because you still got the brand and you got it at Marshall's prices

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
But then starting in the early 1990s

52
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
Brands like H&M and Zara started to go Global and it meant that all of a sudden

53
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,888
Many more people had access to high fashion designs but at a much lower price

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,776
This is the way that Steve Madden not only tapped into but in a lot of ways

55
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Pioneer

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Especially when I came to shoes

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
With Steve maddens

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,272
You could all of a sudden by a pair of black stilettos for 70 bucks

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
Viciously like a $900 pair of Manolo Blahnik

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
Or a $60 pair of Lego like heels that

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Borat knock off of

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Thousand dollar Balenciaga

63
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
This was the genius of Steve Madden

64
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,680
He managed to carve out a very sweet spot between Nine West

65
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Tan Christian Louboutin

66
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
This approach didn't come without consequences

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,152
The world of high fashion is an exclusive club and Steve Madden

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Is largely unwelcome

69
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Pedigree

70
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,904
Steve didn't Apprentice at one of the great fashion houses he didn't start out in Milan or Paris effect

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
Steve didn't even study design

72
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
And he's also kind of brash and the bit of a loud enough

73
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
In fact that he was willing to break the law to get ahead

74
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
Steve's been 2 and 1/2 years in prison for financial crimes

75
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
It's an experience that completely changed his life and we will get there but long before that

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,040
Secret weapon Long Island New York uses scrapy middle class

77
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Papyrus

78
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,232
I was sort of a leader type charismatic sort of always pretty similar to the way I am now.

79
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Small

80
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
A big mouth

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
And

82
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Blue ambitious and

83
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,007
A little obnoxious probably will get in trouble at school

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Yeah I always got

85
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
I had attention deficit disorder I didn't know what then yeah

86
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Nobody nobody yeah yeah that was the sixties and

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
So

88
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Didn't really talk about

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
But I couldn't sit still

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Yeah and you should say

91
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
I had shpilkes

92
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
So school is not your your Forte

93
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
No

94
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
The only difference is that I was

95
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Rosarita

96
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
So and I loved history

97
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,727
And I used to love to read about the Mughal

98
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
You know what that was I was obsessed with summary I was drawn to this thing about

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
Louie B Mayer and

100
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
Samuel Goldwyn and these great entrepreneurs that

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
I mean it's a very young man

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
It was like

103
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Drawn to it

104
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
DIY

105
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
I don't know why I mean you know I was I guess it was the

106
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
The intersection

107
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
I've art and commerce

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
Yeah it was very interesting to me

109
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
And still is

110
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
And those guys came from nothing

111
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
Yeah and they were artists but they were businessmen so is that kind of thing

112
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Yeah

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Your dad's in textile business voice

114
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Just address it was your dad

115
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
Entrepreneurial did he have that kind of

116
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,479
Mind yes my dad was but you know he grew up in the depression

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
And you know he was very limited

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Filled with fear

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,391
Because he had seen so much poverty

120
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
So his he sort capped is upside

121
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
He wasn't a great mistake but he was a smart man he was a businessman

122
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
But it never really made the big bucks

123
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Because he was very safe

124
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Which in a way I admire

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Because he stayed in

126
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
It's easy to criticize people like that

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
You know but he was always provided we weren't there

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
We were right in the middle I mean we weren't

129
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Yeah Rich or anything but

130
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
We weren't the poorest but you said you know

131
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
People got a 10 speed bike

132
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
And they got Schwinn

133
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
I never got a Schwinn

134
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
You want to be the kind of person who could

135
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Buy that stuff one day

136
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
I did I always did

137
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
You always wanted to fly first class you know

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
Like I'd be riding in coach

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
You know I was like

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,943
Get me in the front of this plane without anything

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
Working at a shoe

142
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Shoe store NH

143
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Why work in a shoe store

144
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
In high school

145
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Yeah the neighborhood sort of cool

146
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Shoe store the old it

147
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
The guy that

148
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Started the store

149
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
I went to high school with my brother John

150
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
So with a job it wasn't like hey I want to go working shoes with

151
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
A job fell into it

152
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Yeah but I fell in love with

153
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Would you follow up with

154
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
So it's hard to explain but

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,407
At that moment in the shoe business you know it was a very exciting time because

156
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
This is like the

157
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Early to mid-seventies like 74

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Before I even started platform shoes were very big

159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
For men

160
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
It was just very interesting

161
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
You know

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
I was into it

163
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
I was into the

164
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
The creative

165
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Sort of

166
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,215
Vibe of the whole thing what do you remember about working in that store

167
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
I remember working

168
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Very hard

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Very motivated even at a young age

170
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,455
And what's that I mean when you were there was were you thinking

171
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,319
Is this is me this is my calling or was it more like I like selling stuff

172
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
I love selling stuff

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
I do but I also like creating stuff

174
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
And I like creating stuff to sell

175
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
It's always been sort of a course with a philosophy of mind

176
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
I've never been like oh that's creative but you know

177
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Nobody wants to buy it

178
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
And then on the other hand you know just to

179
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Cell without any

180
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Kind of creativity is boring to me too

181
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,223
So you are working at 6 here in the store the stores by the way is called Toulouse

182
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
And what

183
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
This great guy

184
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
His name is Lance Ruben and I really most of what I know

185
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,255
I got from the sky you were 16 and he was in his

186
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
27

187
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,911
Yeah and the thing about this guy was so interesting because he was up

188
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
A young man

189
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
Was successful in creative

190
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
And I never saw that usually the people that had

191
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
But I thought of his business and we're like my father

192
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
Yeah they build the railroad and they were those long coats with the hats

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271

00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,879
Building with landscape artist and designer shoes

195
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
And also the wholesalers that sold him

196
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
Would be asking him for input on designs

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,375
Yeah cuz he was an up-and-comer you know like a young gun

198
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
So you are a high school student working at the shoe store but you have plans to go to college right you were going to go to college

199
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
I went to University of Miami

Too much how long do you last there

207
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,887
It's a bit of a blur but I think it was about 18 months and it wasn't

208
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
It wasn't for me my dad

209
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
Did me the biggest favor by pulling me out of school

210
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
When I say pulled me out of school he refused to pay

211
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Another $0.50

212
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,223
Bring me to fool around in college so I went to work he went back to it to Long Island

230
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
My father recognized that

Good hard work was good

232
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,127
To you you work in a shoe store and and I guess a certain point you go to

233
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
Tri-Cities New York City

234
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
The guy that owns loose Lance

235
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551

And he says come to work I'm cell

239
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
That's what I did

240
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Sick a little wholesale company

241
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
Yeah and what happened was I went to work there and we blew it up man how did you blow it up

242
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Like boom

243
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
We made it nice company out of

244
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,847
And what he was sourcing shoes from Shoe factories and then what year he was designing the shoes and I was selling

245
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
So he would design them

246
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
They would be made

247
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,015
And then you would go from door to door how to

248
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Design shoes

249
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
Well you know this certain tricks of the trade and knowing what people like in

250
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Working

251
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
The different Construction

252
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
It was just a few guys involved

253
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
But you know I was wondering

254
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
I was at the beginning and

255
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
It got very successful

256
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
We sell to Macy's and

257
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
Department stores

258
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847

00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
What's at that point where you you start to

262
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
Think about maybe doing this for yourself or did you think

263
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
This is great I'm going to keep them red

264
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695

00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Ride the train

266
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
You know what some point I thought about doing it for

267
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
For myself I was very happy there

268
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
You know but at some point I thought

269
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
You know I could do this

270
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,495
When you were working for him how much money would it make

271
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
I would say they were doing Maybe

272
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
40 million a year

273
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Which is like big

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Maybe something like

275
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Yeah yeah

276
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
And so what happened why did you leave

277
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
You know I had taken it as far as I could

278
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
And

279
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
I just didn't want to have a boss any

280
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
It was just time

281
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535

293
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Risking all that

294
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439

369
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Reaction

370
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,615
But not from the people I thought I was going to get a reaction from which would my contemporaries which was from

371
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Younger kid

372
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
I would like the phone was ringing

373
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Where you get that shoe and all that stuff

374
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
We knew that something was going on

375
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
So that's the track that we went on when you decided to

376
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Start Steve Madden

377
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
Did you have an office where you working at if you're not worked in a shoe factory in Brooklyn

378
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
And and you work with them

379
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
And then you made I guess

380
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
She was and then what did you do did you go

381
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
To your former

382
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
Contacts that you had from Macy's and

383
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Anybody that carry shoes ISO

384
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
And then I would go to the National shows and sell them all over the country

385
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Elect first

386
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
In the first year 1990

387
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,927
Like you would go to stores and they would take

388
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
Compare with your you go with your

389
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Sample case

390
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
And

391
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
You'd like your shoes out of people would buy them

392
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
And that was it

393
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Soap

394
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
What was happening

395
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Was

396
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
The market that I was selling to everybody in the shoe business walked away from

397
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
The teenagers you know and stuff like that but Young

398
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
And

399
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Choose a different generation

400
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
Until they had their own thing their own music in their own

401
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Style

402
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
We just tapped into that whole thing

403
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
And this was a market explain some of the time that was

404
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,327
Abandoned by Moshe Nine West

405
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
It was a company called Nine West it was dominating the industry but there was Nike and Reebok

406
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,359
But nobody was like making like funky little shoes it was kind of a throwback to the 70s

407
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
You know from that other are so I kind of brought that back

408
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
Can I was just in the right place

409
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
At the right time

410
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Were they designed to be

411
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Like

412
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Cool but also

413
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Affordable inexpensive

414
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,767
I've always been sort of democratic with my shoes

415
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
Do you remember

416
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
How many

417
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
How much revenue did in in the first year

418
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
I probably did

419
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
I don't know

420
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
500000 is pretty good pretty good

421
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
And you named it Steve Madden because

422
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Seem like the obvious

423
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
It seems like an easy name

424
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Did you ever think about using a cup

425
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,087
French name lookup European sounding

426
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
The first couple of shoes with gold soulier

427
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
Alright

428
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
Larry gold like the French word for slipper

429
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,095
I'm so you know there was some dispute about that brand

430
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,191
Well maybe I just wanted to call and see bad and I can't remember but

431
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
I switched it

432
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Pretty quickly

433
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
Because you work there was one guy that called me of how dare you

434
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,175
I bought you lie I don't want Steve Madden who Do You Think You Are

435
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,503
Yeah I was telling a guy still he still in the shoe business

436
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
And I was taught

437
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
Alright so you got this

438
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Pretty good

439
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Business going

440
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
And Year One

441
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
What are you thinking are you thinking okay I mean did you have Ambitions at that point already to make this into something here

442
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
So when America started the business

443
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
And you know I just

444
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
That really don't have much money I'm just so

445
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Working hand to mouth

446
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
And

447
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,175
A friend of mine who I grew up with went to work for this brokerage firm

448
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,271
And they were raising money for small company this is Donnie porush

449
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
Danny Park

450
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
And

451
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
600 Grand and then we'll get you

452
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,559
6 million looking for a brokerage

453
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,423
And he said to you hey you need to expand your money

454
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
I've known you my whole life

455
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
What would you do if you got 600 thousand

456
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
Can a hundred thousand is like 600 million

457
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
Yeah. Only will I get to 600 Grand

458
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
But I'm going to get you six million dollars when I take you public

459
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
And I laughed at him

460
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
You know because

461
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
I probably have $30,000 in my

462
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Hot to my name

463
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
And so of course you're like what 3330

464
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,095
Something like that yeah 600000 bucks

465
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,191
That's right so right so Danny

466
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,847
Help you go pee and he helped me go public in his firm wisco Stratton Oakmont

467
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,431
A very famous name for anybody who's seen The Wolf of Wall Street

468
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:11,807
My name is Jordan Belfort

469
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,928
Do you write turn 26 I need 49 million dollars that would really piss me off

470
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,792
3 shy of a million a week

471
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864
Call me pump and dump

472
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
And they were basically

473
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
It's a really crappy companies

474
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Toys R Us

475
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
And so they basically we're going to do this

476
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Steve Madden Wright

477
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
They wanted to do it Steve Madden I was the perfect guy for them

478
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Because

479
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Because

480
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
I had a company and do was small and

481
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
They could do there

482
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Thing with it

483
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
You know fit the profile

484
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
It always you don't know me

485
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
My name is Steve Madden

486
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Now we know who you are

487
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
Amazon The Box

488
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
Country Buffet

489
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
So that scene

490
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
With me talking in front of them it was very Act

491
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
We should explain

492
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
You go up

493
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
In front of all these

494
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
He's like traders in the spoils about my shoes thinking that they were

495
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Taylor leiby interested

496
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Tell me what they really were and I was just a piece of

497
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
It's just a piece of paper and a piece of meat

498
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
Which is really the truth

499
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,936
It's a fat girl shoe believe it or not though the Marilu is actually

500
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
Same as the Mary Jane but it's black leather I want to just

501
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
To digress for a moment

502
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Because

503
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
People listening to this

504
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Budding entrepreneurs

505
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
I'm not one of those entrepreneurs that

506
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
That thought he was going to be

507
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
Super successful

508
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
You know I was just trying to survive

509
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
And I'm very negative

510
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Very past

511
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
Unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done

512
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
You know the shows yet

513
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
I think I'm going out of business every other day

514
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
So it's at that time

515
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
This is like 93 I guess when

516
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
92-93 so we went public

517
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
What and how did the stocks do

518
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,832
Well they were totally manipulated the stocks they went up

519
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
And if that was a

520
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
It was a classic pump-and-dump

521
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
And only Steve Madden was a real comp

522
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
Yeah sure if you kept that stop

523
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,120
You would make on that day in 1993

524
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
And you own 10000 shares

525
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
I haven't really done the math but I think you would be worth

526
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,080
A lot of millions and millions of dollars today

527
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
To The Stratton sell the company goes public strength

528
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Public yeah all of a sudden it raises how much money for you

529
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,648
I think the public offering was about 7 million bucks

530
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
Wow so we use it

531
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
I took it and then

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Barry

533
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Short

534
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
Period of time from

535
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
A half a million bucks I was doing 40 million

536
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
50 mil

537
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
And what is that within 36 months

538
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,848
You get all this cash from from the initial public offering

539
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Did you ask any questions

540
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean

541
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,576
These guys were totally breaking the law.

542
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,904
At that point they were artificially inflating your stock

543
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,512
Are you suspicious at all about Danny in about

544
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,144
Did you think

545
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Knew it was too good

546
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah I knew it

547
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
So

548
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
We know I lied

549
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
To myself

550
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
And I told myself that it was a gray area

551
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
You know the trading in these stocks and the

552
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,576
Flipping they would sell me the stocks and I would sell them back to them

553
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Just demands.

554
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Show

555
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
I lied to my son

556
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
You know everybody's doing it

557
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,888
You know like that but I knew in my heart

558
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
But it was illegal and I was wrong

559
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
Who's apart of it

560
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,336
Grilling that you are getting away with it

561
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
Well making that much money is certainly throwing

562
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Fisher

563
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
But damn

564
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
I wish

565
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
I hadn't done it

566
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
And

567
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
But you know more than wishing I had done it because that's

568
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,256
Superman empty thing to say

569
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,816
I wish that I didn't feel compelled

570
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
I wish that I didn't have that feeling that money was every

571
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Because it's not

572
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
It's not every

573
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
So I was greedy and foolish

574
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
Yes I'm trying to figure out who you are

575
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
This creative guy

576
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Yahoo create shoes you design shoes

577
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,856
And you got a really successful and growing business

578
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
And then on the side you're doing this

579
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
These weird stock trades that

580
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
You are shady and

581
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Slim Shady ultimately illegal

582
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,192
Why would you even do that stuff on the side and Lori have the creativity in the business

583
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Get out

584
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
You just get caught up

585
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Just get caught up

586
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
In this thing

587
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,224
But it is certain point it can't be about money it has to be about fulfillment and

588
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,344
Weren't you fulfilled by just the creation of your shoes and and seeing your shoes out in the world

589
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Well that's a very heavy question

590
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
How one gets fulfilled

591
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
I'm still grappling with that today

592
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
You know

593
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
So there are moments

594
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
But I'm very fulfilled do you know

595
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
And there are moments when I'm not

596
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
I was raised to think that money was everything

597
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
You know

598
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Money is the center of the universe

599
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
And if that's what you're

600
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Core belief is

601
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
You know you'll do anything

602
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
And you will

603
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Break the law

604
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
You know

605
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Second money is like a drug

606
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
You know

607
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
And

608
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,632
We got in trouble in

Support for this podcast and the following message come from Delta

Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

615
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,944
Best 300 cities where many people do the same things you do

616
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,320
That's 300 cities where people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones

617
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
To know about that one place

618
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
And 300 cities where people miss someone

619
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
And one of Delta's other 299c

620
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people to go

621
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,168

Prison cell

644
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
What you think do you think I'm finished my life is

645
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah pretty much

646
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
You know I thought

647
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
I thought I was cutting my Goose was cooked

648
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Butts

649
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
I did have the sense that I could get through it

650
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,744
Were there people who knew you didn't like you

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
TWRP

Feeling like that he got his comeuppance osher

653
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Yeah it made such a success in the shoe business

654
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
I was a bit of a rebel so now people going to Hawk

655
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
See

656
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
That's what happens when you do that

657
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,224
Where did you work where you were sent to a minimum security prison

658
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
What they call a camp

659
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
And what was your boys are living

660
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
Lived in a barracks

661
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
It was like a

662
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Military

663
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
Make your own room

664
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
I live in a cube

665
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Live in a cube

666
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
And that with another guy

667
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Or two

668
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
How did you pass the time

669
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Well that a lot

670
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
Exercise a lot

671
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,544
And I took some classes when I was there

672
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,128
Did you when you got there and you knew that you were going to be there for at least

673
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Are you there for 31 months but but

674
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
41

675
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
6 year sentence

676
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
31 month

677
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
31

678
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Did you ever

679
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Get depressed if you're thinking

680
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
I don't know how I'm going to stay here for 30 minutes

681
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah my first night I looked up at

682
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
The ceiling

683
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304
And I said how the heck am I going to do this

684
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
How am I going to get through this

685
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Did it go by faster than you expected

686
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
It seemed like 31 years

687
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,520
Wow Shannon but

688
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
I quickly

689
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
Ascertained early on that whining and

690
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
Moaning would not do me any good

691
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
And running around saying I was innocent would not do me any good

692
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
So I would try to get through this

693
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Try to

694
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Better myself

695
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
If it sounds corny but

696
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Exercising breed

697
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Learning

698
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
You know

699
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
That kind of thing

700
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
So I did

701
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
When you went to jail

702
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Steve Madden is doing very well right

703
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
When I went to jail it was doing well

704
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
Were you worried about the brand

705
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:49,760
But the name your name was the brand that store at Great people working for me I was

706
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
I was really worried about surviving

707
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
And getting through it

708
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
You personally or company

709
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
The person I was really more

710
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Focused on getting through that experience

711
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Did you think that you would

712
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,120
Ever go back to Steve Madden company built

713
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah

714
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
So you had that Horizon

715
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,800
Do you think this is a really weird question for accuracy

716
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
To hear your take on it

717
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
If you could trade

718
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
The time you were in prison

719
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:24,064
For being a continuing on and not not not having that experience

720
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Would you

721
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Would you do it or or do you think that

722
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Strangely enough.

723
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
The time being incarcerated was

724
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Important for your development as a person

725
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
Yeah that's exactly right II

726
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Very big believer in you know Destiny and your path and all that corny stuff I just believe it

727
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Viscerally

728
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
So

729
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
I'm so grateful for my life

730
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
After prison

731
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
America great girl

732
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,504
I had great kids

733
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,368
I don't know that I would have had children had I not gone to prison

734
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
So

735
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,464
I regret some of my choices

736
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
You know shortcuts that I took or

737
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,144
You know thinking that money was the most important thing I regret decisions like that

738
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
But I don't regret a day in prison

739
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
An amazing experience

740
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Very painful

741
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
I mean the only thing I can describe try to describe it to people

742
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Your heart gets broke every day

743
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,784
Yeah when you're in prison heart breaks every day the living in prison

744
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,368
It's not as terrible as one might think

745
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
But

746
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
You know your heart's breaking cuz you're not with the people you love

747
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
That that's the difficult part of prison

748
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,960
It sounds like you became a much more empathetic

749
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Person

750
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
When you are there

751
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Saw

752
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,360
People who unlike you who did not grow up like

753
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
Came from different backgrounds

754
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,736
Who had who kind of ended up there because of circumstance

755
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
But particularly the

756
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
The African American Experience really

757
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Touched me

758
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
And

759
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
Young man dealing drugs

760
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Getting

761
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Huge sentences

762
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,376
Unfair drug laws that really were biased against black people

763
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
So that was

764
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
You know to see

765
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,776
Problems in those communities talk to

766
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Young black man and

767
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
It's very complicated.

768
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
You know issue

769
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Yeah

770
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Yeah I just think

771
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
I'll give you an example

772
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
Is a little thing

773
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Did you know

774
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
When I grew up

775
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
I went to

776
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Grade school in the six

777
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
It's right

778
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,000
We we we learned that Robert E Lee was a kindly gentleman

779
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
He was called a hero like he left

780
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,888
He defended his homeland of Virginia

781
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
And that's just that way that's just

782
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Complete

783
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Racism

784
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
But we didn't realize it's the subtle form of race

785
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
So that's the kind of thing that

786
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
You know those kind of feelings

787
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Stuff that came up in prison do you know that kind of

788
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
That learned and read more about it

789
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:08,416
Okay so you I think you get out again in 2005

790
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,488
Do you remember the day that that you were released

791
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,072
You know that such an interesting question because

792
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
I don't really

793
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
Is a bit of a blur

794
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
I think of it now

795
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
I thought about that day when I was away for so long

796
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
What it was going to be like

797
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
And I can't remember it

798
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
I really can't

799
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
My wife picked me up

800
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
We should mention that while you were in prison you fell in love yes

801
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,416
Yeah and she pick me up he was an employee when I know that we had sushi

802
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
And I just

803
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
I just can't remember was so

804
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
It was such a blur

805
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
It was so much coming at me

806
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
You know when you're locked up

807
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
After 30 months

808
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
You know everything is like amazing

809
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
Like slice of pizza is like

810
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:05,248
Oh my God like this is the greatest thing ever

811
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
So you

812
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
You're out

813
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
Your back

814
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
Back in in society baggage

815
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
Freedom

816
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
Back how long does it take you to get to address

817
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,352
To having control of your own schedule your day today schedule

818
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,216
Well there's a transition. You go into a halfway house but I was fortunate cuz I had a job

819
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
And I came right back to work so

820
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
Is an amazing time

821
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
Lose your position when you came back to to your company

822
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
The same position I'm in today what is the founder

823
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Which is the

824
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Chief cheerleader

825
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
We have fabulous people running Steve Madden

826
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
I wasn't a great CEO

827
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
Why weren't you a great CEO

828
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
You know I'm just

829
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Not detail oriented

830
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
And

831
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
My talent is suited and other things you know

832
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,752
When did you when did you realize that you were not cut out to be a CEO

833
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
For what it's the pits of small you can kind of be the CEO so you know everybody

834
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,456
You live and breathe and then you could be a CEO

835
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Because you touch everything

836
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
But then a business kiddo what's a business gets past a certain

837
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Point

838
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,416
You know it's impossible for someone like me

839
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
To to do that job

840
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
In 2005

841
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
I think within the four years

842
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
Steve Madden net revenue of

843
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Of over half a billion dollars

844
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
So what happened in that time with the company grow

845
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
What was the strategy that

846
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
Allowed you to grow so much

847
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
So our goal was to

848
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
You don't make great shoes and

849
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
You know I think that that

850
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Kind of like 1/2 at the end of the day

851
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
The marketing was in Super

852
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,744
Fantastic it was just great shoes

853
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
Great prices great value and

854
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,888
You know I think that we just wore everybody out

855
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,960
With that you know more people are giving us they're open to buy

856
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,312
And we open more stores you know anything in our internet business exploded

857
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,920
But the big thing about Steve Madden I have to say and I've said this many times

858
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:14,784
Was the people it's the madness that I've hired so many great people

859
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
It starts with recognizing my own limitations

860
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,952
I'm weak at that so when I get somebody that can do that for me

861
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,488
And

862
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Yeah that's really the story its people

863
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,864
So you come you come back to the company and

864
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Yuan

865
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
By the way

866
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
You had

867
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Funny Money

868
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,056
You could have sold your shares walked away very rich man

869
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
And just kind of

870
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,432
I don't know done something else are focused on

871
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,760
Yourself why why did you want to go back to

872
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,576
The company actually it's if that's an eternal

873
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,136
I grapple with that all the time

874
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,440
So I love the idea

875
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,976
Making shoes

876
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
The people want to buy and I love seeing my shoes being worn

877
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
And I just love all of it and I love making money

878
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
Let me be clear about that I love it I love the whole thing because you don't need more of it so what do you love about it

879
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Well

880
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
Okay that's a good these are great questions

881
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
And I want to ask other entrepreneurs rather

882
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,344
People like so how do you stay motivated you know that's all you've got

883
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
You know a few dollars in the bank and you know that

884
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,744
Use the rent is paid and all of that

885
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
So what keeps you going

886
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,400
I want to ask Haim Saban some more question you know how to spot is right the median mobile

887
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Yes

888
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,288
Screw up like dirt poor and Alexandria Egypt became from boudoir

889
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
Right and

890
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,920
What what's the big deal cuz he was waiting to sell

891
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,480
His company to Disney for

892
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
I don't know

893
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
More than a billion

894
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Yeah

895
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
And I said

896
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
No I want you take 500

897
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Million

898
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
I forgot to

899
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
He said it wasn't worth that I want to see I want to be a billionaire

900
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,608
And it wasn't about the actual dollar amount

901
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
It was

902
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
For him it was a mark

903
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
It was like a musical Mark you could say okay I've reached this point

904
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
And then I can meet you this

905
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
And then it's this point and it

906
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,152
It's like a demarcation point of success

907
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
Yeah it's a heavy question

908
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
It really is

909
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,576
But of course it's a luxury that people with money have to be able to talk about this stuff

910
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
You know there's somebody

911
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Out there that

912
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Listen to this

913
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,000
You know they've got to pay their rent next Friday in the same listen to this

914
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Idiot talking about

915
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
You know what I agree with them

916
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:41,216
I know but but it's something I think about a great deal

917
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
Because

918
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,616
I feel so good if I have had a great day at work

919
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,968
Where I'm inspiring and inspired

920
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
At the same time

921
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,832
It's such an amazing feeling there's no amount of money that can replicate

922
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Yeah

923
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
So I guess that's what I want

924
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
You know Inspire and be inspired

925
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,864
What was the last shoe that you designed to say curiosity

926
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,472
The last shoe I designed was last week

927
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,544
Sneaker with studs

928
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
You designed a shoe last week

929
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
Yeah we have a factory in

930
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
Outside the East River in Manhattan

931
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
But I'm always fiddling with shoes and

932
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
Thinking about shoes

933
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,440
Course I have a great team that does most of the work and I take most of the credit now

934
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
You don't

935
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,304
Seemed to be a super obsessed over your own

936
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,400
Personal style you like you got the baseball cap bingo in Endicott.

937
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
But you're not wearing like

938
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
Designer like Runway outfits everyday

939
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,616
I look like a garage mechanic Sundays

940
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
I'm at Runway

941
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,759
Yeah I wear t-shirts and jeans I'm very lucky that's why I don't take that

942
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,063
For granted I'm blessed that I'm

943
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
The ability to wear

944
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
But I scream t-shirt everyday

945
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
Did you ever feel like I don't know like some of these

946
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,815
Fashion folks Conover snobby about you that they

947
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,655
I know they don't let you into their Club cuz you weren't from you know Milan or

948
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
Didn't go to art school or

949
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,007
Yeah you wear baseball caps in the

950
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
And you were so kind

951
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
Kicking their butts with with with you

952
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Shoes that were

953
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
LeFrak the price

954
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
Did you make that disappear

955
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
There was

956
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Big time

957
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
It's not so much anymore

958
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Used to bug you

959
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Yeah but

960
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Bug me a lot

961
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:42,047
You know I will or I would going to a high-end department store like a Barney's

962
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
And

963
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
Steve Madden

964
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,775
People working in the Star Wars Steve Madden drive me crazy

965
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Yeah

966
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
That happened so many times

967
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,407
And still to this day there's a bit of that going on

968
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
It's frustrating

969
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,319
But it with you step away from the balcony like me looking at this I would be like

970
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
Who cares can you crush them all like so big deal

971
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,719
Well I once was upset because

972
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
They put Puff Daddy in the cfda

973
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
The CFT is a club for what

974
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
Something for designers at FDA

975
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Very very posh

976
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,519
Empty put coffee in there I thought to myself coffee

977
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,335
Are you in there

978
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:32,479
I'm not there when you are even allowed in the building

979
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:38,111
They would say well you copy Pinot Blanc siaga or whatever it is

980
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
You know I'm weak

981
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,231
We definitely are aware of expensive shoes that are out

982
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
Some ways a lot of these

983
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
These hide and designers

984
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
Connect if you could make the case that

985
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,191
The younger crowd

986
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,591
Will enter the market by buying Steve Madden shoes and then there's this aspirational to buy

987
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,895
It's a gateway drug if shoes Steve Madden

988
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
You're not buying

989
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,991
Louboutins manolas without starting with Steve Madden

990
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
Salmonella should give me

991
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Tons of love for that

992
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
I reach much many more people than him

993
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,975
To think that there will be a point where you are

994
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
Acknowledged by your peers

995
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Is it important to you

996
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
I'm acknowledged by a lot of people

997
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Probably too much

998
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,935
You know young men coming up really know

999
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,751
And identify with the struggle in the grind and

1000
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
What I've done so I think there's a difference

1001
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
Kind of respect going on

1002
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:38,015
Not what I had thought but another kind of respect and I feel it all the time and I'm walking down the street people shout out

1003
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
How to me

1004
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
You know it's

1005
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
It's the real thing

1006
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
How much

1007
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
Of your success do you think is because of

1008
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,375
Your skill and intelligence hard work and how much of it is

1009
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Because of lack

1010
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
I think a lot of it is luck

1011
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
I do I think

1012
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
My own sort of philosophy is

1013
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,823
That the window of opportunity

1014
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
Opens

1015
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,711
For you several times in life for 1

1016
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
And I think the intelligence

1017
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
Comes from

1018
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
Knowing when that window

1019
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
Is open

1020
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
And

1021
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
You know being able to jump through that window

1022
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,791
Because you can have all the talent in the world but sometimes the window is just not open

1023
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,471
Besides the stuff that lands you in prison what

1024
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
Other mistakes that you made

1025
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,359
Early in in the business that you would have done differently knowing what you know now

1026
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,175
Let me just say that

1027
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,247
Mistakes can be a very good thing

1028
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,159
You know so there were some mistakes that we made that we did so many great things

1029
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
And the thing about that is

1030
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
If you start getting gunshot

1031
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
I stopped being afraid to make a mistake

1032
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,399
You'll never have the brilliant ideas you never have the big ideas

1033
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
You know if you just try to hit the safe

1034
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
The safe ones

1035
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
You know then you're

1036
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
You're doomed

1037
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
I feel like

1038
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
So you need to make mistakes

1039
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
You need to make mistakes you need

1040
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
You need to go

1041
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,551
Cuz if you're not goofing a few times it means you're not reaching

1042
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Steve Madden

1043
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Sounder

1044
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Steve Madden shoes

1045
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,327
The company's market cap recently hit more than three

1046
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Billion dollars

1047
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,679

1064
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and say story starts back into

1065
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,711
2002 Chris dimino was a design student working on a

1066
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,295
Class project assignment was to repurpose a typewriter

1067
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,135
Given that it's now obsolete ideas

1068
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,023
Chris spot and old smith-corona typewriter at a garage sale

1069
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:07,423
Staring at it for a while ago so hungry at the time but I think just staring at a long enough it eventually came to me that this looks like a

1070
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Waffle to me

1071
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,007
And a few seconds later and then I thought okay

1072
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
If I use this as the base

1073
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
Have another thing on top and it would be sort of like an old waffle maker

1074
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:25,343
Make a waffle iron out of typewriter Keys instead of the typical cast iron grid

1075
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,207
So it went to Salvation Army and picked up this old waffle iron for 7 Bucks

1076
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,607
And then I basically rip the keys off of the typewriter

1077
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
Off of that old smith-corona

1078
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Use them to make

1079
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
Plastic mold and they put the mold into the waffle iron so

1080
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,103
It looks like you could make a waffle in the shape of a keyboard but

1081
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,991
This thing was just for show it looked incredible but it didn't have a heating element so

1082
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Couldn't make anything

1083
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,391
Play the story might have ended their except Chris posted a picture of this

1084
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,791
Websites people started sharing it and people started emailing me about it and like 2 years later at 7

1085
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
Clean hits on that page in particular

1086
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
And of course a lot of people were asking Chris

1087
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
Where can I buy this thing

1088
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,751
The more the people ask the more I ask myself

1089
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
Hey could I do this

1090
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
It was almost like

1091
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
Universe is like you're going to make this

1092
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
And people don't like it

1093
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
Okay but this pose a problem

1094
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
How to make a real waffle iron

1095
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,647
Well for starters Chris decided to give his original idea of pillow makeover

1096
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
And go with the

1097
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,255
Computer keyboard instead is basically the standard

1098
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Five rows of

Keys

1100
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,703
Escape key is aliki the spacebar

1101
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,055
And then put it into an existing mold for an electric waffle iron

1102
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,871
But then he discovered that most waffles

1103
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:57,247
They're pretty square and he couldn't find an electric waffle maker that had that long

1104
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Angular base he needed

1105
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
So then he's okay

1106
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,903
I'll just make the bass myself but it turns out

1107
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
That wasn't going to work either

1108
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,719
It's a really steep

1109
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Cliff

1110
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Price wise

1111
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
To get into that game

1112
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Yep

1113
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
Certifications in

1114
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,679
Not to mention just a manufacturing tooling so

1115
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
It always scared me away from

1116
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,615
Going that way soon. Maybe I shouldn't even bother trying to make an electric waffle iron

1117
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
Maybe I can just do one that sits in a stovetop no electronics no

1118
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,343
I ended up making one real aluminum version carved out of a block of aluminum

1119
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
Super-heavy having dancing pic

1120
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Guy poured battering

1121
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,047
And lo and behold on the first try and made a very very good waffle

1122
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,631
He launched a Kickstarter campaign and people were really into it

1123
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:49,215
And they're like oh my God finally you're making it now I can't believe you're finally making it

1124
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,799
Chris raised over $60,000 on Kickstarter

1125
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
And with that money he was able to find a factory in China that was willing to make the waffle iron and yes

1126
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,831
If you look at his video the thing definitely does make waffles in the shape of a computer keyboard

1127
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,623
Alright design this so that

1128
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,951
With all the keys there it sort of has parts that are thick

1129
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:16,351
And then basically between the keys were thinner so my hope is that those be sort of crispy and Airy and then

1130
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,399
The other parts of these or more dancing

1131
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,799
You need to find ways to have fun with it with toppings and putting berries in the keys Chris Costas

1132
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,871
Products what else did keyboard waffle iron

1133
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,735
The past three years he's sold 7000 of them mostly on Amazon

1134
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
But for now

1135
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,087
He still got his day job as a graphic designer

1136
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,439
