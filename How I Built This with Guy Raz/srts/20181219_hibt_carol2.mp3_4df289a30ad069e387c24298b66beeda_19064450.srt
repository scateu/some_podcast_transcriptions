00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,088
Hey it's guy here and today we're releasing our final episode from

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
How I built this

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Summit

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
San Francisco

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,184
And today's conversation

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,512
Is with Lisa Price the founder of Carol's Daughter

15
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,096
If you don't know her story that you may want to listen to The Original Episode 1

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
Ran back in June of last year

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
It's an incredible story about Lisa began making lotions and body creams in her kitchen

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,080
In the 1990s

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,896
Geneva brand after her mom Carol

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
And eventually

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
Turn it into a major line of beauty products

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
Primarily for women of color

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
And then

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,624
She sold her company to L'Oreal about

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,744
4 years ago it's a classic story about starting small and growing big

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Am I spoke to Lisa at the summit I wanted to ask you about that and about some of the hard lessons she learned

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
And when she was expanding her company

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
One woman show

29
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
Into a major brand

30
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
Thank you for coming Lisa

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,552
One of the biggest beauty products brands that was enacted discovered mainly by women of color

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
What's up with the idea

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
I'm take us back to the early 90s

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
How did you

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Had the start how'd you get the idea

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816
Well initially It Started From Me making

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Fragrances

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
I have

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,936
Always loved fragrance for as long as I can remember

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,008
And I read this article about prince who

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
It's my favorite musician of all time

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Yes thank you

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
And

44
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:58,272
In this article it said that he used to blend different fragrances on different parts of his body

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
To create a unique set

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
And I was like okay I'm sold that's a great idea

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
And I started

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
To blend fragrances for yourself for myself

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
And then I realized that I needed

50
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
To have moisturizers in the center

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
It's because that's how you layer your fragrance that's how your fragrance laugh

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
And I started to

53
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
Add the fragrances to

54
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Lotions that I would buy at the drugstore

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
But they didn't blend well

56
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
They would get messy

57
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
So then I started to make my own

58
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
The kitchen stove

59
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
And then I began to share it with friends and family

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
And my mom said

61
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
Why don't you sell it the Saint Mary's Flea Market

62
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,768
That was May 25th 1993

63
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
I mean you were buying like off

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
The Shelf cocoa butter and melting it down and

65
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,960
Like in your kitchen like a on the stove for Amazon Prime

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,336
Peace and crickets were not as easy to find as they are today

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,968
And if you remember the episode that Lisa was on at the time you start to sell out of your apartment and people body here and there

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
Still was your side hustle for like 3 or 4 years

69
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
At at what

70
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Point cuz a lot of people here

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,512
They kept side hustles going I met many of them amazing amazing products that people are trying to create

72
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,840
At what point did you were you able to take the mental leap and say

73
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
You know what

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
I'm going to turn my side hustle into my main my main gig

75
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
Well in 1996

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
I was

77
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,104
Pregnant with my first son Forest

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Teesnow 22

79
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
But he was born in March of 96

80
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
I basically looked at

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
My schedule

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
And

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Figure it out

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
That if I try to

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Continue working

86
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Along with trying to take care of a newborn

87
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
I would basically have to give my paycheck to the babysitter

88
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
So it just seemed to make sense

89
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
At that time too

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Let

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
The job go

92
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
And give the business a try

93
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Since I would

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Just had my paycheck to someone else anyway

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Were you

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
I mean

97
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Were you worried about making ends meet

98
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
At that point I mean

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Is it because you have a pretty decent paying job in in TV and presumably you weren't making as much

100
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Watch from from the

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Lotions at that point

102
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
I wasn't as worried

103
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
When I first started

104
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Because it made such large

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Medical Center

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Where it got

107
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
Scary was about a year later

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
When my husband lost

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
His job

110
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
And then it was just a business

111
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
To take care of every

112
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
That's what it really.

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
That's scary and at that point we purchase

114
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Home as well

115
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
So now we had a mortgage

116
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
A second baby on the way

117
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
And all of a sudden he had no

118
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,511
And we managed our expenses as best we could we can be very a frugal people

119
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
But we need to be

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
And thankfully it worked

121
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
And the business continue to grow and within about

122
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Six to eight months

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
My husband Gordon was working again

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,383
But that's 6 to 8 months without him working and with another child on the way it was

125
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
How was your

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
What is the idea what's your vision to turn this into a

127
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Massive company or did you think

128
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
This is going to be something for me my friends and anyone who wants to buy it

129
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
I did not think of it being a mess

130
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Company at all I really thought that

131
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
What I defined as

132
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,791
Success in the beginning

133
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Was

134
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
That I would make enough money

135
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
That I could contribute to

136
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
My household

137
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
And I maybe I would run a business out of a garage

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Yeah

139
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
But I thought we'd get here like a bigger place

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
And I did and I didn't think that I would

141
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Be traveling and

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
Bandito doing the different things that I have to do

143
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
You know for the business today

144
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
And and had no idea

145
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
You

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Got something happened in 2003 which is

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
Oprah Winfrey profile

148
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Put you on the show

149
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Ten Years After

150
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Amazing

151
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Ten years after a church

152
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
Church flea market

153
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
She puts you on the show it was it was

154
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
So what happened after that did it

155
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Demi was just like

156
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Crazy

157
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Spike

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
It wasn't crazy like a lot of

159
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,999
People think like a lot of people think that because you meet Oprah Winfrey and you shake her hand that when you shake her hand

160
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
A wire transfer takes place and you're suddenly a millionaire

161
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
That doesn't happen

162
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
But

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
Our website actually crash

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
We told the people that were hosting it is going to be a lot of traffic

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Oh we're ready we're ready they were

166
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
But we were still able to capture a lot of orders capture a lot of

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Email addresses

168
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
And it was

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
A good build

170
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
But like a

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Steady bill

172
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
It wasn't something that we couldn't manage

173
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
And it continued

174
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
The Climb

175
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
So I appeared on her show in June of 2000

176
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
3

177
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
And

178
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Then pee

179
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,615
People magazine had been thinking about doing something on me and that cinched it they were like oh yes

180
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
We're doing a spread on you

181
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
And the show re aired in October

182
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,087
The People magazine article came out in November and I had a book deal

183
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
By the top of the following year

184
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
It was a very good fourth quarter

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
So was it sort of like

186
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,887
Just a spike in the 4th quarter p&l

187
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
Well it didn't fall off and how did you manage that

188
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
That level of scaling I mean all of a sudden

189
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
You got to hire people you've got to

190
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
You could expand your inventory you got to

191
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,807
Increase the production what was good about it was the show wasn't about

192
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
A specific product

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
So it was about women who started business

194
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
So they just profiled the business

195
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Oprah happened to mention

196
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
The foot cream

197
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
That I had a foot lotion and I had a foot butter

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
I didn't have a foot cream

199
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
But what we did

200
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,519
We put the foot products on

201
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
The first

202
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Page of the website so when you went to

203
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
To the website

204
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Foot products were there

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
And we had a week

206
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Between when I taped it and when the show aired

207
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,623
So the staff just Beast up production on foot butter and foot lotion

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
And we were ready

209
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,767
Well when you started it was you and like a stove top

210
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
And

211
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,655
And the table at the flea market by 9th but you know by 2003-2004 how many

212
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
How many people working with you

213
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
About 20

214
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
And then how big did it eventually get

215
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,127
By the time we were acquired by L'Oreal we had about 40

216
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Two employees

217
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
So what does that mean

218
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,575
What was that like to go from just you and a kitchen to overseeing 42 people I mean was that

219
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
It's a different Beast

220
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
So it's very different

221
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
If you're not in HR

222
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Person

223
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Or a

224
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
A manager in that way it's a very different skill-sets it was something that I had to learn how

225
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
How to do

226
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Because you sort of assumed that

227
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,847
Everyone's going to follow your work ethic and your styling

228
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
You're just going to tell people that this is what they have to

229
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
To do when they're just going to do it

230
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,783
And then you have to remember wait what did I do when I had a job

231
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
Did I always listen to my boss

232
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
No

233
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Yeah

234
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
I'm the boss

235
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Now and then

236
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
This is their job

237
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
They don't like

238
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Got it

239
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
Did you eat a one when you were on the show I remember you saying something like

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
That

241
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
As we grew in

242
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Sort of felt like

243
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
The company kind of got away from

244
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
In a little bit oh yeah you remember remember what why what happened

245
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
Well I had investors who had come into

246
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
The company

247
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
And

248
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Then we had equity

249
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
Partners in and when you have Equity partners

250
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
More money comes in

251
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
As things get very professional so

252
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Now

253
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
Either sitting at the table you have someone who's been in sales beauty sales for 15 years

254
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,519
Can someone who's been in operations for 10 years and

255
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
Someone that's Run Beauty companies for the last

256
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
12 years

257
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
And there was all of this

258
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
Experience at the table that I didn't

259
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
And half

260
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
And

261
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,855
I decided that I was going to take the position of

262
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
I'm not going to sit at the head of the

263
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
The table I'm going to sit at the table with everyone

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Because there's so much that I need to learn

265
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
And unfortunately

266
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
That was proceed

267
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Saved as

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
A weakness

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
And it was perceived as me choosing to take

270
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
A less important role in a less import

271
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
And I began to notice that

272
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
People worry

273
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Coming to me first

274
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
With things

275
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,759
They weren't necessarily

276
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
Valuing my opinion in the same way that they should

277
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
And I

278
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Began to lose my voice within

279
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
My own brand

280
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
And I had to get it back

281
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Did you were you able to

282
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
I wish I was able to we hired a

283
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
A person to be the president of the

284
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
The company

285
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
And that person

286
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Was a person who

287
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
Decided that he wasn't going to make changes

288
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Without

289
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Me

290
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
And without mice

291
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Support and he was someone

292
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
And who

293
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Taught me

294
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Instead of just told me

295
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,207
You know other people would tell me what was happening or they would say oh don't worry about it we've got it

296
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
And

297
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Richard

298
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Explain things to me and I could see

299
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
We asked him questions

300
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Without feeling as if

301
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
I was less than b

302
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Because I didn't know

303
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,079
I can understand that instinct right went when your smell like you you start this business

304
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
You got the passion but then all these sort of x

305
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Spirits of God

306
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
Years decades of Industry experience come in you think okay

307
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,343
I should come take a back seat cuz they've got this expertise like I can understand that instinct to

308
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
Want to want to pull back but at the same time

309
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
When you did that

310
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
You had to kind of

311
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
Give up a lot of your

312
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,399
Stamp on the company what what do you think you would have done differently if you

313
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
If you had a chance

314
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
To be in that position again

315
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
I would trust my gut

316
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
More

317
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
I am not

318
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
I'm not

319
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
Sad that I did it because

320
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
That's how I learned so it

321
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Would never happen

322
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
And

323
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
I think I had to go

324
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Through that to learn that

325
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
But it's

326
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
It's important to understand that no matter how much someone else

327
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Nose

328
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
They still don't know

329
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Your breath

330
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
And if you if you can

331
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Pair your brand to

332
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Your child

333
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
There maybe you know a teacher or a tutor

334
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151
Who's just a miracle worker and they're able to break through

335
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,759
And and get to your kid in a way that you haven't been able to figure out

336
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
But that doesn't make them a better parent for your child

337
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
That just makes them a really good tutor or really good teacher

338
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
But it doesn't make them there

339
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Apparent

340
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,095
And that was what I had to learn that even though there were some people along the way

341
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,399
Who knew better things about the business

342
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
It didn't mean that they understood her

343
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
And that they really knew how to

344
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
Help her grow

345
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
And how to translate her for other

346
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
That was my job

347
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
And I should never have let anyone else try to do that job

348
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
But you say that you kind of had to go through that to learn

349
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
But you made a mistake

350
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
And you now know that

351
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
But here in this audience and people listening to

352
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Today's podcast

353
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Are are going to be in a similar position right

354
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Where are they they made

355
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
I created something and it

356
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Rose and lots of experts

357
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Come in

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
And say you know

359
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Let me take take this over

360
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
What

361
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
What should they do what

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
I mean

363
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
What are the wraps

364
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
Well no one's ever going to say let me take this over

365
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
They won't be that over

366
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
It happens quietly

367
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
And indifferently

368
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
You know

369
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Your gut

370
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
And you know when something is right and you know when something is wrong

371
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
And there were times when I knew something

372
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Was it right

373
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
But

374
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
I let my gut

375
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Go

376
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,247
You know I said well he's been doing it for 12 years and this is different and this is a different level

377
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
So let's just see

378
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
And

379
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
You know we would let's just see

380
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
And it wasn't

381
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Right

382
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Don't let that

383
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Happen

384
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
You know speak up

385
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
When your gut

386
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Feels like it isn't right

387
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
And

388
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
What what I what I learned from it was

389
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,543
When I do speak up it doesn't necessarily mean that every single time

390
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
People are just going to listen to me

391
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
And they're not going to listen to anybody else

392
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
But at least there was a conversation and it was a dialogue

393
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:22,111
And sometimes when there's a dialogue someone will explain to me what you know the reason that we wanted to do this is

394
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Is because of this

395
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
And if we learn this

396
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,815
Then we know we should go in this direction and then I say okay I can understand why you would want to do that

397
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Because we're going to learn something different

398
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,495
So then I would learn from that process and they would learn from that process but it's awful

399
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
When You Say Nothing

400
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Even though inside you know

401
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,431
This isn't quite right I wouldn't do it this way I don't understand why it's going in this direction

402
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
So you have to speak up

403
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
Because you don't want to live with that what if

404
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
And if I had just

405
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Stano if I had only

406
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
You don't want to live with that

407
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,815
You we just discussed as a load of the podcast you got a little bit of backlash from your hardcore fans when

408
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
When Carol's daughter was sold to L'Oreal because

409
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
I'm sickly in a some of your

410
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Irfan said hey you know

411
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
Self-made African American business woman selling his company to Big multinational

412
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,919
It's a sell-out blah blah blah you heard that criticism

413
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Did that sting and did you

414
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Did you kind of take that personally

415
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Oh yes

416
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
It stung a lot

417
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,695
And I did take it personally for a short. Of time and then I let it go

418
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Because

419
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
I realize that

420
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
You know people had written a story for me

421
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
And if that was okay

422
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
That was what they understood

423
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,799
And that was what they thought and they thought that I should go in this direction but they didn't really know

424
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
The whole story and they didn't

425
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
No

426
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
That the way that I had built

427
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
The business

428
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
My investors needed to exit

429
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
And they didn't know

430
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
The work that it took

431
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
To get a company to a place

432
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
Where a company like L'Oreal would buy it you know a lot of people

433
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Think that

434
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,815
You know you're not doing so well so they pick you up for a song

435
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
It edits

436
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
It doesn't work that way you have to be profitable you have to

437
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
How to be doing well

438
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Have to have good profit

439
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Margin

440
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
And they have to

441
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Growth coming

442
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
From you

443
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,151
So it it hurt and it stung for about 36 hours

444
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,991
And I let it go

445
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
And you did very well

446
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Thank you

447
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
Very briefly Weebly play Nadia Montage at the beginning of the day where you said whether you're doing 40,000 and sales a year

448
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
28 million

449
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
You still doing the same work

450
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
What do you mean by

451
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
You know

452
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,447
It's very interesting being a notch

453
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
Open or cuz technically right now I'm not an entrepreneur

454
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
I'm an employee of L'Oreal

455
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
But there's so much that I

456
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Do that is

457
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Still

458
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
The same work

459
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
You know I

460
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
I push

461
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
I believe

462
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,415
I rally people together i-lead I inspire

463
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
There's so many things

464
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Stat I do too

465
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Today that I did

466
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
When I was selling in the flea market

467
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
I just might have to do

468
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Less

469
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Great work

470
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
If you will

471
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
But a lot of it is is the same and it takes

472
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
It takes that same

473
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
Drive and passion

474
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
And love for what I do

475
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
And

476
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
I've got I've gone back

477
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
2

478
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Making things in the kitchen

479
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
Just for myself and just for fun

480
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,927
And it's amazing to be in a place where I can do it and give it away

481
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,791
You know like I'm not relying on how much each bottle is going to

482
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Bring into

483
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,447
To pay whatever bill now you can just make a batch and just go to my neighbors and be like here

484
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Occasion

485
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Amazing

486
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
