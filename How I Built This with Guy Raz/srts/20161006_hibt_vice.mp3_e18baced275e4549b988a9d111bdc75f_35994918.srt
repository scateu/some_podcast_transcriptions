With a friend of mine who also went to meetings and I was scared

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856

Vice

45
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816

Vice co-founder suroosh Alvi

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
Keep didn't set out to create any of this in fact

53
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
He barely made it out of this

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Money is alive

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,552
I was born in Toronto and my parents emigrated

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
From Pakistan

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
A couple years

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
They are retired academics

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488

For a while

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
And so I ended up going to high school in the states

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
So I heard a lot of you have to work

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
Twice as hard as white people to get anywhere in this world grown up

67
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Is it that turned out to be true

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Yeah

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Yeah

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
What what did they want you to be

71
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Well

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
Feels that are most respected

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
And in Pakistan at least

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
When I was growing up with medicine or engineering

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
So I think that

76
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
You know in an Ideal World

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
I would have been a doctor

78
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
With that with a ba I'm

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
The black sheep

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,824
Of the family everyone has multiple degrees to seem intelligent in Montreal right

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Yes or you could send

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
I was not a good student I originally went into psychology I got kicked out of that program ended

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Getting a degree in philosophy

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
It was a

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Tough

86
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Slot guide

87
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Come from you know small

88
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Private school in

89
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
Minneapolis Road high school and

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,120
Going to go was just a different badges lot of distractions in Montreal and that's a

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Place where you can buy

92
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
You can hit a low point right

93
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
That's where I

95
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Bottomed out

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
When I

97
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
You know finished Miguel it was

98
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Also with a

99
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Full-blown heroin habit

100
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
And so

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,832
I spent a couple years afterwards kind of looking for a geographic

102
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Bouncing around jumping

103
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
From City to City

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Bumps that with me it's here in the city this environment it's

105
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Just to decadence

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Blah blah blah

107
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
So I ran around

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
And

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
No matter where I went

110
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
I kind of took it with me

111
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
End up in Eastern Europe and even there in a remote part of Slovakia

112
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Was able to

113
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,823
Stay strong out for upwards of five years and

114
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
Ended up back in grad school Toronto

115
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Studying psychology

116
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
And I dropped out

117
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
And that's when I really was like

118
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
You know descending in the talespin

119
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
Heading bottom and when I end up back in Montreal it was

120
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
To go to rehab

121
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
How do you know it's time to go read

122
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
I couldn't

123
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
I couldn't sustain it anymore

124
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
I couldn't

125
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Keep the

126
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
The Web of Lies

127
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Going

128
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Yeah there was this got a double life

129
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
I've been waiting

130
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
No no one really knew

131
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
That I was

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Heroin addict

133
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Your friends and family

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
I got my parents are

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Conservative Muslim

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Immigrants

137
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
But Progressive

138
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
As well as far as Pakistani immigrants go

139
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
But they thought I had the occasional

140
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
They didn't know the

141
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Send a ball

142
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
What's going on with me and when they found out

143
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
My mom went to bed

144
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Russian my brother wanted to kill me my dad

145
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Had a heart attack

146
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,727
I don't know if that the heart attack was directly related but I don't think it helped

147
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
It was bad it was a really bad time and so my mental state at

148
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
At the time was

149
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Was not good

150
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
I did go into a bit of a

151
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
Depression at that point I went I had to go to rehab twice

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
The first time it didn't stick and

153
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
Yeah like they found out that I was using again

154
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
And

155
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
It's the only time in my life that my mom's ever hit me

156
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
And at that point I remember that

157
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Was my bottom

158
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
So it's like early 94

159
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
On the waiting list to get into a treatment center

160
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
No friends no

161
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
I wasn't speaking much I was kind of you know kicking dope in my parents house on a waiting list to get a new treatment center like

162
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Life is not great at that point

163
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
How long does it take you before you

164
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
You started to assertive

165
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Feel like you

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Or regaining control over your life

167
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,879
Black I came out of the treatment center and I was so scared that I was

168
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
The relapse and it was just like I was going to meetings this going to

169
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
NA meetings at the time

170
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
Yeah they say you should go to 90 meetings in 90 days when

171
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
Stop drinking or doing drugs and and I was going like two meetings a day

172
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
I got my own little apartment in Montreal and was on welfare and I just

173
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,639
What are my bike from meeting to meeting all day everyday and it was during

174
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
That time that I actually started thinking

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
About

176
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
What I wanted to do with the rest of my life and

177
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
I had this idea that I wanted to work for a magazine

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
And you wanted to write about like what I like

179
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Like music

180
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Pop culture are like

181
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Like what will

182
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
I didn't get that far

183
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
Something I felt like

184
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
Talk about those things yes music culture

185
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
I felt like there was just

186
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
A lot happening that wasn't being talked about when I picked up magazine

187
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Depraved underground culture that that I was obsessed with was not being covered properly in the alt-weekly

188
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,063
What's it like a realistic possibility could you just go in and work for a magazine or or news

189
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
No I don't think so I had no experience doing with my only

190
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Writing that I've ever done was

191
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Academic

192
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,303
You're writing in University and when I was going to these meetings in Montreal

193
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Someone came up to me

194
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
An out-of-the-blue they started a conversation with me

195
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
And they said you have a sponsor I said no

196
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,591
And they said well I'll be your sponsor and I met some random dude who is a random dude

197
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Walked up to me yesterday Narcotics Anonymous

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
He was in the meeting with me the meeting ended and he came up to me

199
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
He said what are you what are you doing like are you working I said no I'm not working I can't even get a job volunteering anywhere ID

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Tried to volunteer at this place and they

201
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
She wouldn't let me

202
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Tend

203
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
Out of the blue he said have you ever thought about writing he didn't know me

204
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,423
I was like actually yeah and he's like well I know a place I'll take you there tomorrow

205
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,287
So he took me to this place these Haitians in Montreal who

206
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Had a a bilingual magazine going

207
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,967
Call damaj Intercultural that it was becoming French only and they want to start an English magazine

208
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
And he vouched on my behalf

209
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
This is the guy you want he's really good

210
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
He worked there before but he was like this

211
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,071
This is heaven-sent Angel who just was like

212
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,911
Put in my path and it opens up a whole conversation of

213
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,543
Do I believe in God do I believe in a higher power. I believe in Allah all this kind of stuff and

214
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,175
For me that whole story is like the proof of existence moment for me in my life

215
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
Something greater than me put me

216
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,831
There in this place where this guy just

217
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Walked up to me and shows me to talk to me

218
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,279
And happened to know a place that was looking for a guy to start an english-language magazine in Montreal

219
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
Exactly

220
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,007
So what was the magazine called

221
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
So I went in for this meeting and he vouched for me and said that he don't be long time that I was going to work really hard I did

222
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
Didn't have a lot of experience but that

223
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
He thought I could do this thing and day

224
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
They said okay and they gave me a desk a fax machine a phone and a computer

225
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
I started this process of

226
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
You know making a magazine

227
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Diamond

228
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Alright voice of Montreal

229
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
Is the name that I came up with at the time

230
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
And I had no idea what I was doing I just

231
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
But I knew it's a few people around town and

232
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,799
Started this kind of recruitment process of finding writers to write in the magazine and

233
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
And I remember walking down the street

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,479
Completely freaked out with a friend of mine and I was scared and because I didn't know what I was doing and he said

235
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
What have you got to lose

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
He said maybe it'll be

237
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
You know like one magazine that you make

238
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,999
Can you can go around and say hey I made this magazine and then you can apply for a job and get a job somewhere

239
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Or maybe it'll be huge

240
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
And like that conversation

241
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
On the street

242
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
That was

243
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
A huge mode for me because that gave me the kind of strength

244
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
To continue on when I was

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,615
Like overwhelmed could barely tie my shoes straight coming out of a treatment center like

246
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
It was a mess

247
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
And I owe him a lot because he

248
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Realize what he was doing at the time but he gave me this kind of

249
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Strength to

250
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Keep marching forward

251
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
So you get to the magazine what like what kind of

252
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Publication was it

253
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
It was a 16-page newsprint magazine

254
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
But you were like that that kind of a really like the

255
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Torpor stepchild

256
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
The two big all week

257
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Like you guys were totally

258
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
A joke compared

259
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
We were the laughing stock

260
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
Because it was a shrinking English Market okay

261
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
So it's you

262
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Mitchell bilingual City

263
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
So there were four

264
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
All weeklies already to French ones into English ones

265
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
And then we came on the scene in the English Market is actually shrinking

266
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
There wasn't enough

267
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
The advertising to sustain those to let alone the third one

268
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
It didn't make any

269
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Economic sense

270
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,119
Yeah but I really believe that there was an audience there for what we were talking about

271
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
So you guys were recovering like what like

272
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Episode of the alcoholic alternative scene in Montreal like skaters and

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Punk shows in hip hop

274
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Is music like Underground Music

275
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
And I wrote this

276
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Terrible editorial about

277
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,087
The search for authenticity and then heat for like quitting real content but

278
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
I stand by that editorial like

279
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
I hope you got nobody ever finds out and publishes again because it

280
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
It was awful but it is the spirit

281
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Of what we do today is

282
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,191
Was was there so you are like you are basically the editor-in-chief of this

283
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,519
Magazine in your early 20s voice Montreal

284
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,383
And like who did you hear some the people you brought in to help you start it and create it

285
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
You're one of my

286
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
Friends from college he connected me to a bunch of different artists and also two different writers in one of these writers

287
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
It was a guy named Gavin McInnes and he

288
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
It was funny and had a comic book called pervert

289
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
That's why I asked him to become my assistant editor

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,119
And I think is going to be my, excited or whatever that means

291
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
Micardis around town and put together a Comics page

292
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Count the public face of

293
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Advice I guess

294
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
How did he how did he get involved

295
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
So Shane and Gavin

296
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Grew up together in Ottawa

297
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
And

298
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
The first night we met he was just like he said literally said you're my new best friend what happened

299
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,231
On acid as well I should know I should qualify this right

300
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
He was in a bar called a bifteck

301
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,887
Gavin I had been driving around the city all day Distributing the magazine it'll just come out

302
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
And we finished our rounds and went to the bar to meet Shane and he was in there he's been waiting for a couple hours for us and

303
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
By himself somehow managed

304
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Epicurus psychedelics and was drunken

305
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Novice

306
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Of course you don't

307
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Sober

308
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,831
Tired and I walk him this a drunk man on psychedelics

309
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,647
Who is I call you from Pakistan you must love cricket and then was like

310
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Pretending to like bowl like balls at me

311
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
But he's worked for for Greenpeace before and he could actually sell

312
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
You know

313
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
With greenpeace usa

314
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Erase a lot of money for them and

315
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
Eastern Europe he was involved with some activities

316
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,455
Where he was making lots of money so he knew how to make money activities

317
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
Basin activities I'm going to leave it up. He was good at making money and you could

318
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Yo self

319
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Rattlesnake boots to Rattlesnake

320
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
And so then it was me Gavin and Shane working

321
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Amiss

322
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Office with the Haitians

323
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
We were there for like 3-4 months and

324
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
But it wasn't working out

325
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Because we weren't getting paid

326
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
Commissions on the ads that we were selling it at all

327
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
But we're on welfare

328
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
And so we talked about the vacations and said

329
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,295
You know it's it's time for us to delete even if we came up with this thing where

330
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
We said the Village Voice has a trademark on the word boys

331
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
And there are suing us and forcing us to change our name piss you guys were the voice of Montreal we told the world

332
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,631
That we were being sued by The Village Voice and that's why we had to change the name device

333
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,239
Basically made this thing up about the Village Voice to generate publicity

334
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Yeah

335
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,567
And it was a complete lie

336
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,455
That's why we dropped the O and then how we started Vice City basic created a new mag

337
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,087
We we created a new man

338
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,231
To find a new office or did you start working at your apartment or that's a good question we we got a new Loft

339
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
And like not too far from the original office

340
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
I brought five grand for my parents Davenport five grand from his parents and Shane got $5,000 worth of computer

341
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
From his dad is that working

342
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
No idea or something and

343
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
So it was with that

344
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
10000

345
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Dollars

346
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Canadian

347
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
That we started Vice

348
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Okay so this is now like

349
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Like I guess the mid-90s

350
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
And you guys

351
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Become vise

352
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
What was the magazine like at that point like at what did you cover

353
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
We really wanted to

354
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Again

355
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Such an over

356
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Use word guy but it's

357
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
It's a good one authenticity like how do you create

358
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Real content

359
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
And we're going to journalism School

360
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
So the way to do that is to get as close to the source as possible

361
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
And if we were going to write an article about

362
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
The prostitution

363
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Community in Montreal let's

364
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Get the prostitutes to write that story

365
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,463
Then let's go out with pimps as they drive around and interview them and so we created this

366
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
Really raw

367
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Magazine

368
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,863
There are a lot of typos but it was alive like I think the worst kind of jumped out

369
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
The pages and it was kind of shocking stuff and yeah

370
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
And we were so

371
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Without freedom of

372
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Depress

373
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,591
With such a big deal like we're so anti-censorship that even

374
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
If you

375
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,503
I'll be towards advertising if you buy that page of advertising you on that page you can do whatever you want with it

376
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
So we had these

377
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
Skateboard companies from Southern California that had like

378
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
Are pornstars in their ads

379
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Nude pornstars in the ad so the magazine all the sudden has

380
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
He's crazy articles with

381
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
Lots of nudity advertising

382
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
Skateboard companies called serial killer skateboards or whatever it was

383
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
This whole weird little

384
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Take on

385
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
American culture that was coming from Montreal so we were

386
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,175
Science magazine to San Francisco Chicago La New York and

387
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Americans reading it up

388
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,759
So you guys making money you like

389
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Pretty soon after

390
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Not sure where you pistol

391
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Bootstrapping it in

392
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Barely

393
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
We were bootstrapping it because we couldn't

394
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,975
Afford to have that we didn't we couldn't get a loan

395
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,815
So we just printed copies based on how much we were

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,119
Selling and advertising and

397
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
It's what we call this kind of

398
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
Punk rock capitalism just be really aggressive you really ambitious and you can't have that

399
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Those are the rules that we live by until we

400
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Tok our investment for the first time and that was when

401
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
That was an

402
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
98

403
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,111
When we sell 25% of the company took onion Richard sowinski he was like

404
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Some rich guy who

405
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,743
Just why to invest in magazine cuz it seems like kind of a crazy investor

406
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,095
So Shannon I'd realized at that point that we needed some help

407
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
If we want to grow the magazine

408
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
I'm like who Investments like maybe Larry Flynt wood and

409
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
There was a guy in Montreal named Richard sowinski who

410
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,711
Had a software company called discrete logic that he'd sold to Autodesk for several hundred billion dollars and

411
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
He was starting to buy a media properties

412
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
And we had been

413
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Interviewed by

414
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
The French daily and Montreal called The Press

415
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
And so we said

416
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,511
In that interview in the press that he was interested in buying us

417
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
And he done Reddit

418
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,655
And then it had his office contact us a few days later and said

419
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
He wants to meet you guys who are you guys

420
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,591
He has no idea who you are but apparently he's interested in buying a so we met him

421
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,943
And individual very quickly to sell 25% of the company to him

422
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
Crazy amount of money for you guys at the time

423
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Raise ya

424
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,487
This could have happened in Montreal there was no due diligence I took place it was literally one meeting with him

425
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
At a restaurant that he

426
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,887
He loved and so he bought it and moved it into the basement of his office

427
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
And he

428
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
Brought a bottle of Jack Daniels and kind of for Shane to drink a bunch of it

429
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
And that the end of the meeting said I want to

430
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,151
To buy piece of your magazine come back to me in a week and tell me how much

431
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,455
And and don't try and gouge me

432
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,807
And so we we left his office and spend a week going like how much

433
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
Do we value our company for like it

434
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
I was kind of arbitrary pulled it from the air

435
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah we pulled it from the air and came up with this number somehow justify that it was a million bucks

436
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
And he read it

437
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
What is all in one piece paper to

438
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
The price of ice

439
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
She right at me said

440
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
That's a lot of money and then he signed it

441
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
And a Whiskas upstairs and they wrote us checks

442
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
And I think his

443
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
Advisors like this is such a bad idea

444
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:33,503
This shouldn't be happening but again no due diligence no like accounting nothing

445
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:38,111
And his office was actually walking distance from our office and we went out it was

446
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,999
Springtime in Montreal we literally did somersaults in the grass when we left 50,000

447
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,327
So with that money we were able to

448
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Scale magazine

449
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
We're able to move to New York

450
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919

00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
And a dream to become much

524
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Speaker

525
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
We always had aspirations to

526
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
Talk about the world and other things

527
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
As well and we

528
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,592
It started building up a stable of writers that was International

529
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
But we had a ceiling

530
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
Becoming National in Canada

531
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Wasn't good enough for us

532
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
We aspired for more

533
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
And we thought okay we have to go don't know if we want to become

534
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Bigger

535
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
We need to go to

536
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,232
Either New York or London or LA

537
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Want you to say

538
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
To do with the money

539
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
He had this vision

540
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
So we had

541
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,960
Vice and then he had a magazine called shift which was like a spin meets wired kind of

542
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,824
Magazine for slightly older crowd and then he had another company called Halo 46 which was

543
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
Travel luxury goods high-end brand

544
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
And he wanted all three of these brands

545
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
To diversify and become multichannel brands

546
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
That was going to be tied into a big e-commerce platform

547
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
And he's going to take it all public

548
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
And so that's what we did with the money we

549
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,560
We build a fashion division the film division the TV division of Music division

550
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
You should have a brick-and-mortar

551
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Presents for your

552
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:39,008
Fashion Division and huge fish and that you guys weren't even

553
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Thinking about like you were you were thinking we're just two

554
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
He's kind of ahead of the Curve

555
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,760
It's kind of like an Amazon kind of thing and like we came in and we actually

556
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,600
Executed his business plan and like you actually started a fashion label

557
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah and we

558
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,976
We had four four clothing store like you got designers to make like Vice

559
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Fashion

560
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah but we also sold a lot of thought we were advertising the magazine we sold their clothes

561
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:12,800
That we we realized by doing it that we don't want to sell pants for a living that we're better at making content

562
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
That's really what we want to do but it's service

563
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Its purpose at the time

564
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
Seems like really

565
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Like trying to move no

566
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Very quickly

567
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
So when's he kind of

568
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
Run out of money in

569
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Retreated to Nantucket

570
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
And this is when the butler.com Bible verse

571
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,768
So what were they leave you guys

572
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
It left us

573
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
You know

574
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Kind ride bike stores in New York

575
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
You in office space

576
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
In Manhattan

577
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
End

578
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
You had employees

579
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
And you

580
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
I'd no money

581
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
100

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
It was bad

583
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Is it was bad time

584
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
So what happened to sew ins

585
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,808
We found out that Richard was in Nantucket at his house and so we rented a car and drove up there

586
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
We took the ferry over and

587
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Calling from a payphone

588
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Can you pick this up

589
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
And was very surprised that we were there we had met any contact with him for like a month or something like that was coming

590
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Russia running out of money

591
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Yeah

592
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
So we went to his house or like what's going on you said

593
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
It's over the money's gone

594
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
I'm done

595
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
I can't put any more money into this

596
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
So

597
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
What are we doing so

598
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
Then we came back and that's when we move to Brooklyn

599
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,624
He left his office I unscrewed the mirrors out of the bathroom and took

600
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,208
The plants in the desks and filing cabinets that we still have

601
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,072
I'm still using the same filing cabinet that I stole from that office on 27th Street

602
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
It all happened so quickly we

603
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
And we sold more equity

604
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,472
Saul Alinsky so you ended up taking over

605
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:51,104
Control of the whole company at that point before the company basically fell apart

606
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
He

607
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,456
He bought the entire company from you

608
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Stock trading

609
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,320
Our shares for his company which was called normal net

610
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,952
And the like you're worth 44 million dollars now so we went from being on welfare to theoretically being

611
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Worth 40 million bucks

612
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
In a very short amount of time

613
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
2

614
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,192
It just all collapsing and being broke again and all the sudden we have these doors and we have Dad

615
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
For the first time

616
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,056
Is olinsky still own completely owns the brand of that point

617
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah and then we bought it back from him

618
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
How did you do that

619
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Verb

620
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
Pennies on the dollar exchange at a deal and

621
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
You know he

622
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Was

623
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Nice to us in a way like

624
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Even though

625
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
He put us out of business but he was

626
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
He he agreed to sell

627
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:44,096
The company back to us we did a deal with him I can't remember exactly how much but for

628
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
4 and we got a deal to buy the

629
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Pax weed

630
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Dollar Equity Bank

631
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,104
How how are you able to raise the money to buy them out

632
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
I borrowed money from my brother

633
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
Well we'll have to borrow the money

634
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
So you guys buy the buy back to company

635
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
It's yours again

636
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Essential you got to completely rebuild it

637
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
So what did you do did you like

638
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
You got these the shops you got

639
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
The film division in this division

640
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
E-commerce

641
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
What do you do

642
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
We went back to doing things how

643
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
We had originally done.

644
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Which is weekend

645
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
And we owed all this money to these

646
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,312
Italian like fashion companies who are manufacturing our clothes and Shane went into

647
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Took meetings with all of them

648
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
And figured out how to

649
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Reduce the debt

650
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
So he's like what I know you want 200000

651
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
I've got 20

652
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
Take it or leave it sue me or take the 20 grand

653
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,904
And that's how we worked our way out of gas at that time and we just

654
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
Went back to eating beans and rebuilding

655
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
And doing things

656
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
How we'd always done them before we

657
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Tok investment

658
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
And so that was

659
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
You know like

660
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,984
I really valuable lesson and

661
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
Being able to buy the company back

662
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
And

663
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Have a second chance

664
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Was

665
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Was huge

666
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
Aren't you in the in the midst of all this year you were still putting out

667
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
The magazine

668
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah the magazine was hot

669
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
They were still doing well like from a

670
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Cultural level

671
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,328
Maybe not making a lot of money it was

672
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Profitable because

673
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
It had to be

674
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,704
We weren't paying people much money and

675
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
We

676
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,824
Weren't Distributing millions and millions of copies but it was getting out there and it was make

677
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Making an impact

678
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,688
And getting some recognition and you're still mainly covering like Counter Culture

679
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Yeah

680
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
But when occasionally we would have photojournalists

681
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
That would come in who had been in Afghanistan

682
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Or

683
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,184
Jamaica and done something with like

684
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
You know

685
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
Gangsters in Jamaica and we would

686
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,096
Run their photos like we tried but we didn't have the resources

687
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
We didn't have

688
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Annette worth we weren't

689
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Doing reporting

690
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
In the traditional sense

691
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
At all

692
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,080
It was a Culture magazine that occasionally

693
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Did some kind of

694
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Music photojournalism

695
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
If it was gritty and raw

696
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
But in 2006

697
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
That was when everything

698
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,856
Changed for us when we picked up cameras

699
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
Video camera

700
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Yeah

701
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:21,280
We took a meeting with MTV and they said if we gave you money to make a DVD what would you do

702
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
And we said it would be

703
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Play jackass meet 60-minute

704
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,216
And that work we were speaking their language you know and

705
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,312
So they gave us money to make a DVD so we said okay let's go make the travel

706
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
The vice guide to travel DVD

707
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
I said where did you go

708
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
I went to Pakistan

709
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
We found in this area 3 years ago

710
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,528
We wanted is the massive illegal arms Market

711
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
Believed to be a source of weapons with Delavan

712
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,392
We just got to recreated what we done in the magazine

713
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,256
Is this loaded

714
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
But it was

715
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
First time we were

716
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
Telling stories in a different medium

717
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
And it was like a eight-minute segment

718
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
We started on this DVD

719
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
That

720
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
Segment eventually ended up on the homepage of

721
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
See you then

722
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
And

723
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
They treated as news

724
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
The co-founder of Vice

725
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,528
Took a trip to the country's most volatile City

726
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Karachi

727
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
It's crazy it to think about it

728
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Right because

729
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
If you if you go back to the early 2000s

730
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,840
There were a lot of really cool magazines and there are a lot of really cool

731
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
Like seeing people doing cool stuff

732
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
And

733
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
But for some reason you guys

734
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Made it act like why do you think

735
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
That is how was it that Vice

736
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,176
Became vice and those other Maga

737
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
We refused to die

738
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,320
Again we're survivors right and we always

739
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Find a way

740
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Do a deal even when

741
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
Times where it where dark and it was hard

742
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
And we found a way

743
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
And we Diversified

744
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
The right time so we would have

745
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
Some other deal

746
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
That would

747
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
Keep the lights on

748
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
While

749
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,312
The magazine is going through a downturn and we're having a hard time selling ads

750
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,640
Don't do a big deal with with Viacom that will

751
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
Keep us going for another eight months

752
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
You know and then

753
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Do a deal with

754
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
No private Equity Firm and get some money from there

755
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,672
And it's all about it is crazy that all those magazines are gone

756
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
For the most part and they were also

757
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Big

758
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,096
And we were like the stepchildren

759
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
And they disappeared

760
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,568
How do you feel when people say that biases

761
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Is

762
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,640
Like self-indulgent you know and it's all about the

763
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Reporter

764
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
And it's not really news

765
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,552
Because I can give you a her that right and you you hear that from mainstream news organization

766
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
Sure so how do you feel that I need to you to

767
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Defensive juice ignore it or

768
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Maybe they're right

769
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
And we ignore it for the most part

770
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
I think.

771
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
Often wrong or their they're basing it on one thing that we did way back in the day whatever

772
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
But I do believe

773
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
Strongly and how we create our content

774
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
And the importance of

775
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
Having a point of view and and subjectivity

776
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Yes we didn't go to journalism School

777
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,552
But I think that there is

778
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
A place for

779
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
The type of content that we're making

780
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
We're winning

781
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Peabody awards

782
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
You know for all the people that are taking shots of the real something

783
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Those accusations are coming from a place

784
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
People feeling threatened

785
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
As well

786
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
You know

787
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,032
Wild Al Jazeera America shutting down and in that kind of thing

788
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,616
Horseweed we have me Compton that isn't

789
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,736
Great that isn't perfect there are mistakes for learning we're going to school in public

790
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
You know in an in

791
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
And when I do think there's a lot that

792
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,440
They teach in journalism school that we've tried to incorporate into the content we make

793
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
2

794
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Be accountable

795
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Yeah

796
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,816
Have there ever been stories that you guys have done that

797
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
But you will

798
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Yeah

799
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,360
Can you talk about them without fear of being sued or

800
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,200
No I mean like that there's there's the one that the McAfee

801
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Story I don't know if you remember that one the guy who did the

802
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:34,976
On the run from the police couple years ago exactly where we kind of embedded with him and and

803
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
Released a photo where we didn't

804
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
Scrub the

805
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
Geotag from it so people

806
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
We basically exposed exactly where

807
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
He was when he was on the run which we obviously weren't trying to do and everybody celebrated that mistake

808
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,456
Everybody been all of the competition in in the other

809
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Your news organizations

810
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
The

811
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Novi Southern China

812
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,392
Do this reporting in and they're making rookie mistakes

813
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,232
So that was you know learning a lesson and in public the hard way

814
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
But for the most part

815
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
You know I don't have a lot of

816
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Regrets about

817
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
Did the content that we

818
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,216
Make and have made visits got us to this point

819
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,312
Today over time you guys have attracted a lot of investment

820
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
And today

821
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Spices value it over for

822
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Billion

823
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Dollars

824
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
You started this like

825
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,672
English language version of a Haitian Fresh Magazine in 1994

826
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
Like how crazy is that

827
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,304
I mean it takes me back to that time on the street where my buddy said to me he said

828
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,888
Maybe you'll make one copy of the magazine or maybe it'll be huge

829
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,704
One day and in my gut at that time

830
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
I felt like a

831
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Maybe this could be huge

832
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
I couldn't

833
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,872
Define and I didn't know that this is how it was going to manifest itself in that

834
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
We would employ

835
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
New two thousand people in

836
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
And be valued it over

837
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
4 billion dollars but yeah

838
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
