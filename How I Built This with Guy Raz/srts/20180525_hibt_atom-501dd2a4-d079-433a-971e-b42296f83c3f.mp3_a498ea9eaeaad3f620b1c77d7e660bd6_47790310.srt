About a year ago

Troy Carter

And I hope you enjoy it

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
So what happened to the business

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
It was over and I didn't have the cash flow and the phone started ringing and it

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
Was the landlord of that building saying you know what rent hasn't been paid you know all of my vendors you know

20
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
Started calling me my house was under foreclosure and my wife

21
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,912
And my mother-in-law ended up pawning their wedding rings that you know that that's the save the house

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
You know I'm with me at you know I never could you know considered suicide but I know why people

23
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,432
Will do

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
From NPR how I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories

25
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Lego

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
How Troy Carter went from the rough streets of West Philly to launching the career of one

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
One of the biggest pop stars in the world

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Lady Gaga

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Usually takes

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Sev bit of instinct

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,112
Sim failure and a lot of luck to figure out what customers are going to want to buy

32
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Seth Goldman

33
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,696
He figured a lot of people would want a

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
Barely sweetened iced tea

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
And with honesty

36
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
He turned out to be right

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Herb Kelleher

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
I thought people wanted cheap flights with no frills

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Well

40
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
We got Southwest

41
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Preferred Troy Carter

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
It wasn't just that

43
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
He thought Lady Gaga would be huge

44
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
It's that he had no choice

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Because

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
At the time he met her

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
This is just 10 years ago

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
He had lost

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
All of his money he was totally broke

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
But somehow over the next few years

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
Troy essentially built a company

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Youku

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Call it

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Lady Gaga

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
A sprawling Empire of writers dancers choreographers costume artists Roadies music

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,752
Producers Engineers marketers publicist

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
You get the idea

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
And Troy-Bilt that without

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
Any family connections or money or

60
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Formal training in fact

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Much to his mother's disappointment

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
Troy dropped out of his high school in West Philadelphia in 1990

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
To pursue a dream

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
That dream was to become a rapper

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
We had this idea that we were going to be this rap

66
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
You know call to too many and it was me and two of my best friend

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
We called ourselves

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
2 to many because it was

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
We only had enough money for one of us

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
So it was always two too many of us

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
And my best friend said If We Ever Meet Will Smith Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince they're going to give us a record deal

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
So that we had the soul focus and Soul Purpose meeting Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Are the guys from Philadelphia

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
They were the only guys in Philadelphia they weren't they were from our neighborhood

75
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
They were successful they were like gods in Philly

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
And they were they were too way out

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
That was plant that was plan a b and c

78
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
So did you

79
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
Yes we we actually hop the

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Train

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
And you know we don't have money so we just went in a wait for the

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,176
The train to pull up and jump over the turnstile and

83
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
The train down the Delaware Avenue

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
And we knew Jazzy Jeff had a record

85
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
Studio there and we just wait outside

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Recording studio

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Nothing we did that for almost

88
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,000
Six months and Jeff used to see us outside but would never let us end.

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
I think he thought we were like stalkers or something

90
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
And then one day we saw some friends

91
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
In the studio that let us in

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Will Smith in

93
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
That just happened to be in a

94
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Studio n

95
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
We walked in and

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
We played our demo

97
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
And he listened to it right then and there

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
He listened to

99
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
And

100
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
We actually went outside it was snowing

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,551
And we said well we want you to see how to dance to so we actually

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
He started dancing in the snow

103
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
I think

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
And we quickly found out we

105
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Suck but you know

106
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
Well saw some potential in US

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Antioch

108
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
He said look how you know how you guys

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Getting home then

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
We said we don't know

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
And he

112
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Drobots home at night

113
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
And basically told our parents

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
It's that you know

115
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
He had discovered we

116
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
We were going to be okay

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
And what was it was a track you play for

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Did you remember how close

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Oh my

120
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
God it was

121
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Pretty terrible

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
You have to give it some of it

123
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
It was a song called where's the party at 1

124
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
I'm not telling you that actually I shouldn't even said the name because you're going to

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Google Now

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
I know you are

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
Girls that so bad

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
We thought it was really good will thought I had some potential we put it out and it went doublewood

129
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Cmake no money

130
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
We may 00 money

131
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
I probably still Will Smith money for that

132
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,303
That you establish a relationship with Will Smith which was kind of a big deal

133
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
Yes and you know what and will has a partner stilted

134
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
It is very day name

135
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
James Lassiter

136
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
You know he was in the studio that day we played the demo.

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
And

138
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
He was Jazzy Jeff

139
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
And fresh Prince's manager

140
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
He actually got the

141
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,735
The job is their manager because he was the only guy in our neighborhood with a

142
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
The car

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
And James had become

144
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
This sort of

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
Mogul in the industry

146
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
And

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
I wanted to be jeans

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
So in my soul

149
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
I wanted to be less

150
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Fresh Prince

151
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,679
Amore Jean so I just kind of put myself under James

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
And James became a teacher

153
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
CCU

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Basically move away from

155
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Being a performer that

156
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Appointment Etta James give you a job

157
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,735
Yes James gave me a job I had a few jobs with an account but I was James's assistant I was

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Was Jazzy Jeff

159
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Assistance

160
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855
I ended up moving out to LA

161
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,975
And working with working with James at his production company what will how old are you by the way

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,863
I was in my late teens or early twenties done some sort of that transition.

163
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Right

164
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
And

165
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
I was working at will and James

166
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
This production company

167
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
And I was having the time of my life and I'm very hard headed thought I knew everything

168
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
And I didn't have a car I thought it was going to be like Philly where you just can take the train everywhere

169
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
And in La everything so separated

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
And I was taking this car service

171
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
From the office

172
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,463
To visit this girl probably two or three times a week or whatever but I would

173
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Pay

174
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
The bill at the every two weeks when I got my check

175
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
I would pay like the office managers they hate a Bills going to come in

176
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
I got you covered or whatever

177
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,055
And one time I think I pissed the office manager off over something

178
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
And she told James that I have been using this car service

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
The visit this girl

180
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
And James came in and fired me and sent me back the

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
The Philly on the spot that was it you were done

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,671
Done James basically you know he saw the route that I was going and I was taking a lot of shortcuts

183
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,303
And I was kind of living this La fastlife in sort of the stereotypical

184
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Fake executive

185
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,191
You know I thought I thought I was much bigger than what I was at that particular time

186
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
He kicked me out of LA

187
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Like you said go but you're going back home

188
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
So

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
Like you're in your early 20s

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
You lose your job and you go back to Philly

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah I went back I went back to Philly soda with my tail between my legs

192
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Am I cousins in Philly

193
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,695
LeapPad started a small management company as sort of a

194
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Production company

195
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
That they asked me to come in and run and wanted to clients with a girl that I met when she was 16.

196
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Sushi and I known each other

197
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
And we started working together and and it was the rapper Eve

198
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
I had absolutely no clue

199
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
What I was doing

200
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
And you know it started off you don't even come to me and she

201
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
She said luck you know I need your help and you know it

202
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
I'm figuring this out

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,231
And at first I was kind of helping her find a manager

204
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Finally she said look I want you to do it

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
And and of course I said yes and jumped at the Opera

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Opportunity

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
And

208
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
I think initially the job was

209
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Protecting my friend

210
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
So instinctively

211
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,871
The decisions that I was making was really about

212
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
How do I protect her and make sure that you know she has the best

213
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Possible chance to make it

214
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,087
And everything else was you know learning as I was going along

215
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
And you know I remember the first

216
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
Tore that we went on with this cash money Ruff Ryders

217
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Store

218
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
I got on the bus

219
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
This old bus driver

220
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,863
And you know scruffy beard and he said

221
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
You got the flu

222
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
I said I'll be right back

223
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
And I you know I got off the bus and I called one of my buddies who is done touring for a long time

224
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Blessed dude

225
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Float

226
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
And he said

227
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
The money that you

228
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
You give the bus driver for gas

229
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Kohl's

230
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Fuel you know everything else or whatever

231
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,879
So I got back on the bus and gave him the money and he knows

232
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
But here's the float

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
Anna and I sort of floated my way through the resta

234
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,863
For the next three years I got a float at my way through kind of figuring it out as I was

235
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
Was going along do you have to do

236
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
As a manager for

237
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Book shows in Ensley how did you even know how to

238
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
How to do that or how to promote

239
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Herbrand and had to get her out and

240
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
The world you know what the the way it works

241
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Is

242
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,319
The manager sort of you know it's like the Hub

243
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Of an artist

244
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
So you know I go out and I hired a booking agent

245
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Who books the show

246
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
I hired a publicist who

247
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
Who who who does interviews and television

248
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
I bringing the record label

249
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Beats the music

250
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
So sort of like you know

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
CEO of

252
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
You think of her of her business

253
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
And that

254
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
That became a pretty big business

255
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Yes she she actually became

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
One of the biggest

257
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Female hip-hop stars

258
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Of all time

259
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,815
And you know I was lucky enough to have the The Fresh Prince bloopers

260
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
Breadsoda kind of understand

261
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
That a rapper could Duty

262
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,775
TV in a wrapper could do you know things outside of their Core Business

263
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,615
And Woody we ended up building you know a clothing line

264
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
A television show she

265
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Calgon on the dude you know

266
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Barbershop you-know-what with

267
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Ice

268
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Cuban and

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Cedric the Entertainer

270
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
So we ended up building something

271
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,207
Really special in something unique for a female rapper at that

272
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
How did you know what

273
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,143
I mean negotiating is really really really hard

274
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Work right

275
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
And you are so inexperienced

276
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
A time like

277
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
How did you know

278
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
What's a ghost

279
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
You know what I think a lot of it is you know

280
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Is is West Philly Spidey

281
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
You know so when you have to

282
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Negotiate for survival

283
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
And you have to know how to read runes

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,207
And you have to know who the bad guys in the rooms are who has the gun in their pocket

285
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,815
Who's jet who's just going to brandish it and who's going to who's going to actually pull the trigger

286
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,935
So I think that's just a natural instinct that comes with

287
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
Coming from where where I come from

288
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
So

289
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:33,919
Being able to take that tool into negotiations are on reading people and I'm reading rooms and reading Circle

290
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Stances

291
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
I think it's

292
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Very very important

293
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
And then also knowing

294
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,623
What's important for that person on the other side of the

295
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Cable

296
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
And what's important for

297
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
The client

298
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
And a lot of time is not conflicting till so both sides can kind of get what they want out of

299
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
So I mean personally this point in your life you're still

300
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,055
Really young guy like you're thinking I'm set I am

301
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
This is all like

302
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
This is all

303
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
Unfolding exactly as I had hoped

304
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah you know I was

305
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,391
I was on cloud nine because you know this is everything that I've ever dreamed

306
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,487
That's all I ever wanted to do in my in my life with with music

307
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
And because I was a failed artist

308
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
I was actually able to help

309
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Somebody account

310
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
Was their dream was you know definitely fulfilling

311
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,287
And then the trappings that came along with it as a young guy

312
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
I was I was loving it

313
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Are you making money

314
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
I was making Hood money

315
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
So I was like I was ghetto Rich at that particular time

316
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Have you had enough

317
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,903
The nicer house out of the 40 row homes on that side of the

318
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,487
Mistreat you were doing okay but by no means was I

319
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Was I rich

320
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
You know

321
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
My goal was to make $1,000 a week

322
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
If I can make $1,000 a week.

323
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
Was it for me I was set that was my that was my goal

324
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
What was the name of your company by the way it was called Irving wondering what

325
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
And I and I did it out of Philly

326
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
For five years and then I sold that come

327
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Company in an 2004

328
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
You sold it to another management company

329
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,623
Yes it was a big company in the UK called The Sanctuary group

330
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
And I'm so I sold it

331
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
To the sanctuary group and then move to LA to help them open

332
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Why did you sell the your master

333
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
The real reason was

334
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
At that particular time it was

335
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
The largest liquidity event that I would have experienced it was a lot of money basic

336
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Live in Czech

337
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
The check

338
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,759
You know walking around venues with you know a backpack full of cash from venue to venue

339
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
So you know it was an it was a complete lack of

340
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Vacationing in the way we

341
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Operated the business

342
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
And then

343
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
The guys from Sanctuary you know they were managing guns and roses and you know bunch of

344
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Huge Rock axe

345
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,447
And it just done a deal with Matthew Knowles who was who's Beyonce's Dad

346
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
And bought his company

347
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
And he approached me and said luck this company can help you

348
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
To scale your business

349
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
They can help you

350
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Grow your business you know in a way that you

351
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
You can't grow it internationally

352
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
And you know

353
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
You don't have to live check to check you have a young family

354
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,415
And he said look this is going to take you to the next level and I and I ended up doing

355
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
What is a pea

356
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
I can't tell you

357
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
NBA long expired I ever made

358
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
I'll tell you it was a it was a

359
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Dad it was a 2 million dollar check

360
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Actually

361
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
The actual number was to

362
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
2 million

363
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,711
Buy $275,000 with the actual number

364
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,063
Because I remember when the wire when a wire went through

365
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,159
I called and checked the automated bank machine

366
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
About 10 times to make sure that the money was

367
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Still there

368
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Because I never I never had $1000000 them in my in my bank account before I never had

369
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Even close to it

370
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
And you know in in the bank at one time

371
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,359
And here it was now it's like okay you know what it's

372
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
This is this is very real

373
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
And I just

374
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Yeah it was very real

375
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
What was it like working working for sanctuary

376
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
I hated

377
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,487
I hated it when you know it was it was fantastic at first

378
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
And

379
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Because

380
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,119
I was so excited to let you know to get the check I can

381
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
Completely overlooked all of the red flags what were they

382
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,591
You know what it just was certain things and certain behaviors that showed up during that period

383
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
That I chose to ignore

384
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
Because I I I said I'm just going to take the check

385
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,039
And I'll and I'll deal with that and maybe he isn't such a bad guy

386
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Maybe don't

387
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,671
Maybe they are ethical underneath some of the things that was happening

388
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
During the negotiations

389
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
So

390
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Coming in

391
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
I just

392
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Didn't do

393
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
The diligence on them that they were doing on me

394
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
So how long did you last there

395
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
You know what

396
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Probably I remember waking up

397
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
And

398
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
Talking to my wife a couple times

399
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
About buying a

400
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Because

401
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
I'm talking about you know me Growing Up Loving music worship and you know Berry Gordy

402
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
All of these guys in like this is my

403
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Dream and I didn't

404
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Have a plan B in this is all I wanted to do

405
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
And I was dreading getting up

406
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
In the morning going to the

407
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Like I had knots in my

408
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Going in and I were going to the office

409
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
And I will pull my shades

410
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
That we had glass off

411
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
And I will pull my shades

412
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
It's down because I didn't want to work with

413
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
In about

414
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
2 years in a year-and-a-half

415
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,991
And you were managing you are still managing even

416
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Yes I was managing the

417
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
Now when you lost Sanctuary Sanctuary you are still

418
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Pretty much financial aid

419
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Security

420
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Yeah I thought I was

421
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
Invested

422
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
A lot of money back into the business into this new business

423
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,703
Did the new business that you started after you left Sanctuary after I left Sanctuary so

424
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
One of the things I realize was $2000000 isn't actually $2000000

425
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
You buy a house you paid

426
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
You know you paid taxes

427
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
You buy a couple new cars

428
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
And it's gone it's gone I invested in and I invested in this new business

429
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Anna

430
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
He was going with me so I said you know what

431
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
I know exactly what we're doing

432
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
This is going to the next level

433
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Did a build-out annie's beautiful offices

434
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Design on Wilshire Boulevard

435
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,191
And and started this new this new business

436
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
What happened

437
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Are you not even walked in one day you're not

438
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Maybe I'll

439
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Probably about

440
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Your

441
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
Maybe a year or two into the into the new business

442
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
But she came into my office you know she sat down on the couch and she

443
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
She said I think I want to go

444
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
In another Direction

445
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
And I said what what do you mean

446
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
So well

447
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
I think I'm going to find

448
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
New manager

449
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
I said wow

450
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Why

451
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
This is why I think

452
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
I want to go to the next level and

453
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
I want to go with a manager who I think

454
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Could get me to the next level

455
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
That's it why are you thinking about anybody's

456
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Specifically

457
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
She said yeah

458
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Yeah I'm thinking about

459
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
This guy shot cam

460
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Mentor and good friend

461
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
So

462
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
She ended up siding with one of my good friend

463
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
For management

464
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
And I mean she was like your

465
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,839
She was your ticket to making that new business

466
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Successful so

467
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,935
But even even more she wasn't even she was my

468
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Friend

469
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:58,591
And we know really close you know she was there through you know girlfriend and through my wedding

470
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Little peanut birthday

471
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Getting a Mac

472
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Kids in

473
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
It was a heartbreak you know number number one

474
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,063
Tom in terms of how it how it ended up happening

475
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,647
You know and then the business what was Haile head

476
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,047
On that success what you know of her you know it was a single client business pretty much

477
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
So what happened to business

478
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
It was over

479
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,983
This was you know this kind of bleeds into a you know going into

480
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
Probably 2007

481
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
When

482
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
You know I didn't have the cash flow

483
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,199
And a phone started ringing and it was the

484
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Landlord of that building saying you know at rent hasn't been paid no all of my vendors you know started calling me

485
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
And then it kind of spilled into home my

486
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
House

487
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Was under foreclosure

488
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,583
And my wife and my mother-in-law

489
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
Ended up pawning their wedding rings

490
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
You know that that's the

491
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
To save the house

492
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Uni

493
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,287
And even down there that you know the kids were in privates

494
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
School in

495
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Having to to tell you no

496
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663

497
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Asking them to you know could you

Super humblin

Not not just as an entrepreneur but as a dad and you know in having a live through

508

That really

510
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
Dark dark dark.

511
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
And Hip-Hop is a very small community

512
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
And it will you know

513
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,368
We had a couple of buddies who were like you know real Executives in our business

And you know I'm with me at you know I never could you know considered suicide but I know why people do

518
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Obviously you had

519
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Already demonstrated some

520
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Talent by managing

521
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Eve and buy

522
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
All the promotional work

523
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
You died

524
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,624
But in your mind did you swear you able to save yourself okay I'm talented I'm going to pull out of this

525
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
Were the moments where you just.

526
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
I'm doomed

527
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
I am not

528
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Going to get out of this

529
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Now you know what it is

530
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
You can't fall off the

531
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,168
And I was on the floor no nowhere to go right

532
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
And

533
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Mom mom

534
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
You know she was a single mom

535
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
We grew up

536
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
We're a lot of times we had the

537
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
Choose between

538
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
Weather we going to have a phone line in the house

539
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Or electricity

540
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,296
And I remember us being on the bed with a penny Bank

541
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
And it was a bronze penny Bank shaped like a

542
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
A pig

543
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
And she was stick a butter knife

544
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Into the slot

545
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
To get the coins to come out

546
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
And we would divide the

547
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
The coins up

548
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
To get that you know

549
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,096
So me and my brother

550
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
We have bus fare to get the

551
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
The school

552
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
So we grew up

553
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
My mom caught the bus everyday

554
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
To go to work and walk

555
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Sometimes 4:30

556
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Years straight

557
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,712
So my mom's work ethic

558
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
And spirit

559
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
In My DNA

560
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
And I was always working

561
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672

562
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Make my mom and my grandmother proud

563
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
That was always a big thing for me

564
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872

Having somebody who has your back knowing you got somebody who has your back like that

568
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
The big deal

569
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

626
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Gyros

627
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Troy Carter is

628
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Probably a few lowest

629
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Point in his life

630
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Houses in foreclosure

631
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Is businesses

632
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Falling apart and

633
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
But around this time

634
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,312
Introduced to a young singer and piano player who

635
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Calls herself

636
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Lady Gaga

637
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Did you know

638
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
This is going to be huge

639
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Yeah you know what you

640
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
The real answer is you don't know

641
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
You think

642
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
And you hope

643
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
But you don't know

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Whip people see now

645
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,792
Is what she was you know except for his you know she was a brunette

646
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
Nnc

647
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,656
She didn't dance at that particular time you know she was behind the piano

648
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Actually Ellie Reed

649
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
Dunya show

650
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,288
I just dropped from Def Jam

651
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,104
But you know what she in all fairness to LA

652
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Cheat she was a piano singer

653
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Yeah

654
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
And she going to West Virginia

655
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Cried on her grandmother's couch afterwards because

656
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,928
Her dad gave her a year off from school and basically said you got one year

657
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,744
To figure this out or you need to go back to NYU

658
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
So she thought her dreams were shattered

659
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,680
I think it was that sort of thing you can't fall off the floor and so you know she had the spirit

660
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
And her that

661
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
You know when you feel that sort of pain

662
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,336
You never want to feel it again so she was a

663
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Incredibly hard

664
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Worker

665
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
So she just worked hard everyday to get better and better

666
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
So what did you guys start

667
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
To do I mean how did

668
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
When you are almost

669
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Bankrupt basic

670
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Financial your bankrupt

671
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,440
And she's like oh please can you manage mean you're like

672
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Yeah sure okay

673
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
You know we made music

674
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,912
That that was the big thing like Vince Vince was incredibly talented at

675
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
You know helping her shape the sound

676
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
I knew

677
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,152
How to work with with female artist you know I knew about the fashion business from working with Eve

678
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,504
You know got signed to Interscope which was the same label that he was on

679
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
So I had a great rapport with the with the label already

680
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
So it was it was

681
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,952
Very it's all natural kind of navigating it

682
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
And we don't

683
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
I think we worked in a music for almost

684
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
9 or 10 months

685
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
And then we took it to

686
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,984
The record label in the record label said all those songs are great

687
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
Let's give this to the Pussycat Dolls let's give this to Britney Spears so she ended up becoming a great songwriter

688
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
And

689
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
A few of the songs we

690
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
We actually fought for it and we said we just not giving these records up

691
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
And we went out and we took those songs the radio

692
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,904
And it was a disaster

693
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,976
The radio wouldn't play it

694
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
It was the song Just Dance nobody would play that song

695
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,776
Nobody would play it

696
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
Build her career what did you do

697
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
We you know what it's

698
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
We ended up

699
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
This is as Facebook and

700
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Twitter

701
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:46,624
And Myspace and YouTube all of those platforms were starting to

702
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
Just emerged as places where you can reach audience

703
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
What is directly

704
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,048
And we started using the platform they were free

705
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
Where we got lucky

706
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Is that a lot of them were global

707
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
They were in markets outside of outside of the US

708
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
So we started reaching audiences and places where we we didn't travel Geographic

709
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
What you just liked post

710
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712

The art clips of her and her dancer

720
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,360
Her and you know but we will have the better music underneath and it was

721
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Super artistic

722
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
And you know she was brilliant and in a one of them

723
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
First

Music voices who who really knew how to use and levirate social

725
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
And it really work so we started building you sort of underground followings throughout the world but it wasn't

726
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Big it was

727
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,608
75 to a hundred people in clubs that we will play

728
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
But we we super serve that community

729
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
Because just a

730
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Few years or year-and-a-half

731
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Before that you're in a

00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,000
Start started over and over

739
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
And also you know this was newt

740
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
For me because this was

741
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Pop music

742
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
Totally different front from Hip Hop

743
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
It was it was it was a difference

744
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,032
Skillset and so-so really start starting over

745
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
How are you able to even

746
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Fund

747
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Like the videos

748
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Heart or like

749
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920
You didn't have any money

750
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
The time so how are you able to do it

751
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Interscope Records

752
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
Ososo Interscope stepped up

753
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
Nna funded a bit

754
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,464
It sounds like they didn't think she was going to be as big as you thought

755
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,536
No you know what is it was a shoestring budget

756
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
We didn't need a lot though

757
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
You know I remember her

758
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
She know she didn't have outfits

759
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
So

760
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
She had this idea for this sort of mirror

761
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Bra

762
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Panty set

763
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
Or whatever that she couldn't afford

764
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
So she took a mirror

765
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,224
And she actually broke the mirror up with a hammer and crazy glued

766
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
Hp's Contour onto a bra and panties

767
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:28,928
You know we had this for all of the early Gaga fans you know from the from the early days

768
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,768
You know she had she had this latex costume

769
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
You know what these big shoulder pads

770
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
That she wore to every single show

771
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
Not multiple outfit

772
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
One outfit

773
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
That she wore

774
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Every single show

775
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:50,176
So you know so we we've basically bootstrap this thing and every dime that she did make

776
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,992
She reinvested it back into her career

777
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
So I think when you married

778
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,112
Did you marry that with the perfect storm of

779
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
I don't have a plan B

780
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
She doesn't have a plan B

781
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
Vincent doesn't have a plan B

782
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
We we

783
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Have to make due

784
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Just had to work

785
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Had to work

786
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Had to work

787
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,728
I'm getting anxious just listening to story cuz I'm thinking oh my God

788
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
Crazy it's crazy risk

789
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Okcu

790
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
So you're trying to convince State radio station

791
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
Play her music

792
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Keep building up a social media Network

793
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
But

794
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
What was the moment where

795
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
She just blew up

796
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,160
The moment that I knew like you know because it wasn't just

797
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
One moment right it just was like

798
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,768
Deathgrind over a one-year period

799
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Forget it on the rain

800
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,864
And so I remember we were playing at

801
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Theater

802
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,960
It was The Wiltern Theater in LA

803
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
And you know this is that things are

804
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
The feeling better

805
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:55,456
Yeah but I remember that we were so nervous about The Wiltern no

806
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Because it's a thousand seats yeah

807
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
But we have sold out a couple of nightclubs

808
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,160
So we like maybe we can stretch it will keep the tickets at $20

809
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,768
So you know so it's super affordable or whatever and we can give away whatever we don't sell

810
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
We can give to the radio stations or you know

811
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,448
I'm kind of pad the venue right like 2008/2009 yeah right around that time

812
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
And I remembered

813
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Driving down the street

814
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
That morning because I had to go downtown for something

815
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
And I drove down a path

816
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
The theater

817
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
And kids were sleep outside

818
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
To get tickets to that show

819
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
No they had already bought tickets to the show

820
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,696
And they just wanted to get in first and when I saw those kids sleeping outside I said we'd

821
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:44,096
Did it we did it because when you can get them to line up you got something special

822
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:50,496
You got something special that ride like you know what it was pretty incredible you know

823
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,592

Met people you never thought you would me so not only did she go to an incredible

825
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
Level in her career it actually took me to a level in my career that you know I thought you know what I would do

Where you just had a quiet moment and you just look at each other

830
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
How did it happen

831
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152

A crowd

2010's

00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
You also start to

856
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
Like I said I'm going to Branch out right now

857
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Yeah because

858
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
You started a company

859
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Around that time

860
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Atom Factory

861
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
Yeah I started atom Factory

862
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
Actually so I started Coalition Media Group

863
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
What was the original name of the

864
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Things started

865
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
It was

866
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Distorted energetic

867
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Shift

868
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
With that within a company

869
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
And you know I not gone through

870
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
You know the terrible time.

871
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
I said you not

872
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
I want to change

873
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
The name of the company

874
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
I want to bring a new energy into it

875
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
And I said

876
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
I want it I want this company

877
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
Something small

878
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
But yet powerful

879
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
And just to be honest with you

880
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
The thing was

881
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
I just said I want to wake up everyday and do

882
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
That was

883
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
The mantra for me purse

884
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,248
And so whether that included management Oregon oh

885
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Producing

886
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Be your whatever I just wanted to do

887
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you think that that inspired me

888
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Yeah

889
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
So

890
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
Restart this company and

891
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Lady Gaga's career

892
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
Doing great and

893
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
One day she walks in and says

894
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
I'm leaving

895
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,240
Yep just walked in and say I want to go in another Direction

896
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Which is a story you had heard

897
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Yasso

898
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,152
I can't say it felt any different than if that then it felt the first time

899
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
But you know what it is

900
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
It was a different

901
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Experience

902
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
The first time I went in

903
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
To panic mode you know when that

904
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
When I happened to

905
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
This time you know I

906
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
I think I think I was able to

907
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
The sit in the middle of that storm

908
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Anne and watched

909
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
The storm path

910
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Want to part ways with you

911
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Are you know what it's

912
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
I think it just it happen

913
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,848
I think I did differs in opinion you know on what happening and why have

914
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
But ultimately our

915
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
You know I respected

916
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Took it on the chin

917
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Are you guys still friends

918
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,320
I wouldn't say friends but cordial

919
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
Yeah cuz you was probably the closest person

920
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256

921
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
You know you

922
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,840
I can't do it without

923
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Pouring my soul into

924
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
I can't do it without investing

925
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
1

926
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
2%

927
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
And internet released

928
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
So

929
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
I didn't go into

930
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
To the relation

931
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Get wet

932
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
Gaga with my guards up

933
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
You know because

934
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
The thing happened

935
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
You know so it just doesn't work that way

936
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
It's just no gray for

937
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
For me and my mind all in or all out

938
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Is it

939
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Bittersweet to see her perform at the

940
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
What all do you know what is

941
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
Not not even better

942
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Stewie I think it just

943
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
You know

944
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Bet the songs that she

945
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
She sang at the

946
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
You know those old records that you know

947
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
I know the origin

948
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
I know the stories behind

949
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
You know we we were part of

950
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
I was part of getting those records

951
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
Super Bowl so it's a part of my life

952
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
That you know

953
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
Always going to be proud

954
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
Completely different side a

955
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Of your career with

956
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,144
Which is arguably a much bigger part of your

957
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Which is

958
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Investing

959
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
You basically

960
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
At a certain point decided

961
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
I want to invest

962
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Startups

963
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Yeah that that

964
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Sort of came about

965
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Through

966
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
You know we were doing all of these

967
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
These things in technology

968
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
He's a startup

969
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
Liquid Gaga you know in order

970
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
Yeah just to promote the music

971
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Yeah and the music industry and end

972
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
Just Hollywood in general

973
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,304
We're in litigation with most of the United Technology Company

974
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
So it was this sort of

975
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,144
This wall between technology

976
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Quien Canta

977
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
And we embraced it and

978
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
Since I started building a ladder relation

979
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Epson Silicon Valley

980
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
That

981
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
Introduced me to a lot of young entrepreneurs

982
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,968
Who started asking me you know can I buy

983
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Starr companies github

984
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Introduction

985
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
You know that I want to invest in their companies

986
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:31,488
And that that ended up turning into you know I think I've invested in close to a hundred early-stage technology

987
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Yes I'm free

988
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Pretty seems like

989
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,912
Uber Warby Parker Spotify write you an early industrial although

990
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
Yeah yeah Spotify

991
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Warby

992
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Uber Lyft

993
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Dropbox

994
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Slack

995
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Really great company

996
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Means that we're proud

997
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
So like

998
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
Looking back at that that

999
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
2 million

1000
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Dollar check that you got

1001
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272

Very rich guy

1004
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
If you've done very very well do you feel

1005
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
Secure now do you feel like you'll never get back to

1006
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
That point

1007
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
11 mm

1008
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
6 worth

1009
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280

1012
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
People who grew up poor

1013
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
You suffered Financial

1014
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
PTSD

1015
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
XOXO

1016
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Going through financial

1017
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
PTSD

1018
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
You always have that fear that thing just happen

1019
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Yeah you all you want you always have it

1020
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
So

1021
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
I'm just

1022
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
I'm a simple guy

1023
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,928
What I appreciate in life in the things that make me happy

1024
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
Tend not to have

1025
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
To do with with the money itself

1026
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
More importantly

1027
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
It's

1028
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Have an ability

1029
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Need to live a life

1030
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,936
If that I can wake up every morning doing what I love

1031
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Nothing's more important

1032
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Timmy Turner

1033
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
You never went to

1034
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
College

1035
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
You don't have an MBA you don't have

1036
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
An advanced degree the

1037
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Being

1038
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:03,647
I think to Harvard Business School case studies about you and Lady Gaga which isn't that great irony but

1039
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Geography like

1040
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
You didn't belong

1041
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
That you weren't

1042
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,767
I don't know that like you are around

1043
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
People who had credentials and

1044
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Made you feeling

1045
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Intimidated

1046
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
Yeah

1047
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
At time

1048
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
He's right you know in

1049
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
If I had a v

1050
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Grade teacher

1051
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Your name is more

1052
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,919
And I was always the littlest guy in the class you know you take this

1053
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
The school pictures are you get in line

1054
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,783
The go to lunch in the hallway I was always first in line cuz I was

1055
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
The smallest guy

1056
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,647
But she used to call me the big guy

1057
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
And she made me feel like I was six foot five

1058
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
And like she get it was something that she

1059
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
She did psychological

1060
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,935
Did that like really really made me

1061
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
I feel

1062
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,007
Not only did I belong

1063
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
But that I was special

1064
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,383
So you know sometimes I'll go into rooms

1065
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Where

1066
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
It's

1067
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
This person has a lot more

1068
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
Experience that me that much smarter

1069
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Denying

1070
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
But I know what I know

1071
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
And

1072
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
I think I bring

1073
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
A very bringing unique point of view to the

1074
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743

Experiences

1077
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
And I'm

1078
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
Confident in that in

1079
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
That point of view

1080
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,751

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and today we're going to update a story we ran

1119
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,279
Last year this comes from Robin Kerber who works for a bank in New York problem that has

1120
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
Nothing to do with her day job gets super frustrated looking for parking

1121
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
If I'm driving if I'm a passenger in a car annoying things

1122
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
Car in a big city people fight with their spouses trying to find a parking space

1123
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,879
Baden-Baden drive there fast enough so it's really a source of

1124
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
Pension we about four years ago Robin noticed that her dad had come up with cut the low-tech solution

1125
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Gentoo the city's parking problem

1126
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:33,471
Key devices system where he would put a piece of paper on his car window with a :-) if you

1127
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
You were sleeping the next morning and drivers in his neighborhood began to look out for his car if they saw the :-)

1128
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:46,271
Of course when Robin says I thought to myself there should be enough for this and how many

1129
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,671
Very same thing but Robin actually did something she got a friend to help her do the coding and then she met

1130
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:59,071
Need an app that allows drivers to share information about parking spaces we have a find a spot off

1131
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
Option and Hostess pot option so if you are looking to find a spot you could click that button and it would search

1132
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
Search for all the spots within your vicinity and it would show you the 20 closest spots

1133
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
You want to snag you get the make and model of the car that the leaving and then you navigate to your face and they

1134
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
We are actually tracking you on GPS so you know if the person is on time you could chat with them a nice person

1135
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:31,071
You have to pay if it was successful or not course for the app to really work Robin needed hundreds actually

1136
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
Visions of New York City drivers to download it and start sharing this basis soap to get the word out

1137
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
The music video no I'm not trying to be rude but let me get that far from you I wish we had a bad way

1138
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Good spots go away

1139
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015

1140

Either staying in it or dance Bennett video did not exactly go viral but

1142
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,327
Robin keeps pushing she put flyers on thousands of cars all over New York City

1143
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,727
Chase after me when I'm handing them Flyers asking for more flyers to just her friends that live in neighborhood

1144
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:16,127
They they love this and that enthusiasm is what keeps me

1145
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Pushing forward

1146
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,991
Robin called her a par car that spelled

1147
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
T a r k a r r

1148
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
