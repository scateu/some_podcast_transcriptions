Well I kind of freaked out and I got this like small army

Give interns to help basically be customer service to email and call all these people let him know that there

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
NPR

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
How I built this

19
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,584
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
Stories behind the movement

21
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
They don't know

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,152

Anything anyone

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
I seen before

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
So I should

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
Probably let you know right

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
At the outset hear that

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Today's show is going to be

30
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
A little bit different

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:41,376
Because normally in the first half of the show we hear the story of how an entrepreneur

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,192
Painstakingly build his or her business

33
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
From the ground

34
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
And then get old

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
How it goes from there right and in normally it's

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Just one

37
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Business

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Who is Blake mycoskie

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
It is not just one

40
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Because before he even turned 30

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
He's already launched

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
For company

43
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Pretty well

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
And as for his best-known business

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Toms Shoes

46
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536
We're not even going to get there for a while so hang tight

47
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Blake's

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
Very first business dates back to the mid-1990s

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Is when he was a freshman in college

50
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,288
Growing up keeping a pretty good tennis player he even played against Andy Roddick

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Pekin High School

52
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
And Blake was recruited to play at Southern Methodist University

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
And everything was going according to plan

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040
That is until one day when he injured his

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Achilles tendon

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
I've had this big cast on in

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Crutches and

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
I wasn't able to play tennis

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Several months I have

60
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
At the rehab

61
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
But everything I can do is ask

62
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
She couldn't carry my laundry

63
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
I down to the

64
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Facility in the college

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
What's dorm

66
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,496
And so my laundry is piling up in my room and my roommate was

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Probably not like

68
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Get that much and

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
This is the hard to believe but this is back

70
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Before any search engine so we had the yellow page

71
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,016
And I remember looking in the Yellow Pages to find a place that would come pick up

72
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
And deliver my laundry back to maybe

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Because I physically couldn't do it

74
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
And and there is nothing like that in Dallas that I can find it

75
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
The time

76
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
There come to the campus and do that and

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
That ultimately led to

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
My first business

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Just called EZ laundry

80
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,960
Blake partnered with his roommate and eventually they figured out that the

81
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Key to getting customers

82
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Listen to the students

83
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Actually through their parents

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Show the next year

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Quienes roommate got a booth

86
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
At the freshman orientation

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
So parents are kind of going there's kind of signing up for everything

88
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
The other getting the books

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
They're getting the death again that

90
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,184
Navigate to the laundry thing and they don't know how long we've been in business or if every kid on campus does it or not but

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Cashiers a chance to

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,304
You know sign their kid up for something that's not that expensive Ville

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Help make sure that

94
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
The kids don't ruin their clothes are freshman year they haven't been used

95
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
East Washington

96
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Drawing your own clothes and

97
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Say some some time that they can use

98
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Use for the things

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
We are pretty good

100
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Kitchen

101
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
Within the series like two or three days we did like

102
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
$80,000 in prepaid laundry sales for

103
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
The year

104
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
When are the actually expanded

105
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
The four other colleges

106
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Texas

107
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
And then

108
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
They were doing so well that Blake

109
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Dropped out of SMU to

110
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
The focus entirely on the company

111
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
And after a few years

112
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
They decided to sell it

113
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
So at 21

114
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
Blake walked away with about $100,000

115
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
And lots of

116
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Time to Kill

117
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
And I actually took a trip out to Los Angeles

118
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
The first time I'm just take a little bit of time off is it at

119
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Friends are going to school out here

120
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
And when I was in LA I saw these

121
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
This huge

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Advertising

123
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Displays inside the building

124
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Lynx now

125
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Drawing of a Texas ID

126
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
I never seen like a massive

127
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Add

128
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:50,303
I'm for an iPhone remove ear whatever you painted on the side of a building

129
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Yet there was a lot of that in Los

130
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
And I noticed that they're not only was a lot of it but there was almost a

131
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
Exclusively advertising movies

132
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Asian TV shows

133
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
So this

134
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Pacific industry the LA was

135
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Who is known for

136
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,943
And I remember sitting there that she's thing at Mel's Diner on Sunset I'll never forget this moment

137
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,039
And I was looking at this massive ad for I think one of the first Jurassic Park

138
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
And I was

139
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,671
This is so powerful that there's no way you can tune out this type of Alberta

140
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
The Gap is bigger than life is

141
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,839
It's exciting you know I wanted to go see the movie because of that the wall skate was so exciting it

142
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,215
Underneath it had a name of a company van Wagner And it was a company that owned that space

143
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Technical vanwagner in

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
AI company in

145
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Want to do some

146
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Really big in LA and a salt is added you anyways could I rent this side of this building on Sunset and it's as well

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Actually have a year-long contract with

148
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Warner Brothers for that one so we

149
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
We can't we have mother one in town

150
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
How much would it cost if I wanted to rent this one and he said something

151
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
I think you said it was like

152
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
$85,000

153
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
You were a course

154
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
Pretending like you just want to get the information

155
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
If he says 85085 thousand a month

156
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
What I'm thinking

157
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,895
Hold on that means that building owners making over $1000000

158
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
The year

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
Just by renting the side of their building and he has two sides

160
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
It's cuz the building

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Face it sunset two different ways

162
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
The $2000000 on one building

163
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
And I thought there's no cost

164
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Like all you doing is this

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Painting or putting the vinyl on there's no like

166
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Actual billboard structure

167
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Steel and all that stuff

168
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
You have to do like this

169
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
This is incredible

170
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,727
I just start thinking to myself like who would pay $85,000

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
And like

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Why cuz there's no way that can make sense

173
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
On a

174
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
No cost per thousand or an advertising metric

175
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Images 9f people that drive on Sunday

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
But I think

177
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
So the reason I basically came up with my mind was

178
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
It had to be you

179
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,439
You had to be there like all these studios in town went there movies

180
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
On the note on the

181
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
The street they want to show the

182
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
Actor the Starlet like I can put you on this building and

183
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Like how big a deal is that

184
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
Isaac in Nashville the time and I made it

185
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Quick

186
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
Assumption that the country music industry

187
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
Maybe not as big egos but definitely some big egos in town and

188
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
What if I put country music stars on the side of the building

189
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
So is that

190
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Is that what you did

191
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
Yeah so I went back to Nashville and got after it in

192
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
When found out that you know there's no one has ever done this in Nashville

193
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
I and it was very

194
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
You're challenging me

195
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
To get the city to allow me to do it ultimately I had to convince

196
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
The city

197
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Because I have the Highway beautification Act

198
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,959
Twitch kept people from putting up any new Billboards I think like after year 1984 something

199
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
I'm so what I ultimately came up with after like

200
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Arno

201
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Countless

202
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
City Council meetings

203
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Discussion

204
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
This and that was

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
I was going to

206
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,295
Actually make the city More Beautiful cuz I was going to create country music

207
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Art

208
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,415
And so what I did was I actually would put the album cover

209
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
Of the new Dixie Chicks are Shania Twain

210
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Whoever was coming out with an album

211
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
But there would be no like

212
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Call to action know like

213
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Available at Best Buy for 999

214
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
It was just that

215
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
The art of the album

216
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
And by doing that

217
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
I can visit City I was adding to the landscape of Nashville which is all about

218
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
Music

219
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,991
Hate had this idea all you have to do is give me the side of your building and you get

220
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
CID

221
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Did the thing you don't ever want to do especially when you're 22 years old and trying to talk to the 50 and 60 year old people who own apartment,

222
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Places you don't want to use the word idea

223
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
Because if it's just an idea then it's like

224
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
You're not going to inspire a lot of confidence

225
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Because people can say I don't like your idea

226
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
I don't believe your idea

227
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
If you say I have a business

228
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
And what we do

229
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Is wheelies

230
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
You know the side of your building

231
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
And will guarantee you this amount of money per month

232
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
And we're going to resell the side of your building

233
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Cuz we specialize

234
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
In selling advertising

235
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
To the country music industry end

236
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
You'll make money on an asset that you never thought you would ever make

237
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
You're basically Hustler

238
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
A little bit

239
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,351
I mean there's no doubt like I mean anyone is an entrepreneur associates they start really young

240
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
I mean

241
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
You got a fake ID

242
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Do you make it tender

243
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
You know and I was I was never being

244
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Dishonest I was just saying

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,871
This is what I'm doing and they had nothing to lose like by signing a contract with me

246
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
Then they were basically saying okay if you go out and least this

247
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
The Dixie Chicks

248
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,551
Jose and you can lease it for 10000 bucks

249
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
You're going to give me 30

250
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
Percent of that just for

251
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
Me allowing you to do this

252
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
That's that's $3,000 a month

253
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
To a place that made with charging

254
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
$500 a month for

255
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Mitsubishi I just created

256
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
6 new apartments

257
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
They didn't even know how did you get the first

258
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Company or who are

259
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
Label to agree to let you work with them to put their album art like how did you even

260
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
Have those connections an end

261
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
How did you make that happen

262
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
It was just cold calling you know I mean that I found out who had albums coming out did some research and then I contacted

263
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
Yeah the marketing person said hey I know you're getting ready to promote

264
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Get a disc this album and

265
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
I have a way you can promote it larger than life right here in Nashville it's going to make a big impact and you can be one of the first

266
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Do it Mr all things that marketing people love to hear

267
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Yeah and and

268
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Who's your first client was the first

269
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Piece of art that you put up on the sun side of a building

270
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Amy Grant

271
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
We did it on the side of a Ramada Hotel in downtown

272
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
There's a picture of me and and my partner who is helping me

273
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
At the time

274
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
Standing in front of it you know I know

275
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,159
Cover the national newspaper when it came out and it was great and then what we had that way

276
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
With credibility

277
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
And then we just started

278
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Yes I'm right and left

279
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
What did the label pay for that

280
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
I think we charge for that one about

281
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
I want to say 15000 a month

282
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
So if you work we are probably cash flowing. 10000 a month

283
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Just for that one wall

284
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,383
Do you think you have the confidence to do that because you had done the laundry business and

285
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
In college

286
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Yammy I learned a lot I've started laundry business

287
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
19

288
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,599
So I didn't you know kind of hustling and building and having employees and learning about Custer

289
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Summer service and learning valley sings

290
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
About 4 years

291
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
So when I had this idea I had to pay a little bit more

292
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
And you have nothing to lose you know

293
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
It's like they they're going to say yesterday weren't in

294
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
I've always been good with you no like

295
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Just Taking Chances and

296
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
And see what happen

297
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
So eventually

298
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
View

299
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Black Nashville

300
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
What US company

301
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
So I end up selling the company to Clear Channel

302
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Big Media Company

303
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
How hot it was

304
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,319
It's really big in the outdoor advertising we ended up having walls in Nashville and

305
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Expanded to Dallas

306
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
2

307
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
And once I got to Dallas I realize that this is like a

308
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
A big business game like I'd had some

309
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Small successes

310
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
But it was very quickly that the big

311
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Companies like the Viacom

312
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
Clear Channel's bandwagoners they were onto my game

313
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
And it was going to be hard at camp

314
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
So did you walk out of that

315
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Teal

316
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
More less

317
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
Set pretty set yeah I mean

318
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Every everything is is relative right

319
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
But I definitely had a nice

320
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
Cash flow coming in from that that I wasn't having you know

321
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
Jumped Outlet find a job so when I moved to LA

322
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
It was more kind of

323
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
For fun

324
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Exploring what could be next

325
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
Then I was fascinated with reality television how is

326
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Show me some popular

327
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Cuz like right after like the first Survivor came out

328
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Yeah and it just fast

329
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
I think the competitiveness in me

330
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
I did Venture that you know like

331
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
All that and

332
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
My sister and I were thinking about

333
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
Applying for Survivor and we actually did have life

334
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Survivor Wii U

335
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
You wanted to be contestants on Survivor

336
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Yeah

337
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
And

338
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
The casting

339
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
People Survivor also cast

340
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
New show called The Amazing Race

341
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
And they called us up and said hey I

342
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
I don't think

343
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
We can put you and yours

344
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Survivor

345
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
But they knew about the Amazing Race

346
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Today I talked

347
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Descend to

348
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,959
Thinking about the Amazing Race and so we got into the process

349
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Disturbing interview

350
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
For that

351
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
And we got on

352
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
And then the actual show itself is 31 days so

353
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
We literally disk

354
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,991
Secured smartworld for 31 days and we couldn't really tell anyone what we're doing

355
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
Super confidential disappeared

356
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,183
Anywhere from like country to Country right yeah it's all over the world and

357
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,327
We're done the hard part with a show with

358
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Can start hearing for another you know

359
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Couple months

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Week in Taiwan

361
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
What happened

362
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
You know if we won or if we didn't win how far we got

363
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
Not to spoil the ending for anyone

364
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Because Darren 2002 but you barely

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Did you almost

366
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
You guys almost won a million box

367
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Yeah and thankfully then cuz I think that

368
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
That would have been a positive thing at that moment but probably wouldn't have

369
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Been good

370
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
For my further Drive Minaj

371
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
General Sam

372
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
She sits The Amazing Race fans

373
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Steve Soldier

374
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Company

375
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
What I mean at this point you are kind of

376
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
You like 23 24 25 you head up

377
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
You're 25

378
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
You've got this check coming in

379
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
From Clear Channel

380
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
Ubitus presumably you didn't really have to

381
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Work if you

382
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Brave enough to whole lot

383
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
But I was never really about the money like it

384
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Every business of EverStart has been more of it

385
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Curiosity

386
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
And it kind of what if

387
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Enso

388
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
As I just got off The Amazing Race in his look

389
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Getting around and seeing how popular reality

390
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Becoming antenna

391
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Understand the basic

392
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Sigmetrics of

393
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Advertising and

394
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
And what advertisers want

395
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Targeting and all that

396
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,983
I just got really excited us idea of the network

397
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
If you really having your own channel

398
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
And it would be

399
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Please focus on reality and reality

400
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Movie stars that like a cable

401
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
TV channel

402
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
It's just amazing to me because I remember when I was

403
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
25

404
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
I worked pretty hard it was a foreign correspondent was trying to

405
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
You know start my career. But

406
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
I mean

407
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
I don't know Timmy 2502 tank

408
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Restart cable TV channel if that's

409
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
It's a pretty

410
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Bold

411
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Idea to have

412
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Yeah I mean absolutely

413
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
But I felt like you know I feel like it was possible I could just

414
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
It seems like

415
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
I was in this position I started to understand

416
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
By being on the show did interest

417
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
People hiding

418
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,295
We're just about finding the right people that knew how to do it and then figure out highway to channel

419
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Their energy and

420
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Get the right capital

421
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Together to do it

422
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
So so did you raise money for it

423
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
So I did so I basically I track down

424
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Are the gentlemen who is the founder of the

425
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
You Channel and

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Somehow got a meeting with

427
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
And then he kind of said

428
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
Looks like it's so competitive now to start a channel

429
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
No

430
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Probably about

431
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,359
Play streamline box maybe $750,000 you would need

432
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
Just to get

433
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
The lights turned on

434
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
And I said why I definitely have seven

435
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
$50,000

436
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
To just kind of bed on the

437
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
That's right out the gate

438
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
But I do know some people

439
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
Who really understand Reality Tea

440
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,999
And you have some money that maybe they'd invest in my idea was is

441
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
To go to all the winners

442
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
So the reality shows the last

443
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
2 years

444
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
And get them to invest

445
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
You said you guys should all invest let's start a reality TV

446
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,823
Yeah and you got the money on a million bucks or whatever

447
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
And I got them all to invest in

448
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
And then I put some more money in it

449
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Within a couple months I raised is 7 and 50000 in

450
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
We launched what was called reality Central

451
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
So you raise money and then

452
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
And then what do you do start

453
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
Like producing a reality show

454
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
No the whole idea was it we require the Conte

455
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Next enough

456
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
You know I did to reshow

457
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
And then we would actually

458
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:45,311
Do, like Mystery Dinner Theater where you had someone come on it was on the show and kind of talk

459
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Through boys happening

460
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
That's a good idea

461
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
But you know so we really don't have to spend money on the continent

462
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Is more about trying to get the

463
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Which ultimately was he

464
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Achilles heel and why didn't work in

465
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Do we have to go to LA

466
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Comcast

467
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
Time Warner and Charter needs big organization

468
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Guitar cable

469
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Networks

470
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
The host all the channels

471
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
And convince them that they should give us a

472
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
The slot of the one of 500

473
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
And

474
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Ultimately we couldn't convince

475
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Of that

476
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,919
You know it's funny cuz I I sir you tell the story and I think of you as somebody who

477
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Cuz really

478
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,783
Try to make the world a better place and I don't know if

479
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
If your 24-hour reality channel would have made the world a better place

480
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:37,023
It wouldn't have been I'm so thankful that it didn't work I would ride probably going to shoot myself if I was running

481
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
I mean there's something

482
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,679
Genius about and something really horrible service

483
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,775
So what happened with all the people who including you poop

484
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Unfortunately we all lost her

485
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
It was really hard I was

486
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
Pretty depressed for a while

487
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
I'd let go everyone

488
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
It was challenging

489
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
So when that

490
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
All kind of

491
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Collapsed

492
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
What did you do

493
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
Tide the Disco

494
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
So I mean company 3

495
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
The overarching theme of my entrepreneurial life

496
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Which I am really think

497
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Before has been like there's been no

498
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,775
Connection from one business to another it's literally been me following

499
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Kind of

500
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,175
My Curiosities and the serendipitous conversations and experiences I have

501
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
And so the next business

502
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Totally that way

503
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
I was actually at a barbecue

504
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
As we were

505
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Kind of closing down

506
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
The reality Channel

507
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
And one of the people that work for me they had a son.

508
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
15 years old and he was there

509
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,583
And I was asking him what he was doing that summer

510
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
You're making small talk and

511
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
Waiting for burger or something and he told me he was

512
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Doing driver's ed

513
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
And I said all I got to be so exciting

514
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Learn to drive

515
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
And he responded like

516
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Totally

517
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
An uninspiring way I mean you just said like

518
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Yats

519
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
It's okay you know I go this

520
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Play

521
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Teacher boring

522
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
I pretty much sleep

523
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Class A

524
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
I like

525
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
First off this is not good

526
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Our future drivers in LA

527
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Sleeping through their driver's ed class

528
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
That doesn't make me feel good by getting on

529
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
Highway in the second thing is like

530
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
I mean getting your license

531
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
Should be like this amazing experience for 15 year old in

532
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,287
And there's got to be a better way to engage them yeah

533
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
And I just thought guys like all these

534
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
Teenagers are starting to be online more and more

535
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,479
You know maybe there's a way to 10 to take this

536
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Driver's ed in

537
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Instruction and learning

538
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Into

539
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
The technology

540
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Teenagers from braids

541
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
So I had this idea just kind of start a new

542
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Type of driver's ed

543
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
We would do all the instruction online

544
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
I'm you have to pass things

545
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,215
Sequential manner so you can really make sure that they're learning and they're paying attention like

546
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
It couldn't just like cram for the final test they would have to

547
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
You get the

548
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,847
Stage is almost like a video game

549
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
And

550
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
I recognized it

551
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
One of the ways to get them to pay attention and be more excited

552
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
About the actual learning

553
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
How to drive

554
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Was to have driver's ed teachers

Is the tension in the best way I could figure out to do that

558
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
Was I hired only

00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Higher like

You know that need part time work need flexible schedules

572

Trying to make it

574
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,231

576
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583

Hey welcome back to how I built this from

631
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
NPR

632
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
I got a ride

633
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
So it's 2006

634
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
And Lake

635
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Driver's ed businesses taking off

636
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Making good money

637
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Life

638
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
But he's feeling a little bored a little

639
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Restless

640
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
So he decided to take a break and

641
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
Do something a little unusual

642
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
He thought

643
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
What do I learn to play polo in

644
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
Argentina

645
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
And was actually

646
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
After about being down there for about 3 weeks

647
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,576
When I met serendipitously a few women that were in a wine bar

648
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
That were talking to me in English which is nice

649
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
Christmas everyone is speaking Spanish and I didn't

650
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
I understand most of what they were saying

651
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
And when I

652
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Asked about what they were doing

653
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Explain they were doing something

654
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Hey characterized

655
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
The Shoe Drive

656
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
And what that meant was they were going around

657
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
Collecting slightly used shoes from wealthy families in Buenos Aires

658
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Cogitate

659
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Two children

660
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,664
Who did not have shoes and couldn't afford shoes that needed them

661
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
I had to go to school

662
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
And I was just really taken by

663
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,320
By their passion for this project and the fact that

664
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
Kids just outside of Buenos Aires to dinner

665
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Shoes cuz

666
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
That was something new kind of new to me and

667
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
You know I have to

668
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Enough questions to get interested

669
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
And they

670
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,400
Offered me to come with him and help distribute the shoes and I said sure they said

671
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Check out this

672
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Yeah they were going like a week later and I was

673
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
It's going to be down there still

674
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
So yeah

675
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
To what happened

676
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
The experience was

677
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
An amazing one of me I didn't have

678
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Really any experience

679
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
Point about volunteering

680
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Being in a place of

681
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Poverty in

682
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,416
But I saw these kids really light up

683
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
When they

684
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Got these shoes and they won't even use

685
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Disease where you shake

686
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Is Bethea the kids were acting like it was new

687
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Christmas Day

688
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Parents are excited and

689
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Joy and laughter we put the

690
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,216
Cuz she's on the kids we played with him we jump rope

691
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
It's soccer we did all these things

692
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
And it was just a great day

693
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,128
And so I went back that evening and I was talking to my

694
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Paula teachers in Vallejo

695
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
About the

696
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Experience

697
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
And

698
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,552
And telling him what a great day I had and how

699
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Nioh how satisfying

700
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Why isn't

701
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
I was going on and on

702
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
Gushing

703
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
With enthusiasm

704
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,304
And then he asked me a question that I really wasn't prepared for he said Blake is it this is

705
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Amazing what you've done and I'm

706
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
I commend you and

707
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Doing this in my country and

708
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,496
I know what area you were in today and that's a very challenging area for

709
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
The families

710
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
He said but what happens when the kids

711
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
You grow out of the shoes

712
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
User when they wear out of

713
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
It's your only pair they're going to wear out of them

714
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
And I said

715
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
I don't know

716
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
And his question kind of haunted

717
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,112
I need to be honest cuz all the sudden I thought Geist

718
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
We actually do something good or did we just

719
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
Further propagate a problem that they're going to have down the road

720
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
And I remember that night like

721
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
Actually having a little trouble sleeping and kind of wrestling with this

722
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
This question he asked

723
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
So

724
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
I woke up the next morning and when the things I've done

725
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
Since I was like 15 years old as I write in my journal I'm a servant

726
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
And I'm having a cup of coffee and reading my journal and

727
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
Cat thinking about is questioning

728
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,480
It all seemed like cats this idea of like

729
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Okay well if I really want to help you

730
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
His kids which I really did I really connected

731
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Redis group

732
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
Maybe I go and get all my friends to donate

733
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Is a couple times a year we bring them down

734
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
I thought well

735
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Yeah that's

736
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,840
Once again dependent on other people's donations and what if they don't do it and

737
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,912
In a doesn't seem like a very sustainable way

738
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
To give these kids

739
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Kid shoes and then

740
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
That led to

741
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
You know what

742
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
What is the hours of business

743
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Set up a charity

744
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Donations what if I actually started a

745
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
A shoe business and every time I sold a pair of shoes

746
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
I would give a pair away

747
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
What what kind of shoes did you have in mind

748
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,208
But you know at the same time I've been Argentina for about a month and I've noticed that a lot of the polo players Neva

749
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
The girlfriend

750
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Wearing

751
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
The shoes called the Opera

752
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Borgata

753
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
And it was kind of like an espadrille type canvas shoe that was

754
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Very different than

755
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Anything I've ever seen in the US

756
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
And just like

757
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
Kind of magic

758
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Taken together

759
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
With gosh what if I sold these shoes that everyone down here is wearing

760
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
The people who never seen them

761
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,992
Come back here and give away shoes to kids who need them

762
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
What did you

763
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
How do you even get started

764
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
So we just started meeting with people in town made these shoes

765
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,768
And asking them like a could you change this to change that

766
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Delphi

767
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
It's crazy because what they all

768
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,496
The country is in Argentina what everyone appreciate that the shoe is there really inexpensive and they were kind disposable and they were

769
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
You know. Something that

770
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Put too much investment into

771
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
People can buy them

772
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
You never

773
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Month or two or couple months

774
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
They got a new pair

775
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
And so

776
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
They thought some of our changes was in

777
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Make the shoe way too expensive

778
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
They didn't understand that

779
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
We had a market that

780
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Hey cuz

781
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
If you were paying 40 bucks for paravanes if I can make something

782
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Have the same you know kind of

783
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,816
Longevity then they will pay $40 for this

784
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
Small-time artisanal

785
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Shoemakers are worthy Zia

786
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,728
Yeah just make it in the garage is or making them in

787
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
Indifferent yes small little Barns and factories

788
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
So we got some ideas and

789
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,456
They were typing really rapidly cuz they were small organization

790
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
And we made a couple hundred pairs

791
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Looks like prototypes

792
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
And

793
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
In the name Toms

794
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Was birthed

795
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,440
There are created down there too because

796
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
When I totally hear what I want to do I said

797
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
I think if we sell a pair of shoes today

798
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
Will give away a pair of shoes

799
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Tomorrow

800
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
And will come tomorrow shoes

801
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,800
And our slogan will be shoes for a better tomorrow Sawzall run this word tomorrow

802
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
And

803
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
When it came time to

804
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Put a tag on the shoe

805
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
We couldn't fit the word tomorrow

806
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
It's on to the tag

807
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
Tigers with small in the heel

808
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,648
So we shortened the word tomorrow's to Tops and that's how the word Tom's came

809
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,280
And until you get back to the US How many pairs of shoes did you

810
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
About 250

811
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
What's your idea

812
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Could you see if this would

813
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Work like because you could have come back to the US and people would have said

814
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,104
These or you could have sold them all and then

815
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
And then what

816
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Yeah it was definitely

817
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
I try to stress this

818
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
The people I mean

819
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Of all the businesses

820
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,064
Did I started this was the least business

821
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
List of the businesses

822
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,648
China the irony of all of it was like okay there's 250

823
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
HobbyKids in this Village

824
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
I want to come back by Chris

825
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
And give them all a new pair of

826
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,328
So I'm going to go sell these shoes and I'ma come back and then we'll figure out what

827
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Like it was not a business it was

828
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Clearly like

829
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
This is a way for me to

830
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Kind of

831
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
Stay connected to this amazing feeling I had helping these kids

832
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
And Annex

833
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,384
Excuse to come back to Argentina which I'd totally fall in love with

834
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:13,504
And and that was it and I still do the driver's ed business I'm still kind of have my normal life is

This is kind of be my side project in my kind of

837
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Own personal

00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
And so

842
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
When you came back

843
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768

What you do

848
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
I mean first I said I kind of got

849
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008

00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
The style and they love the idea that they're helping

854
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
What did you charge for

855
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528

I sold a few pairs that way and then I got

859
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184

Don't like to carry stuff that no one else has in this is

868
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
Clearly that

869
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,920
Answer my first account was a store in La called American Rag

870
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,760

And

874
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
You know the girl's name is Courtney she was a shoe buyer

00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,000
And I sure do the shoes and she really liked them

876

881
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
She asked me how many pairs I had to sell

882
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448

886
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,992
Put a little display in the window at American dragon that was our

887
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
It was our first big account

888

00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Amazing

890
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,184
Hearts the story and really, turning point all of it was

891
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,304
This woman Booth more who was at the time and the leading fashion writer for the LA Times

892
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840

893
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
Was in the store American Rag and heard about

894
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
The story

895
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
And she asked for my information

896
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
She contacted me in

897
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
She interviewed me

898
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568

00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
No emailed her a picture of one of the shoes

900
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,176
And the next Sunday

901
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
It was like on the cover of the calendar sex

902
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992

910
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
You do

911
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
Well I kind of freaked out

912
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
I also did worth

913
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
I think a lot of entrepreneurs doing

914
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
Time of dire need a start put

915
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
As many ads

On Craigslist

918
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592

Basically be customer service to email and call all these

921
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
People let him know that

922
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
There is no chance

923
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,416
Said they're going to get their shoes in the four days or five days the website

924
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208

Couple months

926
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Longer

927
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Because I had to go back and make

928
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Argentina

929
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
You literally had to

930
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,984
Havana plane and go back like 3 days later after I get the intern set up with

931
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,336
Like laptops and phones in my apartment I said okay I'm going back to make the

932
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Tissues I took the article

933
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Do I need that would never believe me

934
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
And I literally

935
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Prettyboy nosara

936
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,808
Take a taxi to this guy's house one Torres who

937
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Who is making the shoes

938
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
In his garage for

939
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,928
The time had Alejo meet me there

940
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
And I walked in

941
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,000
With the little Spanish I knew I said

942
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Something like that

943
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Muchos

944
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Zapatos rap

945
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
And yeah I know

946
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,472
Just got cranking and one called some friends over and

947
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Other people who knew how to make this

948
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Shoes and

949
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
We got our own little kind of small little fact

950
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
Are you going in this old barn

951
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
I down there

952
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
And after a couple weeks

953
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
We got to work make about 900 pairs of

954
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
I'm out of this little operation

955
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
Imadri for weeks

956
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
2200

957
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
So you have

958
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
2200 Paris

959
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Excuse being in Argentina

960
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
And

961
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Did you ship them back

962
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
Did you like

963
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,984
Stuff them in suitcases like we literally let me know it was like we put them in like big

964
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,312
Boxes in and they flew back with me on American Airlines

965
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
Send the cargo area the airplane

966
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
See what kind of LAX

967
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,712
With giant boxes of shoes

968
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Erase back to your

969
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
Apartment in Venice with the interns and we started

970
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
Shipping in the house from Bach like

971
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,512
So did you have boxes made and emptied it look professional or did was it just like

972
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
Justice shoes

973
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
Padded envelope basically

974
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
Until we got the UPS guy

975
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
To actually

976
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Comstock Park

977
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
I pick up every day wishes

978
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Great sweetie Netflix

979
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Take him all the way to

980
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
The place

981
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
So

982
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
I'm serious we are running shipping the stuff out of the apartment

983
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Everyday and

984
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,528
And then because of that we're getting mortars online and we started talking

985
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Stores

986
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,832
Password

987
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
You are like honor roll

988
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
And then the next big break was

989
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
We got a call

990
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
From Vogue magazine and

991
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,888
And that funny thing about that was I had just seen the movie The Devil wear

992
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Can't Stop

993
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,520
Summer I see Meryl Streep video playing Anna Wintour

994
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,152
And I see how challenging she is Dan Hathaway's character and when I got a call from Vogue

995
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Come to New York to meet with

996
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
I was horrified I wanted you to

997
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,528
Come there to meet them

998
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
Well I'm the one interview me and they did read the LA Times article

999
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
So

1000
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
C I went and interviewed me and then later they did a photoshoot in Venice and

1001
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
Next thing you know we're in Vogue and when were in Vogue

1002
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Just all kind of

1003
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
What exploded

1004
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Everyone

1005
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
The crazy thing is it

1006
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,496
People just assumed like we were like a real company when we are in Vogue

1007
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
And so we are getting calls

1008
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
Nike stores all the country even

1009
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Celebrity start

1010
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:07,040
That was also the benefit of thing of being in LA and that it was just such a radical idea like

1011
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,112
No fashion company your shoe company has ever liked

1012
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
Giving something away every time I sold it in

1013
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
I think that naturally appealed

1014
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Certain

1015
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Celebrities in

1016
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
And they also like

1017
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
You're wearing things

1018
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Other people aren't having like

1019
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
It's new and so

1020
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,960
So we just started like without any work on her own we just started

1021
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,080
Sing celebrities wearing the shoes and they start being photographed by the paparazzi and then it starts showing up in

1022
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,920
Things like People magazine and US Weekly and okay and how

1023
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
The craziest moment

1024
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,272
For me was when I saw a stranger

1025
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Actually wearing

1026
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
That was about

1027
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
Three or four months later I was actually in New York

1028
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
Trying to sign up some new stores

1029
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
This is right before Vogue came out

1030
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,376
Discouraged I was going to that airport to fly back to LA

1031
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,776
And actually wasn't wearing my shoes I was wearing a pair of running shoes anyways I'm at American Airlines checking in

1032
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
Kiosk and the girl next to me

1033
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
She probably mid-thirties

1034
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,664
She's wearing red para tops

1035
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
At this point like the only thing ever seen

1036
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
My parents

1037
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Friends my interns

1038
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Made my neighbor

1039
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,672
You know and I was so excited me like yours like

1040
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,024
Total random person wearing a pair of shoes so question

1041
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Yeah

1042
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
So I says we're doing the checking as excuse me I said damn

1043
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,936
I couldn't help but notice these shoes you're wearing

1044
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
You're really cool what are they

1045
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
And she like

1046
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
Ligament stress out there Tom's Tom's

1047
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,664
This is like the most amazing comp in the world I might not really tell me about it

1048
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
Check when I bought this pair of shoes

1049
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
They gave a pair to a child in RG

1050
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
And I am right

1051
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
And so I said well actually

1052
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
You know

1053
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
MSU Blake

1054
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
I started Toms

1055
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
Dead Silence

1056
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
She just said

1057
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Can't believe it

1058
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
And then she listens

1059
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
Why did you cut your hair

1060
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:04,800
A question in the fighting was why should I cut my hair why she knew I live in about all this stuff was

1061
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
Because of at this point now

1062
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
You know where

1063
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,176
We're on Facebook and where

1064
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
You know we're promoting on YouTube and

1065
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
She had not

1066
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
Just a customer

1067
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
She's gone line in like learn

1068
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Everything sheep

1069
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
He could about the business

1070
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
And it just really started to

1071
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
I kind of like

1072
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
In my mind

1073
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,024
Come up entrepreneur and mathematical stamp

1074
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Point B a quote

1075
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Bic

1076
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,704
Everyone who bought a pair of TOMS new

1077
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776
Morris knew that when they were buying a pair

1078
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
You guys were

1079
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Prepare to

1080
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Yeah me and you're only days I think that's

1081
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Primary

1082
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
Driver of why people bought Tom

1083
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
The shoes were

1084
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
Frankly not that good a quality

1085
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
They didn't last as long as we had hoped they would I mean

1086
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,392
Yeah they were different they were stylish Etc but

1087
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
That the giving was at

1088
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
Huge huge driver in the early days

1089
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
I mean I'm like a turtle

1090
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
3 years behind everybody else

1091
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
And I think the first time I heard about Tom's was

1092
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
In 2009

1093
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
This commercial

1094
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Yeah what was that about

1095
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
So I

1096
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
Was doing a lot of media about Thomas and so I think I was doing a CNN interview

1097
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
And

1098
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
The woman asked me

1099
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,856
She said how in the world do you run your business cuz I just got back from Ethiopia on a giving trip

1100
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
And she's like

1101
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:28,768
You on your Ethiopia last week you were in you know Argentina 3 weeks before that and your this fast-growing business

1102
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
Like how you running this company and

1103
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Being in all these places we are giving out the

1104
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,192
Cashews and I held up my Blackberry at the time

1105
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Which I had and it's a disc

1106
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
I said I can literally

1107
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Approve designs take orders

1108
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
You know

1109
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
To everything from this

1110
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
And I can do it from Ethiopia

1111
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Someone

1112
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
Who I worked at Bebe D&L at age

1113
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,832
Who AT&T with our clients

1114
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Saw that interview

1115
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Enneathought

1116
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,232
Man this guy uses AT&T this is the best commercial we get everything

1117
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
And thankfully I did use it

1118
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
They called me late

1119
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
They said okay well we going to talk to you about an idea we have for

1120
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:13,056
Commercial my name is Blake and I'm the chief shoe Giver at Toms shoes they went with us on a real giving trip

1121
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
In Uruguay when you went and handed out

1122
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
Choose when we choose

1123
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
They filmed us in our office

1124
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
I need a network with great coverage because for every pair of shoes that we sell

1125
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,832
Everything was just is

1126
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,160
Only real toy legit and they made it into

1127
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
A very different type of commercial for AT&T

1128
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
But it just hit a nerve

1129
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
That was a turning point

1130
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
What that made that turn Tom's from like

1131
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,400
Kind of this this fashion

1132
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,704
Nice thing to a major shoot

1133
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Yeah I mean that was it

1134
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
Because now I mean your millions and millions

1135
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
Have Americans at least four

1136
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,432
Sing our story multiple times throughout the week on different shows and commercials that

1137
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,504
And that was just driving the business and an incredible way

1138
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
And by this point had you

1139
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
I mean I'm assuming you you hired

1140
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
18 to help you

1141
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Run this

1142
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Growing business

1143
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Cuz you were probably doing

1144
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
What kind of Revenue are you doing

1145
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Every art that point we are I mean we did the first year

1146
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
And business

1147
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
I want to say we did

1148
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
About

1149
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
300000

1150
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
The second year we did about

1151
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
3 million

1152
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
And the third year we did

1153
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Like

1154
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,456
15 million

1155
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
In the fourth year we went extinct

1156
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
We went from basically from zero

1157
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
To 450 million dollars

1158
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
Sales on an annual basis

1159
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Enlight

1160
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
7 years

1161
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
You know I think

1162
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,072
We can the fastest growing shoe company in the world

1163
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Insane

1164
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Yeah it was insane

1165
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
What did you find to be

1166
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,776
The most hardest thing about growing so quickly

1167
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
You know

1168
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,104
But after that commercial Nephew just started like

1169
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Going gangbusters

1170
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Aladdin shoes

1171
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Making a shirt

1172
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
Andy I didn't even I mean even until just

1173
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
How to say recently as the last

1174
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
2 years

1175
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,903
Making the shoes has always been the hardest part 4

1176
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Because none of us

1177
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Swear Shoemaker

1178
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
None of us were

1179
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
You know Productions

1180
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
People anyways all

1181
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
Just different people I met along the journey that

1182
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
You had a passion

1183
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Jennifer you know

1184
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,983
For helping kids and doing something disruptive and having fun in like

1185
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
And so the discipline of being great making shoes has always been

1186
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
And something that we've struggled with

1187
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,919
And we really just recently in last couple years gotten better at

1188
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
I'm wondering about

1189
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
Something happening around 2011 2012

1190
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
Cuz you you decided to just take a step back from

1191
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,135
From the whole companies

1192
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Drop off the map

1193
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Hawaii

1194
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Well

1195
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
The in the business was

1196
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Was becoming

1197
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Pretty

1198
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
Corporate pretty kind of bureaucratic we had

1199
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,751
Yeah well leadership team that we had built that was

1200
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:56,127
You know maybe not running it the same kind of way that we used to in St passion and

1201
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
I didn't feel connected

1202
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
To the mission of TOMS and

1203
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,855
And I was questioning like is it something with the rest of my life or like my other entrepreneur gigs is it time to go and do something different

1204
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,951
Until I just thought the best thing for me to do which I've always found is when I'm

1205
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Struggling in statistics

1206
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Getaway in

1207
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Can't be alone

1208
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Sometime

1209
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,143
And I did that what did you do did you get you just like.

1210
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,471
Now I'm at the Austin Texas where I originally

1211
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
Love often and I just got married since my wife and I

1212
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Seidman Dawson for a year

1213
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,943
Melissa company became super corporate and you are kind of dissolution

1214
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
What happened to make you want to

1215
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Return to it

1216
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
Ultimately I realized there was more to be done

1217
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
You know like we had bigger

1218
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,463
Ambitions than what we had accomplished before

1219
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Now I feel like we could use our model

1220
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
How to help more people with more products

1221
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,631
I had enough new things that kind of get my energy

1222
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Play again

1223
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
You know it was just time for me to come back and is really my wife Acts

1224
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
Play she recognized that I was

1225
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
Kind of getting into a depressed state

1226
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
In Austin

1227
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:02,175
And I just realized I was gone that I loved it like I missed it I miss the people I missed

1228
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,735
I'm being in it missed the challenges

1229
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
Messing you refer to Tom's

1230
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Does a movement

1231
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,879
Rather than a business obviously

1232
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
You know there's a

1233
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
People are cynical about that

1234
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Oh that's true

1235
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,303
That's just Blake use it you know yeah he's just using that as a way to

1236
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
Generate more interest as business but

1237
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
Is that like is that how you see it a movement rather than a business

1238
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
You know I think I think that

1239
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
The movement part

1240
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
I really felt that

1241
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
When I cuss

1242
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Customers

1243
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
AR

1244
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Rain gauge

1245
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
In the

1246
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
The effect that there have

1247
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
And that

1248
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
Maybe buying a pair of Toms

1249
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,111
Was the first step or maybe it's

1250
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,183
The 10th step in their desire to

1251
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
To be more conscious

1252
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
Consumers in human

1253
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
And so

1254
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
To me that is more of a movement of a way of thinking

1255
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
And it is a business

1256
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Like you

1257
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
Menu you've read and

1258
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
And know about

1259
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,823
Do you know over the years people have said look you know

1260
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
This might sound like a

1261
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
The great business

1262
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
Actually X is

1263
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Disrupting markets

1264
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Days Inn

1265
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
Dashie not helping alleviate

1266
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Poverty

1267
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
And you know

1268
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Directions

1269
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Creating other problem

1270
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
I mean try some of those criticism

1271
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
AR

1272
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Aren't there some

1273
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
A merit to them right

1274
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
Yes I mean that the first in kind of most

1275
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
Prevalent criticism

1276
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,239
Has been like okay if Tom's really want to make a difference in the community

1277
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
They would not

1278
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,079
Just focus on a they would focus on job creation

1279
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
And that criticism was really difficult to hear it first because frankly I just didn't know how to address it like I agreed

1280
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:45,343
You know what yes and Theory would be amazing to create a bunch of jobs in Kenya

1281
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
But I mean

1282
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
How in the world am I going to figure that out

1283
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
I like everything else

1284
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,791
But ultimately back in mm

1285
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
I think it was

1286
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
The 12

1287
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
We made a pledge to

1288
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,239
Manufacture as many shoes as we could in the countries that we give in

1289
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,567
And today were manufacturing over 40%

1290
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
Have our giving shoes and Country

1291
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,199
Trees like Kenya Ethiopia India

1292
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
You lots of different places

1293
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,599
We're also giving so was that was at 8 direct response

1294
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
To your critics are sort of like saying you know what you're right

1295
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
It was

1296
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,023
It wasn't it was a it was a humbling experience in one where we had a

1297
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,607
Expressing vulnerability and say okay we don't have to do this french fry

1298
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,447
And we start small we scaled is moved on and it's actually been

1299
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,775
You know now it's something that we pride ourselves in is part of our business

1300
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,383
The idea of the buy one and then we'll go

1301
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Give one to somebody need really you know you

1302
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
You guys are crazy you are credited with

1303
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
Really starting to smiley

1304
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,599
Probably warrant the first they were probably other companies out there doing this but

1305
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,207
You know you did this on a very big scale incense and lots and lots and lots of

1306
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Companies

1307
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Have follow that model Warby Parker

1308
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
Another

1309
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
And it's been good for business.

1310
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Benadryl

1311
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Really good

1312
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
Yammy I think of all the things we're most proud of

1313
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
Toms like

1314
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,591
The Legacy that we've created in in this model has become

1315
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Not just

1316
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,455
Irrelevant model of Toms but with lots of companies around the world

1317
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,527
And it's encouraged even companies will be on the one Ford Model

1318
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,855
To incorporate giving more into their actual business

1319
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
This model not just

1320
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,463
A check that they write at the end of the year you know to a non-profit

1321
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
I think about like the Arc of your career

1322
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
I mean

1323
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
The laundry business for

1324
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
College students and the

1325
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
Outdoor advertising company and

1326
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,519
Reality TV channel in the knee

1327
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
TN driver's ed

1328
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
The school

1329
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
I mean very different from what

1330
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
Did you get with X write like

1331
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
Very very different

1332
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,527
Do you think that you could have done Tom's without

1333
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
Without doing all those

1334
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Biggest companies

1335
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
I don't think

1336
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
Tom's would be where it is today if I hadn't had the

1337
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
His experience

1338
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:03,839
The thinking behind Tom's was always there but it was always something that was more than

1339
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
In order of

1340
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Make money first

1341
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
Help others second

1342
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
Because that's how every other

1343
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Business person I've ever known

1344
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
Have done it you know I never

1345
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Had a rat about anyone that was

1346
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Helping people as they were building the business

1347
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,199
And I think that Tom's is

1348
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
Is like my soulmate a business

1349
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Venous Lake

1350
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
I get to be

1351
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Be creative

1352
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,855
I get to find meaning in that

1353
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
Yunnan

1354
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
Recognize it

1355
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Amount of wealth

1356
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,255
But now my wife and I were responsible for what

1357
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,791
Was far more than we would ever

1358
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
Men think about spending In Our Lifetime

1359
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
And so we made a real conscious

1360
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Decision to take half of it

1361
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,239
And and committed to investing in Social on

1362
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Entrepreneur so that the big part of my life now is

1363
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Actually investing in the Next Generation

1364
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
As a way to solve problems

1365
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
That that we are faced

1366
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Athens oh

1368
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
A huge blessing in all this is well Blake mycoskie founder of Toms

1369
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
Shoes by the way Tom has given away more than 70 million shoes in 70 countries around the world

1370
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
Back in 2014 Blake

1371
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,399
Sold half the company to a private Equity Group

1372
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,983
Up until then Tom's had never had a single investor

1373
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Do people call you Tom

1374
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
All the time

1375
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895

1376
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,455

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's timeout for how you built that

1389
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
And the story comes to us from

1390
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Chris Kiely in

1391
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,727
San Diego California any other entrepreneur

1392
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,311
Wanted to solve a problem but before we get to the problem

1393
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
Here's a bit about Chris

1394
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
My hair is blond

1395
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
It's

1396
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,039
About down to the middle of my back when you see me.

1397
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:35,903
Pretty much the first thing you're going to notice Chris and his buddy Lindsey

1398
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
And Chris and Lindsay

1399
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:43,839
They're both dudes with long hair and be like Brooke Shields in 1982 long

1400
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
And because of this

1401
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,703
They kept running into a problem that men with long hair face

1402
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
We go to the women's hair care oil

1403
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
Search

1404
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,383
For the hair ties that look the least girly

1405
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
That's what

1406
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:03,807
Guys with long hair have been doing for decades the struggle is real

1407
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
It's not a very fun experience when you have to choose something that is the

1408
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
Least bad option

1409
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:18,143
One day in this is back in 2014 when Chris was driving back with Lindsey after visiting

1410
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,031
It came to him I swear it just popped out that the word just popped out I got it

1411
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
Hair ties

1412
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:30,175
Guys in shorts a more manly man bun scrunchie

1413
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,247
Chris wanted a hair tie that was a little bit wider

1414
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
A little more comfortable

1415
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
And with some cool designs he wasn't seeing in the drugstore aisle everything from surfboard

1416
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
Lightning bolt

1417
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,791
Martini glasses camouflage

1418
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
Rocket launchers

1419
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
Fun designs

1420
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
So Chris and Lindsay.

1421
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
We got this

1422
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
Great idea

1423
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Let's make some hair ties

1424
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
Quick and easy

1425
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,871
But it wasn't so simple we started out buying our own material tying them off

1426
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:06,271
Finally going to manufacturing connection we got the first round with our designs printed on them not what we were looking for

1427
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
Finally probably five

1428
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,719
Samples later we finally got what we wanted and it took almost two years from the time that we had

1429
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:21,119
At the idea until we had the product ready to sell that was back in December 2015 and since then they've sold more than

1430
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,215
6000 packs of hair ties to customers all over the world

1431
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,519
Chris sells them on his website which

1432
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,799
Is elegantly called

1433
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
The longhairs

1434
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
And the sites got articles to

1435
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,175
Tutorials and tips for Men about

1436
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
How to grow your hair out

1437
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
And of course

1438
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Fit healthy and

1439
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:44,159
Glowing we truly are a Lifestyle brand because having long hair is a lifestyle it's a choice

1440
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
You are always reminded of your long hair and Brad Pitt

1441
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,351
Styles and of course David Beckham

1442
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,423
Celebrities who have all at some point

1443
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
Warren a man bun which is it

1444
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
Term Chris actually doesn't really like

1445
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,823
So we call it a highball

1446
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,639
Like a fine glass of scotch

1447
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
It's refined

1448
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Dignified

1449
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:13,087
And it portrays the proper respect of the fine men's hairstyle that it is

1450
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
Chrissy Lee co founder of the long-hairs

1451
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,231

Into the company

1453
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Need for now but eventually

1454
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
They have dreams

1455
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
Turn the longhairs

1456
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
