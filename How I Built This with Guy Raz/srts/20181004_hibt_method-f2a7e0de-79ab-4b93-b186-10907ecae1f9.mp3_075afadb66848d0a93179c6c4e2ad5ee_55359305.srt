00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,304
In the following message

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
Did come from Madewell

4
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,352
Where the motto is

5
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When is Good Day start

6
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,400
With great jeans

7
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
Madewell offer

8
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
Premium denim style

9
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,496
We're seriously every

10
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,032
Stop by a Madewell

11
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,824
Or go to Madewell.

12
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Define your

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Perfect pear

14
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,552
To prove that this really was not tok

15
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
You drank it in London you know I love the British press is so skeptical

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
And she said is it in a safe enough to drink outside sure so we both took a shot at 12

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
What cleaner and then I immediately text Adam finally got back to me as i k

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,336
I'm going to be okay right

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,224
From NPR how I built this

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists at the stories behind the movements

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
How to friends in their mid-20s mixed up some household ingredients to make soap and

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
And then took on and eventually outmaneuvered some of the

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Biggest companies

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
In the world

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
If you were looking to start a business

26
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
In the late 1990s

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,392
You probably didn't have to spend a lot of time convincing friends and family that it was a

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Good time to go into Tech

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,024
This was the height of the dotcom bubble and

30
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
It seemed like the future was

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Literally

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
By companies like Google and Yahoo

33
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
EBay and Amazon

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,288
So they can be kind of hard to imagine why 220 something

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Who lived

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
In San Francisco in the 1990s

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Wood survey this

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
Promising Landscaping say

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
You know what the world really needs right now

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Soap

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,160
Soap that will do a good job cleaning your kitchen counter or your toilet

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
But that

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
Won't destroy the planet in the process

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
And that is exactly what Adam Lowry and Eric Ryan set out to sell in mm

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Barry year the.com bubble

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,568
And the company they founded method with its sleep bottles

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
Products smelling like cucumber or bamboo

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Actually went on to compete with some of the biggest soap companies in the world but before they went into

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Adam and Eric were actually childhood friends they met when they were kids maybe 12 or 13 years old

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,304
Because they were both super into sailing

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,656
And both of their families worked in the Auto industry which

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Pretty much what everyone did where they grew up

53
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Grosse Pointe Michigan

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Almost everyone that I can remember

55
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
Their families were involved in a

56
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
I think arakur

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Family

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,576
Great-grandfather dropped out of pharmacy school and move to Detroit to work for Henry for $5 a day

59
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:09,696
And then ultimately Henry Ford Ford stock that

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,536
Was bought when Henry was still running the company by my great-grandfather

61
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Didn't I

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400
Great-grandfather and grandfather together started machine and stamping

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,264
Giant presses that come down so they would make a lot of parts that went on

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
The automobiles

65
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
And so I kind of grew up

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,248
In the shadows of my great-grandfather and grandfather babies entrepreneurs who created something from nothing

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Adam Merrick

68
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Collagist was an early 90s Adam went to the West Coast he studied chemical engineering at Stanford

69
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
What's the East Coast

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Business at the University of Rhode Island

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Both of them were actually recruited by the university sailing team they were serious Sailors and to be clear

72
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
In college Adam and Eric didn't really keep in touch

73
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Just whenever they were back in Michigan

74
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
So after graduating Adam stayed in the Bay Area to work for the Carnegie Institute of science he was doing research

75
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Church on climate change

76
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
And Eric got a job in advertising

77
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
Eventually made his way out to San Francisco as well

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
And shortly after that

79
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,399
They both just happened to run into each other on a flight

80
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,007
I think it was Thanksgiving if I'm not mistaken 1-year Maybe 97-98

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
I walk on the plane I see Eric and I didn't know that

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
He was living in

83
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
You'd only move there

84
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
A couple weeks ago

85
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,807
And so there was an open seat I ended up sitting next to him on the plane we

86
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
For 5 hours got all caught up

87
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
It turned out we were living on the exact same block

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Just out of

89
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Pure

90
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Coincidence

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
And

92
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
I was living in a flat

93
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
With

94
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
For other

95
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Guys from

96
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Stanford

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
And Eric was living lion

98
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Himself in a one-bedroom

99
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
When one of those guys rotated out we

100
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
Invited Erica move into the apartment

101
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,151
And then we were roommates when you could actually live in San Fran

102
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Cisco

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
For a reasonably

104
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Low amount of rent

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
I paid $600 a month

106
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Oh my God this is 1997-98 amazing

107
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
So you move into this group house

108
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
Doing what you doing on your early twenties or whatever and

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
In the house

110
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Just like a six guys in a

111
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Emily Natsu

112
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Super clean

113
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
It was exactly as clean as you would

114
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Expected to be

115
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
I mean

116
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Either of you at that time

117
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
In your mind

118
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Or either of you thinking

119
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Business or you just kind of

120
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
Grinding away doing your day-to-day job

121
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
I mean for me personally I

122
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
I knew since the third grade I want to be.

123
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
You're annoying neighborhood

124
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Kitty was constantly selling buttons or anything else I could so I just I always knew I wanted to start a company and I love

125
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
I fell in love with advertising and branding

126
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
But

127
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
I knew

128
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,655
It's pretty uncommon as an entrepreneur your first company will be successful

129
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
So I kind of wanted to build

130
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
A little bit of a safety net of a career but I was

131
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Constantly noodling on ideas

132
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,639
For me personally just coming up with the right one that would eventually take Elite Four

133
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Adam

134
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
For me it is the journey talk

135
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Bernard ship was less predestined

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
My parents are both on

137
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
First they started their business

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
1980s

139
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
What would serve

140
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
It's an automotive sales rep

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Business

142
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
Representing Parts suppliers in the automotive industry but

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,679
When I was 6 7 years old moms making

144
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Chili for the week for myself and my older brother and my older sister and I watched them build

145
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
The business and do it in a way that was much higher

146
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
Then the risk that Eric and I

147
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,271
You are so young We Were Young we didn't have family

148
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Mortgages and any of that so well Eric kind of always knew going entrepreneurs

149
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
As soon as I can for me I am motivated by

150
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,071
Creating some sort of good change in the world

151
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
And I'm a big believer in that you don't need to figure out

152
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
What you need to do with your life

153
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
You just need to figure out what you want to do now

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
2

155
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
What were you noticing

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
In 1999 that

157
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Eventually you will

158
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Would lead to

159
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
What was going on around me

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
I was working on a project

161
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
4 Colgate so spending a lot of time in the grocery store

162
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
And I just started looking at the

163
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,023
The cleaning aisle and saw that it was such a big category

164
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
But a sea of sameness

165
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
Everything looked and smelled the same

166
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
The brands were pretty dated

167
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
So that was kind of Clue

168
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Dig here

169
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
But I mean you're 25 not get you working on an ad campaign

170
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Colgate so that

171
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Accessory starter kit

172
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Exposure to that end

173
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Like

174
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
It could have been anything I mean it could have been chewing gum like you could have

175
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
What was it that

176
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
That made you think

177
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Cleaning supplies

178
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
Will it really I think with any ideas

179
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Do you start off with

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Absolute place of insecurity

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
But as much as my mom she's like

182
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
I've never seen you

183
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
You make it better you sure you're the right person.

184
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Start a cleaning products business

185
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
So I hid the

186
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
The products underneath my bed

187
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,127
Because I didn't is pretty dorky I didn't want anybody to know I was even thinking about this category

188
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
And admire both back in Michigan

189
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,527
And we were driving up North early morning to go

190
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,135
Skiing and been close friends I felt like Adam with somebody I could

191
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Share an idea with

192
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Is the winter 99

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
I need to know there was skiing in Michigan but keep going

194
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
It is technically it's okay

195
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Yes

196
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
And I

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
Mention that hey I think there may be an opportunity

198
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Innespace

199
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
And I remember Adam

200
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Looks over me as he's driving

201
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Mangos

202
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
You know the degree in chemical engineering

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
And then we just it was sort of one thing leading to another that

204
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
And I said well you know not only these

205
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Product really ugly butt

206
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Did you know they're super toxic

207
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Might as well

208
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Right

209
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
And that was kind of

210
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,351
Where one idea gets added to another and it kind

211
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Are you the one

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Play remember us

213
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
We

214
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Got to go skiing

215
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
And we went up the first chairlift

216
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
And

217
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,639
We did a couple runs has been more excited to go work on this idea that we were to keep skating

218
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Tips to paint the picture for like

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,087
Cleaning supplies products in 99 like if I'm going into Safeway and I

220
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
I'm going to get 409 I'm going to get

221
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Brighton release

222
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Strong sense there's kind of like

223
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
If your eyes weren't watering it means it wasn't cleaned

224
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
Toxic category

225
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Wait that was a thing that

226
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
She brought that really opened my eyes insight

227
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,871
You mean like you actually blue when you clean and use

228
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Poison to make your home healthier

229
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,831
And this is like the winter of 1999 were you still working at the Carnegie Institute

230
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
I stepped down from

231
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Carnegie

232
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
I did

233
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
There is an important detail here

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
I quit my job in

235
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
September

236
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
And in October was the Olympic trials

237
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
4

238
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
Olympics sale

239
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
And and I had been

240
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
With USA

241
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Is on the US Sailing

242
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
7 years

243
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
We did not win the Olympic

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
3rd and

245
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
And so

246
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
That

247
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
Period of time for a couple of months there I

248
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
I just finished the Olympic trials

249
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
I was doing a bunch of interviews

250
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Product design firms

251
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Looking for a job

252
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Engineering firms yeah

253
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
In the Bay Area

254
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
So so right

255
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Then and there that moment you both

256
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
It was almost a perfect storm for you a time cuz you were

257
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
I have

258
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Transition phase Eric you were were still working

259
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
The Ad Agency

260
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Which actually

261
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
Was giving you this incredible experience

262
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Open your eyes

263
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
This to this

264
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
It's her world that you had

265
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Expose to the right

266
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah it really understanding like

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Understanding consumerism

268
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,647
This was really kind of driven by so you go back to 1999 Ikea was just arriving in America

269
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Home and Garden television was just taking off

270
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
So it was a time where people were starting to think more about their

271
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Holmes azra

272
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Reflection of themselves

273
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
Instead of thought was well what if we designed these

274
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Products of the world

275
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Like pieces of decor

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
And hey if a

277
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Spray cleaner was beautiful enough to lead on the counter versus

278
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Is hidden underneath the

279
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
The sink out of sight out of mind

280
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
You might actually use it more

281
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,783
And I've loved the phrase like there's no such thing as low entry

282
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Categories

283
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Just low-interest Brad's

284
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
So I thought was

285
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
How do we take boring cleaning

286
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
And not make it boring

287
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
So what happened after that

288
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Christmas tree

289
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
To Michigan

290
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
You come back to San Francisco and

291
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
You do what

292
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
So

293
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Yeah I was in the middle of it

294
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
And I said hey you know I'm going to

295
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Look for some job

296
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
But I'm going to start doing

297
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Researching

298
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Trying to figure out these

299
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Categories

300
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,199
Do some of the digging that Eric had a full-time job

301
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Is adverb

302
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Didn't have a ton of time to do and I said I'll start to do this

303
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
I actually at one point had a desk in Eric's bedroom

304
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Where I would work on

305
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
Some of this stuff while I was gone

306
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Kind of continuing my job search

307
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
We're writing the business

308
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Plan

309
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Together I was doing a lot of that research

310
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
Goodnight we kind of put the pieces together

311
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
So you already decide what's

312
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Make a go at this

313
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
What was Israelites

314
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
You're the hardest thing with

315
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Starting

316
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
He Is We are really insecure about this idea

317
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
5040

318
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,367
25 and we're going to take on only some of the largest multinationals but the world's first multitask

319
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
The form of Proctor

320
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Can you deliver

321
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
1250 year heads

322
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Start

323
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
And it really you know own distribution

324
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,911
What was that your vision in 1999 make this and see who buys it

325
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
That we have a reset from the beginning like

326
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
Go big or go home

327
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,687
But I didn't feel very secure getting there so one of the first things we did was we trade what we called the concept book

328
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
And so we brought to life the idea

329
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
Give it to the 20 smartest people we knew

330
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
And ask them shoot holes in them

331
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
Nice for what professors

332
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Friends family got everything from people who actually found some former Clorox employee

333
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,655
These lawyers of people going to finance background advertising just like

334
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Tell us why it's going to fail

335
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
And nobody could come back with a reason other than if it's so good why is nobody done this before

336
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Yeah where they'd say

337
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
The reason it's going to fail is because

338
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
They're begging you

339
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
You're small

340
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Which we didn't

341
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
That's not a reason

342
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
This is still the

343
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Before the.

344
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Come

345
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,231
Crash against the.com right on top of it and April

346
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,791
I remember it well but this is a time when

347
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Most people your age

348
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
At that time we're moving to this area get involved in

349
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Text company

350
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Trebeache

351
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
So what are you doing everybody said that

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
Add friends who are raising $40 on

353
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
40 page business plans and bragging about $1000000 per page for a raise or do these lavish launch parties which seems so

354
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
Ridiculous now to spend funds on a lunch party

355
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
But yeah this was San Francisco to turn of the century and money was being

356
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Thrown around and Tech

357
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
And should we horse showing up pitching

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Soap and idea that was hot a hundred twenty years ago

359
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
When do you actually

360
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Mix

361
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,847
Stuff together get it get it was a dish soap was it cleaner

362
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
What was the first thing that you

363
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,711
Yes right around that time so the mid-2000s

364
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,295
It was mostly me mixing those things

365
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Well

366
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
You can make cleaning products out of

367
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Very

368
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,463
Standard things that you can buy in the grocery

369
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Like whatever

370
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
Of course water vinegar baking soda

371
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
These are relative

372
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
Simple chemicals that don't require

373
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,775
Professional Lab in order to mix them together

374
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,103
And that's why I came home one day and Adam was

375
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,735
Mixing things in beer pictures which

376
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
What what what do you remember mixing

377
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
Well I think there's different

378
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Soaps and different

379
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Detergents

380
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Yeah you can make soap from

381
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Basically a base

382
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
And an oil soap

383
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Boil and the bass you bring those together to make a soap

384
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
For solvency UK

385
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Like vinegar

386
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Some of the acids that are present in things like orange juice

387
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Very

388
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Common everyday

389
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Mild

390
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Chemicals that

391
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
You formulating differ

392
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Current ways

393
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,967
To achieve a certain cleaning

394
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
Function and you mention dish soap

395
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Hard surface

396
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Cleaners that kind of thing

397
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,159
Were you awake I'm trying to mention where you would look in your

398
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,743
Room or in the kitchen of this group house like

399
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
With action pack it like pouring in Imagine sort of

400
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
16 oz jars maybe if plastic

401
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Glass containers of

402
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Orange oil

403
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
Baking soda and then I would just experiment I would try different formulations and I would make experiments the way

404
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
Way that a scientist does so that you

405
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,039
You know you can have a control and in an experiment and you

406
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
Yeah I was just a little bit of process to getting to something that work really well to Eric while Adam was

407
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Looking into

408
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Category and looking at

409
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Ingredients of Fort Worth

410
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
What are you doing

411
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,959
So our plan was to create our first four products which were the surface cleaners

412
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Get them in the local stores

413
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,639
So Adam was working on basically doing everything in the bottle and I was doing everything kind of around the bottle

414
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
And this joke was dialing something

415
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
Until what I started doing was we we didn't have a lot of

416
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Money to do custom tooling

417
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,231
And so I started looking for stock bottles cuz I think I really like

418
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Cytus

419
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Camping water bottle

420
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
From Norway that I found just a really simple kind of bullet design with these nice elegant shoulder as he had his

421
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Are utilitarian but the same time would look on the second base sitting in someone's home

422
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
So we use that as the basis for the first bottle and how are you paying for the

423
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
Okay We've ran the business out of pocket for about 2 years

424
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
How much money did you have at the beginning

425
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
How much money is YouTube

426
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
We'd put in $45,000

427
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
All the money

428
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
YouTube you had yeah my grandfather passed away

429
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
With that money

430
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
And so will I

431
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
We put it right in the method

432
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
And you split it 50-50

433
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
At the beginning

434
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
Yep put it down on paper and you called a method

435
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
At the time yeah we had something at the name by then

436
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
We wanted a name that represented a technique

437
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
A new approach

438
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Do you make things

439
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,183
And I remember both brushing her teeth at the same time

440
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
Sounds very weird

441
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Yeah basically one

442
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
How about method I like that's it

443
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
How did you come up with

444
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
I don't know I just thought of it

445
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Is bottles that you really like

446
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Were you just

447
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Binders at the Shelf

448
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Summer

449
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,247
Now we we did every design was so important

450
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
Big chunk of that the Dallas we had went into tooling we just going to forward that Expo design but to link

451
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,279
Find the bottle know we basically took inspiration from this bottle I found in Europe

452
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,167
And then had a supplier kind of do the engineering of it yeah and then build the bottle molds which

453
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,519
Ate up most of the investment

454
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
We had the bottles and we were making product home

455
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Look like funnels paper towels

456
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
You were filling the bottles yourself you're bringing them to your apartment with a funnel in just pouring it in and closing it up

457
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
Okay and we wanted

458
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,999
We wanted to feel very different than everything else out there but also to really show it was you no say

459
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,351
Safe to be around you think about when most people clean they would put on that you know that old

460
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
Team building exercise sweatshirt from 1998 in the rubber gloves cuz you don't want to stop touching your skin

461
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:29,151
Cypress labels were very different they actually showed people on the front of it and put it in any money so we would go

462
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
Go to Home Depot and buy sink and photograph Adam holding the stink probably return the thing to get her money back

463
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,951
If you fast forward to late February of 2001 by now

464
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,023
Call Eric and I have product prototypes and

465
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,375
We were taking these prototypes around walking into grocery stores unannounced

466
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,959
And cornering the store manager and try and get them to buy a product

467
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
And so we got a grocer

468
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Restore

469
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
February

470
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
To say yeah 2001

471
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Yeah it was actually February 28th

472
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
2001

473
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
So we had bothered the store manager enough

474
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
He said fine guys

475
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
I'm going to give you some

476
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
But you have to get the product

477
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
This was in Burlingame

478
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
In the mid peninsula

479
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Of

480
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
San Francisco

481
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Store called

482
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Mollie Stone's

483
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
Yeah it's essentially what we need to do is get a proof-of-concept so we decided the first step was to try to get into

484
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
All the independent

485
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Grocery stores in the Bay Area

486
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,799
These are the places with that manager can make the buying decision

487
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Cigar shop at 6 a.m.

488
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
This guy is always really grumpy

489
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
And I think it's actually they just agree to take your product

490
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
Because they know you're going to

491
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Keep coming back

492
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,343
Until they say yes will you going to the store Burlingame you went to Malta

493
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Apple X

494
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,439
And in the first time you went there the manager was like I'm not interested

495
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
I mean imagine doing this

496
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
6 in the morning

497
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
With a with a store manager they are not in

498
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
At first Mall store manager

499
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Just don't take sales calls right so that was

500
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
That's not how you get a product

501
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Groceries

502
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
But it was the only way

503
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
How so

504
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
They weren't used to

505
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
I seen that

506
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
And

507
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
So there was a lot of

508
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
To the store in Burlingame

509
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
You got out the car

510
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,295
A&a products glass

511
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Of the stores

512
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
Close your the back door

513
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672
And we waited till they were open

514
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,024
Stocking the shelves still like all the trucks are coming in during the delivery and she's busy

515
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Yeah it was the best training cuz we don't know how to sell

516
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
And you have 30 seconds

517
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
The pitch

518
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
And so it really helped you

519
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
Learn how to sell the product

520
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,616
And every time until that day at multiple stores

521
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Osher doesn't

522
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,480
I mean after a full day of going round pitching this

523
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,320
Using a lot of emotional energy would you calm feeling like dejected

524
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,416
That and nobody depending on the day

525
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
What am I doing

526
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
A million

527
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
Write an essay for me

528
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Personally like

529
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
The cold call

530
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
Was a hard thing to learn how to do

531
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
And yeah sometimes you know you get a bunch of rejections it's a little bit demoralize

532
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,552
Rising but you know we got it going before we got so demoralized it would quit

533
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:21,952
Let me come back how a Longshot email to a famous industrial designer and a big bed

534
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
Dish soap landed method on the shelves of Target stay with us

535
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

565
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
So it's 2

566
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
2001 + Adam and Eric

567
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,352
Get the first method cleaning products into a grocery store in the Bay Area

568
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
Infrequently

569
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
They realize that they couldn't just make all the stuff in the

570
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Kitchen

571
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Weather San Francisco group house

572
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
They start to think about building a

573
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Supply chain

574
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
Make more of a product

575
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Funny wild and out

576
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
They're showing up at different stores

577
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,088
Trying to convince customers to try out method soap

578
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
One person at a time

579
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,464
We didn't have Market hours what would you do weird offer demos

580
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
So we did that

581
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Of course we didn't do a demo so that would be

582
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
Would be me

583
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,496
He set up a table and I was wearing a lab coat which is comical to look back years later

584
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,592
And it's kind of funny I look at these photos I was standing in the wine aisle

585
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
I think I just realized that people shopping for wine were way more interesting

586
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
Talk to thin people shopping for cleaning products

587
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
But

588
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,856
We were really big Believers at the packaging would have to be the primary Mercury vehicle

589
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
And you would see it on shelf

590
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Because the design

591
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Buy it because of younique fragrances

592
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
To get home

593
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Find out it works

594
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
Turn the bottle over

595
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
And realize it's good for you and go to the planet

596
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
And that would suck to create a following

597
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
And if you talk to most Americans at that time

598
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
They would say green doesn't

599
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,664
The only way we're going to make us work as we had to get the mainstream into a green product

600
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
And we thought a lot of it as it

601
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
The Trojan Horse for good

602
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Where to put a green credentials

603
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Is on the back of the

604
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
The bottle and I was kind of high.

605
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
So

606
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
After you got into

607
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Mollie Stone's

608
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
What was the next step how did you get to the next

609
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
Or same process talk to the manager in

610
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
The first step was that I believe there were 10 Molly stones at

611
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
That time there

612
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
I think more than that now

613
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
None of her other similar chains

614
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
Premium high-end more Gourmet Focus

615
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,640
Grocery stores that we went to in the Bay Area but we did it

616
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,992
We built these 30 stores we called it our paper route so every morning we take turns

617
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
Driving to each store

618
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Counting how many sold

619
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
Replenishing at writing up an invoice

620
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
And was a way for us to really understand the grocery business

621
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
A Big Moment of Truth came through when

622
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,632
Yeah we did have a customer service number so my cell phone was on the back of every bottle

623
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,936
And I never getting this first call

624
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
From this person who just wanted

625
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,312
Call to say how much they loved our cucumber bathroom cleaner

626
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
There was a friend of mine

627
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,248
But these calls started coming and we realized like we really struck a bit of an emotional

628
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Chord

629
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,880
And a category that traditionally is so low interest and so boring

630
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
And it's just

631
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
24/7 us

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Working

633
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
All the time

634
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
On this

635
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,632
Yeah me the challenges you know of any startup a particularly in the space momentum is

636
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
And that's a raise Capital you need to show momentum

637
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
So yeah I always felt this race against

638
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
The clock to grow as fast as

639
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Is it possible

640
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
Pretty soon into this thing

641
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Saying enter in 2001

642
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
It becomes

643
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Clear that

644
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
You got a raise

645
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
You got to get

646
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Because ninety thousand bucks

647
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Is only take you so far

648
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Patachou

649
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
What's the next step how did you get

650
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
The family

651
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
That was a saga

652
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
I mean we're constantly running

653
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
The cash and so we were getting

654
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,192
Five grand 10 grand here from every friend family

655
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
Person that would give us money

656
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
And

657
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Did that

658
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
For about

659
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Almost 2 years

660
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
To run the business and all told it was maybe

661
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Couple hundred thousand dollars that we got that way

662
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
Before we were able to raise our first

663
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Professional money

664
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
The people who believe in you more than a necessarily believe in

665
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Your idea

666
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
And

667
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,488
I also found it so motivating cuz is one thing like for admire

668
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
Did I lose our own money or fail

669
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,144
But when you're taking money from people you really care about our roommates

670
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Grandma Mae

671
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
Curdling parents

672
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
You don't want to let them down

673
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
And I was encouraged entrepreneurs to take money from family because I think it's the best motivation to ensure that no matter how

674
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Hard things get

675
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
You going to find a

676
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Path forward

677
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,368
So you know funding this

678
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Anyway you can

679
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
At what point are you able to

680
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
At what point do you decide

681
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Hey we got to go to like

682
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
People big money people in and get an infusion

683
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Investment

684
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
We decided that really early on

685
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
But it took a long time

686
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
So it was probably I mean even by mid-2000

687
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
We knew we were going to need to get capital

688
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Run the business but

689
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Took another year at least

690
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Before we were able to get a professional in

691
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Bastard

692
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,672
Design on the bottom how much did the first round was $1000000

693
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Is one firm

694
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
One investor

695
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
And we were scheduled to sign the timesheet on what turned out to be September 11th in so

696
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
In the months that followed we were stalled because of

697
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Course nobody was doing

698
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
Deals with the uncertainty in the world particularly in a

699
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
Premium-priced cleaning products

700
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,432
And finally closed in November

701
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
And you always have a closing dinner when you raise capital and we went around the room to pay the bill

702
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,672
Afterwards in between Adam and I none of our credit cards work

703
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:23,072
Musically we knew the person who owned the restaurant that we had them if we can pay him next week after we closed

704
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
And yeah so all we had inventory and Order

705
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,080
All that was on credit cards

706
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
On the face that

707
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
We would ultimately get the

708
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Investment

709
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
That was a scary time

710
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
What was your

711
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
What did you think convince them

712
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
To give you the money

713
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
A big part of our pitch was

714
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Sherwin-Williams proven locally and regionally

715
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
And the argument that we were going to go get Target next

716
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,960
And that we needed Capital to be able to close Target and starts a scale National

717
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,824
Did you even even say that we talked into Target before you had

718
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
No not at all because

719
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Because we wanted to

720
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
To be able to get the capital but we started doing it

721
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
With karim rashid

722
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
Who is very famous industrial designer

723
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
And

724
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
We wanted to

725
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Create a line of products

726
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Working with

727
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
Karen that would make a real statement of marketplace

728
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
Just supposed to take care of her she dislike

729
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
A huge industrial designer like

730
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
He's made products

731
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Explorer

732
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,192
A certain design Pepsi bottles in

733
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496
Iconic furniture

734
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Perfume bottles like

735
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
You guys are

736
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,432
Mid-twenties like how did you connect with this guy and why would he even answer your call

737
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
We were huge believer in the power of design

738
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
And great industrial design to put a list together of the top industrial designers Karen with a stop at last

739
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,208
We just work down the list until we finally

740
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Got somebody to work with us

741
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
And I shot Carrom

742
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,912
An email video

743
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
Shady Nook Oldham

744
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Okay

745
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
NSAID acuzar pitch

746
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:13,152
We want to work with you to redesign the dish soap and object that sits across

747
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,480
Every sink in the landscape of America

748
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
Will you work with us

749
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
And he wrote back within 20 minutes and said he has

750
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,184
Well I do remember Sandy category first met us for the briefing he

751
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Play 50 Cent Josh

752
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,816
Handy who we work with at the time he's like a new try to get some of the payment up front

753
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Yeah we were able to

754
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,824
Convince him to do it for a lower fee cuz I really believe in the project but also with equi

755
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
And

756
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,176
Gave you no got enough skin in the game with us

757
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
So he agreed to do it

758
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
Take me to do it which was absolutely amazing and they the

759
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
The time Target was working with bleach dark

760
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
We knew that interesting

761
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
And working with Cara

762
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,720
And so what we did was working with caramel

763
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
We are able to use kind of Karam as a carrot

764
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
To get a meeting with Target marketing

765
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
Who invited the buying team

766
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,496
We did a big dog and pony show with Karen how to spend

767
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Premature last dollars

768
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Kind of went all in on this

769
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,896
It don't really know this company would have ever

770
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248
When I do exist if it weren't for the risk we took on our dish soap

771
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
And Adam

772
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Miracles

773
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,696
To get the first prototype of the dish soap

774
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,536
It arrived moments before the presentation actual soap

775
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
Add soap in the bottle

776
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
And that what was unique about this product

777
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,192
Did Karen had designed is that it was upside down

778
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
So the distal came out of the body

779
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,848
It was on this inside that everybody know you always turn it over it's a weird experience

780
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Shout out of the bottom

781
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Beautiful sort of

782
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Sculptural

783
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
This is an important detail I was not actually at the meeting because as Eric mentioned

784
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
To leave literally the very last moment

785
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
We're

786
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
Putting together

787
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
The product I was in the factory

788
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Doing that

789
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
24/7

790
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
4 weeks in preparation

791
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
So I was like sleeping on the factory floor

792
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Doing that whole

793
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
Thing and then I Fed Ex this thing first overnight

794
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
To Eric

795
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
For the pit

796
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Were you nervous I mean

797
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
This is like a make-or-break meeting

798
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
Oh it was

799
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,736
I mean I was trying to work in my business school application

800
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Just as backup

801
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Because

802
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Yammy

803
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
You knew that

804
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
If we could not get

805
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
A national retailer behind it

806
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
The economics ranking to make sense

807
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,608
Wikipedia guess people who know they own their own plants they had a hundred fifty years to figure out efficiency

808
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,192
And we were charging initially that $5 a bottle to keep bringing the

809
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
The price down to make it

810
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
More competitive so you were losing money

811
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Everybody lyrics

812
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Do we need a scale

813
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
And we needed a fast

814
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
What happened at that meeting

815
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
God is able to a test

816
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,600
Marketing stood up at the end and said this is right for a guess it's

817
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,976
Design forward on Trend and so Target gave us a 90 store test

818
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
To basically prove ourselves

819
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Giselle

820
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Dish soap

821
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
And

822
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
And service

823
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
And do you remember how many units a bot

824
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Oh they bought

825
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
Initially about

826
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
25000

827
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
A lot of a lot of

828
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,272
Yeah yeah

829
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,320
Target

830
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
Not really because we knew if we fail that test we were out of business it was Mega break there was I mean

831
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:45,120
Triumphant like yeah we got this test which was great but I mean I remember

832
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
That moment vividly because my heart sank because you know I had to then make sure that we could get twin

833
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,920
25000 units made with perfect quality in all of this

834
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Includes things like

835
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
Long lead times for making

836
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Bottles

837
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
In all this type of stuff that

838
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,720
It never should have been able to be done in 8 weeks I still to this day don't exactly know how we got it done but we

839
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,584
Yeah there's a thing that always ran through our business that when you hit a roadblock

840
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Yeah you get out

841
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:22,752
Paperclip in the chewing gum in the rubber band and you figure out another way around

842
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,592
And you know making 25000 units

843
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,408
Was just another sort of MacGyver moment

844
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
Do you know if you're going to build a business

845
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
It's hard

846
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
And you've got to be incredibly resourceful and for us that was very real because it was born from all of

847
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
These times where we went the past you were supposed to go

848
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,328
And a door got slammed in our face and we had to figure out another way

849
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Soap mid-2000

850
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
To you are in 90 Target

851
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
And you've got a hit

852
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
A certain

853
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Target

854
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
For them to

855
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Spend out

856
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Further

857
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
How'd you do that how did you

858
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,576
Create awareness around the product but we didn't hit that Target as it turns out

859
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,392
First thing we did was there the set date

860
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
And so we had to make sure we got on shop as fast fossil

861
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,304
Fox we start driving store to store go in if it's not set up you go to the bathroom

862
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,864
You pull it out yourself you take whatever's on shelf

863
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
Off you get your product on shelf

864
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Quickly

865
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
But

866
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,288
We started out first week looking the numbers were missing the number

867
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Innovative

868
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Problem

869
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Which was

870
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:37,504
The dish soap that we did which was the first ever inverted dispenser so it comes out of the bottom

871
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
Consumers would go to smell it cuz the

872
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
The fragrances were really unique at the

873
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
And it would

874
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Olaf

875
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
Bottom in a way it wasn't supposed to really come off

876
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
So that didn't really go back on

877
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,816
And thinking we're great Merchants we put that on the top shelf

878
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
So weird walk in the stores

879
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
And there's just dish soap raining down already

880
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Tire display

881
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
It's hard to sell a product when it's

882
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Yeah

883
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
And it's really hard to clean up dish soap

884
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
India Love

885
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
What store

886
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
But how are you I mean

887
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,296
You had to hit this Target and you you didn't

888
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
So what happened why did Target

889
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
You caring

890
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Ultimately it was

891
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,768
Why we weren't hitting the number of units of sell-through that

892
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
They gave us for a well-known brand on promotion

893
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
And all that

894
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
We're doing reasonably

895
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
Well unfortunately

896
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
A buyer at

897
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Target

898
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
Realize

899
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,544
That it wasn't just a number of units

900
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
That we were selling

901
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
But the type of

902
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
People that were

903
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,712
Buying our products and the other types of products that they were buying in

904
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Who were they

905
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
Yeah they were they were people that were sort of the millennial equivalent

906
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,136
What's the day right there were young they were

907
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,976
More Dynamic more slightly more urban

908
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
A higher-end audience these are

909
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Exactly the types of shoppers

910
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Target costumes

911
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,984
That they wanted to get in their store they knew that that was a highly valuable

912
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,848
Chopper for that dick that's a paradigm we really broke and I guess I'll take credit for it cuz we haven't found anybody who did it

913
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Before I spot

914
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Eco-chic

915
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
End

916
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
Traditionally

917
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
Green products Dental

918
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Look beautiful

919
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
And beautiful products

920
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Necessarily green

921
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
And I think a lot of it is

922
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
Just coming down our own dumb luck of atoms

923
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Passion for sustainability

924
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Mine for design

925
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
SI Target made so much sense because

926
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
We just needed a bigger platform to drive change

927
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
So

928
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
After Target

929
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,776
At that point did it become easier to get into other big

930
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Box stores not retailers

931
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
I wouldn't call it easy

932
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
But what I would say is

933
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Every next

934
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
Retailer every next

935
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Financing

936
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
Get incrementally easier

937
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,064
And that's really

938
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
That's momentum right

939
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
If you build

940
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,232
It really at the end of the day I believe that business is about starting with a really small

941
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
That's a small

942
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
Success and building into a slightly larger one and if you do that a couple times whether it's going from direct-store-delivery at Paulista

943
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,472
Stones to some Regional Grocers to a test at Target

944
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,056
You only have to do that a number of times and you can build

945
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
A pretty big business

946
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
It's not easy

947
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
But the more you do it

948
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
It gets easier to get bigger and bigger

949
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,296
It's interesting that you started really with Target

950
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,672
Because we had John Mackey on the show was that other products that really started out at Whole Foods

951
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
They were not toxic and environmentally

952
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Friendly

953
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
A hard time getting home

954
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Is that true

955
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Yeah I mean

956
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
You know I'd lie

957
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
They didn't like that we were already

958
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
In a mainstream retailer

959
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
And we were just very up front

960
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Listen we think that we've got a product

961
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
That your shoppers

962
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Really going to enjoy

963
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Recent look like a green product

964
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
We don't wear the uniform of

965
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,440
Agreed we wanted to change that cuz we those weren't the people we want we want people to buy our product

966
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Would never consider buying

967
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
It is important to note here like

968
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
I think it's totally pointless to make a green product

969
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
For green people

970
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Right there

971
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Only about 5% of

972
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,520
Products in the US market that are sold our

973
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Green

974
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Products

975
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,128
So if all you're doing is preaching to the converted

976
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
In the 5% like what are you do

977
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
We want to create a product that

978
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
Fairfield to everyone

979
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,320
And not just people that are only going to shop on their Environmental

980
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
At one point Erik Satie

981
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Proves that this really was non-toxic

982
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
You actually drank it

983
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
But you drank what would you do

984
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
What did you drink which one did you drink

985
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
So is it in London

986
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
And

987
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
You know I love the British press are so skeptical

988
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
And I was talking about a product

989
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Is that

990
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
There are not toxic

991
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
And Save

992
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
And

993
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
She said is it

994
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,432
I'm safe enough to drink outside

995
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Sure

996
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
And it was a toilet bowl cleaner

997
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,344
And so we both took a shot the toilet bowl cleaner

998
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
And then I immediately

999
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
Text Adam is still you know he was still sleeping here and finally got back to me as i k

1000
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,280
Citristrip the toilet bowl cleaner

1001
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm going to be okay

1002
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Right

1003
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,400
He writes back what would have been my first

1004
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,984
Choice

1005
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,312
Ended up on Japanese television the number of time

1006
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Is drinking a lot of mess

1007
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
How

1008
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Quickly

1009
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
When did you actually

1010
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,064
Become profitable wind went what's the news about 5 years in

1011
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Mm

1012
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
5 week

1013
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
In process after you're in Target

1014
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
It's all over the country and

1015
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Still takes

1016
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
Sometime

1017
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
Before you turn

1018
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
Play fast for a consumer product is

1019
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
Seagal from nothing

1020
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Too profitable

1021
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
About 5 years

1022
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
Free quick how much money did you have to raise before

1023
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
Stop raising money

1024
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
I'm just fun because 25 mil

1025
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
25 million

1026
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
We felt we had to grow fast

1027
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Both

1028
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Keep

1029
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,039
Startup competitors away but also all the Legacy brands

1030
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
Restoring a copy of

1031
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
I'm sure right cuz

1032
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
Because you guys had this

1033
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,975
People were like I love this product right they did try to

1034
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
There were a number of brands that were launched

1035
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Bye

1036
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Large

1037
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Cpg Clorox

1038
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
All of those

1039
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,775
But what was interesting is it was so funny and in Eric predict

1040
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
To his credit

1041
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
He predicted that they wouldn't

1042
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Be able to get it right

1043
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,687
And what they launched

1044
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Yeah

1045
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
Invariably was sort of the same old like

1046
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Pistol grip bottle

1047
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
With the finger grooves in it that happens to run down there lines already it was like a different label on it and then slap a fly

1048
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Flower on it

1049
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
With some sort of like

1050
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
Name

1051
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
It just was like

1052
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
Come on you know an invaded through a lot of money at that

1053
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Apple email

1054
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
Really scary

1055
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,519
Did it cut into your absolute disease in the short-term

1056
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
It did

1057
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,335
But because you know they weren't

1058
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Authentic products

1059
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
They weren't

1060
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
Interesting Prada

1061
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Text they were just sort of

1062
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
You know people would try them once and

1063
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
And they got promoted so they

1064
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
Play Capture Shoppers that way

1065
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
But then it just

1066
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
The product

1067
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,695
Didn't perform

1068
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
The bay companies

1069
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
So

1070
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
I guess for a 2008 UD

1071
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
Decide to Branch out into

1072
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
2 personal care products

1073
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
What was that name of the

1074
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Label

1075
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Block

1076
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
And you say that in a very

1077
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Matter-of-fact way

1078
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
This was

1079
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Shower gel in hair

1080
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Shampoo and stuff like that

1081
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,855
The original idea was actually this really kind of beautiful organic

1082
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Shape

1083
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
13 stand up

1084
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
Shape of

1085
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
Bottle ya almost imagine like a

1086
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Seed

1087
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
We wanted so keep that kind of object

1088
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,119
Approach and we ended up with square and then

1089
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Plane crash

1090
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
It's not one thing that goes wrong it's like

1091
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
Things that go wrong with exactly that we did there

1092
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,615
From kind of walking away from our core vision of it

1093
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,455
To not getting the tooling right and what it is we were always

1094
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,759
A little bit more conservative

1095
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
Here we believe in feel fast right

1096
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
Do you get product out there limited number of retailers

1097
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Make sure it works

1098
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
Just lunch and learn

1099
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,791
And everybody love the design of it so we went really Broad

1100
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Everyone said this is going to

1101
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
Everyone could have this in their bathtub

1102
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
In the shower

1103
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Costco Love dead

1104
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
Grocery to everybody got behind it

1105
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,287
It is such that was nailed to the shop

1106
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
It did not move

1107
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
Expensive to launch a new product

1108
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
It really expensive

1109
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
The discontinued

1110
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:39,807
Because when you see something on shelf that's being discounted for the store to get rid of it

1111
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
The manufacturer's funding

1112
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
Will you say you just got

1113
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
All the stuff like what what happened to the excess

1114
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Stop

1115
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,863
Actually just recycle

1116
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,215
Playing a whole bunch of bottles that

1117
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
Yeah you'll have some

1118
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
We did hear some of it was sold to prison

1119
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
Well so

1120
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
How big of a hit did you get it

1121
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
Take us back to domesa take

1122
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Yeah I don't remember exactly dollar term

1123
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
But it was

1124
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
You know Millions

1125
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,111
Of you know any investment that

1126
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
Basically the amount of money we lit on fire

1127
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
But the bigger thing though is just

1128
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
Product failures a reputational risk

1129
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
And it's something that you need

1130
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Recover from

1131
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,423
The customers meaning for us a customer was a retailer

1132
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Yeah they were they were

1133
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Not excited about that

1134
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Something that you have to dig yourself out of

1135
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:38,431
So I'm curious because at this point you've had obviously had lots of success with

1136
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
With method cleaning products

1137
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
The company is profitable

1138
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
And then you have this failure with block right

1139
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Was there any tension between the

1140
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
The to be around that like

1141
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
How was your relationship

1142
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
Well marriage

1143
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
Yeah it yeah it is

1144
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
It's like a marriage I mean I think

1145
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Eric and I are

1146
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
Super good friends

1147
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
You know we obviously know each other incredibly well cuz we

1148
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Sleeping in the trenches

1149
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Kids together

1150
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
There was a time

1151
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,103
For a couple of years where we were at each other

1152
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Why

1153
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,687
You know Erica I

1154
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Approach problems

1155
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
From varied

1156
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,807
And that is

1157
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
ShoeDazzle

1158
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
But it also can be

1159
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Huge

1160
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Rub

1161
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
When

1162
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
You know I see a problem from this Direct

1163
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Can you see the problem

1164
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
From another direction and you can but heads

1165
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Not that

1166
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
And

1167
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,191
You know that what it requires is a requires a lot of oppa

1168
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
Open mindedness

1169
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Requires a lot of selfie

1170
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Awareness

1171
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Requires a lot of listening

1172
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
These are all

1173
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
Skills that

1174
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
I'd say that we've learned

1175
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
But early on

1176
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
I don't know a lot of

1177
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,575
25 year olds that have that level of

1178
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,207
Sort of experience and maturity to have those skills

1179
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
Breakdown

1180
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
It's unusual for

1181
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Partners

1182
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,863
Create a company to scale it and then to stay friends after

1183
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
And good friends

1184
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
I mean how did you guys get through that

1185
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Those tense

1186
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
What did we do

1187
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
Overtime

1188
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,103
You know we knew how to be friends but we didn't know how to be

1189
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Colics in pharmacy

1190
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,991
And we started to learn each other's different styles professionally

1191
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
-6 is to just

1192
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Engage run out of

1193
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,647
Adam needs a little bit more space to kind of think it through

1194
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
He's an extrovert I'm an inch

1195
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:31,327
We really learned each other's working Styles and we were able to find a better Rhythm together

1196
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
And

1197
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,983
Very conscious effort to say like

1198
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
Screech on the record like

1199
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
We got to work on

1200
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
That's right or this is going to end badly

1201
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
And at the end of the day it was mostly about

1202
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Us

1203
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,039
Doing it individually and working with one another to figure out

1204
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,111
You know when Eric says XYZ and

1205
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,463
I feel like it means this actually that's not what he means it means something else and I can

1206
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Separate

1207
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
You guys sold this

1208
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Company

1209
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Method to ecobee

1210
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
An 2013

1211
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
Why did you decide to do that

1212
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
He built this from

1213
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Ground up

1214
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,799
Was it a point where you kind of had

1215
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Had to do this

1216
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Esl it

1217
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Gavin

1218
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
We are approached by a private

1219
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Out of the UK

1220
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
And they had owned

1221
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
The recover brand

1222
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
Which was really the Pioneers in the 70s

1223
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Spring cleaning

1224
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,951
Enter the pitch to us wise was opportunity to really allow all of our investors have been it for a long time

1225
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
To see a nice return

1226
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
We're big Believers that you

1227
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
You build businesses

1228
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
I'm sort of for posterity

1229
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
To endure

1230
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
And businesses change ownership

1231
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Answer the question isn't

1232
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Willett

1233
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
It's

1234
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
If it does

1235
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
Will a business be better after

1236
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
And in this case of selling the business

1237
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
Tui gewehr actually the greatest

1238
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
Example of that as we were able to build

1239
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,087
Was probably the most sustainable manufacturing facility in the whole world

1240
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,183
In the inner city of Chicago immediately after we sold the business

1241
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
So

1242
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,815
There was an example of like deepening and enhancing the mission and building something

1243
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
Can you help us grow the business much better

1244
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Rather than

1245
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
What other people

1246
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Fear would have

1247
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
See you both of you

1248
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
Moved on a Draw 2

1249
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
2015

1250
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah we're still still involved with the company

1251
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Satellite touch

1252
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
But you have no ownership at all anymore of them

1253
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Struct

1254
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
So I asked

1255
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
A discussion of

1256
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
Pretty much I want to come

1257
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Michelle

1258
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
The star with you Adam

1259
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
How much of

1260
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Successive method

1261
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
You think has to do with

1262
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
You know your intelligence in your skill and

1263
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
And how much

1264
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Woodloch

1265
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,911
I think there's other factors other than just those two

1266
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:49,311
I think that it certainly isn't all because of me I'd like to think that I contributed

1267
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
An amount

1268
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,919
To a group of people working together to create something really awesome

1269
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
I think perseverance was a

1270
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,575
Huge huge key to the quote-unquote lock that

1271
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
That method had

1272
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
And yeah

1273
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
You know what's there

1274
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
20% luck in their absolute

1275
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,095
I was saying on for Newark and never have an ego because lucky

1276
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
Is always

1277
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
A factor

1278
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
And I agree with Adam with enough for sister

1279
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Since like always

1280
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
Plex always shows up

1281
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Yammy

1282
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
We made so many

1283
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:26,687
Stupid mistakes and kind of had near-death moments that luckily the ball just passed the right way to Keep Us Alive

1284
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
Just been a real pleasure

1285
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
Is it strange to go into a Target or Whole Foods and see this bottle you design this

1286
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
Coq design

1287
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,047
This thing that you were making in a San Francisco

1288
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
Group house called whatever you want

1289
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
Enstilar

1290
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,263
Emotional attachment

1291
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
And everytime I see

1292
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:59,711
You walk into a random restaurant bathroom and there's are are teardrop handwash sitting there and you see it and you can

1293
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,575
Think of that kostoryz the creation of it at. So much a part of our identity like

1294
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,903
Whether or not we own a couple of shares or not has nothing to do with it

1295
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,559
It's still ours that's Adam Lowry

1296
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:20,959
Eric Ryan the two co-founders a method by the way each of them has now launched their own

1297
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:27,359
Pictures of a company called Ripple foods which makes plant milk and other dairy free products

1298
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:33,759
Vegetable protein mostly from yellow peas and Ali

1299
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Nutritional supplements protein bars and smoothies and even though they're not professional Partners anymore

1300
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:46,559
Adam and Eric and their families still hang out quite a bit around once a month

1301
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you

1302
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Things your building

1303
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
But first

1304
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Quick thanks to one of our sponsor

1305
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
American Express

1306
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
No matter what you do in business

1307
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
From building a

1308
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,247
Better mousetrap to building a better app

1309
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
It's easier when you

1310
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
You don't do it alone

1311
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Powerful backing of America

1312
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
Express

1313
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Don't do business

1314
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
Without it

1315
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Okay thanks so much for sticking around but

1316
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
I know for how you built that

1317
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,167
Play story comes from Marin County California

1318
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
And she starts

1319
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
120 years ago

1320
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:33,407
Yeah my great-grandfather immigrated from Italy in 1897 and we have been farming and ranching here since the

1321
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,735
That's Lauren Poncho from Tomales California

1322
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:41,087
Where he runs stemple Creek cattle ranch

1323
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Oliver Ranch

1324
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,975
We have a few with white faces are speckled faces but most of them are all black

1325
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,327
All Black Angus beef cattle the same kind of parents raised

1326
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Lauren was growing up

1327
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
Even though you love the ranch

1328
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,007
She eventually moved to Sacramento to work in pharmaceutical sales

1329
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,335
13 years ago Lauren realized

1330
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,639
He wanted to get back to those cows

1331
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
In Marin

1332
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
I felt like

1333
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
It's either now or never I'm 30

1334
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,063
You know totally okay if we try

1335
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
And fail

1336
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
But if I don't even try

1337
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
I'm not going to fulfill as a person

1338
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,975
So Lauren talk about it with his wife Lisa

1339
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,559
I mean I knew obviously since I met him

1340
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
How passionate Lauren was about agriculture and

1341
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,935
I was up for the adventure

1342
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,751
Salisa quit a good-paying job at a law firm

1343
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
And I moved back to Marin

1344
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,079
To join Lauren's parents

1345
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:34,847
On the ranch

1346
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:39,199
But we were still ranching the way that my great-grandfather unrest at the time

1347
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:44,319
And we need to change some things up and actually make it a profitable business otherwise we weren't going to be able to survive

1348
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
And we essentially asked Lawrence parents

1349
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
If we could take over

1350
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
The running of the ranch

1351
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,815
Thankfully they had the vision they were brave enough

1352
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,167
To say okay so we can Lauren started to make some changes

1353
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,471
For starters they no longer wanted to

1354
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
To auction off their

1355
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Cattle to a

1356
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Feedlots

1357
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:08,895
They want to raise them until they were slaughtered and then sell the beef directly to customer

1358
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,991
Because they saw that more people were demanding healthier food

1359
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,807
They decided to raise the cows organically

1360
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,831
On grass

1361
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Instead of grain

1362
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
But all of that

1363
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
Took a lot of time and

1364
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
A lot

1365
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,863
We invested a lot of REO personal Assets in the business like we didn't have an investor we didn't have

1366
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,703
You know seed money we were the seed I remember

1367
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:37,055
Conversation with Lisa multiple times and Lisa think when are we actually going to

1368
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
Pay ourselves

1369
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
The do this

1370
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
Both Lauren and Lisa kept day jobs

1371
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
Paid the bills

1372
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,735
While they certified the pasture and

1373
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
There was many people in our lives that just thought we were completely insane because he had two children

1374
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
During these years

1375
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:57,023
And we were running around you know seven-days-a-week juggling all of these balls

1376
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
It took them

1377
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,119
3 years to fully convert to being an organic Ranch

1378
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
And to build up a base of customers

1379
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,239
First Farmers Market stand at local stores

1380
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,311
Working on different ways to go easier on the

1381
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Environment

1382
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:15,711
In fact they become one of the first farms in the US to actually measure their carbon levels

1383
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,527
And now they're not only carbon neutral

1384
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
There actually was known as

1385
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Carbon positive

1386
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:25,183
Managing operations and the property the way that we do

1387
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
Applying compost in rotational grazing

1388
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
Or actually

1389
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
Sequestering more carbon than permitting

1390
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
It just

1391
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,863
Incredible

1392
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
Anyway a few years ago Lauren was able to

1393
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,007
Quit his day job in sales to work full-time on the ranch

1394
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,799
NOAA profit margin

1395
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
In ranching

1396
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
I slept

1397
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,175
Their gross revenue this year is over 3 million dollars

1398
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,199
Which comes from

1399
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223

1400
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,039

1401
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
All on the ranch

1402
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
Started by his great-grandfather

1403
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,159
I think my parents are like

1404
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,207
