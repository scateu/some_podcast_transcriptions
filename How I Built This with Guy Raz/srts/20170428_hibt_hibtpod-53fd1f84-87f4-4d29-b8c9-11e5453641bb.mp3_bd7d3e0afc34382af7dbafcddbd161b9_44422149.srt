So what happened to the business

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
It was over and I didn't have the cash flow and the phone started ringing and it

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
It was the landlord of that building saying you know what rent hasn't been paid you know all of my vendors you know

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
You started calling me my house was under foreclosure and my wife

And my mother-in-law

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384

Lady Gaga

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
It usually takes a bit of instinct

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Sim failure and a lot of luck

And with honesty

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728

It's that

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
He had no choice

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
Because at the time he met her and this is just

38
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
10 years ago

39
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
He had lost all of his money he was

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Totally broke

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
But somehow over the next few years

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
Troy essentially built

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
A company you could

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Call it

Formal training in fact

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
Much to his mother's disappointment

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,512
Troy dropped out of his high school in West Philadelphia in 1992

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
To pursue a

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048

Ways to become a rapper

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
We had this idea that we were going to be does rap

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,008
You know call to too many and it was me and two of my best friends

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
A 10-week we called herself

62
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Too many because it was

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,712
We only had enough money for one of us so it was always two too many of us

64
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
And

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
My best friend said If We Ever Meet Will Smith Jazzy Jeff

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Fresh Prince that going to give us a record deal

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
So that we had the soul

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Focus and sole purpose of meeting Jazzy Jeff

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
Cuz those are the guys from Philadelphia

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
They were the only God can fill it up

71
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
They weren't they were from our neighborhood

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
They were successful they were like gods in Philly

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
And they were they were too way out

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
That was plant that was

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Esplanade

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
GNC

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
So did you

78
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Yes we we actually hop the train

79
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:37,600
And you know we don't have money so we just went in a wait for the train to pull up and jump over the turnstile and take

80
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
The train down the Delaware Avenue

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,000
And we knew Jazzy Jeff had a recording studio there and we just wait outside

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Recording studio

83
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
Nothing we did that for almost 6 months and Jeff used to see us outside

84
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
But would never let us end I think

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
She thought we were like

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Stalkers or something

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
And then one day we saw some friends in the studio that let us in

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,688
Will Smith and just happened to be in the studio and

89
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
We walked in and we played our demo tape

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
And he listened to it right then and there

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
He listened to it

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Ni

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
We actually went outside it was snowing

94
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
And we said well we want you to see how to dance to so we ask

95
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,768
Ashley started dancing in the snow

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
I think we quickly found out we suck

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
But you know

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Well saw some potential in US

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
Antioch he said look how you know how you guys getting home and we said we don't know

100
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
And he

101
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
I drove us home at night and bass

102
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
Sickly told our parents that

103
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
You know he had discovered

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
We're going to be okay

105
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
And what was it was a track you play for

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Did you remember how close

107
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
My God it was

108
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Pretty terrible

109
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
You have to give a sandwich

110
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
It was a song called where's the

111
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
The party happens like

112
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,119
I'm not telling you how I actually

113
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,471
I'm even said the name because you're going Google Now

114
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Where can I find it

115
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
I know you are

116
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Girls

117
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
It's not it's not so bad

118
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,647
We thought it was really good will thought I had some potential we put it out

119
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
And it went doublewood

120
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
So you made no money

121
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
We met zero

122
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,631
Zero money I probably still owe Will Smith Money

123
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
For that record that you establish a relationship

124
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Was Will Smith

125
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Which is kind of a big deal

126
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,615
Yes and you know what and we'll has a partner still to this very day named James Lassiter

127
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
You know he was in the studio that day we played the demo tape

128
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,039
And he was Jazzy Jeff in fresh Prince's manager

129
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
He actually got the

130
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
The job is their manager because he was the only guy in our neighborhood with a car

131
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
And James had become the sort of

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Mogul in the industry

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
And

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
I wanted to be jeans

135
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
So in my soul

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
I wanted to be less

137
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Fresh Prince

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,103
Amore Jean so I just kind of put myself under James

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
And James became mighty

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
CCU

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Basically move away from from being a

142
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Perform at that point in did the James give you a job

143
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
Yes James gave me a job I had a few jobs

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,695
Within the camp but I was James's assistant I was Jazzy Jeff's assistant

145
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
I ended up moving out to LA

146
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,119
And working with working with James at his production company what will

147
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
How old are you by the way

148
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
I was in my

149
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Late teens early 20s

150
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Sort of that transition.

151
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,639
And I was working at will and James's production company

152
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,271
And I was having the time of my life and I'm very hard headed thought I knew everything

153
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
And I don't have a car

154
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,951
I thought it was going to be like Philly where you just can't take the train everywhere and then La everything so separate it

155
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
And I was taking this

156
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Car service

157
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
From the office

158
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
To visit this girl probably two or three times a week or whatever

159
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
But I would pay

160
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
The bill at the

161
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Every two weeks when I got my check

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
I would pay like the office managers they hate a Bills going to come in

163
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
I got you

164
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
You covered it whatever

165
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
And one time I think I pissed the office manager Office

166
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Over something

167
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
And she told James that I have been using this car service

168
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
What is the visit this girl

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
And James came in and fired me and sent me back the Philly

170
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
Wow so on the spot that was it you were done

171
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Done

172
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
James basic

173
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,839
You know he saw the route that I was going and I was taking a lot of shortcuts

174
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
And I was kind of living this la

175
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
A fast life in

176
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Soda stereo tip

177
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Book or fake

178
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Executive thing

179
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
You know I thought I thought I was much bigger than what I was at that party

180
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Tequila time

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
He kicked me out of LA

182
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
Like you said go but you're going back home

183
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
So

184
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Like

185
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
You're in your early twenties

186
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,111
You lose your job and you go back to Philly

187
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Yeah I went back I went back to

188
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,487
The Philly soda with my tail between my legs

189
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:05,375
And my cousins and Philly had started a small management company and sort of a product

190
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Shane Company

191
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
That they asked me to come in and run

192
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,079
And one of the clients with a girl that I met when she was 16 so she and I had known each other

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
And we started working together and and it was the rapper Eve

194
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
But I had absolutely

195
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
No clue what I was doing

196
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
And you know it started off you don't even come to me and she said luck you know I need your help and you know it

197
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
I'm figuring this out

198
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,399
And at first I was kind of helping her find a manager

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
Finally she said look I want you to do it

200
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,543
And of course I said yes and jumped at the opportunity

201
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
And

202
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
I think initially the job was

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Protecting my friend

204
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
So instinctively

205
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
The decisions that I was making was really about

206
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
How do I protect her and make sure that you know she had the best

207
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Possible chance to make it and everything else was you know learning as I was going along and you know

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
I remember the furs

209
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
Tore that we went on with this cash money Ruff Ryders tour

210
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
I got on the bus and it was

211
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
What does old bus driver

212
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
And you know scruffy beard and he said

213
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
You got the flu

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
I said I'll be right back

215
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,735
And I you know I got off the bus and I called one of my buddies who is done touring for a long time

216
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Blessed dude

217
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Float

218
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
And he said

219
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
It's the money that you give the bus driver for gas

220
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Kohl's

221
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,463
Fuel you know everything else or whatever

222
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
So I got back on the bus and gave him the money and he knows

223
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Sa here

224
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
The float

225
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,911
Anna and I sort of floated my way through the resta

226
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,799
Next three years I got a float at my way through kind of figuring it out as I was going along

227
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
What did you have to

228
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
Do as a manager for

229
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Book shows in NJ

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
How did you even know how to

231
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
How to do that or how to promote

232
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Her Brandon had to get her out

233
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,135
The world you know what that the way it works is

234
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
The manager's sort of

235
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
You know it's like the Hub

236
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Of an artist

237
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Career

238
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
So you know I go out and I hired a booking agent who who

239
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Who books the shows

240
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,495
I hired a publicist who who who does interviews and television

241
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
I bringing the record label who

242
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Distributes the music

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
So sort of like you know a CEO of

244
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Even cover up her busy

245
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
And that

246
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
A pretty big business

247
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Yes she she actually became

248
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
One of the biggest

249
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
Female hip hop stars of all time

250
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
And

251
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,031
I was lucky enough to have the The Fresh Prince blueprint so they kind of understand

252
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
That a rapper could do TV

253
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,199
In a wrapper could do you know things outside of their Core Business

254
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,783
And Woody we ended up building you know a clothing line

255
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
A television show she

256
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
Are going to do you know

257
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Barber Shop you know what would

258
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
With Ice Cube and and

259
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Cedric the Entertainer

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
So we ended up building something really special and something unique for a female rapper at that puts

261
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
How did you know what

262
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Tudela

263
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
I mean negotiating is really really really hard

264
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Workrite in MN you are so inexperienced that time like

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
How did you know

266
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
What's negotiate

267
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
You know what I think a lot of it is you know

268
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Is is West Philly spidey sense

269
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
You know so

270
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
When you have to

271
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
Negotiate for survival

272
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
And you have to know how to read runes

273
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
And you have to know who the bad guys in the rooms are

274
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Who has the gun in their pocket

275
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
Who's jet who's just going to brandish it and who's going to who's going to actually

276
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
We pull the trigger

277
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
So I think that's just a natural instinct.

278
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Comes with

279
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Coming from where where I come from

280
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
So

281
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,295
Being able to take that to Linton negotiations are on reading

282
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
People in Reading rooms and reading circles

283
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
I think it's very very important

284
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
And then also knowing

285
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
What's important for

286
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
That person on the other side of the

287
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Table

288
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
And what's important

289
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
4

290
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
The client

291
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
Yeah and a lot of times

292
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,055
Is not conflicting till it so both sides can kind of get what they want out of it

293
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
So

294
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
I mean personally this point in your life

295
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
You're still

296
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
Really young guy like you're thinking I'm set I am

297
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
At this is all like

298
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
This is all

299
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
Unfolding exactly as I had hoped

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Yeah you know I was

301
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
I was on cloud nine because you know this is

302
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
Everything that I've ever dreamed

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
That's all I ever wanted to do in my MMR

304
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
With with music

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
And because I was a failed artist

306
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
I was asked

307
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Ashley able to help

308
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Somebody accomplish their dream was

309
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
You know definitely fulfilling

310
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,455
And then the trappings that came along with it as a young guy

311
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,527
I was I was loving it were you making money at the

312
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
I was making Hood money

313
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
So I was like I was ghetto Rich at that at Peppa

314
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Italy time

315
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
So if you had you know

316
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
The nicer house out of the

317
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
The 40 row homes on that side

318
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
The street you were doing okay but by no means was I

319
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Was I rich

320
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
You know my goal with the make $1,000

321
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
If I can make $1,000 a week

322
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
That was it

323
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Funny I would say

324
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
That was my that was my goal

325
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
What was the name of your company by the way. It was called Irving wondering like

326
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,135
And I and I did it out of Philly for 5 years and then I sold that company in in mm

327
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
Before you sold it to another management company

328
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
Yes it was a big company in the UK called

329
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
The sanctuary group

330
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,911
And I'm so I sold it to the sanctuary group and then move to LA to help them open up there earlier

331
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Why did you sell the your master

332
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
That you

333
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
The real reason was

334
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
At that particular time it was

335
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
The largest liquidity event that I would have

336
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Experience that was a lot of money

337
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Yeah I was hustling you know I was living check to check

338
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,183
You know walking around venues with you know a backpack full of cash from venue to venue

339
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
So you know it wasn't

340
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Weed wacker

341
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
Mastication and in a way we operated the business

342
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,959
And then the guys from Sanctuary you know they were managing guns and roses and you know a bunch of

343
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Huge Rock axe

344
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,615
And it just done a deal with Matthew Knowles who was who's Beyonce's Dad

345
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
And bought his company

346
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943
And he approached me and said look

347
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
This company can help you scale your business

348
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,879
They can help you grow your business you know in a way that you can't grow it internationally

349
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
And you know you don't have to live check the check you have a young family and he said look this is going to take you

350
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
Due to the next level and I and I ended up doing it

351
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
What is a pea

352
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
I Can't Tell You Why

353
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
Dependent players that NBA expired

354
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,103
They pay me more than I ever made you know but you know I'll tell you it was it was

355
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
That it was a 2 million dollar check

356
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Actually

357
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
The actual number was

358
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
2

359
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
2 million

360
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,855
Buy $275,000 worth

361
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
The actual number

362
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,463
Because I remember when the wire when a wire went

363
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Through

364
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Add

365
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
Call and check the automated bank machine

366
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
About 10 times to make sure that the money was still there

367
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:41,311
Because I never I never had $1000000 them in my in my bank account

368
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
I never had even close to it

369
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
And you know in in the bank at one time

370
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
And

371
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,527
Here it was now it's like okay you know what it's

372
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
This is this is very real

373
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
And I just

374
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Yeah it was very well

375
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
What was it like working working for sanctuary

376
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
I hated it

377
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
I hated it when you know it was it was fantastic at first

378
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,287
And because I was so excited that you know to get the check

379
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Wheatley overlook

380
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
All of the red flags

381
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
What were they

382
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
You know what it just was 30

383
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
Things and certain behaviors that showed up during that

384
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
.

385
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
That I chose to ignore

386
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Because I

387
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
That's it I'm just going to take

388
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
The check

389
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
And I'll and I'll deal with that and maybe he isn't such a bad guy

390
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Maybe don't

391
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
Maybe they are at the kalander need some of the things that was happening

392
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
During the negotiations

393
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,215
I'm so coming in I just didn't do

394
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,543
The diligence on them that they were doing on me

395
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
So how long did you last

396
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
You know what probably I remember waking up

397
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
And

398
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
Talking to my wife

399
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,319
A couple times about buying a company back

400
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
Because I'm talking about you know

401
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Me growing Up Loving music worship and you know Berry Gordy's and all of these guys in like

402
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
This is my

403
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Dream and I didn't

404
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Have a plan B in it

405
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Is all I wanted to do

406
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
And I was

407
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Dreading getting up in the morning going to the office

408
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Like I had knots in my stomach

409
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,407
Going in and I was going to the office and I will pull my shades down we had glass office

410
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,223
And I will pull my shades down because I didn't want to work

411
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
People there

412
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
In about 2 years in a year-and-a-half and it was

413
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
And you were managing

414
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Yes I was

415
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,535
The know when you lost Sanctuary Sanctuary you were still

416
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Pretty much financial aid

417
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Security

418
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,935
Yeah I thought I was invested

419
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
A lot of money back into the business

420
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Into this new business

421
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,847
Did the new business that you started after you left Sanctuary after I left sanctuary

422
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
So

423
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,479
One of the things I realize was $2000000 isn't actually $2000000

424
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,831
Buy a house

425
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Cheap 8 seater you pay taxes

426
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
You buy a couple new cars

427
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
And it's gone

428
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
Is gone I invested in and I invested in this new business

429
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Anna

430
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
He was going with me so I said you know what

431
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,935
I know exactly what we're doing this is going to the next level

432
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,287
You did a build-out and he's beautiful offices on Wilshire Boulevard

433
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
And then started this new this new business

434
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
What happened to it

435
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,991
Are you not even walked in one day and I think maybe I'll

436
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Probably about a

437
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Year

438
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,623
Maybe a year or two into the into the new business

439
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,511
But she came into my office you know she sat down on the couch and she said I think I want to go

440
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
In another Direction

441
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
And I said what what do you mean

442
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
So well

443
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
I think I'm going to find new manager

444
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
So wow

445
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775

446
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
She said why I think

447
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
I want to go to the next level and

448
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
I want to go with a manager who I think could get me to the next level

449
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,295
That's it why are you thinking about anybody specifically she

450
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
He said yeah

451
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367

Mentor and good friend

456
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
So

457
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
She ended up signing with one of my good friends

458
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Fomantis

459
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
And I mean she was like your

460
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
She was your ticket to making that new business success

461
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Also

462
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,871
Even more she wasn't even she was my friend

463
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151

Shenzhen

469
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
It was a heartbreak

470
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Yunnan number one

471
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
In terms of how it ended up happening

472
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,071
You know and then the business what was highly Hedge

473
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,471
Ah not on that success what you know of her you know it was a single client business pretty much a day

474
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
So what happened the business

475
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
It was over

476
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,919
This was you know this kind of bleeds into you know going into probably

477
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
2007

478
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
When

479
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,783
You know I didn't have the cash flow

480
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,367
And a phone started ringing and it was the

Landlord of that building saying you know at rent hasn't been paid no all of my vendors you know started calling me

House

And you know super humbling

501
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615

And Hip-Hop is a very small community

506
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928

Suicide

514
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
But I know why people do

515
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Obviously you had

516
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
Already demonstrated some Talent by managing

517
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
Eve and bite all the promotional work you done

518
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,792
But in your mind did you swear you able to save yourself okay I'm talented I'm going to pull out of this

519
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
Were the moments where you just.

520
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
I'm doomed

521
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
I am not going to

522
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Get out of this

523
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Now you know what

524
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
It's it's

525
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
You can't fall off the

526
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
And

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
I was on the floor

528
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
No nowhere to go right

529
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
And

530
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Mom mom

531
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,272
You know she was a single mom we grew up where a lot of times we had to choose

532
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Between

533
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
Whether we were going to have a phone line in the house or electric

534
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,720
And I remember us being on the bed with a penny Bank

535
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
And it was a bronze penny Bank shaped like a pig

536
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
And she was stick a butter knife into the slot

537
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,912
To get the coins to come out

538
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:35,520
And we would divide the coins up to get that you know so me and my brother

539
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
We have bus fare to get to school

540
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
So we grew up

541
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Tough

542
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Yeah

543
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
My mom caught the bus everyday

544
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Day

545
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
To go to work and walk

546
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Sometimes

547
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
30 years

548
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Straight

549
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
So my mom

550
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Work ethic

551
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
And spirit

552
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
Is in My DNA

553
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
And

554
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
I was always working

555
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
I wanted to make my mom and my grandmother proud

556
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
That was always a big thing

557
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
For me

558
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728

00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384

564
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

623
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
I'm Gyros

624
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,144
Troy Carter is probably at the lowest point in his life

625
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Houses in foreclosure

626
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
His businesses

627
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Falling apart and

628
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
He's basically Banker

629
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
But around this time

630
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:27,200
Gets introduced to a young singer and piano player who calls herself Lady Gaga

631
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
Did you know

632
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
This is going to be here

633
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
Yeah you know what you

634
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
The real answer is you don't know

635
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
You think

636
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
And you hope

637
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
But you don't know

638
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Whip people see now

639
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,888
Is what she was you know except for his you know she was a brunette

640
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
Nnc she didn't dance at that for

641
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Tequila time you know she was behind the piano

642
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
Actually Ellie Reed

643
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Dunya show

644
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,384
I just dropped it from Def

645
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
But you know what she did all fairness

646
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
The LA

647
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Cheat she was a piano singer

648
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah and she going to West Virginia

649
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,648
Fried on a grandmother's couch afterwards because

650
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
Her dad gave her a year offense

651
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
School in basic

652
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Oakley said you got one year

653
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
To figure this out or you need to go back to NYU

654
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
So she thought her dreams were shattered

655
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,216
I think it was that sort of thing you can't fall off the

656
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
The floor and so you know she had the spirit

657
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
And her that

658
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
You know when you feel that sort of pain

659
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
You never want to feel it again so she was a

660
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
Incredibly hard worker

661
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
So she just worked hard everyday to get better and better

662
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
So what did you guys

663
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,648
Start to do I mean how did you mean you are almost

664
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Bankrupt

665
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
We Financial your bankrupt

666
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
And she's like oh

667
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Please can you manage mean you're like

668
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Yeah sure okay

669
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
You know we made music

670
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,264
That that was the big thing like then Vince was incredibly talented at

671
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
You know helping her sheep the sound

672
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
I knew

673
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
How to work with with female artists

674
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,504
You know I knew about the fashion business from working with Eve

675
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,552
You know got signed to Interscope

676
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
Put the same label that you was on

677
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
So I had a you know grape

678
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Rapport with the

679
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
With the label already

680
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
So it was it was very

681
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,048
It's all natural kind of navigating it

682
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
And we know

683
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
I think we worked in a muse

684
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Vamos

685
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
9 or 10 month

686
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,240
And then we took it to

687
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,080
The record label in the record label said all those songs are great

688
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:36,736
Let's give this to the Pussycat Dolls let's give this to Britney Spears so she ended up becoming a great songwriter

689
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
A few of the songs we

690
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
We actually

691
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
We fought for and we said we just not giving these racks

692
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
Heads up and we went out and we

693
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
Took those songs the radio

694
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
And it was a disaster

695
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Radio wouldn't play it

696
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
It was the song Just Dance nobody would play that song

697
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
Nobody will play Nobody what plant did you start to

698
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Build her career what did you do

699
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
We you know it

700
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
We ended up

701
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
This is as Facebook and Twitter

702
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
And my space

703
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,184
Lee sin YouTube all of those platforms

704
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Restarting to

705
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
Just emerged

706
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Places where you can read

707
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Niche audiences

708
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Is directly

709
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,632
And we started using a platform they were

710
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Free

711
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
Where we got lucky

712
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,008
Is that a lot of them were global

713
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
They were in markets outside of outside of

714
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
The US

715
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,176
So we started reaching audiences and places where

716
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,016
We we didn't travel Geographic what would you do what you just liked post

717
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,320
Text or videos are like is like

Messages from Lady Gaga

719
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,672
Yep both how would people even discover

720
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:54,560
You know what is be sort of underground music community that wanted that want to find things

721
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Before others

722
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
People find

723
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
And I'm and I remember we came up with this

724
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
This concept called Gaga

725
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
For YouTube

726
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
And it was like these 3-minute video clip

727
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Basically

728
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,872
These are clips of her and her dance

729
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
Her and you know but we will have the better music

730
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Underneath and it was

731
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Suppurative

732
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,504
Mystic and you know she was

733
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
Brillion and in a one of the first

734
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Music voices

735
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
Who really knew how to use and leverage social

736
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
And it really work

737
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:26,560
So we started building a soda underground following throughout the world

738
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
But it wasn't big

739
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
It was

740
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
75 to a hundred people in clubs that we would play

741
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
But we

742
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Wii Super serve that

743
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
Community

744
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
Because just a few years or year-and-a-half

745
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
Before that you're in a

746
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,968
High-rise office building in La glass office building

747
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
Living this life as a

748
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
Corporate executive at this

749
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
Management company

750
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
And you are now like going back to

751
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,024
Two traveling in Vans and like sleeping in them and trying to get this artist into small clubs

752
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Yep

753
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Start started over

754
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Wow. It over

755
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,704
And also you know this was Newt for me because this was pop music

756
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Totally different front from Hip Hop

757
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,080
It was it was it was a different skill-set

758
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
And so so really start starting over

759
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
How are you able to even fund

760
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
Like the videos and hurt or like

761
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
Like you didn't have any money at the time so how are you able to do it

762
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Interscope Records

763
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
Okay. So so Interscope stepped up

764
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Nna funded

765
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,816
It sounds like they didn't think she was going to be as big as you thought you

766
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,888
No you know it was a shoestring budget

767
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
We didn't need alot

768
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,960
You know I remember her

769
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Cheating on she didn't have outfits

770
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
So

771
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
She had this idea for this sort of mirror bra

772
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Panty set

773
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Oh whatever.

774
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:51,040
She couldn't afford so she took a mirror and she actually broke the mirror up with a hammer

775
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Krazy glued

776
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
On to onto a bra and panties

777
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:01,024
We had this in for all of the early guy fans you know from the from the early days

778
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,352
You know she had she had this latex cost

779
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Tomb

780
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
You know what these big shoulder pad

781
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
That she wore

782
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Every single show

783
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Not multiple outfit

784
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
It's one outfit that she wore to every single show

785
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
So you know so we we've basically bootstrapped

786
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,528
Is staying in an in every dime that she did make

787
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
She reinvested it back into her career

788
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
I think when you married you marry that with

789
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
The Perfect Storm of

790
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
I don't have a plan B

791
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
She doesn't have a plan B

792
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Vincent doesn't have a plan B

793
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
We we have to make this work had to work

794
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
The Hat

795
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Had to work

796
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm getting anxious just listening to story cuz I'm thinking

797
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080
Oh my God

798
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
Crazy Eights

799
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Crazy risk

800
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Okcu

801
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
So you're trying to convince State radio stations

802
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
Play her music you're building up a social media network but

803
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
What was the moment where

804
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
She just

805
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Blew up

806
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
The moment that I knew

807
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
Like you know because it wasn't just

808
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
One moment right

809
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Just was like

810
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
Grind over a one-year period to get it on the radio

811
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,216
And so I remember we were playing at

812
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Theater

813
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
It was The Wiltern Theater in LA

814
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
And you know this is that things are feeling better

815
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
Yeah but I remember

816
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,552
Did we were so nervous about The Wiltern no

817
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,600
Because it's a thousand seats

818
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
But we had sold out a couple of nightclubs

819
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
So we like maybe we can stretch it will

820
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
Keep the tickets at $20

821
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,120
So you know so it's super affordable or whatever and we can give away whatever we don't sell

822
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
We can give to the radio stations or you know

823
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,008
I'm kind of pad the venue right like 2008/2009

824
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
Yeah right around that time

825
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,616
And I remember driving down the street

826
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,944
That morning because I had to go downtown for something

827
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
And I drove

828
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Down in pasta

829
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
The theater

830
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
And kids were sleep outside

831
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
To get tickets to that show

832
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
No they had already bought tickets

833
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Today Show

834
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
And they just wanted to get in first

835
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
And when I saw those kids sleeping outside

836
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
I said we did it

837
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,936
We did it because when you can get them to line up you got something special

838
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,776
You got something special

839
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,688
You know what it was pretty incredible you know we gone to places that I never dreamed about

840
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
Met people you never thought you would me

841
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
So

842
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,672
Not only did she go to an incredible level in her career it actually took me to a level and Maca

843
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
Career that you know I thought

844
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
You know what I would do with Eve I thought I was at

845
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,424
You know what this height was Zero your urine yo Mount Everest

846
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
Did you guys you and and Lady Gaga

You ever have moments

848
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Where

849
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,712
You just had a quiet moment and you just look at each other and say how did this happen

850
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Amazing

851
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272

And we will always have those moments like

855
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
My

856
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
God

Can you

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792

Or you know

863
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
I remember seeing her play stings

864
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Ring Forest event in New York

865
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,640
Where you know Stinger bring out you know Legend after Legend you know Elton John Bono

866
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Stevie Wonder

You know just all of the greats and Harvey and the only

868
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
Young artist they are playing with those

869

Those guys

870
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:41,696
Seeing her hold their own with those guys and I'm just take her under a wing unit under their wings

871
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:46,048
So you know it just all those moment so it just you know very very special moment

872
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
Is it to drink during this time

873
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Scissor like

874
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
2010's

875
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
You also start to

876
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
Like I said I'm going to Branch out right now

877
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,312
Yeah because you started a company

878
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
Around that time was called Adam fact

879
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah I started atom Factory

880
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,248
Three actually so I started Coalition Media Group

881
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Was the original name of the come

882
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
Things started

883
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
It just say it was

884
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
What's the disorder of energetic shift

885
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
With that within a company

886
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,584
And you know I not gone through you know terrible time. I said you know what I want to change the name of the

887
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,912
Company I want to bring a new energy into it

888
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,288
And I said I wanted I want this company be to be something small but yet powerful

889
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
And just to be honest with you that the thing was

890
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
I just said I want to wake up everyday and Duke

891
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
That was

892
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
The mantra for me

893
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Personally

894
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
And so whether that included management organelle producing tea

895
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,696
TV or whatever I just wanted to do things that that inspired

896
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Yeah

897
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
So

898
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
See start this company

899
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
And Lady Gaga's careers

900
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Doing great and

901
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
One day she walks in and says

902
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
I'm leaving

903
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Yep

904
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,848
Walk walk in and say I want to go in another Direction.

905
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Which is a story you had heard

906
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah so it's I can't say it felt any different than if it didn't felt the first time

907
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
But you know what is

908
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
It was a different experience

909
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
The first time I went into

910
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,464
To panic mode you know when that went to happen

911
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Into me

912
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,560
This time you know I think I think I was able to

913
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
The sit in the middle of that storm

914
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
And and watch the

915
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Storm path

916
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Why did you

917
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
Want to part ways with you

918
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,312
Are you know what it's I think it did it happen

919
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I think I did differs in opinion you know on what happening and why happen

920
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
But ultimately are you know I respected it

921
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
And took it on the chin

922
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Are you guys still friends

923
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:48,672
You know I wouldn't say friends but cordial

00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
Pouring my soul into

931
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,312
I can't do it without investing one

932
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
100%

933
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872

Bittersweet

944
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
To see her perform at the Super Bowl

945
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,376
112 and you know what is not not even better soon

946
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400

00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
You know

948
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,520
That the songs that she sang at the Super Bowl

949
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,848
You know aren't those old records that you know I know the origin

950
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
I know the story behind

951
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Let me know

952
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,432
We were part of

953
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
I was part of getting those records

954
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Super Bowl so it's a part of my life

955
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
That you know I'm always going to be proud of

956
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,936
Completely different side of your career which

957
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,264
Which is arguably a much bigger part of your career which is

958
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Investing

959
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
Basically

960
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
At a certain point decided

961
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
I want to invest in startups

962
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,992
Yeah that that sort of came about

963
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Through

964
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,344
You know we were doing all of these things and Technology with these

965
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
Startups Wiki

966
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
What Gaga you know in order

967
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Yeah just to promote the music

968
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,816
And the music industry and just Hollywood in general

969
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,936
We're in litigation with most of the United Technology Company so it was this sort of

970
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,776
This wall between technology and content

971
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,872
And we embraced it and so I started building a lot of relationships

972
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Silicon Valley

973
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
That

974
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
Introduced me to a lot of young entrepreneurs

975
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,600
Who started asking me you know can I buy sir companies can I put in some

976
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Traduction

You know that I want to invest in their companies

978
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
And that that ended up turning into you. I think I've been vested in close to a hundred early-stage technology

979
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,968
Going through financial PTSD

So

1006
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
I'm just

1007
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952

10 not that have to do with with the money itself

1010
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
More importantly is

1011
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Have an ability

1012
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,288
You to live a life that I can wake up every morning doing what I love to

1013

Nothing's more important to me than that

1014
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
You never went to college

1015
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
You don't have

1016
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
An MBA you don't have

1017
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
An advanced degree either

1018
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Being

1019
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:35,744
I think to Harvard Business School case studies about you and Lady Gaga which isn't that great irony but

1020
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
Ever feel like you didn't

1021
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
The law that you weren't

1022
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,656
I don't know that like you are around people who have credentials and

1023
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
Made you feel intimidated

1024
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
At times right you know in

1025
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
If I had a 5th grade teacher

1026
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
Teacher named Miss Moore

1027
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,711
And I was always the littlest

1028
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Guy in the class

1029
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
You know you take this to school pics

1030
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Pictures of you get in line

1031
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,135
To go to lunch in the hallway I was always first in line cuz I was dead

1032
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
The smallest guy

1033
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
But she used to call me the big guy

1034
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
And she made me feel like I was six foot five

1035
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,167
And like she get it was something that she did

1036
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
Psychology

1037
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Did that like

1038
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Really really

1039
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Made me feel

1040
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
BL

1041
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Not only did I belong

1042
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
But that I was special

1043
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
So

1044
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
You know sometimes I'll go into rooms

1045
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Where it's

1046
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,367
This person has a lot more experience than me that much smarter

1047
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Then I am

1048
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,695
But I know what I know

1049
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
And I think I bring

1050
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,815
A very I bring a unique point of view

1051
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
You know just

1052
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,399
With different experiences

1053
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
And I'm

1054
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,239
Confident in that point of

1055
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
Elsa singing with the story you told about your mom

1056
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
