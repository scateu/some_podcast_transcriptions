33 to 1 of the TED Radio Hour on NPR

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:28,160
In the past few months I've been working on a new project where I've been meeting some of the most

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,536
Amazing entrepreneurs the founder and owner of

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
Thanks

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
As in Spain

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
The other guy

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,912
My product was all about the rear end

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
And so the word spanks was

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,336
Kind of naughty and kind of funny and a little bit risky but back in the 1990's

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
When Sara Blakely came up with the idea

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
She was not joking around

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,064
I was basically coming in and disrupting an entire industry than looking at something in one way

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,392
They were making Hosiery to be seen on the leg

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
And I knocked on their door and set guys

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
It's actually going to be hidden under clothes it's a new type of undergarment

26
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
And that

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
Very moment

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Seeing an opportunity and

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Being on someone's door

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
That's the starting point

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Going for all the stories in

32
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Michelle

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
It's called how I built this

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
And it's about how some of the most I can

35
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
Tonic companies and Brands were built

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,664
Usually with lots of struggling

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Failure before

38
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Finally making

39
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272

Anymore and by the way

45
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Most of these people

46
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Head pretty humble beginnings

47
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304

Machines door-to-door for about

49
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
7 years

50
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,984
And I know it sounds crazy but I kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,848
Where's the director where's the producer of this is not my movie

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Will hear the apps

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
The downs

54
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
And

55
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
The drama

56
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
I put everything into this

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
This my life and it's our employees missing

58
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
My family is named after

59
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
My dad

60
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
And I'm shaking right now is thinking of it

61
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
Stories about perseverance

62

00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Success by

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
One or two memberships

65
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,864
If I sold two memberships a day it was a banner day

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
Stories about bootstrapping

67
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
We did all our business

68
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
You know I knew where all the good Payphone

69
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
We're the ones that were warm in the winter

70
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
The ones where

71
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
He actually had a little shelf or you could put stuff

72
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
And financial melt

73
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
So we went to his house

74
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504

75
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040

Put on this new show probably the one thing you'll hear more than anything else

78
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
I knew it I could

79
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Unshakable optimism

80
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
In the sheer Joy

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Creating something

82
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
My God like we did it

83
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Someone in the world is using this thing out in the wild

84
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
That feeling

85
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Is like way more rewarding

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Then any amount of money

87
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
So if

88
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,040
You've ever built something from nothing something big or small or something you really care about

89
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Just dream about doing it
