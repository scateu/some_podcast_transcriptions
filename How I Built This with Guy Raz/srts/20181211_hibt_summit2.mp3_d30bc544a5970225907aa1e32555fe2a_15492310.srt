Hey it's guy here and today we've got another episode from the how I built this Summit

22
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,616
That we held in San Francisco this past October

23
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
This week we're featuring

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Katrina Lake

25
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944

Original interview with

30
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Katrina ran earlier this year

31
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
You haven't heard it you might want to give it a listen

32
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
Because Katrina story is

33
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Pretty amazing

34
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
She's built a billion-dollar business

35
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
And is the youngest female

36
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
CEO ever

37
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
Company public

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
But she's also one of those Founders who

39
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
It really set out to

40
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Katrina and I sat down together and

41
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Turn of a live audience

42
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104

For the Arts

44
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
San Francisco

45
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
So what's what's the start with your self perception

46
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
As

47
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
You know as an entrepreneur you didn't

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
We talked about briefing

49
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
Who didn't go into too much detail on it was

50
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864
You used to think of yourself as somebody

51
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,984
It was going to start a company and run a big organization and be a leader of all these people like

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
That wasn't

53
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
How you saw yourself

54
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
And that wasn't your intention

55
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
Any obviously you're doing it but

56
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Why what why was that

57
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,016
Yeah it is it's funny I look back and it is one of the things that I am

58
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,832
Passionate about of how can how can we make

59
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,416
Entrepreneurship something that feels more accessible and more real to more people

60
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
Because I think I look back and

61
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
In my childhood like

62
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Nobody

63
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Thought I would be an entrepreneur would encourage me to be an auntie

64
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,656
Carpenter like my mom is a RC jets retired actually

65
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
She was a public school teacher my dad

66
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
The doctor in the public university system

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,128
I don't know that I was raised with that as even a possibility in my mind

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,224
And it's funny because sometimes people ask me like I know you went to Stanford that

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Did that make you realize you wanted to be an auntie

70
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,672
In some strange ways that actually had the opposite effect of like the people who are the entrepreneur types

71
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
At Stanford were very different than

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
Kind of how I saw myself and so it took a really long time I think

73
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
Sing for me to realize that don't you

74
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
Partnership would be a good path

75
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
For me

76
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,984
And I think there's a lot of other people out there that would be pretty good at it

77
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
That maybe haven't had that exposure haven't had that push

78
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm in Salinas definitely one of the things that I'm passionate about about you know making

79
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Ensure that

80
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
This path is available

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
What did you think

82
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,088
An entrepreneur what was supposed to be like what did you think

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
It matters

84
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
What was that person like in your mind

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
I mean it's just it really is you know who you have exposure to

86
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096
She was like you Mark Zuckerberg was around the Stanford campus when I was

87
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
And when I was

88
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,936
In school Google was created around the time that I was

89
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
School

90
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Dealers you know kind of largely this

91
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
Like coder code in your garage

92
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Likewear Adidas flip-flops

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
Kind of kind of personality that

94
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
That you know didn't feel all that accessible to me

95
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Yeah as you as you mention the podcast in the early days you had to raise a lot of money cuz you needed a lot of money to get this thing off

96
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
You got to buy inventory is to build

97
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,584
All the technology rabbit you describe Stitch fix really is

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
The tech company

99
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
UC told me that mail VCU

100
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
And that you would ever most

101
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Man that you were meeting with

102
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
We're not

103
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Passionate about dressing women

104
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
How did you convince them

105
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Or at least some of them

106
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Otherwise

107
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,552
We actually didn't raise that much money we raise less than 50 million dollars.

108
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,696
This is now over a billion dollars and so you know I think are the amount of capital that we raised was

109
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
Very modest relative

110
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
To know where where we would end up

111
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
But in the early days yes we did need money

112
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
And so we raised I think 500,000 and a seed round and then we raised a couple of million and a round butt and we weren't

113
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Raising these

114
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
You know crazy size Venture rounds

115
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
I'm a nail candidly like I wasn't able to

116
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
Like a fundraising was not the thing that I have the best in the world at

117
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
I hated it because I was bad at

118
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
I mean we raised

119
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
You can say that

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Building a billion-dollar business on West

121
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:50,303
50 million is that something to be proud of like it's it's honestly the result that like fundraising is not my towering

122
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
It's just a

123
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
It's not the thing that helped me to be a good entrepreneur

124
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,239
I mean I probably wasn't very good at it then I don't know that I'm terribly good at it now

125
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,335
You know Capitol wasn't necessarily one of those things that helped us

126
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
And we should have

127
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
Some survey results from a survey that we we

128
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
Commission just to earlier today and it showed that women entrepreneurs who

129
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Who responded some of them in the audience

130
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,719
You know they've reported bias against them as they try to grow their business

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
That's what I want to ask you at this very moment

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Because

133
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
Because of what you represent the youngest

134
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
Female founder to take a company public

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
And

136
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
Yewtree this billion-dollar company

137
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Do you like

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Being seen that way

139
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,199
Is it irritating to you when people kind of

140
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Say oh here's this

141
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
Great woman founder do you embrace it how do you feel about it

142
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
I mean

143
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
I am mostly positive but it sometimes mix

144
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Like you know I think there are times when

145
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,815
Yeah it can be like oh that she's a great female CEO Mike

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Just want to be great

147
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
I don't need the female part of it I

148
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Just want to be a greaser

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
And I

150
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
That part can irritate me

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Maybe cuz you know I think that this point like we have the credentials

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
The flipside I

153
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
I feel immensely

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Proud and

155
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Really responsible

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
To be able to show

157
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
People like me

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
And so I know I'm very proud

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
That I am

160
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
A woman and very proud that I don't look like all of the other

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Public humping

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:36,543
D'nicio's out there and those are things that I think you know I feel like just by

163
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
Being on this stage I can have an A

164
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Impact

165
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
I'm and I think is is really really important

166
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Yeah do you mean

167
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,111
Do you feel like things are starting to change or turn a corner or

168
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Do you think it's

169
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
More of the same

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
I am mean I think there just has to be

171
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,535
Positive change like you know I don't

172
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,631
I don't know that we're turning a corner but you know there are there are many morphe

173
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
Female CEOs out there

174
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
I'm when I was writing my business school essay like I remember I was like I had Google spreadsheets of like women executive

175
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Passing how did they get there and

176
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
I mean either

177
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,551
Very few women for me to choose from when I was writing those essays and if I tried to write those essays

178
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Now I

179
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Anna 10 years later

180
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
There's many more options

181
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
The people that I could look to as role models

182
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
You know for that

183
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
10 years ago me

184
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
And so and I feel optimistic that changes happening

185
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
You know is it happening fast enough

186
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
That that part I think is is a real challenge

187
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
I want to ask you about building culture at

188
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Stitchfix because

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
I wonder if even when you were just a tiny team or maybe it was just just

190
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
The few people

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
Did you even have the luxury of thinking of

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
Culture at the early stage or you just trying to grind through

193
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
I hate you I thought about culture really early on and I and I do wonder if some of it

194
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,399
Even I was thinking about starting this company like I was thinking about it in terms of like while I want to

195
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Create

196
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
Like the retail model of the future but I also want to create

197
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
The company of the few

198
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
Future and related to that is like

199
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
I'm going to work at this cup

200
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
How many for 10 years 20 years whatever I'm now 7 years in like

201
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
In this day and age if you're going to work somewhere for

202
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
For 7 years like

203
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
It's a place you really love

204
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
And so you know I have this mind that when I was creating the company of like

205
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
What would be the company that I would want to join

206
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
7 years 10 years 20 years

207
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
You know I think the culture that we have I mean

208
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
People talk about diversity

209
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
Quite a bit and I think for us like

210
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
We have a very diverse

211
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:45,311
Steam we have a very diverse management team but I think it's also this idea of diversity of thought

212
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
And one of the epiphanies with Stitch fix was

213
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
That to be able to have two people in a room that had very different perspectives on how to solve a problem

214
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Ended up with better outcomes than two people who thought the same

215
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
For example we have data scientist

216
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Just sitting alongside

217
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Side stylist

218
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Like they look at the world images

219
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
They look at how do we serve clients better in a

220
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,167
Way and I think the the two working together is so much greater than us

221
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Some of its parts

222
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
I wonder how

223
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Crucial you think that is Imagine right people in this

224
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Ennis audience is listening early-stage entrepreneurs

225
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
You know they got to think about

226
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Everything from just

227
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,527
Getting a product out there and marketing and

228
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
You know competitors and

229
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
When all the things that you worried about

230
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
ETA mean

231
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,327
Could you argue that at the very early stages thinking about culture is an Indulgence or do you think it's absolutely

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Critical and crucial the vet

233
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Baked in from day one

234
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
I mean I think if you're going to have the best out

235
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Come for your company at half

236
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
I mean there's a I think there's a couple of reasons for that I think one

237
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,199
And I think it is that the team that you have like all of

238
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:01,855
Pics of such a great example because there was a point in time where like I was in the room and we talked at every 6 then we style every

239
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Obviously now I can't do that anymore and

240
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
It's all in the hands of

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Achievement culture

242
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
And like eventually

243
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
If you're successful if you have more than 10

244
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
People who are

245
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,911
In a working for you like you are your company that

246
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
State of your company rest in the vineyard

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
And what is going to keep a team motivated it's not money

248
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Actually it really is the culture

249
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
It's like what are they getting out of their day today

250
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
We all are lucky enough to have many choices

251
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
In terms of where we working are we spend our time

252
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
And they have to be choosing yours every day

253
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
And so you know I really believe that like if

254
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
If you aren't setting that up from day one

255
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
I'm you aren't realized

256
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Using your full potential

257
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
You do something really interesting

258
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,471
You think of your job as a different thing every year I'd rather chew you described as you rehire yourself

259
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
Every year so what it what does that actually mean in

260
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Yasso

261
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
Being a CEO is

262
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
I is fine with the very early days I remember I had a friend from high school who

263
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
I came to visit our

264
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Tiny office

265
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Set the time in

266
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Do you like I feel like your job is kind of like

267
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
CEO / janitor

268
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,583
And it really was in those early days like some of the things were like I need to make sure the printer has toner I need to make sure that

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
When somebody starting that they would have

270
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
That's going to be

271
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Computer

272
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
And so you know I think the recognition that like your job changes

273
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
And

274
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
You're to be able to have this

275
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,919
I guess processor just like this reflection of like

276
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
What is my new job today

277
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
What does that mean in terms of how I spend my time

278
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
And also like you know do I still like this job I think it's I think this is practical for me as CEO but I think it's also practice

279
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
For anybody who's employed at a company that's growing

280
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,351
Where are you know I think there are people who stay like I loved the early stages running out of toner and

281
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Feel crazy running around

282
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Like

283
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Love that stage and don't love

284
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
The stages later and the reality is like the job

285
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Changes in it

286
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
If you're not recognizing the ways in which

287
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
The job or changing or the wisdom

288
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
What you are changing

289
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Then

290
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
You can get stuck in the stall Jack

291
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
And so for me what I think is super important for me to feel really energized and

292
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Excited about what I'm

293
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
I'm doing is really like

294
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Recognize

295
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Latin saying like

296
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
This year like now or publicly traded company

297
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Like now some of the new challenges for

298
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
For me are working with public market investors are creating a longer-term strategy around how people perceive the

299
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Company from a financial

300
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
And really like those are interesting new challenges that I didn't have

301
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Before and so I think

302
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,967
Yeah for me being able to be excited about the next chapter in the new challenges that come with that

303
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
I'm at leaving some of the old ones behind has just been like a really important practice

304
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
How how

305
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
Has your leadership style changed 5 years ago vs. now

306
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,791
I don't know that my style itself has changed I think you know I've

307
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Developed in other ways but

308
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
I think the

309
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,983
Feeling this quote a little bit of just like I think this like idea of

310
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Today's leaders need to be off

311
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
And that's just like it's such a great

312
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Currency of like how do you build

313
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Trust

314
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
And

315
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
I think I've been

316
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,319
Forced to just be that from the beginning because there aren't a lot of other examples of people I can try to be like and so

317
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
And so and I think that's been really can't

318
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Interested in

319
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
True throughout my

320
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Tenure as CEO

321
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
But you know I do feel just like

322
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,423
I don't know I feel more experience I feel a little bit more like I know what I'm doing maybe the thing that's evolved the most has actually less

323
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
What to do with the company's trajectory as much as it

324
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031
Does for my family which is that like

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Having a toddler home and expecting another baby just means like

326
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
You have to ruthlessly prioritize

327
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,063
And so you know there are things that I would get super excited about and spend all night doing or just eat a crazy things that I used

328
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
To do that way

329
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
I can't do anymore

330
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
And so I think that's probably been the biggest

331
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Are remaining minute

332
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
If you were in this audience 10 years ago

333
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
And you're watching

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
A version of Katrina Lake hear what what do you wish you knew then that

335
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Would have been helpful

336
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
All to you that that you now know

337
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,335
Firstly I think it's awesome that you guys are in the audience

338
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
To I'm really be

339
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Be part of the entrepreneur

340
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
Community and really build. Network in the early days

341
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
I think that first and foremost you guys are

342
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Are already doing better than

343
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Then I was

344
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
I mean I think one of the things that I wish that I could have done better with a

345
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Having

346
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
The ability to pull back

347
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
And I'm in

348
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
See

349
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
I don't know how do I split that's like

350
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
The as an entrepreneur I felt like my life was just as

351
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
Crazy up and down roller coaster where is like one day it was like today's The Best Day Ever and then the next day it was today's the worst

352
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
They ever and it just was this like

353
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Crazy emotional rollercoaster

354
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Sister and

355
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
You know if I pull back the lens I'm like

356
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
Generally looks kind of up and to the right and it just like things generally were better the day you know the one month later than they

357
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
They were the month before and

358
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
It was just really hard to get out of that day today
