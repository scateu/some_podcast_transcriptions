I treated myself to a facial

74
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
After an economics exam and I had saved 40 or $50 to go to this place that was

75
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
Supposed to beat the be-all-and-end-all of facials and I remember walking into that place and the esthetician look through the lamp

76
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
At my skin what a pity

77
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
This is not a treat and I left feeling so horrendous and I remember to see my reflection

78
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
My face is kind of raw and blotchy and thinking if I ever had a place like that I would know

79
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Never make my customers

80
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064

Successful serial entrepreneur

100
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
She never sat down and said hey I'm going to start a line of skin care products called Bliss and then

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:15,744
I want to start for more companies she was a personal trainer who had a side hustle getting facials

102
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399

103
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Bigger

104
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
Marcia actually grew up

105
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055

Dad was a real estate agent mom took care of the house

Until age 11 when Marcia's dad died after battling cancer

So I think I've always loved a big challenge

119
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
Lunch and when I was living in Saskatoon which was

00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Really much too

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
To do

123
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,287
My middle sister started dating a guy whose brother owned

124
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055

00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
You know Saskatoon

133
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
10 months of the year

134
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,951
Pretty cold and there are only two television channels back then so it was

135
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
It was pretty dry

136
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
So I went down to the gym

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
And I remember them hooking me up with this

138
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215

Just got out of the gym

146
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879

I said don't laugh

163
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
But you know the it was great because I could also I mean by taught aerobics when I was a teenager as well just to earn extra money

164
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Waitress

165

Start of Lent itself to many different things that

166
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
That were useful

167
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Is in was was

168
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Was the idea

169
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Did you

170
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Did you have jobs in

171
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Did you earn money in part because

172
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Was you

173
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,455
I don't know felt like there was some Financial insecurity at home and that you

174
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,039
And it was a way for you to kind of have some control over your

175
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Own financial situation

176
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
I think that I knew my mother was under a lot of stress

177
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,279
You know just just from being a single mother and trying to make ends meet and I didn't want to be

178
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
A drain

179
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,935
And if I could pay my own way in terms of at least not asking her for any money

180
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
Even that was something that made me feel you know that it was it was

181
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Relieving

182
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Stressed from her

183
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Hitman never made enough

184
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Pay the rent

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
But I didn't have to ask

186
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Schizophrenic

187
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479

188
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
And bring a bunch of jobs at your bodybuilder

189
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Robux

190
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
The fitness type person as a teen and then what was your

191
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Plan After High School to Jutsu

192
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Did you go to college

193
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
What when I was

194
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,631
17 my sister who is living in New York at the time so this was my

195
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
My oldest sister Jody

196
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
She told me that if

197
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
I could get accepted to Columbia University and get

198
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Pass

199
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
All the different entrance exams

200
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Then she would pay my tuition

201
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,783
How was she able to do that she was a model she was living in New York City and making

202
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Decent cash decent cash

203
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,671
So I came to New York I had $300 in my pocket

204
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:34,303
And I was supposed to go to Columbia and that year unfortunately my sisters

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
Financial situation was not as strong as she thought it

206
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
It was going to be

207
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,239
And so as a had applied for a student loan

208
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Foreign student early enough

209
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
It's too late for me to get a loan

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
So I kind of was in New York

211
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
With my 300 bucks

212
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,783
And no school to go to and I had to figure it out

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
And this was like

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
1987

215
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
So you don't have money for school

216
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
No work

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
You know this is the interesting thing so I started

218
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
When I first arrived in New York

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
I got myself a gym membership

220
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,103
With the little money that I did have because of course once working out is part of your life you really have

221
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Citgo Antioch

222
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
To go pretty much every day for an hour rescue starts

223
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
To kind of lose that endorphin

224
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,575
Dependency and so there's a really great gym

225
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Call Better Bodies

226
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,207
And i met a film director there named douglas keeve

227
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
We chatted in a while we were working out and at one point he said hey do you think you could be my personal trainer cuz I want to look more like you

228
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
He was very tall and kind of lead and I will

229
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
Was probably a little bit more muscular but not bulky

230
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,127
I said he wanted to have a busy like mine and so he was my very first personal training client

231
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
And then other people

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Brewhemia

233
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
You just meet you and I started

234
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
My sister been

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
You realize that I was a purse

236
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Personal trainer and started to

237
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
Refer models and actresses and actors and stunt man and

238
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
We are all kinds of

239
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
People to miso

240
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
I ended up having you know

241
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
Quite a collection of interesting personalities

242
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Personal training clients

243
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
And started to build up the money that I needed

244
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Let's go to some part-time

245
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Classes at NYU

246
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
So

247
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
What did you think

248
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
All right I'll do this I'll take some

249
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Classes at NYU olbia

250
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Your personal trainer and then

251
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
But like long-term I'm going to do this or that

252
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Did you was that

253
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
Even like part of the equation

254
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
I had no plan

255
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
I think I was in survival mode I knew that

256
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
Doing personal training getting up at 5 a.m. and sometimes having your last night at 9:30 at night and then sleeping

257
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,031
Maybe 5 and 1/2 hours and starting all over again and maybe going to a class somewhere during the day that was under

258
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Sustainable

259
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
And I used to fall asleep in my

260
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Economics

261
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:02,271
Because I was so tired and then I started to develop quiet

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
A bad case of acne and it was probably because New York can be so humid

263
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
I was running around all day

264
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
And you wanted to look decent so you could put makeup on

265
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
And then go to

266
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,167
A personal training session with someone where you're sweating and then you put more makeup on that you didn't have time to go home and wash your face in between

267
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
That client the next client so my skin got really bad

268
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
I want summer I treated myself

269
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
To a facial after an economics exam that I took at NYU but I had actually walked up

270
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Town I had saved for your $50 to go to this place that was supposed to be the be-all-and-end-all a facial

271
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
And I remember going in there and I had been under so much stress trying to write this exam studying really hard

272
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
Working all the time no paying for everything myself and this was supposed to be a real treat and I remember walking

273
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Into that place laying down on the table

274
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
An esthetician booked through the lamp at my skin

275
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
And then she said what a pity

276
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Okay this is not a treat she actually then proceeded to go out into the

277
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,207
Let me know common area of that spot and bring in this file manager

278
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
Who was a gentleman who came in and they both looked through the lamp at my scanning and sort of piston oh no

279
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
What a disaster and I left feeling so horrendous and I remember taking the subway home

280
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
A nasty

281
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
Subway pulled up in front of me you have to have the stainless steel side so you get your reflection and remember to see my reflection of my

282
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Basic kind of raw and blotchy and thinking if I ever had a place like that I would never

283
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Make my customers feel bad about

284
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
And

285
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Remember

286
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
I decided

287
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
To take

288
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
The crash course

289
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
And skincare

290
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
And I took this I think it was probably

291
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Three or four weeks

292
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Crash course in

293
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Skin carrying a base

294
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
6 skincare and how to do facials

295
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
And I

296
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,895
Started to convince my personal training client after I would take them jogging or

297
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Give them a yoga

298
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Classic

299
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Whatever it was

300
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
To let me pray

301
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Facials on them

302
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
An end

303
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
And likes

304
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
And you would have all the

305
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
You know I'm driving

306
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Haven't had a facial.

307
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Ever

308
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Like showing up in

309
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
People's apartments with

310
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
All the supplies you need to give a

311
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,079
Facial Impressions picture that you were you lugging around like potions and lotions and things like that

312
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Oh yeah

313
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
I mean this was a huge bag of stuff first of all I care.

314
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,063
Steamer which is a very outdated piece of equipment I would never seen somebody's face now

315
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
Back then it was what everybody did and that was kind of the method that we learned and we thought

316
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
That was good for the skin

317
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,071
You know since then we've learned that it's not so good for the skin Tokay this steamer which was

318
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
We like a small

319
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Coffee machine

320
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
And then I would have probably 20 tubes in jars

321
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Cotton pads and

322
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Towels and

323
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
You know it was sort of

324
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Like a giant bat

325
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
If you were going to go

326
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
Hike the you know the trail

327
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
You can go hike that I was probably carrying around that

328
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Because I would then also bring my personal training app

329
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Play mat with piano

330
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
30 kilos

331
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Wow

332
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
So you

333
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
So you had this life

334
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Disservice

335
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,447
Sides and go and why you were also a personal trainer and

336
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
I mean it at what point Did you sort of start asking

337
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
People to pay you

338
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Furfrou

339
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,687
Think that any of my personal training clients I don't think I ever charged them for

340
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
And then at one point and it was

341
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
Kind of one of those beautiful organic things

342
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Where

343
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
I was doing a lot of

344
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Young models

345
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
I was their personal trainer

346
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
And there was an agency that used to send me all of the young models who were a little bit out of shape

347
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
To get them in shape

348
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
I'm at agency

349
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Cihad

350
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
A couple of girls who were the boogers

351
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
And one of them had

352
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,335
Quite Baskin and started to come for facial

353
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,175
And then she started to send me all of the young models

354
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
Who had bad skin and I started to really

355
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Gained a reputation for being able to

356
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
The clear up at

357
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,463
At which point I got other people coming in who were not necessarily just you know

358
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
Young new models but in fact

359
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm more well-known individuals who happen to

360
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,679
Live downtown here about me through the grapevine and you know

361
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Started coming in and paying for that service

362
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
Where where are you doing this at this point what started at my apartment and then I rented a tiny little space

363
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Probably

364
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
NSA

365
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
300 square feet

366
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,343
It was just a one-room Studio I had a little closet where people could change

367
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
And a chair where they could wait

368
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
That was what I had in people becoming for the facials

369
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
So you would probably you will be work on

370
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Currently working but it sounds like you were

371
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
When you were doing pretty well and you had money as a purse

372
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Coming in from Europe

373
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Personal training good money at coming in

374
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
The facials like that

375
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Olivia mean you you had expenses but you were his hands

376
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
You are covering

377
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Oh yeah I was covering my expenses

378
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:21,503
I was at a very low maintenance person though so I lived in in the East Village in my

379
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Studio art

380
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
What's it like sort of a

381
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
You could kind of call it a one bedroom

382
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
And I had a futon

383
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Leather sofa

384
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
I had a

385
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,279
Tiny TV that one of my personal training clients have given me because they didn't want it anymore

386
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
It's sat on a crate I had a

387
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Vacuum cleaner

388
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
And you know it's a lamp in a radio

389
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
So you know I was

390
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Apus

391
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
A minimalist

392
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
Let's say we're clients are mostly models at SFO

393
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Yeah it was quite funny because

394
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,063
Only had one door right over the door and people just sent us at the door knock and then I would open the door and

395
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
I remember from time to time opening the door

396
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
And the person standing I was so

397
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,767
Outstandingly beautiful male or female that I wouldn't be able to

398
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Speak

399
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Kroger open the door

400
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Gas

401
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
And lose my breath and I have to kind of

402
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,031
You know get my composure back and welcome them in and show them where to change and then give him a facial but

403
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
That was when it really

404
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
Exploded and everybody started

405
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
To come in from

406
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Uma Thurman I didn't

407
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Kidman Demi Moore

408
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Annie Leibovitz came in

409
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,623
How did you get all these Super Famous clients like

410
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
What was your

411
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
If I tell you I

412
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
I just really thorough

413
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
I think it's really important to be thorough and do you know just

414
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Do the best job you cut down

415
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Listen most facials

416
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Would take an hour

417
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Facial is generally an hour

418
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
I might be in there for two hours

419
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455
With somebody if they really needed it for me time you know

420
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
If I have the time and I could

421
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Could have somebody

422
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Have there treatment for longer I would do it and I Bank

423
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
You get results when you put time in

424
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
So at what point did you think

425
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
This really could be

426
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
A business like I need to

427
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
Think about turning this into just something Beyond

428
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
This 300 square foot

429
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Being a little

430
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Walk-in closet

431
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
2 something

432
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
I think I've

433
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Realize that it could be

434
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Viable

435
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
I guess career

436
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
When my appointment book

437
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,527
Started to be full for

438
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
5 to 6

439
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
Six weeks in advance

440
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,183
People would call and I couldn't necessarily get them in at the time that they requested I was working today

441
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
6 days a week

442
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
And still

443
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,815
Still trying to hang on to some of my earlier personal training clients

444
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
And realizing that it was just

445
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679
So hard to be able to do both that I might have to

446
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
You know someday give that up

447
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Also realize that I could train other people to do

448
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
The same thing

449
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,663
And that wasn't something that ever entered my mind before because I'll be

450
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
DC you know when you think that you're

451
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Early passes

452
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
You're going to go to university and you're going to have a profession you're going to work as a

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Professional never again no one in my family had ever

454
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Have their own business or

455
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
Give me that example that you can run a business that you can employ people that you can

456
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Can grow an idea

457
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
So

458
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
I think I'm probably after 2 years in that

459
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
That tiny little 300

460
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,727
Square foot space I hired someone

461
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
I'm who came in and started to learn how I was doing treatment

462
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
And then I found a bigger

463
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Space that I could rent

464
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Which was just

465
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Two blocks away

466
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
And started to build out what was

467
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Ben called let's face it

468
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
So when

469
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
How did you become Bliss how did that

470
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Adeline name be

471
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Become the name

472
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Company

473
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,375
So at let's face it it started to become so busy that we were books and they were at that point probably

474
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
5 estheticians

475
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,751
Esthetician being a person gives facials and we worked on different shift

476
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
So somewhere part-time but we tried to make the most of the 12th

477
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,223
The 14 hours that we could be open in our building during during each day and we were also open on Saturday

478
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
And at one point

479
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Probably after about 2 years

480
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,415
We were so busy that when people would call they wouldn't be able to get an appointment for

481
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Anywhere between

482
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
14

483
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
16 months

484
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Ansible

485
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
Yeah you know it was so amazing because people come in they would have their treatment they would leave it would be so high

486
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Happy and they would book

487
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
For that same time slot

488
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
For the next 12 or 18 months

489
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
I've never actually

490
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Great story

491
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
A huge snowstorm

492
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
In 1990

493
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
I-95 in New York where

494
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,439
Width of a snow piled up for 12 feet on the side of the road then

495
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Okay

496
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
Every everything around us with closing

497
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
Crate Barrel close Dean & DeLuca close everybody close

498
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Are phone that day

499
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
What's a ringing off the hook

500
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
What people say

501
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Has anyone cancelled

502
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Can we get in

503
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Because

504
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
They were hoping that a point would become available and that somebody else would have cancelled their put and nobody cancel their appointments

505
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,343
Somehow despite the weather everybody still made it down there cuz gossip are they going to cancel their appointment

506
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
So it was amazing

507
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
So I guess it was like

508
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,792
Like 1996 when when you open an even larger

509
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
Storefront right in this is when you called it

510
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Let's write

511
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Yep

512
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
And it was

513
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Much

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Bigger

515
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,336
Area floor plate than we'd had at let's face

516
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
We had 10 treatment rooms and we had a nap room

517
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,736
I'm and we opened in

518
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Beginning of July

519
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
Of 1996

520
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
How did you have the money to do this I mean the most to you must have

521
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Rent a space you have to

522
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
How to take a 3-year lease you had to put lots of money down yet

523
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
To convert the space I mean

524
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
Did you bring in outside investment

525
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
At the time

526
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
I was pretty scary

527
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
And

528
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:08,128
I again having not had the experience of anyone or you know really any business school likes

529
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Experience I didn't really

530
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
Consider I didn't even think about outside

531
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
What I knew was

532
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,088
That if I gay facials myself

533
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
All day long everyday

534
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
And I can probably take Sunday off

535
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
And charged you know maybe it was

536
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Is 84 a facial then

537
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,376
That I could still pay that rent by myself and that was a calculation that I made

538
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
I'm intensive of the build-out of the

539
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Spa

540
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,544
I took a little bit of a flyer on that one because

541
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
At that time of course we were booked for

542
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,432
18 months in advance and I kind of did the calculation in terms of

543
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,736
What you know

544
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
What we made

545
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
When we were full all day long

546
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Everyday

547
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
That we were really lucky

548
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
The timing was great on this

549
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
About two months

550
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Before

551
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
We open blessing while we were still in the construction phases

00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
American folk

555
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,264
A girl having milk poured over her head and talked about

556
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
We cream

557
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
And one of them

558
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Was

559
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
I think one of them is creme de la mer

560
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,760
Which Estee Lauder went on to buy and turned it into a big thing

561
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,624
And one of them was a Swiss oxygen cream that we saw and

562
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
When is

563
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184

A lot of the construction

We're almost covered by that 1 hour

578
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Incredible

579
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,880
So I mean you think about like renting a space in New York City today

580
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,696
In Manhattan today that's insane like you have to be

581
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
Multi-million

582
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
Are you have to put down tons of money and

583
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
Attentive

584
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Applications in end

585
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
And you did this in 1996 which

586
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,104
Still kind of do that and not be a millionaire I think so I think it was probably one of the last

587
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,968
Periods of time that you could do that not be a millionaire they seem to be a little bit more

588
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
Trust in terms of his

589
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
You know here's the kid I remember the landlord

590
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Kind of looking at me thinking with your sick kid and she's obviously

591
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
Responsible and she's got this

592
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Decent business already and you know let's give it a shot

593
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
Certainly I flinched and it was terrifying filling out the paperwork

594
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
And it was

595
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,984
You're looking at it thinking of the responsibilities of that overhead

596
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
But for me

597
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
Cuz I never had anything

598
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
To lose everything

599
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Was not a big deal

600
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
I'm trying to figure out they were there worse

601
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Spas

602
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
They're still there in the

603
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
But you come in and

604
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
You have this

605
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Baseballism

606
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Call it that

607
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Somehow

608
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Was just

609
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Exploded

610
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
Articles and people are lining up

611
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
What was it

612
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,168
About blessed what were you offering

613
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
That was different

614
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
From those other play

615
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
You know I've always

616
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,360
And and since then all the businesses that have started have been places

617
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
I want to go

618
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
So I wanted to go

619
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
To get a facial or get a body treatment to get a pedicure in a non-judgmental place where people were having fun with them

620
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Music was not about whales

621
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Singing or

622
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
I hated that kind of music I loved

623
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
Are Jazz and really good

624
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
Soulful music so he's a mix of music myself

625
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,424
I wanted it to be different I wanted to be a

626
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
Place that I would like to go that I would feel comfortable

627
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,544
Books where people would be accepting of me

628
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,616
You no answer that's what we did for everybody else

629
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
And

630
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
I think

631
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
It was

632
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
Fantastic because it was

633
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Very egalitarian

634
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,392
You would have those superstars in their soap McDonald whoever but then you would also have

635
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
Secretariat

636
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,512
Kids from NYU let you know terrible problems with their skin and

637
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Just wanted

638
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,072
Relief from it neighbor

639
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
Are going to school up the block so it was easy for them to come

640
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
Yep really everybody and it was

641
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
It was

642
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
Wonderful because everyone was treated exactly the same way

643
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
I think I'd be nervous getting Madonna facial

644
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
She was very curious

645
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
She's one of those people with tons and tons of questions

646
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
What are you doing now what is this what is that supposed to do

647
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,160
But you don't screenshot it wasn't really nervous giving anybody a facial

648
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
It was so much fun there was so many characters

649
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
From the people who work at the front desk

650
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632

651
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936

652
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
It is like watching a television show right

653
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
It didn't seem like work

654
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128

From NPR

714
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

715
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
I'm kyroz

716
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,360
So it's 1996 let's face it

717
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Becomes

718
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,528
Bliss and it opens as a day spa in New York Soho neighborhood and almost instantly the phone

719
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Are ringing off the hook

720
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,928
Took a very short period of time Marcia decides to expand

721
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Double the size of bliss

722
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,304
Chelsea gets married around this time to her boyfriend Terry

723
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,376
He joins the business and the two of them decided

724
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,264
Try new things like make a line of skin care products under the name Bliss in soon

725
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
They start talking about expanding to other cities

726
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
But just as things start to take off this is 3 years in the business a huge multinational brand

727
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Comes knocking lvmh

728
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,880
The conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton and they want a piece of bliss

729
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
70% and they're offering Marcia a lot

730
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Money

731
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
So the amount of money that's been reported

732
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
It was anywhere from

733
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,240
30 to 50 million dollars for that that 70% stake it which is a lot

734
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,312
But you guys were just hitting your strides

735
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Why did you sell it that

736
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
About a year prior to 1999 if we actually had a lot it was a

737
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
Hot time for beauty companies

738
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,160
Retrospectively there were a lot of

739
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
Cool new companies starting and a lot of interest in those companies from the big Beauty conglomerates they were starting

740
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,400
To buy up smaller players rather than into trying to build their own

741
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
And of course both had such a reputation

742
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,312
That we we had more than one large large company come and try and get us

743
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,712
And I think the most exciting thing for me at that time was the idea of not having

744
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,784
All of the financial responsibility

745
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
For that business

746
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:54,720
I'm on my head we actually were we had expanded and Along Comes A large company

747
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
Set looking at Redbox

748
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Which was

749
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,888
Was also very funny because they had a account and I think based in Chicago who couldn't believe

750
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
But we were making this money without doing something illegal

751
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,312
They came in and they did a report and there were all these things in the report

752
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
You know Bliss purports to have celebrity clients

753
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Play reports to be doing facials and what do you think we're doing in here

754
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
It was really it was quite funny to read I guess they just never seen anything like it before

755
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
It just

756
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
It seems like after so many years of

757
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Being

758
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
Kind of flat broke

759
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Or

760
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
You know

761
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
On the edge

762
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
They would be nice

763
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
Just have

764
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
A little bit of money

765
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
In the bank

766
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
Obviously Bliss

767
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Switching really well but you

768
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
You guys were

769
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Still living

770
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah I'll be okay so

771
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:52,064
For anybody who's live their entire life worrying about money or you know just kind of

772
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
Young Living very minimally

773
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
You do wonder if that's your motivation

774
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
And if your motivation and all this

775
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
Skills that you've developed well

776
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
Somehow profoundly changed when suddenly there are some zeros in your bank

777
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,424
So that was a bit of a crisis thinking will I be

778
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Different if I'm not

779
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Starving

780
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
But

781
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
It was just too good an offer

782
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
To refuse

783
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,640
They had flown me to Paris on the

784
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Concord

785
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,040
I had gone to the Christian Dior Boutique they took me to Orleans where the factory was where

786
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
They were you know manufacturing math

787
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Skara and

788
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
I'll be there when you come back to me or actually I have to say I came back to New York I flew back on the Concorde and I'm on the subway

789
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
In a Coca-Cola spilled all over this

790
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
Steven garbage strewn everywhere and

791
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,824
Hanging on that subway car thanking God I wonder if I was the only person on the Concorde this morning between the subway

792
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
And it was just it was it was funny cuz I can happily do both

793
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,528
But you did realize that maybe after having work my tail off

794
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,672
For 14 to 16 hours a day for the last however many years at that point I guess it would have been 11 years

795
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,512
Maybe it didn't have to be that hard anymore

796
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:11,936
Did it change your liquor like suddenly coming at all this money

797
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
You get a few a few

798
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,384
Dollars in your bank account and I did have a laugh and we used to joke when it got wired you know we said the eagle has landed

799
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,784
And we laughed and then we went and got groceries in our regular shopping Brooklyn you don't see money to you it just goes into

800
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Do its numbers on a

801
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,136
On a piece of paper and it lands and then

802
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Yeah baby

803
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
You might fly business class

804
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
A maybe you might

805
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,376
Go and buy a few more clothes than you normally would maybe once

806
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
And then you realize

807
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
You know what you love is what you love and

808
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,544
I think it takes quite a long time to start

809
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
Living differently when when you

810
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
Live for so long with the same attitude

811
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
Okay see you guys in 1999 you sold about 70% of the company to

812
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
To lvmh

813
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
2004

814
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
You sold the rest

815
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Your shares to another come

816
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
You walked entirely away from Bliss

817
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
That's what was

818
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,376
What's going on in your life that

819
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,240
Lvmh after 2001

820
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
They started to divest of most of it beauty biz

821
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
And we were one of the first ones

822
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
To get snapped up by another

823
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
Business so Starwood Hotels and Resorts

824
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
But ice

825
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
Because they wanted to have blue spots

826
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
And it was put those

827
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
N2w hotels in another hotel

828
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
And so

829
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,256
Yeah that was also very flattering so first I had you know one of the largest luxury groups in the world by

830
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,096
My business and then I had the largest hotel group in the world by my business so

831
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
Two Good Hits

832
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,216
But they put somebody in charge of the business

833
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,288
Who was the young guy probably The Prodigy of the

834
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
The man who owns Starwood at the time

835
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,176
Who really didn't understand customer service the way I understood it

836
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
And

837
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
I felt like I was spending most of my day

838
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
Trying to teach him but he was reticent

839
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
And

840
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
For me

841
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Do you know

842
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Chip

843
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
Spend my time on

844
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
That when the

845
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
The person is not necessarily

846
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Open to the ideas

847
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
Just felt like banging my head against

848
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
It was very draining

849
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
So I decided to

850
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
To take a break from it

851
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,592
And I didn't really know what I was going to do

852
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,152
But I just didn't want to do that

853
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Anymore

854
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
So when

855
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
When you left

856
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
Starwood

857
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
What did you do to shoot I know

858
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,344
That you

859
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Musa London

860
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
Fort for a while did you just kind of hang out

861
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,744
Choi not working for a while

862
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
But probably had a

863
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
About three months

864
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Off

865
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
And as soon as I

866
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
I had

867
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,520
A little bit of energy back I started to

868
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
Come up with a

869
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
You new ideas for a new brands and a new things that I had

870
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
As a woman again

871
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
The hole in the marketplace

872
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Play Store

873
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
So I guess the

874
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
We should we should we should point out here that

875
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
It didn't take very long

876
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
How to decide to start a new business

877
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Which was soapandglory

878
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
And this is going to be like before double personal hygiene

879
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Skin products

880
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
Yeah I'll be okay so I remember just

881
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
You know scanning newspapers

882
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Toscanini's

883
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
Journals every Sunday and

884
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,824
Same as that guy's really being one about collaboration

885
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,408
And you know High Street prices or you know

886
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
Really affordable pricing for designers

887
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Our stuff and H&M was Leading The Way with

888
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
With that

889
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
And also

890
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
About waist

891
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,904
There was starting to be a lot of

892
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
A lot of

893
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,328
Interest in environmental concerns there was a story about David Beckham only wearing his underwear once

894
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Throwing it out and how wasteful it was you know

895
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
SOA

896
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
I started to think you know people are really

897
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Worried about the environment

898
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
People want more for their money

899
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,896
And so how can I roll that all out and do

900
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,712
Fun little brand that I can sell

901
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,552
And soap and Glory it was designer affordable

902
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Cosmetic

903
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,416
And then of course I we also did Dre sample packaging that wouldn't be

904
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
You're too hard on the environment

905
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
Took all the Zeitgeist ideas in

906
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Bundle them up and

907
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
So we launched at Harvey Nichols

908
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Really fun department store and then

909
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Boots came knocking

910
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:37,152
Who's has the big the big drug stores

911
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Britain

912
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,504
And so we rolled out into boots and it was

913
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:47,136
It was actually very small for the first couple of years we didn't do that much business but within essays

914
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,256
767 years we were probably be telling about a hundred million

915
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:57,120
And you did not take any outside investment for this company

916
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
I know cuz you didn't need to you had you could use the money that you had from the sale of blisstool

917
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,128
The snacks company organic growth you

918
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,944
People think about this overnight successes inferi

919
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Rarely are they in overnight

920
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,600
My things do take years and they grow but then once they grow big enough they start to snowball

921
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,440
And so it started to snowball in it at one point

922
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
I remember

923
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Istudent

924
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Like crazy Christmas bag

925
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
Where are these Christmas pictures

926
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Full of products

927
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,656
And there are literally hundreds

928
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
Thousands of them produce

929
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
List every Christmas and

930
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,336
The week before Christmas there would be this special offer we could go in and

931
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
Looking for a Christmas bag and if

932
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
If you walked around London

933
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Every third person was

934
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Carrying

935
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Three or four of these on their arms

936
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
It was such a big deal.

937
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
In the midst of of launching soap & Glory

938
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
A year later

939
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
You lunch to another company

940
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
In addition to that you lunch today

941
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
A company that makes

942
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
I like flip-flops

943
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Is called

944
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Call the FitFlop

945
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
So how did that happen why would you like a second company whilst

946
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Trying to a lunch

947
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,872
The first company Earth II company why would you want a third company

948
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
But trying to get your second

949
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
You know

950
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
This is very interesting

951
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
White lights to kind of

952
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Simultaneously

953
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,392
However I have just read this book called Originals

954
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
And this one chapter

955
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
In that book where it says

956
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
2 entrepreneurs always hedge their bets

957
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,656
Right you don't give up your day job because you think that you're you know side has told her whatever it is

958
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Is going to actually pay off

959
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:41,312
If you always do two things at the same time cuz one of them may not work and you want to make sure that you've got another one

960
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
And it's kind of like personal training

961
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
While I was doing facials

962
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
What's right and I guess I

963
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Did that

964
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Again where

965
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
With soap and Glory when I started it you know it was only a year later

966
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
But I also launched FitFlop and it was really based on

967
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:00,768
The idea for one shoe which was economically correct which would align your body while you watch and

968
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
Because of my personal training days and trying to

969
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,888
Use my time more efficiently and having started this

970
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,752
This new business open Glory thinking that I'd have work-life balance and then finding that I had

971
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
No time at all actually

972
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
Or very little time to exercise

973
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
I was thinking to myself

974
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,968
What can I invent to make more out of this time that I

975
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
That I have when I am walking

976
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,600
How can I make walking really work for me in an optimal way

977
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:32,512
So I've been spent a lot of time on different trains in the UK going to different universities trying to find somebody

978
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
Who would be able to help me realize

979
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
This idea and in fact

980
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Eventually

981
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Found

982
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,240
Dr. Dave Cook at the University of South Bank in London which was

983
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Probably a mile away at

984
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
The crow flew

985
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,896
So I eventually met with DACA

986
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
When I went in at security idea

987
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Blah blah blah and he said oh I know how you can do that

988
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
So they told me they can make a prototype test

989
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
They had a shoe design

990
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
Course going on within the University

991
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
I waited and waited and waited about three months later

992
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
I come in to see this prototype init

993
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
Literally it looks like a lump of coal

994
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
With some ropes

995
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Finance

996
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,704
We can't sell this this so ugly

997
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,520
No one will wear this outside no matter what it does for them

998
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
But we tested it right so we

999
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
We put it on

1000
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Some

1001
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Different

1002
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
University students

1003
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
Speed and we put electrodes on them and we looked at their

1004
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Forces

1005
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,808
You can see whether or not the technology is helping

1006
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
To align

1007
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,416
The force that goes through your heel

1008
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Is your heel strike

1009
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
When you walk

1010
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
And

1011
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
It worked

1012
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
Rights of this this lump of coal with the robes

1013
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
It worked

1014
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
So

1015
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
I've been thought okay

1016
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
What do I do now

1017
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
About the shoe

1018
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
It does what I wanted to do

1019
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,128
I don't know how to make a shoe or where to go to get shoes made and then I thought well I

1020
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,711
I could go to Nike or Puma or whatever and they thought no I can't cuz they're going to steal my ID

1021
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
Yeah and then in the recesses of my mind

1022
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,623
Night I remember that I knew somebody who did Footwear

1023
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,719
At the time they were called Peter black they've since been bought by a Chinese conglomerate

1024
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,815
We called Peter back but we're and we met with somebody who did sourcing for them

1025
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
And then we had a mold made

1026
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,471
Which again you know which one of these since you got to take a flyer it was probably

1027
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
$40,000 to have the mold made

1028
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,895
So you have to really hope this is going to go because $40,000 is not nothing

1029
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,319
But at the time I thought you know what I'd buy this issue with this she was available so I'm sure other people will buy this shoe

1030
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,135
And so would you run up we made a prototype

1031
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
Frantically comfortable

1032
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
Incredible

1033
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
And

1034
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,839
I remember sitting down so course I went to retailers that I knew

1035
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:49,215
From my American days first and then and then also to Busan in the UK who is selling soap & Glory

1036
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,543
But about a year before that I had met with Bath & Body Works

1037
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Explain the idea

1038
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
And the buyer from Bath and Body Works

1039
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Looked at me and said

1040
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
I'll take somewhere between 300000 and 500000 pairs of autism

1041
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
A year wow

1042
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
I'm shocked I remember walking away cuz they wanted to meet at claridge's so we went to Claire just you know and had tea and talked about it then

1043
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Walking out of Clarence just thinking

1044
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Wow

1045
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Whole new level

1046
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
I mean I couldn't get 300,000 facials a year

1047
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,567
It's incredible I mean if you if you think about it right so you

1048
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
You sell blessed

1049
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
You walk away from Bliss

1050
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
You then

1051
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
Launch soap & Glory in

1052
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Run that business

1053
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
Simultaneously launch

1054
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
The economic shoe line

1055
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
FitFlop in 2007

1056
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
You sold soap & Glory to boots I guess and

1057
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
2014

1058
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
And then last year you launched

1059
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
A brand new business

1060
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
8 Hayes

1061
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
A subscription service

1062
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
For high-end cosmetics

1063
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
That are asked

1064
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Salem

1065
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Adpi

1066
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
How do you do that how do you

1067
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
How do you

1068
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,271
Create so many how do you say on top of so many different ideas and Company

1069
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,623
You know guy today I don't feel like I'm quite so on top of it

1070
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
But beauty pie the whole idea behind it was

1071
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
Knowing

1072
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Cosmetic dentist

1073
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Treehouse fun it is

1074
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
To go to some of these third-party lab

1075
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
And that you walk out of there with

1076
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Yeah bags

1077
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Full of free cosmetic

1078
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,079
You're walking

1079
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,431
Through of cosmetic store with a bag that you just got from the third party lab

1080
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
That's probably

1081
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Got a $2,000 street value

1082
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
And they were all free and thinking

1083
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Wow

1084
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,135
You know what if I can bring every woman into the

1085
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
Into the luxury cosmetics

1086
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,767
Factory with me and we can ride it together how fun would that be

1087
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
What are Thrills of being a kid in the candy store

1088
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,655
And so that was the idea behind PewDiePie how do I

1089
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
How do I give women the same feeling

1090
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
That I have to get the

1091
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Furnace parts

1092
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
Of being able to work in cosmetics is Wendy's

1093
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Free boxes of stuff

1094
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
From the lab show up

1095
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,247
MPD pies a little bit different you buy stuff at the factory cost but

1096
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Is practically

1097
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
Compared to what you pay for it at retail

1098
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,183
What what's interesting is that you don't seem to be

1099
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
Sentimentally attached to your company's

1100
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Is you

1101
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
You launch them

1102
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Create them

1103
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Tournament

1104
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,143
Incredibly successful companies

1105
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
And you sold at least two of them and

1106
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
And you may

1107
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Sell others

1108
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Do you

1109
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
Is there a certain point where you just say I don't know

1110
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,687
I just want to move on and in and start something new like is it

1111
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Is it almost like

1112
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
When a business becomes too big or

1113
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,599
Or are you just bored

1114
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
You want to

1115
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Start something new

1116
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
You know I thought about this one a lot

1117
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
I did get asked

1118
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
DIY

1119
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
Why do you keep doing this

1120
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
And I'm and I think about the

1121
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,703
Thrill that is beauty pie right now

1122
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
Really like I'm rubbing sticks together

1123
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
And I think it's

1124
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
What really drives me and what I really love

1125
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Have you ever heard the expression

1126
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,015
Your first marriage is for love the second one's for money and the third one's for companionship

1127
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
I think some famous divorce

1128
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
Say probably

1129
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
That that one

1130
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
The companionship that

1131
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
That

1132
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
I get out of having a business where I can really

1133
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
Interface with women and I'm making them happy

1134
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,191
Answer Man of course we have with 4% man at the moment but

1135
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495
Do you want to make people feel that happy and

1136
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
And have them communicate that to me is what

1137
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Give me the

1138
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
The biggest Buzz

1139
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
I mean it's it's

1140
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
What do you think

1141
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,199
That

1142
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
That your your brain works that way that

1143
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
That you just

1144
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
R generating all these

1145
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Cytosol

1146
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Time and ideas that

1147
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
That don't

1148
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
Flowed up in

1149
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
In the space that ideas

1150
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
You actually

1151
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Stop sit down

1152
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Start to really

1153
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,583
They almost seem to obsess you

1154
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
DC Legends

1155
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
/ take everything

1156
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
In your world like

1157
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Why do you think

1158
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
That happened

1159
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
How did I end up like this

1160
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
It was sort of yeah

1161
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
I

1162
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
You know I have

1163
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,551
But a lot about that cuz you have to psychoanalyze yourself and I

1164
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
I also tell want to be on top

1165
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Respite

1166
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
I would tell them that

1167
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,487
One of the tools that they should have is understanding of how the human brain works

1168
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
That's right because if you can understand how your brain is fooling you

1169
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
When you might be reacting

1170
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
To something rather than making a sound

1171
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:40,287
Decision or when you might be feeling insecure when you really shouldn't be a when you're jumping to a judgment

1172
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,615
He doesn't have enough information

1173
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Back it up

1174
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,759
Now when you try to vanco psychoanalyze yourself I would say well I must be extremely

1175
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
Competitive because I will come up with these ideas and thank

1176
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,415
I can't do that and then I'll think

1177
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
I have to do that and then

1178
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,023
But if I don't do that fast somebody else is going to do it

1179
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
And I don't know why I care

1180
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
I need why do I care if somebody else goes and does it

1181
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,983
There must be some competitive aspect to it and so I much

1182
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
More comfortable

1183
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
Where I feel like I'm building something

1184
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,663
It's got to be genetic right cuz there's nothing else that would

1185
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Really

1186
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
Explain that

1187
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
How much of

1188
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Of your

1189
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Trust you think

1190
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,671
Because of of your intelligence and hard work and how much how much do you think

1191
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Is because

1192
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
It's a lock

1193
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Okay

1194
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Okay

1195
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
I'd say

1196
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
I'm certainly above-average

1197
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
In IntelliJ

1198
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
I'm not a genius

1199
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
I know a lot of people who are

1200
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
Much more intellectual than I am actually much moisture

1201
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Strategic

1202
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
And

1203
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
People always say that I'm very stiff

1204
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,479
Teach it but I don't think of myself as such a

1205
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Strategic person Digest

1206
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
Tend to think of things in very

1207
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Simple

1208
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Champs

1209
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Luck I've certainly had some

1210
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
I mean

1211
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
Moving to New York and having a sister who was

1212
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,303
Really good-looking and in

1213
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Field where she could

1214
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,655
Give people who could afford my services

1215
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
FB

1216
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,751
An introduction to me so that I can have

1217
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Clientele

1218
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
And then more of those people

1219
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,639
Would refer more of those people that's certainly lucky

1220
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,479
However if I wasn't good at what I was doing I don't think I would happen

1221
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,807
And if I didn't show up on time if I wasn't friendly and

1222
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
In a reliable I suppose

1223
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
You get a bit of luck

1224
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
I don't have to make something out of it

1225
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
And

1226
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
I find

1227
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
When I

1228
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
The end

1229
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,863
I'm sure you see this as well you see people were so talented

1230
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,935
Buy Morita really genius at what they do

1231
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
But I'm not

1232
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
Ever really

1233
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
Successful they're always struggling

1234
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
And I always wonder

1235
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,663
You know is it just a choice that you make where at one point you say you know what I am

1236
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
I am worthy

1237
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,015
I deserve this why not me

1238
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
Because

1239
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
You know why not you

1240
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,439
And if you're willing to work that hard why shouldn't you then take the success that comes with it

1241
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,279
And I think that's a very complex thing for many people

1242
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
And somehow I've managed to

1243
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,167
Over combat

1244
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:19,775
It is amazing how many how many of these companies that use

1245
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
Needed

1246
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
E-end

1247
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
All the things you've done

1248
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,431
Have you ever come up with the idea that that you thought was just going to

1249
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
Amazingly well that you just

1250
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,551
Didn't pursue because it wasn't actually quite right

1251
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
I have one right now but I

1252
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
Not that I'm not pursuing it

1253
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Right

1254
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,999
But I can't say what it is because we're patenting at the moment

1255
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,327
Right now you are going to lunch something new on top of

1256
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
Things that you do incredible a guy how do you turn your brain want to explode if I've had too many

00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
In American culture

1284
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
Through line from NPR

1285
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
The podcast where we go back in time

1286
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
The understanding

1287
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Hey thanks for sticking around

1288
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
It's time now for how you built that

1289
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,839
And updating a story today that ran

1290
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
About a year ago

1291
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
It starts in 2015 in Los Angeles

1292
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,471
With a guy named Miles pepper

1293
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,823
I went to my local coffee shop to grab an iced latte before heading off to work

1294
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:34,687
And as I was leaving the shop I put a plastic straw my drink as normal habit

1295
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
But that's what happened

1296
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
Just the night before

1297
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
Cena program about

1298
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
Plastics that are polluting the ocean I had just seen the video of the sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nose

1299
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
I was thinking to myself that

1300
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
I already have a reusable water bottle

1301
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
I already have

1302
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
Reusable coffee cup

1303
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
Why don't I have a reusable straw

1304
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
Yeah a reusable straw.

1305
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
Made out of plastic

1306
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
Maybe metal

1307
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,847
A straw that could fold and collapse

1308
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,639
Like a temple

1309
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
A way to

1310
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
Guarantee that it would always be

1311
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
On me would be if it was a size of a car key

1312
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,623
So I wanted a collapsible straw that was small enough to fit in a case

1313
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
The size of a car

1314
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:21,791
But unfortunately I didn't know the first thing about how to make a collapsible straw

1315
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:27,423
So I started talking with friends I started talking with these designers that I have been working with

1316
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,311
This mutual friend said hey you should call Emma do you remember Emma and in fact miles did remember Emma

1317
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:38,687
She was an acquaintance who also hated plastic straws she even done a tedx talk about it

1318
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Straws suck

1319
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,551
We become accustomed to living disposable lifestyles

1320
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
Based on convenience

1321
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:51,487
So MN ident jumped on the phone the phone rings October 2017

1322
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
And he says

1323
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,351
Hey I've got this idea for a collapsible straw

1324
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,911
And I just remember he first

1325
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:03,775
Sounded really excited on the phone and it got me really excited

1326
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
So anyway miles found in industrial designer in LA to help him develop a collapsible stainless

1327
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,527
Steel straw and while they were working on the design I was

1328
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Working on

1329
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
Creating a social media presence

1330
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
I have a love of means and one of my favorite ones was filling a pack of cigarettes

1331
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
With straws and at the bottom it says break the habit

1332
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,447
After about a month-and-a-half and my miles had a prototype of a straw that folds into Force

1333
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,287
Fits into a little plastic case that you could carry on a keychain

1334
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Annexed

1335
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
Kickstarter campaign

1336
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
And the pickle was

1337
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
5000 straws which would have been about $70,000

1338
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
But we sold about 60,000 straws and closed a month later with 1.89

1339
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:56,767
$3 in the bank which sounds amazing right it's a big problem

1340
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,631
There's companies out there that are patrolling Kickstarter and looking to see

1341
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
When people throw a success

1342
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,007
Spell campaign and as soon as they see that overnight success

1343
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,311
Then they jump on it and they

1344
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,127
Use the measurements that are provided on the kickstarter

1345
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,967
To create an exact replica of that item in that

1346
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
Is exactly what happened to Emma in Miles these random sharks basically hijacked their idea

1347
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Need some quick

1348
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
Cheap knock-offs

1349
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:30,815
And started fulfilling orders before Emma miles could even get their straws out into the world I mean it's

1350
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,167
Talking the hardest part for her is the fact that

1351
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,239
Most of these knock-offs are complete junk

1352
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
And so

1353
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,567
They're just ending up in the trash can

1354
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,407
And the entire purpose of our company was to reduce waste

1355
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
And so I feel weirdly responsible and you know no matter how many people tell me that it's not my fault

1356
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
All like it's still feels like it is

1357
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:59,743
Emma started filling Kickstarter orders in November of 2018 and she says this past year

1358
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,071
It's been like business school on speed

1359
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
I don't know it's like

1360
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,143
Going down a river in a

1361
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,983
Too but you just don't know what to expect and every moment is he there like

1362
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,591
Very Serene and calm or you're maybe going to die

1363
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,615
And I love it

1364
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,919
That's Emma Cohen the co-founder of

1365
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Final straw

1366
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,759
Final straw

1367
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Issue date

1368
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:28,159
I sold about 5 million dollars worth of collapsible metal straws

1369
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
Emma is not working on their necks

1370
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
