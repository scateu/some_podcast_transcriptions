She came to me and she knew I had to fire a lot of people cuz you could just see the

37
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Everybody knew something was going to shake out and she said one should probably fire me if you fire me

38
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
She said no one else could be angry with you when you fire them and she was right so at that Monday morning meeting we always had at 9

39
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
9:30 I said so surprised how bad things are going to have to make a lot of changes and it's going to be

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,512
Very hard for me to do with the hardest change rules required my mother

00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472

To Willie conversity zorawar academic genius

59
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Most of them

60
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Figured stuff out along the way

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
And use the tools they had

62
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
Which princess did Barbara Corcoran

63
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Probably the most

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488

Wasn't the best student in fact

69
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
She didn't excel at school at all

00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
What she had

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Rather has

Charisma

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
How she'd eventually build one of New York's most sick

Successful real estate firm

Quora

78
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Big Irish Catholic Family

79
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
9 brothers and sister

80
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Department

81
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Edgewater New Jersey

82
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
Even though

83
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
They had almost nothing

84
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
She remembers a childhood that was

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Basically happy

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
I mean we all had our issues as every family does

87
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
But

88
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,800
It was well-organized my mother was like a drill sergeant so even though we all

89
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
Lived in such Close Quarters was meticulously clean and everything was put in order where my mother snap turf

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
We had a side yard

91
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,064
Which we controlled it was a skinny little side yard but

92
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Most of the house in Edgewater were back-to-back so we felt wealthy you know we're renting the ground floor we felt Wealthy by

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
By comparison

94
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:48,096
And also my dad was a printing press form and I had to wear a suit to work

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
And every other guy in the town seemed to work for the Luna Factory or the

96
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Coffee company in a uniform

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
So I kind of thought of us as like

98
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
The Kennedys like

99
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
Whoa We were something and up

100
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
At school it was a different story

101
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Barbara struggled a lot

102
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
But everyday when she get home from school

103
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Her mom

104
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Was right there

105
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Achieve

106
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Never

107
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
I told you what was wrong with

108
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
She always told you

109
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,327
What she thought was amazing about you and sheep in one thing on each kid so each kid knew what that thing was

110
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Should I have a wonderful imagination

111
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,007
So when I couldn't pass any subjects in school and I was really upset I remember distinctly when

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
The nun from Hell sister Stella Marie told me I'd always be stupid I was so upset to hear that word stupid like get a label finally

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
And my mother said oh don't worry about it with your imagination you learn to fill in all the blanks so I didn't learn to read

114
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
But I thought I could fill in the blanks

115
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
I fell for it you know and she's right

116
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
Because I did have a good imagination or at least

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Maybe I'll learn to have

118
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Because of her

119
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,655
But it was 22 Barbara was working as a waitress at a diner in New Jersey

120
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
And one night during a shift

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
An older man

122
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Dapper

123
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Confident charismatic

124
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
What in for a bite to eat

125
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
And when Ramon Simone

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
I walked into my life

127
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
And set him

128
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
My counter

129
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Call what you wanted was a lucky break

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
It was like you could

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Hell

132
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
That he was some

133
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
LC

134
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
And she had a suit on

135
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
And he didn't have just a suit

136
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Kid like a pressed collar

137
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
With a shiny toy

138
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Shiny shoes

139
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
And he had all navy blue Aviator Shades I couldn't really see his eyes

140
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Also

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
He told me

142
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
He was from The Basque

143
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
I know where that was but I

144
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
It wasn't a New Jersey

145
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
And he told me it was a warrior tribe of some kind

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Cool

147
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
Now later I learned his name wasn't Ramon Simone with an accent

148
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Mother Vicki who I got

149
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
No many years later

150
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Said his name was Ray Simon

151
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Big difference right but good good for him and he wasn't from The Basque country was 440 5th Street Harlem

152
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
But good for him again what a merchandiser

153
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
All right until he have a lot to

154
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Teach me

155
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Okay and

156
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,287
I got a new family with your his three girls who moved in with us after I moved in with him I didn't know we had

157
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
This is your first

158
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
True love

159
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Well I'm not even sure it was a true love but

160
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Someone who is different

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Can anyone I have ever met before

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
For older

163
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Successful in life had a big

164
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Car I hate to

165
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Biso

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,207
Detritus to say that impress me but it was a Lincoln Continental

167
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,815
With real leather seats and when he offered me that ride home from the diner that

168
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
That first night I remember thinking he had sprinkled talcum powder on the

169
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,983
All of his seat because I was sliding around

170
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
That's just cold real leather and

171
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Was that

172
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
But your life was going to

173
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
BMW

174
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Have bigger ambitions

175
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
You know honestly I have never had that

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
And I I can even say

177
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Along the way

178
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
A building a successful life

179
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
It's not like I really had any big thoughts about when I be successful I just had more of a curiosity

180
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Let's just see how far I could go

181
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
That was it

182
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Curiosity

183
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
No one in my family has ever gone to

184
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,383
The college when I got into a college I just couldn't believe it but it was old girls

185
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,247
College I had previously the year before been a nunnery that made nuns I forget what

186
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
And they're only 30 spot so just opening they took me

187
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
The basically not realize I took anyone

188
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
But that was just a lucky break

189
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,535
And it didn't interfere with my work I was holding three jobs all the way through

190
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Please work

191
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
So

192
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
It just kind of happened you know that I one thing led to another

193
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
How did you find your way to real estate

194
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:46,943
I was working as a receptionist for the jacuzzi Brothers here in New York City answering their phones a million times a day good morning

195
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
The funny Brothers

196
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Zephyr quit my job is

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
The waitress

198
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
Joseph Tiffany was a large

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,207
Real estate holder in Manhattan xi'an probably 50 apartment buildings in your

200
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah they were there very well

201
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
It was Joe and his other

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
What kind of gadfly a brother

203
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Andrew

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
Who ran the business but Joe is really the power

205
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
He hired me

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
And then within a couple of months

207
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
Ramon said Trina with your personally barbecue be great at real estate sale

208
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
I said okay I'll try it on your why not added

209
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
I think I turned twenty-two draws maybe 23 by then

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
I thought why not

211
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Give it a whirl

212
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
And they gave me $2,000 *

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Just like that

214
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Yes

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,255
Ramon gives you a thousand bucks and then

216
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
How did you better you start your own real estate

217
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
I'm the only person I knew was mr. Tiffany

218
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,287
And I asked him if he would just let me rent one of his Apartments the same building where I answer the phone every

219
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
And he gave me a listing

220
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Try to rent

221
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Apartment 3L

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
And so when I saw 3L and what he was asking if it was

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
330 a month

224
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
I looked at him thing or not how do I

225
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
It's it was a dungeon he gave me the worst one maybe it was a challenge maybe nobody

226
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
But when I saw the listing

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
And looked in the New York Times and saw

228
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Reams in

229
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
Reams of exits red identical

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
Play one-bedroom 341 bedroom

231
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
33051 bed it was all the same I'm thinking how do I

232
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,383
Spend my three-line ad why is it was remember I had $1,000 I provided it by my overhead

233
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
I knew I had at 7 weeks to stay

234
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
According to my map

235
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,551
And so I asked him if he build a half wall

236
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
To divide the

237
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
Dentistry part of living room from the L next door

238
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
With double entrance and I told him I thought I can get them 360 a month

239
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
What's the weather

240
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
20 $25 more than you wanted

241
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Johnny said he yeah he build the wall

242
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
And I got it for him cuz Maya

243
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
1 bedroom and den

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
For the same price that everybody else is offering a one bedroom light.

245
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
The first Sunday I must have got 60 phone call

246
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
And so easily rented that apartment and then got others and got others in adjustable

247
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
And you were you were

248
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Basically making a

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Commission office rental

250
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
I made exactly what the

251
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
What the

252
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Monthly rental was I when I rented that first apartment I did the the smartest thing in the world knowing I was ahead of the game

253
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
I collected the commission within a week that's what's beautiful

254
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
You have to wait for sale closing

255
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
So I collected that

256
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Check for misophonia

257
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
I cash in Citibank and I ran right over to Bergdorf Goodman's and I blew it on a new coat

258
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
And it was a smartass and I could have

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
Because I dress like a poor kid for me

260
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
Nothing like being I just looked not the park

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
But I thought the fanciest damn code

262
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,903
A brown and white herringbone is real pearl buttons down 3/4 length

263
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
For real fur not fake

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
And I wore that coat

265
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
The next three

266
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
And you want to know it was the smartest thing I could have done with the money cuz in and I felt powerful Joe

267
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
I'm cool man I'm a cool girl

268
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
What is called a business

269
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
I was called Corcoran Simone

270
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,479
With an accent on the Simone I kept the axon cuz I really thought it was pretty so sweet

271
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
All right meniscus because Raymond

272
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Yes

273
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:09,951
So why you were like why you were going out and working as an agent to rent apartments what was Raven-Symone doing

274
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Ramon Simone

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Ramon Simone

276
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Little flask

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
I'm Ramon Simone was building one family houses in New Jersey

278
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Usually classes

279
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Three or four houses in making a very good living

280
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
And that went on for probably

281
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
3 years or so hazard

282
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Call and then one day we

283
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Drove his accountants

284
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Office in Hackensack New Jersey

285
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
And he had me wait in his car with the car running comes out

286
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Guess what

287
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
I thought it was a joke and I moved immediately out of his fancy apartment

288
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
I moved into his mother's

289
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Hackensack house

290
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
And that was the bad years

291
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Where are we

292
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Not undercover butthead

293
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,471
Up from the Earth all over again and he did he was a great entrepreneur

294
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
I took about 3 years and those were the

295
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
The very very

296
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Tough years

297
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
But lucky for both of us

298
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
I'm the rental business was

299
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Paying for itself and we're able to eat

300
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
He got a salary you were running this from your

301
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Confirm an apartment

302
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,879
No no no no no no I had an office I initially ran

303
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Corcoran Simone

304
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
A from an apartment I shared with two roommates

305
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
On 86th Street

306
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
But then when I could afford to I sublease to desk from an accountant

307
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
On East 60th Street

308
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,239
And by the time we moved into Ramon Simone's mother's house

309
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
We still have the office on 60th Street

310
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
We already had

311
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
I guess maybe 10 or 11 Des occupied by rental

312
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
So you were going into

313
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Manhattan everyday

314
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Yes

315
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,623
It was like it was like the Land of Oz you know the minute I stepped foot into Manhattan

316
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,743
I saw for what it was like where have you been all my life

317
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Clown

318
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
This is like

319
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
The

320
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
The violent nights

321
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
1870s New York

322
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Bankrupt

323
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
The Son of Sam

324
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
What was it like

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
2 I mean

326
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Is it hard to to get

327
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Tenants to rent apartment

328
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
It's crazy to imagine today of course but back then

329
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Was it hard to get people to rent

330
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
No it's saved my ass in those days

331
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Was you had Corporate America

332
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,135
Very well implanted in Midtown granted it was dangerous you wouldn't dare Park

333
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Car in the street you know

334
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
Gets broken into Sirens were always going off everywhere

335
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
So was not easy but fortunately

336
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
You had him

337
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Please

338
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,191
Young employees coming into New York City who had to live there working for these corporations

339
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
If not for that I don't think I would have stayed in business because I went door-to-door and knocked on all these corporate

340
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Personnel departments to try to get business I saw where the traffic

341
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Was coming from

342
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
And I had great

343
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Counselor

344
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Said that people to me 1 hour

345
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Another after another

346
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,671
And so I had a huge Edge over my other small competitors

347
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Because I had a steady stream of

348
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Coming at me

349
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
Yeah that was kir I don't think I could have stayed in business

350
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,143
How did you make the transition from renting from looking for renters

351
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
To selling

352
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Apartments

353
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Really quite by accident

354
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
I had gotten a referral of a young engineer from Union Carbide I don't recall his name and I lined up a hold

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,967
Bunch of stuff to show him like I usually did cuz I had learned by then in sales of

356
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Control someone's time

357
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
They can't go to anyone else I would say

358
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
I'll pick you up at the Drake Hotel

359
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Snow new name

360
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
At 9 and be aware we won't be finished till at least 5:30

361
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
Entertain going to

362
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Another broker

363
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
And then I would tell Midway to I've got everything set up for tomorrow but just control Park them in your garage and don't let the car

364
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
I had this young guy

365
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,615
And I showed him the first two apartments he said well when am I going to see the ones for sale

366
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
I said oh no these are for rent she said no I want to buy some

367
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
So I said well that's X1

368
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
So I said I was going to take him on a tour of all New Yorkers was very important for him to learn all the neighborhoods to see what he could choose for

369
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
From to see what he react

370
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
2 best

371
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
And that the next day we would show him the sale of Parma

372
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Of course I had no sales

373
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
So I got them in a taxi walking around every street showed him every every place in town and then that night

374
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Hit the Floor running

375
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,383
I dropped them off at like 5:15 as early as I could

376
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
Cold every single

377
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,063
Apartment where the owner are which was very common those days and said I have a young engineer his leg

378
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Exactly four

379
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,231
Your apartment on Sutton Place he's looking for a small tear that really had back and go but he must see it tomorrow

380
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Yes come on over and I

381
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
Book everything that night and the third apartment we saw he bought the neck

382
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
That's what got me in the sale business and when I got back

383
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
Commission check in my hand was 38

384
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
8500 switch

385
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
What's at 6:12

386
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,383
I can't do the math anymore shame on me but 6% of that

387
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
Do you know what I I got that check in my hand on closing

388
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,527
And I thought God has given me this to open up a cell

389
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Apartment I hired two sales agent

390
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
And that was the birthing of the sales business

391
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
And all the while you were still

392
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
Let me Ray is still part of this thing you still in your life

393
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
Yes Ray was still part of my life

394
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,959
Because that was within the first seven years we stayed together for 7 years

395
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Until

396
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
He married my secretary

397
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Which is really like

398
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Like so emotionally

399
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Discouraging

400
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Tell me a real up

401
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
He cheated on you

402
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
With your secretary

403
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Yes

404
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,599
She was kind of innocent they fell in love I was angry with him but of course directory

405
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
And so when I wanted to fire her

406
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,351
I said I can't come in the office every day and see your fiance they were getting married 3 months is very fast

407
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
I'm mortified I was mortified

408
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
And then he moved Tina into our combined office I had to look at them through the glass world

409
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
Just stupid thing I must been so young at heart to be so injured over some stupid

410
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,247
But here's the thing I said I have two fires and no I'm looking trolling partner

411
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,879
You can't fire her he owns half of this company and Milian 51% and

412
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,719
That's how I found out the value of that 1%

413
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
That's how it works well

414
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
Yeah but that didn't last long one year later I stopped in there finally Built My courage and told him I was sending the business

415
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
I said Ray

416
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
I'm going to end the business today in this is how it go

417
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
We're going to do it like a

418
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
14 salespeople you can pick

419
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
First I'll pick the second I got a thing

420
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
So we each got seven

421
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Like they were children in a divorce I didn't know what was happening

422
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
And we also had close to $77,000 in receivables which I remember at the time thinking half of

423
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
That would get me through month-and-a-half of overhead

424
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
And so

425
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
I had the ability

426
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
To take my half of the money and start all over

427
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
And lucky for me I went to my landlord in our existing building

428
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
We were on the 8th floor

429
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
And I asked him if I could lease another floor we had always

430
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
Pay the rent on time and he rented me the 11th floor

431
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
Of Ray which I love being above him is not weird I'm sick

432
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
I really need a shrink he started he

433
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,903
He start his own company and then you stayed there and renamed it

434
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Poke Simone

435
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
PS wife's name is Pogue and I moved up to 11

436
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
It my seven people I told my Monday would be

437
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Moving in there like

438
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Wow where we moving to I said

439
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
It's a surprise

440
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
What's a surprise

441
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Give me even

442
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
But by Monday you could open an office in the

443
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
You could buy the desk down on decrepit 42nd street and have those guys asked

444
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Possibly run the desk

445
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
You could order a phone which I did on late Friday morning and had installed on Saturday

446
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,671
And by the time they just came in I called him over the weekend gave him the new address which is

447
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
They came in that all their stuff in a neat box on top of the new desks like nothing had happened

448
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,983
Here's a question

449
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
Is it are you are you just

450
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Sort of

451
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
Hardwired

452
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Tough person means

453
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
Mostly the best men pretty

454
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
Clear off right I mean in this the guy that you're with for 7 years

455
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
I mean you think you're loving and in the meanwhile

456
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Peas

457
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Having an affair

458
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Well

459
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
Hey listen the truth be known I'm not

460
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
A tall heart person

461
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
I mean the idea

462
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
Ask any woman who's been cheated on any guy

463
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
You feel like

464
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,495
Such a fool and you burn so deeply inside now

465
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
I can barely walk

466
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
I received estimated by that

467
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
It wasn't that I

468
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
Even so much lost faith in him

469
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
I mean you're allowed

470
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
On Love stats

471
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Be real with somebody else

472
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
But it was that I fell out of love with

473
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Myself

474
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
I actually thought

475
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
My God I was nobody

476
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Before he found me

477
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,999
He got me to believe in myself he put me in business

478
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
He in love with my mentor

479
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
He's a man of the world

480
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
You know and all of a sudden

481
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
He's going off of somebody else

482
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
It was like

483
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,519
I'm nobody I never actually questioned

484
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
Whether I was capable of any

485
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
Until

486
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
He insulted me on the way out

487
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
What are you saying

488
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
He said you'll never succeed without me

489
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Which

490
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
He

491
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
He was having an affair

492
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,671
And then he'll rub salt in your wounds by saying you're never going to succeed with

493
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Yes

494
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
And you know what

495
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Janome remember we live together

496
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Almost seven years I was as busy

497
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
He may have even been wanting to motivate

498
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,495
Knowing that I'm good when I'm insulted and you know I have learned that

499
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
Was every one of my great successes building the business the ones that were Bellwether changes that I thought wow that my

500
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Make a change

501
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
There are always a result of an insult

502
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,343
Play Weird Al's like fuel to your fire says this and you are

503
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
I mean of course I see

504
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Devastated inside but you

505
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
You just think the greatest revenge's I'm going to

506
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Cruise

507
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Said he's wrong

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,143
What wasn't even a Revenge thing honestly it was like I couldn't

509
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Stan the idea that

510
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
He might see me fall

511
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Who are the opposite

512
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:04,639
And you want to know something I got to believe that was all tied into cuz it injured so deeply

513
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
And became my motivation

514
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
I have to believe that that was tied into being a dumb kid at school

515
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Was basically damning me to hell

516
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
Yeah and that's how I felt in school are we

517
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
Like I'm a loser you'll go nowhere

518
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
And so he hit my hot button

519
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Pusher

520
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
And I'm for sure

521
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
So did you

522
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
From day one when you go to the 11

523
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
In floor and

524
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Can you start your

525
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Your company

526
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
Are you thinking

527
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,616
We was he your main competitor with his company the one that you were

528
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
I moved off of

529
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
I just I was in survival mode

530
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Figuring out the math

531
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,832
Noah has six a six-week run to stay and visit in 6 weeks

532
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
How much cash you had on there because I had a bigger overhead by then you know in the beginning when my thousand dollars gave me a little bit longer

533
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Long run

534
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,584
This was just one ad per week in the New York Times three lion head

535
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Whatever it cost then

536
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Am I sublease charged

537
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
So now it was more complicated

538
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
When I move to the 11th floor

539
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
I also had 14 desk

540
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
But I only had seven age

541
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Problem

542
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
And that's a big overhead no no income

543
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
And classified ads were really expensive at that

544
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Well they always were

545
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
Going up in price

546
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,880
I said yes so they didn't go very far but you know that was the bloodline of the real estate business hours

547
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
Pretty internet if you wanted to go to leave

548
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
You put an ad in the paper

549
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Were you

550
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Freaking out

551
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Kenosha

552
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
Actually no I never freaked

553
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,888
What about pressure I never have

554
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,448
Because it is what it is

555
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
You know I can't have matter-of-factness

556
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Another word something okay give it a shot

557
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
If I'm going to fret about oh my God oh my God it's going to get again

558
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
If I get cocky and big head this is no big deal

559
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,992
I'm going to get cocky

560
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
So I just kind of okay this is what I got let's see how

561
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Hard and fast I can run

562
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
However

563
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
I did have one vision

564
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
I must admit the day I open the kor'kron

565

566
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
I remember sitting at that

567
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,632
Desk and paying extra dollar a month for a pink princess phone you pay $2 extra to rent

568
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Was pink

569
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,008

570
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312

Barbara story

609
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
She may have thought she was going to the queen of New York real estate but

610
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Who's going to be an uphill battle

611
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
She's broken up with her mom

612
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
Split everything up

613
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
She had a pink princess phone in her new office

614
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
And

615
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
Figure out how to get more attention for a company

616
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
One of the world's most

617
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Repetitive

618
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,640
I distinctly remember the day

619
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
I sat and pause and said to myself

620
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Only

621
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
We are going to be successful

622
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
What happened

623
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
I came up with the idea

624
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm taking our

625
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
11 sales for the year

626
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,304
We had 11 sales so far whatever time of the year that wasn't dividing by

627
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
11 which is good I was always good

628
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
11 * 2

629
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,448
And I came up with an average sale price and I typed in one piece of paper

630
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
And I named it after myself the Corcoran

631
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
Report and it looked lonely one number average apartment price I didn't say

632
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Corcoran group I just put

633
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Average New York City

634
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
And on the top I put the

635
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Cochran

636
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Report

637
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
And then I thought it needed something more so

638
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Empty and I put

639
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
Market I can remember some long-winded like market report of conditions and Trends in the greater New York City Market

640
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
There are some long thing to fill up

641
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
I mailed it out to everyone wrote for the New York Times

642
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,960
Everyone and I never heard from the X at all but about 2 weeks later

643
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
I open up the real estate section

644
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
Portion the main generator that an automobile sex

645
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Shuffle the New York

646
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Before the internet

647
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,736
And I opened it up and the front page

648
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Hatred New York City

649
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
Prices hit all-time low

650
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
We're in a recession

651
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
And the first lines that

652
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
According to Barbara Court

653
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
Present of the Corcoran

654
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
Holyshit

655
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Can't believe this

656
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,096
I knew my business was going to be successful

657
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,704
You just made this in this I just took your sales numbers

658
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Properties

659
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
411 Culebra is you divide that decided up and then you said

660
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:58,432
Hey this is the average price of a Manhattan I didn't really say hi where I put I put

661
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Average New York City

662
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:06,368
I'm praying since now that sounds really I could see now from where I sit that is Missy I didn't intend it that way

663
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,696
You know I did intend to trim it up with that long

664
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Conditions in Friends

665
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
But you know

666
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
It was amazing to me

667
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
That

668
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
The newspaper printed my number

669
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
Who likes your daddy

670
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Yeah but also there were no number

671
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
There was no public data of a partner

672
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,640
Are prices in it in the vacuum

673
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
I've no numbers I supplied number and they wanted to do a story on the bed mark

674
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Can I put a label on

675
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,576
I bet it was right so did you start getting

676
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Pause

677
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
From people who set up

678
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Group

679
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
We got instant credit

680
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
We called the listings on the

681
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
For sale by owner

682
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,424
And most of them had heard of us in one day

683
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:56,800
Well everybody read the time so if you aren't page if you are looking to sell your home your reading the front pages in your

684
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Real estate

685
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Without a doubt

686
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
When they didn't hear of us

687
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
My broker start

688
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Saying things like

689
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
I'm sure you've read about us

690
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Today's times last week

691
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Start that didn't take them long to use it

692
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,464
So we got listings more easily we got credibility more easily and we got more phone calls and

693
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
All

694
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Claws

695
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
We were quoted as

696
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
That's it

697
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Wow internet

698
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,912
Presumably that was the first of the carpenter part you even that didn't stop

699
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Sending that that is

700
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
I got it out every 3 months

701
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
And eventually was normal

702
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Incredible

703
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
Based on thousands of sales you could really trust them

704
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
But initially if I had been a big company

705
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
And I'd run it by attorneys wedding

706
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
Committee decisions it would have never gone

707
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,648
The beauty I had his little guys I had the freedom to run

708
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
In New York

709
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
Real estate business was it

710
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
A more welcoming

711
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
Place for a woman to

712
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
Typically a company or was it still I mean you know you hear about that

713
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:05,152
I'm in here at women were sort of in a relegated to being secretaries and diapers and things like that

714
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
Did you feel like you were

715
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,736
Respected and treated

716
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
You know what

717
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
No I never paid attention

718
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
I don't give a crap

719
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Really you know

720
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Diadora

721
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,976
How business was 90% female

722
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
Wasn't like women we're not in the real estate brokerage for you

723
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,864
But it just happened that all the firms were owned by the men

724
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Bosses world

725
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Okay so yes so they weren't

726
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,288
Female only businesses that I competed with but that was

727
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
It was not even important detail

728
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
What an important detail my mind

729
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
That I have for teenager

730
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
And the largest company in town at that point Douglas Elliman

731
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Headlight

732
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Maybe 80-90 agents

733
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
That seemed to me like

734
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
IBM itself

735
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,232
Yeah how am I going to compete with them my I was on that ball

736
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
How did you know

737
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Barbara how to

738
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Even

739
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Run the Spinners I mean I know we're talking now right

740
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Early 1980s and you've been working with re4

741
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
For few years

742
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,640
You don't have an MBA you don't have formal business background

743
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,456
Management issues how to deal with how to pay people with

744
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Pattern pricing

745
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,624
It's a I think you make it sound more sophisticated than it is

746
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
All you needed to know

747
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Is how

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
To work with people

749
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,560
And that sold the business ever is all the work I do today

750
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
It rests entirely any successor

751
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Failure rest entirely on my ability

752
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
To work with the people at hand

753
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
So learning how to recruit people

754
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,312
I learned how to recruit

755
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Because I made friends with

756
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,408
Every store clerk every waitress every

757
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:45,504
Stewardess everyone I ever met I made friends with cuz I'm very friendly

758
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
And if I saw a spark in them

759
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:53,184
Which Wich said to me sells personality I would say have you ever considered doing real estate sales I recruited

760
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Everywhere

761
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
Everywhere I went I recruited

762
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,840
And from what I understand you yourself actually didn't go out

763
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
How many minutes

764
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,472
I saw I saw the engineers first house yet

765
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
And then from Merrill Lynch I Got a referral

766
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
David Palmer

767
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Was a really big wig and I sold him

768
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Chew apartment side-by-side

769
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
On the Upper East Side and East 89th

770
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Like Condominiums

771
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,600
And that was it that was that you didn't sell any

772
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,488
Property I guess you recognize that your talent was not

773
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
In selling property but in

774
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Managing people

775
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
No I was great at renting apartments

776
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
However

777
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
I realize

778
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
Just that if I were to continue to sell because it's time-consuming to be a great sales

779
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Very Thai

780
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Time consuming

781
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
I realized that if I were to continue doing that

782
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,712
I could only go my business on the side and I just took a leap of faith

783
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
Faith especially when I sold David Palmer

784
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
2 Apartments side-by-side 4

785
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Total value of

786
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,416
Little bit more than 350,000 which today would be

787
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
Still cool enough certainly.

788
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
I was a landslide victory

789
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
I took that check I remember collecting it from the developer and 89th Street and walking it to 60th Street in my office was skip

790
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
Chipping down Madison Avenue

791
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
And seeing Georgie

792
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
To myself

793
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
I quit that Day sales

794
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
And I decided to use that money to hire

795
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Three new cells

796
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
Right there I knew I could afford it

797
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
And then I heart6 more and then 10 more

798
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,552
And then before you knew we had a thousand people I don't want to make it sound like it's overnight

799
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,880
But it was just that same methodology whenever I had spare money

800
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
I would / an overhead monthly

801
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Figure out how many bodies I could

802
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Afford like a mother paying for the kid

803
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
Kids and then I would go out her that money

804
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
That's it was a symbol for I never changed it was really very useful

805
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Let me sounds like

806
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
In the first years they was

807
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
You know

808
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
Cyber success but I mean in the short. Of time you must have hit

809
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,200
That the

810
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
37

811
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Pragmatism

812
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Huge

813
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
That was a bloodbath

814
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
For a good reason

815
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,720
When the economy crashes or even really waivers

816
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
A terrible thing happens if you're in the real estate brokerage

817
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Is this a buyers and sellers.

818
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Do nothing

819
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Nothing is terrible for brokerage

820
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
A big sellers Market is great cuz action

821
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Horrible Market is great

822
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
You'll have to sell

823
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,944
But in the beginning when nothing happens you go out of business well what happened was the great majority of my competitors win

824
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Out of business

825
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
I've been used to that is it's hard to stay in business

826
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
It's very good news in that

827
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
Is I realize

828
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
I lost half

829
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
That's a motive

830
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
What happened to you guys

831
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
Oh well

832
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
I was really on the brink

833
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,400
Declaring that it was over but I was ashamed and trying to make back the money I owed to various

834
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,240
Suppliers like my Ad Agency the New York Times

835
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
But I owed over $300,000

836
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
And there was no business coming in

837
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
It was no business know when the market stops

838
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Yeah it's a terrible terrible the end

839
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
You have to remember you have sales people many of them

840
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
Supporting the family

841
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
You have no money coming that's the worst

842
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Nevermind

843
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
The pressure on

844
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Did you have to let people go

845
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
Oh my gosh

846
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
I always let people go anyway

847
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
But it was interesting I had my mother working for me then

848
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
For two years of my life

849
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
Because all the kids are grown and should work at the 5 and 10

850
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,152
On 215th Street walking across the George Washington Bridge and she's getting older

851
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Mommy can't do that you got to come over

852
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
She was delighted

853
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
So she was a file Clerk

854
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Boy did she keep

855
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Color coded

856
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
She was a

857
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
But anyway when the shit hits the fan

858
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
Which is what my mother always

859
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
By the way I get it from her my filthy mouth

860
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
She came to me

861
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
And she knew I had

862
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
How to fire a lot of people

863
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
You can just see that everybody knew something

864
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
What kind of shake out and it was fast and she said

865
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
One she probably fire me if you

866
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
Fire me

867
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,944
She said no one else could be angry with you and you fire them and she was right I thought what

868
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,064
So at that Monday morning meeting we always had at 9:30 I said

869
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,416
You know I forgot it's no surprise how bad things are going to have to make a lot of changes

870
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
And it's going to be very hard for me to do with the hardest changeables me firing my mother

871
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
Really close to going out of business if

872
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
If you had to make

873
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Deposition

874
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Well I was going out of

875
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,944
Business I owe the 300 some 1000 but I came up with a great idea to sell

876
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
A burning mendix

877
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,368
Apartments and nobody wanted which is owned by Equitable insurance he was like a big real estate

878
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,976
That's one of the he until his death about gets 10 years ago

879
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
He was

880
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
The largest developer New York him and Larry Silverstein

881
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,656
Apartments for many years who built the World Trade Center I'm sure you know that name

882
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:56,544
Anyway he asked me to look at 88th Apartments scattered throughout the city and the number of properties and he said I want

883
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,592
Find out from you how you can sell them

884
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
I knew every broken china pendants

885
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
There was no way to sell

886
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,576
There is a dregs of the market that is someone didn't have kitchens Okat Midstream when the market

887
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Collapsed

888
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
So they were in a c-rated buildings

889
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
Everything is wrong with

890
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
Anyway I went I visit maybe 8 or 9 of the apartments

891
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Who the super is in right away

892
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
Hayward

893
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,680
They were dumps they could not be so we need a market to sell Mendes per

894
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
We had no Market

895
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,312
So anyway I went back and I told him there was no way to sell it except

896
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Public auction

897
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,688
Do you want to do a public auction you said if we can't do a public auction we don't want the publicity of

898
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
A failure

899
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
And I saw the snow with a way you can sell these

900
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,136
And I'll never forget what he said he said Barbie you're a smart girl you'll figure it out

901
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
And I went back and thought about it

902
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Right in my head

903
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Came

904
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:55,680
A memory of my mom taking like seven or eight of us however many were born then down to Toms River New Jersey watching app

905
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Puppy sale with the farmer lady

906
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Christmas tree

907
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
For my grandpa's house

908
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,104
And my mother status on the grass and watched all these fancy New York

909
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Arguing over

910
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Puppies are little Jack Russell

911
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
And anyway

912
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
My mother said to us

913
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Look at all these fancy

914
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
See people do you know why they will want those puppies

915
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:18,208
It's because Louis smart enough to invite them all here at the same time

916
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
And so that popped in my head

917
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
And I went back to Bernie mendik the next day.

918
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Enterprise

919
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
All the apartments alike

920
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Same price

921
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:33,056
Well I pray all the one bedrooms like all the Avengers are like a $10,000 difference between the category

922
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,200
But somewhere on 22nd floors with Gorgeous views somewhere on the third floor with no kitchen they was so uneven

923
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,296
Yeah first-come-first-served have a secret sale we're not going to advertise it

924
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,624
I'll announce it to my sales people only let them bring the best customers

925
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,720
But I need you to give me two years free maintenance you're not going to unload these two years anyway

926
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,608
Maintenance is like a association fees monthly maintenance

927
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,704
Erase the terrible maintenance and they had nobody thinks Beyond two years

928
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,544
And price in the mall like it's going to create hype.

929
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,360
And so he said okay give it a whirl

930
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
And I said we had a sick

931
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,552
How to myself closing the business that's how close we were exact belt unconscionable

932
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
But pressure is a wonderful thing in life isn't it makes you think

933
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,536
And so I now to my people as a but get there early and don't bring too many people just a family member if you wanted your

934
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
Single best cuss words you'll bring don't spread it around we don't have enough

935
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
To go around

936
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
And I'm telling you a ride and 80

937
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
The first tree where we had that makeshift

938
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Office that morning at 7 a.m.

939
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
And we had a line of 60 people waiting

940
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Casitas apartment

941
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
To see those apartments

942
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,224
And I'm chilling an hour and a half later more than $1000000

943
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
And I close it was a

944
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Closing

945
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
They sign the contracts

946
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,672
It was like a fire sale in bulk blue or people happy

947
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
They got the deal of the century

948
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
Yeah I bet they're really happy today but not as happy as I

949
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,352
Was that day cuz I went from being

950
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,936
New desperation of being filthy rich in real estate

951
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Chelsea rich

952
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,776
You got it I went right out and I rented myself

953
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
Full floor at 660 Madison Avenue cuz I had the cash to do it

954
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,480
It's like everything I've heard about you people say you know Barbara Has Talent wasn't

955
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
About selling homes

956
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
News about Market

957
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
She was in

958
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Credible

959
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
Marketer is that apps abs

960
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
Italy right where did you is it just an instinct

961
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,256
Is it trial and error is it is it just being

962
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
You know kind of Hustler

963
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,120
Oh no I think it has more to do with

964
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Creativity

965
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
I saw a black and white game marketing

966
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,776
It's a the softer side of things right

967
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
It involves exaggeration

968
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Involves

969
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
Acumen for seeing what a storyline is or what would capture

970
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
People's interest in

971
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
It definitely includes

972
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
PeopleSmart

973
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
And you know what I actually started

974
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368
Realizing I was best when things are bad

975
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,464
Because I would go into any bed real estate cycle in say

976
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
Say 15 position pecking order within the industry

977
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,608
And I would come out of it needs position cuz a lot of people got knocked out

978
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Yeah

979
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
You decide

980
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
I guess

981
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
I like mm

982
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Mm

983
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
To sell the car

984
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
Get out

985
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Yes

986
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,152
Why did you decide to sell me and you love the game you love that

987
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Steel energy in that

988
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
Like pressure so why did you

989
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Do things happen

990
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Open one I had my first baby at 46

991
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
I gave birth to my son Tommy

992
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
After 8 years old

993
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,976
That was nothing short of a miracle something I desperately wanted

994
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
The finally happy

995
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
Once I had that child

996
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
My heart changed

997
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:41,984
And I played out my heart everyday I was home and my grand old age nursing my son and feeling guilty about it

998
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,056
Because my kids heads at work or whisper

999
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,616
And so it took me about 4 years

1000
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
And then I'm

1001
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
Wonderful thing happened when Eve

1002
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
Astronaut were doing the Corcoran report numbers that we are

1003
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Yes Esther my business

1004
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,088
We're doing the quarter report numbers one night

1005
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Because hours

1006
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
Because we wanted to have accurate numbers or verb

1007
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
I don't know why my first

1008
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Report had nowhere

1009
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
It was just a

1010
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
By then we're very respectable and making sure over numbers were

1011
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
And we also did monthly a report of who control the market share on listings buses was

1012
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Melissa New York

1013
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
Destihl menu

1014
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,920
Multiple listing service that showed you

1015
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Who had what listings

1016
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Like if you could just go to one

1017
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
Place to see all the listings

1018
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
No

1019
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:32,160
And we broke the market into price categories in east and west side of town

1020
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Downtown

1021
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
So we had those categories

1022
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
And we would go through the listing can

1023
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Together

1024
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
And she'd say

1025
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
575 / west side

1026
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Distraught

1027
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,680
How to categorize

1028
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,752
By all the top agencies in town the top 7

1029
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
And then that night

1030
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
We did all the ad up and we could clearly see that Corcoran was numb

1031
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
We had more listings than ever

1032
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
3 category 4

1033
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,503
The highest to the lowest Uptown downtown east or west

1034
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,343
Not by a lot but a smidgen over Brian Harris Douglas Elliman

1035
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
My turn to ask Jonathan let's sell it

1036
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,767
Bigfootville also

1037
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
To be a fair

1038
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
It was the first year

1039
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
That I

1040
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
Had made over million dollars

1041
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Myself

1042
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
And I figured

1043
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
It's probably worth something

1044
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,823
You sold it for 66 million dollars

1045
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,407
Because I remember being on a ski lift

1046
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
Is my roofer brother John who still lives in Edgewater

1047
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
We are out in Utah I think I'm going up a chair lift and I get on my cell phone call from my attorney who said I've got great news

1048
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
He said I have an offer

1049
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
20

1050
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
3 million dollars are you seated

1051
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
I said turn 23

1052
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
23

1053
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,399
Million dollars old cash

1054
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
And I said

1055
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,239
Great comeback when you get 66

1056
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Cash and he said

1057
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
Y 66 million

1058
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
Because it's worth it

1059
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
And I hung up

1060
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
And I said to my brother

1061
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,783
23 million think of that John Maginot 723

1062
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
Anyssa but why'd you say 60s

1063
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,135
That's my lucky number

1064
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,023
And would you bake those at those accountants kill themselves to try to figure out why 66

1065
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
It was until the closing of

1066
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Got grease that is bad

1067
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,911
Action telling a whole bunch of hell with my lucky number

1068
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
It was I proved it

1069
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
Did you when you sold the company did you

1070
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
Did you regret it

1071
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,295
I would have to answer that honestly on some level yes

1072
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
And in

1073
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
I'm more important level

1074
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Enat

1075
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
I felt enormous sense of freedom

1076
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
Be a phenomenal mother

1077
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:47,839
And so that was exactly what I wanted and I had the enormous satisfaction

1078
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,423
Of knowing I had become the queen of New York real estate

1079
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
And financially

1080
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Loud sex life

1081
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Yes

1082
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
But I never understood

1083
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
How much I loved

1084
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
The people I worked with and how much that

1085
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Teen Mental

1086
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
It was my lifeblood

1087
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
I found them recruited them

1088
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Train them live with them

1089
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Got into Good Times bad times

1090
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
Times I had sales managers 11 of

1091
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
That I'd ordinator toward me we were such a tight

1092
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
And I felt

1093
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Happily lonely

1094
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
And I really thought I was going to get

1095
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Depression probably need a shrink

1096
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
Because I really didn't know what to do with myself

1097
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Yearn

1098
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,079
For good morning Barbie good morning Father good morning Barbara

1099
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
And all the hoopla that went with

1100
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
Was being somebody in a business it was gone so that part

1101
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Adult

1102
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Baidu

1103
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
What did I do to myself

1104
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Until of course

1105
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
I I don't want to say reinvented

1106
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Myself

1107
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
Starting all over again and trying to

1108
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
That's that's a thing right

1109
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,535
Because obviously you did

1110
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,119
Go on a Nintendo II Korea cuz I didn't most people listening to this

1111
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,495
Would know you as as one of the sharks on Shark Tank not as the head of the Corcoran group

1112
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,311
Do you wait when you're on that show DUI

1113
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
It seems like you have a bias toward

1114
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
People who

1115
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
You know who have similar background

1116
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
To come from nowhere

1117
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Money

1118
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
I'm very fine

1119
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
They have a much better shot at 6

1120
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Why

1121
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Lottery

1122
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
The Mosasaurus

1123
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
They've never had the fancy Vape

1124
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Location

1125
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
The delicious new car

1126
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
The

1127
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
The private schools the higher education of minions

1128
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
And they aspired to it

1129
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,775
So they get more satisfaction out of climbing that ladder in getting to

1130
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
End

1131
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Are they

1132
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Hasina parents struggle

1133
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,015
Through life to give them whatever they've given them the more appreciative they don't take things for granted

1134
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
And you know what else

1135
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,111
Which I should have started with it totally

1136
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
Free

1137
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
From expectation

1138
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Do you know

1139
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
How

1140
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
How lucky I was

1141
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
To never

1142
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
For a second

1143
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
Ever think I wonder what my parents think of

1144
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:04,031
All it was was just like see how far I could go and nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up to make a friend that is to take

1145
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
So they did not risk of R Civ

1146
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
And you strive

1147
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,759
So I really am biased I'm not saying that you can succeed I mean God willing I have

1148
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
I have privilege children

1149
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
And I hope they'll succeed

1150
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,135
It's much harder for me

1151
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
Not to let them feel my success even if I don't say a word

1152
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
And so they're not as free as I was you know God bless them

1153
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Thomas Hardy

1154
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Do you feel

1155
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
I mean when you were a kid you were told that you aren't smart

1156
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Do you feel now

1157
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
But you've convinced yourself that you are smart

1158
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Well yes or no

1159
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
I'm certainly Street Smart

1160
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
I'm certainly

1161
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
PeopleSmart

1162
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
I have

1163
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
Instinct

1164
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
When trouble is brewing

1165
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,063
Where's the best accountants in the world way to the wall

1166
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
Should I trust my math instinct

1167
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
I think I'm a smart person for sure

1168
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
More than that

1169
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
I think I'm going to normalcy hard-working

1170
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,607
Person and I have great Confidence from my ability to work hard through anything

1171
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
And I think I'm very good at not feeling sorry

1172
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
And I think that's

1173
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,031
How much of your of your success do you think

1174
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
Is is because of

1175
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Just

1176
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,919
Skill intelligence hard-working and how much of it is luck

1177
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,271
Well I do believe in luck I've had many

1178
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Many many lucky

1179
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,111
Brakes including meeting Ramon at the diner then

1180
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
Beginning

1181
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,975
Yeah or the very good luck of having my parents as parents

1182
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Not bad right

1183
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
Once you grow up

1184
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Are you make your own luck

1185
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Definitely Maybe

1186
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,751
I think all the lucky breaks I had were more result in me staying

1187
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
In the game

1188
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
I just believing something would break

1189
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Just hanging around

1190
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
That's more important than luck in life

1191
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,455
Being aggressive at every opportunity

1192
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,527
And standing up for yourself yes more important than

1193
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:57,695
Barbara Corcoran by the way she was

1194
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,255
Ashley rejected for her spot on Shark Tank

1195
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
They went with a younger woman

1196
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
To Barbara wrote a letter to the producer

1197
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Acid

1198
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,935

Because everything that ever happened in my life

1201
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,079
Came on the heels of failure

1202
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
The next day

1203
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
He called her

1204
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175

You built that

1223
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Update the story we had on the show last year this one starts about 10 years ago

1224
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
When are y'all Rivera was

1225
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Scrambling

1226
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
Get something together for his girlfriend's birthday gift was actually very good food chest I think

1227
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:23,199
A+ it just some random guy that I'd given her

1228
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
Arielle actually is created

1229
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,439
Who was the wrapping paper I think I had my pictures on my computer

1230
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:40,351
And I just flipped out the head really quick and I I decided to just repeater on a piece of paper with a funny background so

1231
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
So he duplicated his face

1232
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:46,495
15 times and then you photoshop them onto a backdrop

1233
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,311
Like a Cheesy yellow Starburst pattern

1234
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:55,711
Any printed the whole design onto plain paper you wrap the chocolates and then he handed the gift to his girlfriend

1235
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:02,111
Vanessa and her reaction oh my God this is hilarious what did you do

1236
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,975
It was so funny and clearly it worked because

1237
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
3 years later

1238
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
Vanessa and Ariel got married

1239
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,887
She also happens to be a graphic designer and now again

1240
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:20,287
They would do the same thing that would make wrapping paper for friends and family and put their faces on it and

1241
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,871
Just about every time we give to somebody that I start a business out of this you should

1242
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
You should make a website you should make website

1243
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
So eventually

1244
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
Ariel and Vanessa

1245
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,087
Did just that and that's first it was it was tough because we are not web design

1246
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Cena I mean now I guess we are but

1247
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
They started the website their business gif

1248
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
They soak you upload a photo

1249
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
They duplicated and print dozens of your

1250
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
Tiny little faces onto whatever image you choose

1251
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,591
We have the statue of David the Mona Lisa the cupid

1252
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:59,199
Bride and groom we have Vanessa launched a few years ago

1253
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
I got a few hundred orders at first

1254
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
And about a year-and-a-half later

1255
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,623
Oprah featured the wrapping paper in her magazine

1256
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
When you finally hitting BC

1257
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Oprah holding our paper in the I think she was in her kitchen holding up a box that's wrapped in our paper which I know that I printed for

1258
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
For her it was wild it was really wild

1259
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
Even with that boost from Oprah

1260
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
Sales have been

1261
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Modest

1262
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Since the company launched about

1263
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
3 years ago

1264
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,079
But very soon

1265
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
Vanessa and Arielle are hoping to partner with a

1266
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
Printing service

1267
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,759
That will let them move their production out of the garage

1268
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
In the meantime they both

1269
