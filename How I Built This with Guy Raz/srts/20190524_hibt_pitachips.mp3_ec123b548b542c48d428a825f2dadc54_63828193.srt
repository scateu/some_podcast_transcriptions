67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Place where most of us are

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Probably thinking

69
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
I couldn't do that

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Squarespace

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
If you heard that episode

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
You remember that Anthony casalena was and

73
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
Use a gifted computer program

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824

And sold them

00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
But then there are the stories were most of us

79
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Chile imagine doing that thing ourselves

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
Like Brian scudamore

81
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744

00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Lisa Price

Tinkered with homemade lotions in our kitchen

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
She went on to sell her brand Carol's Daughter

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
L'Oreal

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336

89
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Stories

00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Anyone can relate to

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
Because it is such a simple

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Elegant

93
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Idea

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Take pita bread

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296

Today is a 6

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Six billion dollar juggernaut

103
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
BC medicine did not have a grand master plan 2

104
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,239
Disrupt snack foods in the late 1990s

105
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519

00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,639
Cheater boyfriend rule literally selling pita wrap sandwiches from a sandwich cart

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Downtown Boston

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
The pita chips were an afterthought

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
A way to use up those extra

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Peter's at the end of the day

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,391
Pita chips were never supposed to make Stacy rich

112
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Eventually

113
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
Frito-Lay would come knocking with a fist

114
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Full of dollars

115
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,119
Long before that long before Stacy even sold her first sandwich

116
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
She was on an entirely different path

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Grew up in the suburbs near Boston

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
After college

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Stacy went out to California to get a master

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
In social work

121
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
She thought about becoming us

122
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Psychologist

123
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Your dad

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
He wasn't so enthusiastic about

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
He thought I should always

126
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
Become a social worker

127
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Rather than go on

128
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
How to get my pH

129
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Sambia psychologist

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
He was like oh that's no profession for a woman

131
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
That's

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,607
One thing that he said was smile and look pretty and you will find a

133
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
You know I don't want to make him sound like a

134
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
Jerk

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
Caring loving man that put his family

136
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
First

137
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,407
But he was also a product of the fifth

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Sure

139
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
So once you get your master's degree

140
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
You actually

141
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Move to Washington DC to

142
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
To do what

143
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Social work

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Yes

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
I worked

146
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
In a group home for

147
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Homeless

148
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Pregnant drug-addicted

149
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Women

150
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
And

151
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
I have to tell you I mean I loved the job it was very

152
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Rewarding

153
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
But at the time I think I made

154
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
$22,000 a year

155
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
And

156
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
It was really

157
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
Paycheck-to-paycheck and very hard to survive on

158
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
That kind of

159
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
An income

160
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
So I decided to go and get license

161
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
And

162
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
Be able to private

163
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
Which eventually I did go on to do

164
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
But I found it very isolating

165
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Now I've got a

166
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Go and I

167
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Unlock the door and

168
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
And I do

169
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
Marriage counseling in

170
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Send my

171
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
Evening is overripe

172
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Being five or six patients and

173
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
I closed the door behind me and I go home and

174
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,687
I put a lot of effort into getting those degrees and licenses and

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,271
Realize that It ultimately it probably just was not

176
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
For me

177
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,207
I guess roughly 30 years old at this time at and by the way you were engaged

178
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
22 Gannon Rec right

179
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
No

180
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
That ended

181
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Images

182
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Mutual

183
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
I think ultimately it was just

184
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Not the right thing I think wechat

185
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Agreed

186
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
We had had the

187
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,871
Place picked out that we were going to get married

188
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
And it was kind of a bizarre story but

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
I went and I had a massage

190
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
I know sounds like I'm going off on a tangent here but it'll come back I had a massage

191
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
And the woman told me

192
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,303
To take off all my jewelry and Bubba Bubba Bubba they took it off I put it in the dish

193
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
Got my massage and I got up and I went to get dressed and I was like oh my God all my jewelry is

194
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Is gone

195
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Including my ring

196
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
My engagement ring and I was just

197
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,175
You know it was from his family it was like I was just so upset

198
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
And

199
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
The girl was gone she had

200
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
Like never to return I think she took off to Florida or somewhere she never came back to work she just kind of took off

201
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
All my stuff but

202
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
With Rick and I it was kind of like the ring wasn't replaced immediately even and I don't

203
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Don't care about the ring

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
Even if it's just a cigar brand or something like that but it kind of took so long replacing the ring

205
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
That it's for both of us to look at should we really be doing this maybe this was a sign or

206
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
Or something and ultimately yeah we just decided

207
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Maybe we shouldn't get married

208
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
So you so you guys split up

209
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
Xiamen time

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,327
There was this guy Mark Andres who you had met through your brother a few years before he was a friend

211
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,679
Did you guys start dating or would you just kind of

212
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
So he was

213
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,775
Still a friend and I talk to him all the

214
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
The time about

215
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,615
My disengagement and all of that

216
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
He was super supportive and eventually

217
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,991
Our friendship led to dating

218
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
And

219
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
He was

220
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,879
Getting his PhD so he was doing an internship in Hawaii

221
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
And

222
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
Fayetteville lunch come out to Hawaii

223
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
And what did you do in Hawaii

224
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
So

225
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
Hawaii was an amazing experience

226
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
We lived in

227
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Just this tiny box

228
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
And there was no kitchen or anything and they've been there was no bedroom it was basically a cot

229
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
And we bought an electric Wok

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
And we used to

231
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Cook

232
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,039
In the walkways wash it in the bathtub and

233
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,671
Eventually we found a roommate and she had a nicer apartment and we worked out a deal where

234
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
We would

235
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Take her second

236
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Bedroom and

237
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
In exchange

238
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,375
For a lower rent we would cook for her

239
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
End

240
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Well I was out there I worked at a restaurant

241
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
And I got a job at it as an assistant manager and the restaurant was going to open up a surf

242
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Theme

243
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
I need another location of surf team

244
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Restaurant and

245
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
They said you want to be part of that opening and I said yeah that's great

246
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Which

247
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Thinking back I'm like wow that was

248
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
Great experience I got the kind of experience

249
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Learning Center

250
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Start a business

251
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Yeah

252
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
We

253
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
Had this big opening with

254
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
Are all the Surfers the local Surfers in Hawaii and

255
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
Even Retired Surfers they came in the owners of the restaurant were like if we could pull this off you know you guys are going to

256
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
And get a big bonus and Bubba

257
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,551
And we did I mean we were money was coming in left and right

258
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
The point that we have to stop it and beer boxes and

259
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Bring the cash down to the two

260
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
The basement

261
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Because they couldn't fit it all in the register

262
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
It was just crazy so

263
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
Successful opening of the restaurant

264
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Couple weeks later I sat down with my

265
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
General manager and said

266
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
How about

267
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
The bonuses they were talking about you know my name

268
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Coming in

269
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
And he's like let me meet with the owners and

270
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Get back to you

271
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Wait another couple of weeks

272
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Sat down with them again

273
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
And he said well I spoke to the owners

274
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
And they've decided that we need to let you go

275
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
And

276
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Wow I was

277
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
I never

278
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Lost a job

279
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
In my life

280
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
And then I remember speaking to my aunt who was in the restaurant business

281
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,823
Since you saying are you kidding me don't be so naive they always hire people to get restaurants open and then they let him go

282
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
Ultimately I circled back and said well if I can work this hard

283
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
For someone else

284
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
Then why can't I do it for

285
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Myself

286
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
End

287
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
It's a kind of funny because

288
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
At that point

289
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
Mark was still in his internship and

290
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
We were in these high-rise buildings in

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
Downtown Honolulu and

292
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
We were cooking meals

293
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
4

294
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Our roommate anyway

295
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,543
We figured why not just put a sign in the bottom of the building

296
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
When people got home they could

297
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
It was at the time of fax machine

298
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
They could fax over and over

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
And we would just have their dinner ready

300
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
What you would

301
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Yuan Mark

302
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
Is Mike was a trained psychologist writing that that's what his work was

303
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
You guys were also just like pretty good

304
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Home cook

305
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
Yeah we loved cooking I mean

306
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Mark was a total Foodie in

307
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
We marketed

308
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
To our building in the surrounding buildings

309
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
That if

310
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Anybody else wanted us to cook them dinner that

311
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
We would do that to me call deconda cuisine

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,967
And what are you offering like was it just like in tonight's dinner is or you could order from a menu

313
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,831
It's just more of a you know you had a choice between

314
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Two or three items

315
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Your we had seared tuna with

316
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Pineapple salsa

317
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Things like that

318
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Needless

319
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
To say we're cooking in our apartment

320
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
Got very quickly shut down

321
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
Like some guy you don't call or knock on the door I was like

322
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
You can't do this

323
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
Cathay pacific Health Department

324
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
It's like you don't have a license

325
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
That didn't last long. That was like yeah yeah

326
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,831
Are not doing this if you want to do this you have to get into a commercial kitchen and you have to write

327
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Etcetera etcetera

328
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
So that dream that dream died

329
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
And how how long by the way did it last

330
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Before you were shut down

331
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
A couple months 3 or 4 months

332
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Man that clearly like that experience kind of

333
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
Set into motion this idea that it maybe we could

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
Duke some kind of business

335
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Yes

336
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Definitely

337
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
And it kind of

338
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
Pick me back up onto my feet after

339
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Losing that other job

340
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
End

341
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Mark even though he's

342
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Getting his Doctorate at this point

343
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
He always wanted to be a chef

344
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,743
He came from a family of doctors and it was kind of just that's what you're going to be but it

345
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
It also meant that he

346
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Was

347
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Setting aside his dream of becoming

348
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
So

349
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
It was a really

350
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Crazy decision but we decided when we got back

351
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
To Massachusetts

352
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
We would try something

353
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
In the food business

354
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Wow it's okay Mark

355
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
Has a PHD in Clinical Psychology

356
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
You are a social worker by training

357
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
You always knew that you were going to go back to boss

358
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Both of you guys

359
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Or I guess

360
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
From

361
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Yeah New England

362
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
And

363
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,887
He was going to become a psychologist but I guess your plan was hey before you do that let's just Contest out

364
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
This food business idea for short

365
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,799
Going into this and then you got a call so keep in mind

366
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
The reality of the fact that

367
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
He's got $100,000 in student loans

368
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
I don't have a penny to my name

369
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
Remove back to Boston 1996

370
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
What did you guys decide to do

371
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
So

372
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
We decided to buy a food cart

373
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Cuz we couldn't afford

374
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Anything else

375
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
I think it was

376
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
$5,000

377
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
And

378
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,191
I worked with my sister who she owned a catering company in downtown Boston

379
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
She was a huge help and

380
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,847
Yeah I laid out the menu and and she would look at the menu and tell me you know

381
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,687
You have too many items on here are you have too big of an inventory you have to

382
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Streamline this to have it like she kind of

383
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Always

384
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Gave us that

385
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
Reality check on on what when that business

386
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Sense

387
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
And at the same time

388
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
As because now we learned you have to be in

389
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Facility

390
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
All of our menu we prep

391
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
And made out of

392
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Her

393
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Catering

394
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Place in Boston

395
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
So what kind of food were you

396
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
Make it I mean this is like I'm acting like a hot dog push cart with like

397
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
You know a water bin that's

398
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
Hot and warm and like

399
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Another band that keep buns

400
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
Like steaming hot was that with a food cart look like oh my God

401
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
The food cart yes was a

402
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
A cart with

403
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
That was a hot dog cart

404
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
And we used to go out at night

405
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
After the bars close

406
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
And we did the sausage scene

407
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,167
Cooking up and we were just trying to get money

408
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Any way that we could

409
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
So that we could revamp

410
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
The cart

411
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
And once we collected enough money

412
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Then we put the cart in

413
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
To a shop and

414
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
You know I designed it you know made it pretty Frontenac

415
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
Beautiful green awning

416
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,159
And we hallowed the whole thing out and made it almost into a deli counter

417
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,023
And we served healthy sandwiches rolled in pita bread off of

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
The food cart

419
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
And then we made everything to order

420
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,887
So these were like I mean

421
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Rap

422
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Kind of became a big saying in the

423
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
2000's the late 90s

424
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,103
And remember this like pita pita bread sandwiches started said just like pop up all over the place

425
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,943
Yeah but just to clarify that it was basically a

426
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
Chicken Caesar

427
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
Roles in a piece of pita bread

428
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
They were very few options

429
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
But we made

430
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
Worm yet we had goat cheese

431
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
We had

432
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
Turkey and havarti and we had

433
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
More

434
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Upscale

435
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Choices

436
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,239
So we prepared we sliced all the meat we put everything in a giant cooler

437
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
And then we went to downtown Boston

438
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
We were literally roll the cart up the

439
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
The street

440
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,967
And put it on the corner of Chauncey and Summer Street

441
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
And

442
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
We getting ice delivery to the corner

443
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
And we throw the ice in the bottom and then we put out all of

444
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
The ingredients

445
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,999
And then we roll it up in the pita bread and then we had this big white

446
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Piece of paper

447
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
And we've all the sandwich in the white piece of paper and we twist the bottom so people were walking around with almonds

448
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
Like they had this big white club and and so it was really good cuz they've walked away and other people that they knew that looks good what you get

449
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
And what was the name of the

450
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
Did you have a name for the pushcart

451
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Daisy's Delights

452
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
Stacy's Delights that it apostrophe l i t e f e l i t e s

453
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
What did Elie

454
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Flight status

455
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
90s I love that

456
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,583
How did the dude was it a hit did you guys get custom like lots of customers right away

457
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Yes it was a hit

458
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,239
But we were not the only food cart down there you have to remember that you know up

459
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,103
Don't go 50 yards away is the pretzel cart and then there's the burrito guy in the

460
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
You know so

461
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
Was that a time when in the food cart

462
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
World I mean now food card is more HIPAA

463
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Trendy and there's a food truck inviting it's more of a food

464
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,439
Truck but at the time of food cart had the connotation of dirtying

465
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
Stop saying yeah but the way that the cart was designed and that it was presented and that it looked and we had fresh tomatoes

466
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
Mountain of them out front and it was

467
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
It broke the

468
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
Traditional mold of what is a food card

469
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Yeah yeah everyday we ordered fresh bread

470
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Where would you get the bread from

471
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
Just a local bakery

472
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
End

473
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
It was always over order the bread because

474
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
You can run out of alfalfa sprouts you can run out at 2

475
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Tomatoes

476
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,671
And it's not going to be a big deal but in this business if you run out of bread

477
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Your clothes

478
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,559
Yeah so I guess you were just going to you you've all this extra bread and you thinking

479
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
What do we do with this extra bread

480
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,959
And we didn't want to use it the second day because it's not as

481
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,615
Viable to roll the pita sandwiches so when we got back to the kitchen we would cut them up

482
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
And bake them into different flavor chips

483
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
And the idea was that you would

484
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,087
You would do what with a pita chips you would give them away you would sell them like what initially what we going to do with them

485
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
So initially it was just a way

486
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
2

487
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Retain our customer base

488
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,351
And to keep people happy as they were waiting in line cuz it was a long wait you had every pita sandwich made to order

489
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Yes and people would

490
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Yeah we hired a college student

491
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
She was a cashier but in between should go up and down with a basket of pita chips and just give them for free

492
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,359
People standing in line while they waited and pee

493
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
Loved it because it was kind of like a happy hour

494
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
And

495
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
Your we gave them away for free but people started saying that they did want to buy them

496
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
So initially we would just put some in a little baggie with a gold ribbon and and keep a basket of them out on the food

497
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
As well and you could buy it for like

498
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Fifty cents are in a dollar

499
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Tara buck

500
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
And just just out of curiosity like

501
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
Did you guys experiment with a baking gazyva

502
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Pita bread contain like

503
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
Burn pretty quickly

504
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Write like

505
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
I have to assume that you had to

506
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
Experiment would like the right temperature and

507
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
The right flavors and stuff like that

508
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
That came

509
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Later

510
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
Initially we just bake the cinnamon sugar in the parmesan garlic

511
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Everybody thinks Simply Naked with our first flavor

512
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
It wasn't

513
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
It was

514
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
B

515
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
Parmesan and

516
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
The cinnamon sugar

517
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
We were baking them in a four rack oven

518
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
I mean literally for maybe eight

519
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Tres res

520
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
Is a tract of enso

521
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
We could

522
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
Spread out the pita chips on a tray we could bake eight of them at a time

523
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
You know you

524
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Really we were making toast

525
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,783
Yeah you were making thin slices of toast

526
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Really good toast

527
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
And it wasn't until later as the company started

528
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Growing

529
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
That

530
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
There was a huge jump

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Between

532
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm going to make toast in my oven

533
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
And I'm going to

534
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
Sleeping in mind I mean Mark suffering is loans and his lungs

535
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Yeah he's not at this point he's like

536
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
Full on

537
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
In the food business and you are too he's not using his PhD in Clinical Psychology

538
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,112
Clinical social worker he's got his PhD in Psychology

539
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
And we're on a street corner selling sandwich

540
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
And so at that point

541
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah we are

542
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
All In

543
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
We are going to do something

544
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
We could not

545
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
Put our tail between our legs and go

546
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Running home

547
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
When we come back

548
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,896
Has Stacey and Mark make a full pivot to pita chips

549
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
And shake off the warnings of an industry expert

550
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
Who says they will never grow their business

551
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064

Hey welcome back to how I built

605
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Best from NPR

606
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
And Stacy and Mark have

607
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,032
Side hustle out of a side Hustle

608
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,640
Selling pita chips from the little sandwich card they started in Boston

609
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,016
The chips are doing so well that they decide to make more of them

610
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
But they're using an oven that can only make a tracks of them

611
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
At a time

612
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
But then

613
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
They find a way

614
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Bastilla

615
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,816
We met a very nice woman when we were doing the food cart Who Sold pretzels

616
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
It was Boston pretzel Bakery

617
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
And

618
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,728
She said oh I have a 40 rack oven

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
Why don't you come try to make them over there

620
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
So we went over to Boston pretzel

621
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
And we mixed up are the pita chips and we were able to make a rack of 40 of them at a time

622
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm instead of instead of eight trays we can make 40 trays

623
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
She had backup rack

624
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,488
Sowell 40 we're in the oven we could load up another 40 trays

625
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
40 came out in 40 went in and

626
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
We're like okay well this is this kind of makes

627
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
More sense

628
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
What I'm trying to say is look at what

629
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Point running this car

630
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Did yuan Mark say

631
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Actually

632
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,360
The business we really should focus on is the pita chips

633
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
And not the pita sandwiches

634
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
So I think

635
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,296
The coming about of that whole thing was the struggle of getting in

636
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
Inside location

637
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
And

638
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
Come winter it's really rough

639
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Being out there in the cold

640
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Yeah and we

641
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,096
Started working with a realtor and the realtor qunar lasted us and said

642
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
If you want a tiny little indoor

643
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
Location near where you are X want to keep our following of people

644
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
You and your food cart can stand online behind

645
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
Oban pan Dunkin Donuts

646
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,016
At the time Starbucks was coming into the world you know everybody wants his little spaces

647
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
We realize we had to make a

648
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
And we decided to go for the

649
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
The pita chips

650
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Because

651
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,560
In the winter I was working on the pita chips and and the bag and

652
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
The design and the lights

653
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,424
I'm saying and all that I needed to do in order to get that off the ground

654
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
So with the pita chips

655
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,056
We could get bigger faster

656
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,944
Yeah and I took a bag and we had put them in almost like a coffee bag

657
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Like one little window

658
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
Oh yeah plus

659
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
LaPlace

660
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Check bag inside of the paper bag

661
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880
A lot of Labor went into it but you know what

662
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
I took the bag and I

663
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,512
I walked into bread and circus and downtown Boston and I said

664
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
Hi I'm Stacy

665
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,680
These are my chips and I'd love for you to give him a try you just walked into a

666
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Bread & circus

667
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
Stop at Whole Foods and you asked to ask for the manager

668
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
Yeah okay and what did the manager say

669
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
He's a good

670
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
Yeah. Forget them and

671
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
Now we have one store

672
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,368
There was like 6 or 8 of these bread and circus

673
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
Stores and he showed them to corporate there was nothing in them they were all natural

674
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
It was the time of the beginning of the natural food Revolution and that's just what we were

675
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Innately doing

676
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
And obviously you guys

677
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
Personal you chose the name Stacy

678
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,152
Pita chips just cuz that's what it was called Stacy's Delight when you are food car

679
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
We chose it because we thought that

680
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Female name on

681
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Snack food brand with

682
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Sell more than a male name

683
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah the woman in the kitchen kind of things I hate to say it

684
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
That's really

685
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,560
That was the thought behind it was that it sounded better than Denmark

686
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,632
Let's just pause for a moment and talk about

687
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Money because

688
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,728
Even though you are getting some stores

689
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Willing to pay

690
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Pick up the chips and

691
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
To sell them

692
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
I can't imagine your business could

693
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Operated

694
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Tyler Lyon like

695
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
The sale of pita chips how did you have

696
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Money tok to run this thing

697
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
Yeah I mean we had

698
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
A lot of

699
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
That

700
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,208
Between the two of us

701
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
We ran up our credit cards

702
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
We applied

703
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
For it so I was I started working with the neighborhood Development Center and they help me write a busy

704
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Display on

705
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,568
There was a really networked with everybody I

706
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
I can possibly

707
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Draw information

708
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
Nation from the neighborhood

709
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Send her there was

710
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
I think

711
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Jewish vocational services

712
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,392
Was in downtown Boston and there was this one girl that used to eat at the cart and she

713
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
She said to me

714
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
How do you know if you have enough bread

715
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Add

716
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
She asked for these weird

717
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Questions

718
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,888
And then one day I said why you asking me these weird questions

719
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,960
She said why teach a business plan boot camp

720
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
And

721
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
I use your cart is an example all the time

722
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
Wow

723
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
I said really I might

724
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Can I take that class

725
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
She's like yeah you want to take you come on over

726
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
And I went and I took an 8-week business

727
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
Plan boot camp

728
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,696
So between all of these agencies that I kind of worked with cuz remember I didn't have a business

729
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
The grey I didn't know

730
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
I didn't know what a business plan was

731
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
Yeah so after that 8 weeks

732
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
I realized that I didn't just need $25,000 for the packaging machine but I also needed

733
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
$20,000 to buy bags

734
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Yeah the run on the machine

735
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,224
And then I needed $20,000 for this thing that people kept calling working capital

736
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
So that was all new to me

737
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
So I swear I thought I only needed 25

738
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
$1,000 with 60

739
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
I needed 60 yeah right

740
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
How did you get $60,000

741
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
So the neighborhood Development Center in Jamaica Plain help me

742
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,656
Spruce up my business plan a little bit and

743
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Put me in touch with a bank that they used

744
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
That

745
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Worked with the SBA

746
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
So we had to put down

747
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,432
20% of the 60,000

748
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
And that's where our family

749
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Kicked in

750
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
You need to prep 12 thousand bucks

751
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Collateral base

752
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
Oh yeah

753
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,208
And that was a $60,000 loan from a small business administration back

754
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Bank in Boston

755
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
She got $60,000

756
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Which gave you how much

757
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Runway how long could you

758
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Could you

759
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,728
Function of $60,000 cuz you see you're talking about

760
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
Need to buy a machine to seal the bags

761
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,848
To buy the bags and then you're not left of the whole lot

762
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
$60,000

763
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,992
It was not going to go very far because yes we bought the machine we bought the bags

764
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,320
But the one thing that we did have

765
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
We had customer

766
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
Both the consumer

767
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
And the retailers that loved our chaps

768
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
And kept reordering

769
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
And when I got that sack

770
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
$60,000 loan

771
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
Within six months

772
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
I went back and asked them for 500

773
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Wow

774
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
And they and they said

775
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,824
Here you're sure here's 500000

776
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
No

777
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
No they said no

778
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,968
Well they didn't say no they said no

779
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Not without equi

780
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
And we were like equity

781
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
Equity in what we've got nothing

782
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
Yeah at this point

783
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
So they said no to 500

784
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Over a couple of months

785
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
We were able to scale it back and they did say yes to 350

786
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Wow

787
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
So you got a

788
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
$350,000 loan

789
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
From the bank

790
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
Yeah but how did you get the word out

791
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
About the pita chips I get it that you were

792
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,224
Your cat pounding the pavement and you were

793
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Asking for managers

794
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
At at at local

795
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
You know

796
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Markets in asking

797
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
Talk with them

798
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
How did people find out about the chips

799
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,816
Entirely word-of-mouth amenaces pre-internet priest social media pre and he didn't have a dollars

800
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,632
We would go everywhere we could

801
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
Two sample

802
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
So we would go into the store and we would set up a table and we would just give away chips for free just like

803
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,152
We did on the cart and people would try them and they would buy them and that

804
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
That's how we built our customer base

805
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
We had three words

806
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
Simple simple simple

807
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
Did you at this point have a vision

808
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
Or how big this could be were you and Mark saying

809
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,536
Cuz I have to assume you were still doing a lot of the legwork you were still maybe even baking

810
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
The chips and maybe hiring people to help you but

811
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
Did you think this is going to be huge just going to be a national brand or was it was that your ambition at this point or not quite

812
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
Know our goal was to be

813
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
Original brand more like

814
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,200
Cape Cod potato chips and we were

815
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,784
We were going to keep things manageable and in the Northeast

816
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,648
But what happened was with the growth of the natural food into

817
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
History

818
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
There were these

819
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Pockets like

820
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Colorado

821
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
And

822
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Atlanta

823
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
In California and then we don't belittle

824
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Pocket square

825
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
The Natural Food business was really

826
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Booming

827
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
And the whole

828
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,152
Creation of Whole Foods and and then buying up all of these smaller stores we were in all those smaller

829
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Stores

830
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:58,272
So we were in the bread and circus and Wild Harvest and then they all became

831
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
Whole Foods witch

832
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Grew tremendously so are

833
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Initial

834
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
Plan to be a

835
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Small Regional

836
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Brand

837
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,096
We had to rethink that and I think that's

838
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,680
One of the things that Mark and I were really good at was

839
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Not being

840
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
So locked in

841
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
2

842
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
A straight

843
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Half

844
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
That

845
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,920
We were able to see when other Opera

846
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Opportunities came along

847
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
So for example the pita chips over

848
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Food cart or

849
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
You know rather than selling a small Gourmet

850
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Food stores

851
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
We're going to go into the natural

852
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Food you know we're like what we could sell to these

853
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
10 stores or this one chain has a hundred

854
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,960
But that the business was still you and Mark right it was you were the only permanent employees at the

855
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
The point

856
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
So

857
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,128
It was Mark and I for the first two years and then my brother who at this point

858
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Had his

859
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
PhD also

860
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
And we said

861
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
Into him

862
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
You want to sell some chips

863
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,416
You know and hahaha we were all joking around about it and then

864
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
He came back like couple weeks later and said

865
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
You know what

866
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
If I don't try this

867
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Now

868
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
He's married they don't have kids

869
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,960
If I don't try this now when am I going to try it again he's like

870
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
Sure

871
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,080
Does his wife she was an accountant she had a steady income

872
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
So

873
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,432
He said you can just pay me minimum wage and then

874
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,992
We'll give it a try and after the first of the year

875
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
You can just kind of start

876
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Paying me back as we start

877
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Generating a little bit of money

878
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
And that's what really really important

879
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
Is that in the beginning we

880
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Surrounded ourselves with

881
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Two psychologists

882
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Can a social worker

883
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,752
Running a pita chip business right like how implausible

884
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:00,896
Is that like what like nobody would say I want to start my business I need to psychologist and a social worker

885
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
But somehow like

886
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
You're you guys have brought the skill sets

887
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
To this

888
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
To this day

889
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,648
I was street smart and those guys were both street smart and book smart

890
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,000
And said we all work together on trying to figure out how we're going to do this

891
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
And I'll tell you that one point

892
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
We had

893
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Paid $1,500

894
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,728
And we flew a consultant up from Frito

895
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
That he was a retired

896
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Frito

897
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Guy

898
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
And

899
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
Heat Washington

900
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
How we were running things

901
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
And he was just like

902
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
These are very good and they taste good

903
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
But

904
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
This cannot be

905
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
This is a home-baked

906
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Type

907
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Product

908
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,024
And it's fine but you won't be able to scale this big

909
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
Wait why did he say that was

910
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,144
Would you literally like hand cutting the pita

911
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
Pita bread

912
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
Mark's right bicep

913
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Was like

914
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
Three times the size of his left

915
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
Because he was literally using a knife

916
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
So when

917
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
This guy walked in and he saw you know

918
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Marcotte hand cutting bread and

919
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
We're handbagging everything and

920
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Each

921
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,184
Batch took a certain amount of time and then we have to like

922
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
Scrape off the trays and clean everything in

923
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
He was just like

924
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
Yeah you'll never be able to

925
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Bring this

926
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Product to

927
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
Market on any kind of scale

928
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
So for us that was

929
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
A really hard blow

930
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
I bet but

931
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,592
We

932
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Also still found it

933
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Hard

934
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
To believe

935
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Like

936
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
If we can take 40 racks

937
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
40 trays of pita chips

938
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
And we can make that

939
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Why can't we just

940
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
Line up a whole bunch of these ovens

941
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
And

942
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
Be able to make

943
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,024
So many rats at a time

944
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,608
And then with that led to was us realizing

945
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,656
We needed a conveyorized

946
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,728
Oven you needed a conveyor belt oven where you could do

947
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,568
Throw the pizza on there and it would just go to the conveyor belt and then

948
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
Come out the end in j

949
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
52a just a big barrel the pita chips are made

950
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Yeah and the endgame we ended up having

951
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
To purchase a

952
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Custom built

953
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Oven

954
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,952
Is the size of a 52-foot like an 18-wheeler truck wow

955
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,328
But you are still at me nor Mark was still hand slicing the pita into the right shape

956
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,168
You can't scale that like one or two or ten people can't do that

957
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
So how did you solve

958
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
That problem

959
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,640
You're right on target here we broke it down into each stage of making a pita

960
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
And

961
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
That

962
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,528
Piece of it what we did was we would go and we would tour other Factory

963
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
So we went down to Cape Cod potato chips and we went on that tour that everybody in Cape Cod goes on that tour

964
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
When is Taurus

965
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,304
We went as far as we look through that window and we saw

966
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
They were

967
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Cutting potatoes

968
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
With this machine and we asked him well

969
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
How does that machine

970
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Cut the potatoes

971
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
And

972
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
They gave us the name of the machine and then we went out and we contacted

973
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
That company

974
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
NSAID

975
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,272
This is what we're trying to do and we had this guy who worked for us

976
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Who

977
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Continue her with anything

978
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,720
And so what we ended up buying was a machine that used to cut carrots

979
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Campbell Soup

980
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
So you know how they cut those

981
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Tiny little

982
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
Square shirt

983
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Well

984
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
What he did

985
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,472
Is he took those blades

986
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
And space them further apart

987
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
And when he first

988
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
Face these blades and all of us are kind of gathered around the opposite end of the machine holding up bucket where the

989
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,064
These are tempted chips are going to come out until he feeds the bread into the machine he starts

990
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,624
Tossing you know a piece of bread a piece of bread

991
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
And we're standing out at the other

992
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
And we're like

993
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
Holy

994
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
BHS it's a chip but you know

995
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
The very last day that marks

996
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
Spread

997
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,240
You must eventually got married right to your business partners and then you got

998
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Mary cuz you were together right

999
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
Yes we have been together for a long time

1000
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
And eventually we just

1001
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Got married

1002
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,480
I in in 97

1003
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
And

1004
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Always good

1005
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
All right 1999

1006
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
You get your

1007
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
Production method down get the machines you need

1008
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
The revenues growing

1009
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,376
I have to imagine that there are big chip companies looking at you guys even though you're this

1010
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,704
Tiny little new england-based pita chip company and thinking

1011
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,544
Pita chips that's the new craze let's make pita chips and crushed

1012
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
These guys

1013
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:50,688
Not really because so at this point in time in the company as we just started to grow

1014
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
It was also during the time of the

1015
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
No carb face

1016
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
It was a close

1017
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,136
No carb low carb diet

1018
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Oh yeah

1019
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,696
And we were like here we are

1020
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Once again we're making toast

1021
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
And

1022
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,792
We thought oh my God

1023
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
That's going to put us out of business like all these silent all these things along the way you think I'm I got this

1024
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,704
Put us out of business oh my God that's going to put us out of business but

1025
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Ultimately people love

1026
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Chips

1027
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
It was something people

1028
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
Ate all the time and it was becoming a staple in

1029
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Their cabinet

1030
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
It wasn't just a one-time purchase

1031
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
Alright so you guys are

1032
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
Can operating under the radar but growing

1033
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Steadily

1034
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,768
Give me the first year you actually turned a profit like a significant profit was it

1035
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,584
Was it in 1999 or in 2000

1036
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,424
People say it takes three years I would say it take

1037
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
5

1038
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
So it took some time

1039
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,568
Yeah but I guess you guys hit a million dollars and Revenue

1040
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Iran 2001

1041
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,455
Which sounds super impressive did that mean that you guys were

1042
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
All making lots of money

1043
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
No

1044
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
We really paid our self very little and if anything really weren't making anything cuz everything went back into

1045
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:10,303
Do you know if we needed another oven well you know you don't buy this you don't die that you don't do this because

1046
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
You need another oven

1047
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Yeah

1048
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Do you guys

1049
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
You starting to become

1050
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
Horse stable in the production process

1051
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Five years after the two of you get married

1052
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Umic divorce

1053
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
You decide

1054
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
To get a divorce that year

1055
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Yeah

1056
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
But then you stay honest is 50

1057
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,927
T50 business partners at this is normally how the story unfolding normally

1058
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
This is a very messy and traumatic and difficult

1059
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
Doesn't sound like

1060
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Yeah

1061
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Like I'm not going to say we didn't argue

1062
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
I mean certainly we argue

1063
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,519
Over a lot of things mean there's a lot of tension

1064
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
And

1065
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
The employees had to put up with us like

1066
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
Baba baba baba

1067
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Leave the room and

1068
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,623
And then eventually everybody would come back to their test command

1069
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
And that's okay

1070
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
But

1071
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
We had a common

1072
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Gall

1073
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
And

1074
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
I would have to say I think

1075
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
He probably agree

1076
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,471
That during the time that we were married for the most part it was a

1077
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
Successful marriage but we also had a successful divorce

1078
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
It was clean and it was clear

1079
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
And

1080
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,991
We shared the company like it was our child

1081
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
And

1082
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
Everything that we did was in the best interest of the company

1083
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
So we went to court

1084
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Gather

1085
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,487
And we went before the judge and we said we want to get a divorce and

1086
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,071
We're splitting this 50/50 and we really had no assets

1087
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
Yeah everything we had

1088
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,447
Was the company and we agreed we built this together

1089
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
And we were splitting the

1090
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,311
And we were both going to stay on and the judge was like wow this was

1091
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,175
It is

1092
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
I think it's surprising at least for me I think

1093
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Play for a lot of people

1094
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Listening

1095
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Because

1096
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
It seems to me that it takes eight

1097
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
Remarkably like

1098
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
Clear headed people

1099
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,487
To come to this agreement to say

1100
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
Hey you know like we're not going to be romantic

1101
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Partners anymore but

1102
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
We're really good business partner

1103
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
And we got the script thing going

1104
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,983
And let's keep it going that when I when I hear that I'm thinking of

1105
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,287
Of course you would say that that makes total sense

1106
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Rightmost

1107
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
People don't say

1108
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
So

1109
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
The greatest gift

1110
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
That Mark

1111
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Gave me

1112
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
During this period

1113
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Was his honesty

1114
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Cuz it

1115
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
One point he said

1116
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
I don't know

1117
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
When or if

1118
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
I want to have children

1119
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,487
And I was in my mid-30s already

1120
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
So

1121
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,887
He said that to me and it was really in meaning it was that night that

1122
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
I left

1123
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
I went to the factory I had

1124
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
You know I brought my dog to the fact

1125
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
Play all the time

1126
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,127
So I really I went to the fact when I slept in the dog bed that night

1127
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
But

1128
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
You know now that I look back on it

1129
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
Spring Valley

1130
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:13,855
Could you imagine if we would have stayed together and we might have ended up having a kid that he wasn't

1131
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
Anti having kids

1132
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:20,255
Could have been that road that's so many people go down and it ends up being a mess

1133
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,607
Yeah but I did decide to start a family and he was

1134
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Very supportive of that

1135
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
I think this is like 2 years

1136
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,263
Later a2003 you have birthday to your twins

1137
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
Yep I was 39 years old I gave birth to my twins

1138
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
I mean I went to Boston IVF

1139
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
And

1140
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,295
That's how I had the kids and I and I

1141
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,087
Have always spoken openly

1142
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
About that

1143
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,719
That I was financially and emotionally ready to start a family and I do

1144
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,743
I just need a little help.

1145
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
So

1146
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
At this point when your girls

1147
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
In mm

1148
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,983
With Stacy's Pita Chips with with a trajectory

1149
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,055
Like was it clear that it was going to be

1150
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
A much bigger brand or or does it still feel like

1151
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
It was a you know

1152
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,455
More successful Regional

1153
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
So at this point

1154
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
The company was growing like crazy

1155
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
It was successful enough that we could each be taking

1156
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
A decent salary

1157
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
Pull that much out of the business but

1158
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
You know it was enough so that we could each

1159
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
You know by a car and

1160
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Yeah we can teach by our own place

1161
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,751
Or whatever so it was successful enough to do that but we

1162
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Really

1163
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
We decided how much we going to pay each other

1164
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
And

1165
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Then everything else just

1166
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
And

1167
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,831
What companies coming to eat to you guys at this point saying hey we want Stacy's Pita Chips in our

1168
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
In our store

1169
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Yeah

1170
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
So I think it was

1171
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
When we

1172
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,231
Got into the

1173
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Club accounts

1174
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,423
Like Costco and Sam's Club and all of those so we started manufacturing for them

1175
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,495
And then we got into Trader Joe's and we just

1176
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
And it was a perfect demographic

1177
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
For us

1178
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
And

1179
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,639
Trader Joe's was an amazing

1180
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Company to do business

1181
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
They paid

1182
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
On time or early

1183
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,575
And because of that

1184
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,391
We were able to not take on

1185
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Equity

1186
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
Wow and

1187
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,511
At that point you everything just went back into the business

1188
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
But we were just about to give up give up a piece of the company

1189
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:36,703
We never ended up actually doing that because we got Trader Joe's and they were ordering by the truckload

1190
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
And when we were selling them

1191
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
Truck is really

1192
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
Amazing

1193
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
When

1194
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
Trucks are lined up

1195
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
We're selling a you know what

1196
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
$2 item

1197
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
We're not selling computers

1198
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,927
You're when we're when we get to the point that we're doing you know 30 40 50 million dollars

1199
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Those are

1200
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
$2 sales are $1 sales

1201
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
That looks like just truckloads

1202
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
And

1203
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,959
At this point we were we had

1204
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
Move to the Sealy Mattress fact

1205
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,567
Drake where we bought the building and

1206
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
It was

1207
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:19,199
Two or three hundred thousand square feet something like that was basically four acres inside

1208
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,759
And we converted

1209
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
The Sealy mattress factory

1210
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
Into a giant

1211
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Pita chip

1212
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:31,487
Factory I think it's like

1213
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
Buy 2005-2006

1214
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
You're selling like

1215
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,375
More than 50 million dollars

1216
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,703
With a piece chips a year which is e v I think

1217
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239
65 thank you

1218
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,567
Pepsi announces that they were acquiring

1219
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Stacy's

1220
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,967
How did that happen today approached you like a year before do they say hey we're really interested in

1221
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,807
Buying a company is is that what happened or are you looking to sell it

1222
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,207
A couple months before we saw them at a trade show and and they were like others look up product and

1223
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,815
In order for them to even look at you you have to be at least 50 million in sales and Bubba

1224
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
And we were nowhere near there at the time and

1225
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,679
And that was the only contact we ever had with

1226
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
Then

1227
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
You know a year later

1228
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,799
At the trade show again

1229
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,127
There was this one month window where we got

1230
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
Phone calls

1231
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
From

1232
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
3

1233
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
Of

1234
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
The biggest

1235
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
Food companies in the world

1236
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
And

1237
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
We were alike

1238
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
We better start looking at this

1239
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
And this at this time I had

1240
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Two little kids

1241
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
Hey there two years old

1242
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
Single mom

1243
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
So we we really

1244
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
Said you know what we should

1245
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,727
We should wear we never considered selling

1246
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Yeah we should maybe

1247
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Think about that

1248
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
Sexy you decide

1249
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
In middle of working on a deal

1250
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
But actually this ship

1251
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Fire in the

1252
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,087
Yeah there was a big big

1253
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Fire and

1254
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,975
We had already signed the SBA was the stock purchase agreement we already signed that

1255
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,815
But it hadn't closed we agreed on a price and all of this

1256
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
And then we had a fire there was 9 million dollars in Damages and 25% of the factory was burnt down

1257
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,591
And that's a really hard phone call when they call you you don't have to kind of say

1258
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,151
And basically the way that it ended up

1259
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,711
Working out as you know we still ultimately

1260
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
Had a brand

1261
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
That was worse

1262
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Value

1263
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
End

1264
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
We were like

1265
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
We will get it back up and running

1266
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
And

1267
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,511
The way we did it was we built the wall

1268
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,327
Across half of the plant

1269
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:48,959
So we were still able to manufacture on the side that wasn't burnt down

1270
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,775
And then the other side we called in

1271
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Every

1272
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,151
Person over the last decade that had helped us with anything and then

1273
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,247
People were working electrician they brought in like with the one guy

1274
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
Turned into 6 guys

1275
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,855
Overnight Round the Clock

1276
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
Who's supposed to close in December

1277
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
And

1278
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Bye

1279
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
January

1280
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
12th

1281
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
They inspected the plant and they said

1282
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351
Don't believe it

1283
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
They're back up and running place looks great

1284
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Could you go

1285
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Sending the check

1286
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Exactly send them to check

1287
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,079
Which it would have been nice to see a check

1288
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,127
But nowadays it's a trance

1289
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,455
So we all sat in front of the computer just looking

1290
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
Waiting for the number to change

1291
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
It is a bear

1292
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
Is it there is it there is it

1293
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,159
I meant it was like you know that the money transferred in and

1294
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
And we did

1295
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Obviously

1296
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,975
Close the deal

1297
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
I've asked you know other entrepreneurs

1298
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
About

1299
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:51,679
The sale of their business and their different answers I asked co-founders of Reddit

1300
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,775
Why they agreed to sell their company of the time they did in the answer was

1301
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
Cuz it was more money than I've ever

1302
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Had my life I didn't grow up with a lot of money and it was

1303
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,711
Life-changing money which I think is a fair answer

1304
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
I have to assume that

1305
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Was it

1306
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Factories not be factor in your decision

1307
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,647
It was life-changing money

1308
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
But

1309
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,975
It had also become

1310
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
You know where we love this business

1311
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
And we loved running it

1312
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
At a point

1313
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
The tables turn

1314
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
And the business starts to run you

1315
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
So I think

1316
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
It was

1317
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
The perfect

1318
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Timing

1319
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,895
Yeah I was working crazy hours I was lucky if I got home on time before my kids went to

1320
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
To sleep

1321
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,271
So for me it was the right time for Mark I think it was the right time he was burnt out

1322
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
That means

1323
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Sad

1324
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
After it's sold

1325
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
There is this major

1326
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Like

1327
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
This was my

1328
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Whole life

1329
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
Best Miami kids and

1330
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
What am I going to do now

1331
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
So what

1332
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
What did you do in

1333
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
How long

1334
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
Do you stay with Stacy's after

1335
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Soda Pepsi

1336
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
One very disaster

1337
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,967
First year

1338
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
It was so hard I was

1339
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Contracted

1340
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,647
To stay but I really only had to work 20 days a year

1341
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,231
But I didn't know what else to do so I would really go in every day

1342
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,047
And I think I was more in the way

1343
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,607
And I thought that I was going to be

1344
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
Like a buffer

1345
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:30,239
Between the no the new leadership team and the employees

1346
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
End

1347
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,311
I think I probably just

1348
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Created

1349
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,871
More confusion

1350
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
So it was eight months of

1351
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
Yeah

1352
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,575
I can emit like you don't sound

1353
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,903
Like a person who is different from the person who you were in

1354
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
High school or college of course we all change

1355
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Equivalent of all that like

1356
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
You you sound like a very down-to-earth person

1357
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,887
But I'm all of a sudden you were you had

1358
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
Des welfare

1359
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
I have to assume you weren't

1360
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
You had no experience with

1361
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
How did it change

1362
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,615
The way you live your life or anything else

1363
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,407
I think it

1364
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
Even

1365
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
Today

1366
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
Sometimes when I go

1367
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
2

1368
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,039
Do something

1369
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
You think twice how can I do that

1370
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
How can I buy that

1371
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Coconut you know and

1372
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Initially

1373
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
I went out

1374
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
And I bought

1375
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
A castle

1376
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
Right

1377
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,607
Was like I'm going to buy a big house

1378
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Beautiful neighborhood and get us

1379
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
Sports car and do all that

1380
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
But

1381
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,775
Then I realized

1382
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
My kids

1383
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,663
Ride their bike and they go on the bus and and there's only

1384
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,759
5 kids on the bus cuz everybody else is going to private school and

1385
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Yeah and I was like

1386
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
We're done

1387
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
Amethyst House

1388
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Put the house on the market

1389
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
And I bought a

1390
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
Smaller house in a

1391
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
Neighborhood where

1392
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
Our neighbors are

1393
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Right next

1394
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Store

1395
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
And you could

1396
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,423
You know borrow a can opener

1397
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,751
And the kids can ride their bike and

1398
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
Yeah that's how

1399
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
I wanted to raise

1400
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
My family

1401
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
Just curious mean

1402
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
You Are Young You Are

1403
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
In your early 40s

1404
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Having accomplished

1405
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,039
This incredible

1406
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,343
Zayn Malik growing this business and

1407
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,159
The whole rest of your life ahead of you

1408
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
I mean

1409
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,767
Huge part of that uncredible exciting like I know

1410
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
Black people

1411
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,351
Listening would say I would love to have that

1412
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,167
But at the same time you had to figure out

1413
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
I guess

1414
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,495
What you were going to do with the rest of your life

1415
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,591
Right people are people look at you like

1416
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:49,247
You can do anything but at the same time you look at yourself and your like will now what am I going to do with my life

1417
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,575
Of course I'm on my mom and I'm parenting and that's person

1418
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Foremost

1419
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
What else am I

1420
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Yeah

1421
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,559
And it's a very hard position 3 hard place to be

1422
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,863
And the past for 5 years

1423
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
I've had

1424
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
Some

1425
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Big

1426
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
Medical

1427
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,751
Challenges

1428
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,359
I had breast cancer I had an autoimmune disease I had a full knee replacement

1429
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Knocked down for

1430
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
Why were years

1431
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,967
And

1432
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,295
When you're in that position you really feel

1433
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,855
Like the money at that point

1434
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,391
Doesn't matter

1435
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
You know if

1436
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
There's a day

1437
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
Will you think

1438
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
You may die

1439
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
All of a sudden there's this

1440
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Mortality

1441
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,631
Yeah you have to think of your

1442
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,935
Kids it's a most awful thing

1443
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
2

1444
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Think about

1445
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
What's going to happen

1446
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
With my children

1447
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Who's going to give them a hug

1448
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
Who's going to

1449
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
You know

1450
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,527
Take an obviously you know what I mean I've got family that

1451
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,319
That would step in and take care of him but but

1452
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
It's the little things

1453
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
It's the day-to-day things

1454
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,951
That you mentally go through

1455
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,999
That makes it really hard

1456
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
How's your

1457
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
How's your health now

1458
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Now I'm

1459
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
I had double mastectomy

1460
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,959
I don't identify myself

1461
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,287
As a cancer survivor I just look at it as

1462
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,847
This was a time in my life

1463
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
And now it's over

1464
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
All of that

1465
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,063
Getting past the medical issues

1466
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
Selling the company

1467
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,391
All of that adds up

1468
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
2

1469
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Taking control

1470
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
And that's my sense of bold

1471
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,095
So you kind of cut it now you got your mind in a new space

1472
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Amazing

1473
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,983
Station you think about the trajectory of your

1474
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Life in your career end

1475
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,639
The incredible success you had to do you think that it's because of

1476
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,479
The skills that you brought in the hard work that you brought her do you think that

1477
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Pluck

1478
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,295
Played a bigger role

1479
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
And that

1480
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,391
You know a lot of people say oh she got lucky

1481
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
That really pisses me off

1482
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,815
Cuz you're yeah maybe the Stars aligned and maybe the timing was right for a lot of

1483
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Bangs

1484
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,167
Each and every one of the challenges

1485
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,191
And the hurdles

1486
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
That you overcome

1487
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
Others might not have gotten there

1488
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
And we did

1489
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,151
I could have very easily

1490
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Followed

1491
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
The path

1492
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
Dad

1493
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,991
My father

1494
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
Laid out for me

1495
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
Probably could have just

1496
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Stating that

1497
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
Comfort zone

1498
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
But

1499
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:42,303
Yo yes by moving to this place and moving to that place and taking on additional challenges

1500
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
I think you develop the skill

1501
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Someone of us survival

1502
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
That's what

1503
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
Goddesswear

1504
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
We were in

1505
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
2007

1506
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
When we sold

1507
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,407
Yeah maybe there was some luck in there but there was a lot of skill

1508
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,943
That's involved

1509
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
In Crossing that

1510
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
Finish Line

1511
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
Ted Stacy Madison

1512
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Pita chips

1513
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,463
Still in the food business

1514
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,047
A few years ago she opened Stacy's juice bar Needham Massachusetts

1515
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
And along with her brother Dave

1516
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,655
She's just launched a new energy stack

1517
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Call diebold bars

1518
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
But even with those who Ventures

1519
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,335
Daisy still gets excited every time she's at the grocery store

1520
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,895
And see someone putting a bag over pita chips

1521
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:35,039
There was a time I was in the grocery store and this woman picked up two or three bags and she

1522
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
Put them in her car and I just couldn't resist I'm like you know what I'm just going to go tell her and I did I went up and I said

1523
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,255
Those are my chips and she looks at me and she goes

1524
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,047
No they're not they're my chips

1525
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
Oh my God

1526
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,103
And please do stick around because in just

1527
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,175
The moment we're going to hear from you about the things your building

1528
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:08,063

After James reeb was murdered in nineteen

1537
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
55 National Elk

01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,383
The back of the scene of the crime in Selma Alabama

1539
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,919
Many people responded differ

1540
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
What happened

1541
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,527
And what did Justice look like all these years later

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1546
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:52,863
Timeout for how you built that and the Story begins about

1547
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
5 years ago

1548
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,471
Country ratchathani was a pre-med student at UC Berkeley

1549
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:03,359
Taking organic chemistry what do you want to get a hydroxyl group onto a tertiary Carbon on an alkane

1550
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,199
Well then you can use a sn1 reaction

1551
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,063
During this is going to stress some of you out

1552
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,159
An alkyne which is a double bond into a sink I hear something you should know which is that

1553
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Foremost

1554
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,999
Pre-med students organic chemistry

1555
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,119
Sucks their people who will cry the night before the final there are people who would just lose it

1556
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:30,239
Just because it's so difficult

1557
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,639
Because it's about the essential building blocks of life every molecule in your body is an organic chemistry Mall

1558
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,967
And those molecules are reacting with other molecules all the time

1559
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:45,087
And so you need to know these compounds pretty well and you need to know how they interact with one another

1560
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,903
You start with molecule a and you have to figure out how to make

1561
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,927
Molecule B

1562
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,487
And maybe it's kind of obvious by now that

1563
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:56,607
Prereq was one of those rare pre-med students who really liked organic chemistry

1564
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,703
Intimate friends with a fellow student Dalal who felt the same way

1565
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,007
We both very much site like a game

1566
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,895
And then by the time we graduated we finally were like oh my God we actually have time now we're both plan to medical school

1567
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:12,991
Let's try to do this thing like let's try to actually create a game and see if we can

1568
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,527
Demystify this

1569
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
Daunting obstacle that still many pre-med students face all recruited a few other organic chemistry

1570
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,999
Start to develop a board game that

1571
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
You could play in the classroom

1572
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,399
And then we literally met once a week at UC Berkeley and one of their classrooms and

1573
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
Started brainstorming

1574
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,959
How is this going to work

1575
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
What do we want to have this game how exactly do we want to convey why we love organic chemistry and why other people should

1576
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:44,223
Lot of to eventually came up with a game where you get this card with a simple

1577
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Carbon chain on it

1578
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,623
And the goal is to manipulate that carbon chain into a more complex molecule

1579
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,695
And you do that by drawing more cards

1580
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,791
With all kinds of reactions and substrates and reagents on them

1581
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,095
I have no idea what any of that means

1582
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,911
What is the person with the most

1583
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,727
Complex molecule at the end of the game

1584
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:12,127
So the earliest version of the game was literally a kid you not me and my dad printing this out on

1585
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
Normal printer paper

1586
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
Eight and a half by 11

1587
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,247
Like 6 cards per sheet

1588
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:21,855
Cutting it out with scissors in my downstairs living room

1589
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,903
Play that first version of game

1590
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
But it went on

1591
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:28,255
Forever I couldn't even finish it

1592
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,839
Cuz it was still really complicated Ardex for like three hundred cards each

1593
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:37,471
And again they're on in 1/2 by 11 piece of paper card for everywhere there was a mess

1594
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
But it wouldn't work

1595
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,847
So over the next few months prereq in his team simplified the game

1596
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,919
They eliminated some of the molecules and made

1597
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,223
Card each chemical element

1598
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,831
Cartoon figure instead of thinking about all these chemicals

1599
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:59,231
Scary chemicals they actually look really fun like our bromine is a is a bro it has a nice hat on it and it

1600
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,815
Looks like a browse Anyway by the spring of 2017

1601
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
Shrek and his friends went on the kickstarter and it reads $15,000 from 18 different countries

1602
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:15,615
And the thing that I think really made us all proud was I think people love the idea was not doing any of the

1603
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
This on a full-time basis

1604
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:23,551
While the kickstarter campaign was going on he was getting ready to go to med school which he started in the summer of

1605
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
2017 this is a side gig for all of us

1606
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:32,767
I'm in med school I should take care of patients full-time and yet I still have this other thing that I really want to get done today

1607
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,351
The game is pretty much done it's called react

1608
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:42,495
With an! A company in China is making it there's a website where you can order it

1609
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,639
So far they've only sold about 400 games but the market is going to grow I want

1610
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:54,015
React to be the supplement for all organic chemistry classes across the not even the nation even the world

1611
01:04:54,271 --> 01:05:00,415
And even something they can play before they take the class to really be like okay so this is what I'm getting myself into it's not death it's not cray

1612
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Is basic science

1613
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,023
