24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
I've been up all night I knew that I would have to deliver this amazing

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
Speech if I wanted betterment to be successful this is my baby I've been working on for the last 3 years

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
The bikery time stamps when you leave these notes and I woke up in the morning and I saw

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Every 30 minutes all night long I had been awake and they writing down edits to my

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Presentation is probably the most nerve-wracking day of my life

29
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
Ramen PR

30
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,856
How I built this show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,672
Stories behind the movements they built

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
I'm guy Raz

33
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,216
Had decided

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
Online Investment Company

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
A business that manages more than

36
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
10 billion dollars

37
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
Let's face it retirement planning

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,624
Is not simple there are 401 k s and Roth IRAs

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
SEP IRA CDs in ETFs and mutual funds individual

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
A million different ways to save and invest and of course lose your money

41
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
He understood this problem

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
And he became convinced that there was a potentially huge Market out there for service

43
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
They could help people save money easily and simply

44
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Especially for people who didn't have

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,296
Tons of spare cash lying around

46
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,672
Inadvertently helped to create with an entirely new category in the tech sector

47
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
You may have heard the term fintech it's just an abbreviation of financial technology basically a way to use Tech

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
Technology like big data to make Finance more efficient and for consumers

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
A little bit cheaper

50
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
Betterment basically relies on mountains of data that

51
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Beads in the computers

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,920
What's that make decisions based on a dynamic algorithm

53
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Some people call them Robo advisors

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
By doing it this way

55
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,112
Betterment can charge a fraction of the fee that traditional Brokers charge

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,232
At today betterment manages more than 13 billion dollars

57
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
But John launched the company of what might be called the worst

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Possible time just after the financial crash of 2008

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:25,824
Which year Messi had to convince investors that this thing was going to work

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,664
He was also pretty young and relatively inexperienced

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Jean learn

62
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Get to that point

63
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
Started with his parents and grandparents

64
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,696
John Grubb Dallas but some of his earliest memories actually come from his grandparents and their Furniture Company

65
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
In Upstate New York

66
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
And the community that they built around that company

67
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Every Christmas we would be up there

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
At the Red House Inn in McConnelsville New York and

69
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
All of the community would come by

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
I heard they did they have everyone over for their New Year's party but even before that like every day there'd be a half a dozen people coming to the door

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
How to chat with them

72
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
To bring a gift

73
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
And they always have a gift to give in return like there's always

74
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
At your turkeys for every family at Thanksgiving and

75
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
High-end gifts for every family

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Rasmussen

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
They built this real

78
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Community and I appreciated that

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Immensely

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
I also sign them a real appreciation think of it this deep investment in

81
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Quality

82
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
And I just I always learned it was there because we have the finest craft

83
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
Because like we we build things that bass

84
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Finest cherry

85
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
You know from our own land

86
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
I think I draw from examples and I dry eye drops from

87
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Compare example that

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Hey

89
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
They were able to do that since I think those are things that I

90
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
I learned from them

91
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
When you were kids like what were you into

92
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Export-oriented

93
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
Comics or a like that

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
I was never good at any

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
When I would play soccer I would be the kid on the field watching

96
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
You know the airplanes go by overhead at the ball rolled past into the goal

97
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
And

98
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
I never was was big into that but I love scouting

99
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
And

100
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Looking back on those experience

101
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
It says

102
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
I got a lot of

103
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
Confidence out of leading my patrol and leading the troop and leading I know these in a two-week Expeditions that

104
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
We do in New Mexico and Colorado

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
And

106
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
I became an eagle scout

107
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Wow all the way up there

108
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
I still get called the Boy Scouts

109
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
And were you like

110
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
Into business or like selling stuff is

111
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
The kid or was that not even

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Part of Your World

113
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Well when I was

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
Freshman in high school I started getting interested in high school paper I started enjoying writing

115
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
And

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
I got

117
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
Super into it invited by my senior year I was

118
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Editor of the

119
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
And

120
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
I

121
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,463
I interned at the the year before my senior year at one of the big Dallas papers the Mets

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
I wrote my college essay about that experience

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
And

124
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,399
Any published my college essay and it said my internship at the Met got me into

125
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
The headliner

126
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Isner Style

127
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Go to Harvard right so

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
What did you say

129
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,943
I studied economics was my major and I had a real interest in

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Psychology is

131
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
I was taking human behavioral biology

132
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
Herbivore

133
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
He studied how people think

134
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
And taught me that

135
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Despite our best intentions

136
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
We're highly likely to make mistake

137
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Thanks we let our emotions get in the way

138
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
In fact we

139
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
We will not make rational decisions if left to our own devices

140
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
And I saw it

141
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
That

142
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
As

143
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Just a really interesting puzzle

144
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
The song

145
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Cotton problem

146
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
If people are so

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Irrational

148
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
And yet

149
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
We can make the world better

150
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
If we help people make better decisions

151
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
How do I do that how do I reconcile

152
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
When I graduated

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Still had no idea there wasn't a career in

154
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Helping people make better decisions that wasn't

155
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Thing one could do

156
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
But I liked

157
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Theory of it

158
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
And I was swayed at the time by one of my

159
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Icollege

160
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Roommates

161
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Dads who was it.

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
He's just talking about in his career he got to really understand

163
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,407
People and their problems and he was telling their stories

164
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:18,271
And then he was making them better and I thought that's that's it like that's the way that I'm going to

165
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,903
Going to help people in and feel good about victim impact that I'm having on on their lives and I'll be a doctor

166
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,535
Side I said I've got it I've got to pursue this and I did a post bacc pre-med year after I graduated

167
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
But

168
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,143
I just I couldn't stand it what was it about it that you

169
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
But you can stand

170
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
Blood for one day and I realized through

171
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
These types of experiences that

172
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,015
Really my my heart was was most likely in business if it took me awhile to find

173
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
My path I mean were you interested in finance at that point

174
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,999
Did you start to think about what you were going to do

175
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
I was never interested in finance if you can believe it had since I have a career in it I was interested

176
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:11,775
Economics I was interested in the science of how societies work

177
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
How economics is the science of studying civilization in its innocence and Anna

178
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,015
I was trying to put that together with the science of people and and decision-making

179
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
And finance was just like you know it's like helping rich people get richer that doesn't seem that exciting to me yeah

180
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
TTU graduate and then

181
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
What would you do next

182
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Well I came to New York City in New York was there had the highest concentration of friends and I thought

183
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
I've got to get a job and I started looking around and I talked to enough friends I kind of got a sense for who is doing what

184
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
And my happiest friend the one who seemed to be doing the best woodworking at first Manhattan Consulting Group

185
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
He said I think you should come by and apply I think you would like it here and I did first Manhattan does consult

186
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
Voting for banks and financial services companies

187
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
I never thought I'd be in that

188
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Data industry

189
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
But wow is getting access to CEOs and I was getting

190
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Develop new products in

191
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Really into

192
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Problems

193
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
High-level travel all around the country on the world

194
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
But when people would ask what will you do I'd say my job is helping Banks make more money and you know of course

195
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
I was tongue in cheek about that and

196
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Ultimately

197
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
Couldn't see myself doing that for my entire

198
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Korea had to do something

199
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
More meaningful

200
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Impactful

201
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
I see you're working there

202
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
And how long did you end up

203
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
At work and 1st Manhattan

204
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
I was there

205
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
454 in 5 years

206
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,935
Did you work while you were at

207
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Consultant did you for sure thing

208
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
This is kind of like

209
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Smoke and mirrors

210
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
Like this whole industry is like

211
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
I don't want to work but you know what I mean

212
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
I found many times that

213
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
We were

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
Working on projects

215
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
We could go 6 months on a product

216
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Development and never talked to

217
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Customer

218
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,071
That's that seem strange to me I mean we should be innovating Airways

219
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Should be really thinking about what

220
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
The future of this industry not just

221
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Perfecting transfer rate

222
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
Default rates in all these kinds of internal Med

223
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
What customers really want

224
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
I talked to a partner at

225
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Got this

226
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Netpartner said

227
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
John

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Are there some industries that make money off of

229
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
People

230
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
And there's other Industries

231
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Make money off

232
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
We make money off of

233
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
Money which was a way

234
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Don't worry about it

235
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:42,047
That customer so much of course you know there's a lot of well-intentioned people in Banking and Financial Services who do

236
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Care about their cuts

237
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Customers in San Juan

238
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,959
But I didn't see enough of that I didn't see enough real Innovation coming out

239
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Of the industry

240
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
When did you start to think about

241
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
I don't know

242
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Leaving doing something on your own

243
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
I thought about it

244
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Have from probably the

245
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
First or second weekend

246
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
I didn't seriously

247
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Get the edge

248
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Maybe forever

249
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,743
Couple years but I knew from from day one I felt like I was I'd been let into

250
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Figure out how the

251
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
The industry work

252
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
And I was going to someday come back in and start a company

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
I and do something Innovative in differ

254
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
That was probably

255
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
3 years into my tenure at fmcg

256
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
It's like 2006 or so

257
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Yeah exactly

258
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
But you were the kind of financial consulting you were doing was for like big

259
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Companies

260
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
It's right like Institution

261
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Correct

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
Were you pretty good at picking stocks and

263
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Making investment yourself

264
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,279
Challenge really find many

265
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
People are really good at that

266
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
I was not

267
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
I had seven different brokerage accounts over the years I had made a bunch of different mutual funds that I bought at an ETrade account at TD

268
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Scottrade account

269
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
And

270
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Is that bad by the way they have all the stuff accounts

271
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,407
You know I open each of them because I wasn't satisfied with

272
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
With any of them

273
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
I found they would tell me

274
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Whatever it was they wanted me to do

275
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
For them right sode

276
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
A broker just wanted me to trade and were showing me the signals around what I say

277
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Straight around to give me more research and pushing me to the next trade

278
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
IND

279
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
Very few none of them really

280
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
Focused on what was right for me

281
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Or how I might make the most of

282
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
My money did you make a lot of money

283
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
I broke

284
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
Even right I kept up with them

285
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
I get pretty good track of how is

286
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
And I made some great

287
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Terrible investment

288
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
I bought Enron

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
I did I bought it at

290
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
$11

291
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Fallen

292
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
70 + and I sold it

293
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
0 wow

294
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
In-N-Out

295
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
Great example of just

296
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
What was I thinking

297
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
In retrospect I bought it because

298
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Must be there must be a market over reaction hair

299
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Probably to playing on some

300
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Behavioral

301
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
But I learned that I was subject to the

302
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
The same kind

303
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
And learned about it

304
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
College the things that my professors had told me to avoid I was

305
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Is doing myself

306
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
And I realized that experienced it

307
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
If it was that hard for me

308
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
At someone who's

309
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Had all the benefits

310
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Business School

311
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
A degree in economics in

312
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
CFA in

313
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
All of these I can working in the industry

314
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
Wow it must be impossible

315
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
For the average person to time manage their money well

316
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
When did you start to think about

317
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Actually

318
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Creating

319
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
The business that

320
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
You would have been secretly

321
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Was that a fully-formed idea

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
In 2006/2007

323
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
In your mind already

324
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Yeah I wanted to help build

325
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
A new customer center

326
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Service I wanted to

327
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Build Financial Service

328
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Around the cusp

329
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
I wasn't sure where to start

330
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
So I looked at a number

331
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:01,471
Again I had narrow down from like a my business could be anything to it'll be Financial Services right

332
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
And now is it payments

333
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,615
Or is it I want to build a better savings account or I Want to Build a Better investing app

334
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Well others three let me tell you investing is the least

335
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Mrs back in 2006

336
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Is it a long time ago

337
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
In the savings Market

338
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Online savings

339
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
I saw ING Direct

340
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
The company I had tremendous respect

341
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Search for I thought wow what an amazing brand they've built

342
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
I can't do better than that my can't beat these

343
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Dave Dave under

344
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
But then I looked at invest

345
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
And I had a Vanguard

346
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Account and

347
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Another company have tremendous respect for

348
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Now you know

349
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
Like some great Vanguard mutual funds

350
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
But

351
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
The interface was

352
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Terrible the experience was

353
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,295
Just not keeping up and it might initial idea was what if I just

354
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Can I combine these two things

355
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
Great like he's of investing but with a better

356
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
User interface

357
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Some of that

358
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Yeah like get the ease of my online savings

359
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Account through ing

360
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
Combined with the smart investing efficiency of

361
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Vanguard

362
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
If I could just help

363
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
People

364
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Get the best of both of those things

365
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,543
I made the world a better place and that was the initial pitch for betterment

366
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,383
Probably before we get to the actual pitch you I guess around 2017

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
You quit your job at first Manhattan Consulting

368
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
To go to the business school right

369
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,623
Dad I went to business school knowing that I wanted to start a bit

370
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
By the time I start a business school ad

371
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Betterment

372
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
I knew it was going to be consumer-oriented

373
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Because my passion

374
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Was

375
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
People are my passion

376
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Is consumerism

377
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
I think

378
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Institutions and

379
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Really wealthy

380
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Are welser

381
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
There are so many

382
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Smart people out there helping them

383
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
I think first

384
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
The average American

385
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
There's a retirement crisis

386
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,599
Because most people don't really understand the long-term and we're not evolved

387
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
To understand

388
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
We don't do well with thinking about

389
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
30 years from now

390
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,839
We've evolved from a time when we were more likely than not going to die before we had to worry about

391
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Long-term problems

392
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
So just focus on survival

393
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
And so we have this now Retirement System in America where

394
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Everyone is expected

395
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Hip2Save

396
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Non-retirement

397
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
Essential you were talking about people who have

398
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Roughly how much do

399
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
We think of our Target cost

400
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Someone who's

401
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
It's not make

402
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Over a hundred thousand

403
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
That means there are

404
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Professional

405
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
I would love to help

406
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Literally

407
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,047
Everyone in America save and invest

408
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
The reality is

409
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
That

410
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
50% of America

411
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Saving

412
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
About half of them

413
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Don't have enough to really make a meeting

414
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Nest

415
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
And I can't

416
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Solve

417
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
Every process I would love to solve that problem

418
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
But we're focused on helping people who

419
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Who are saving

420
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
And help them save and invest

421
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Better

422
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Sorry you

423
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
You get a business

424
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
You went to Columbia

425
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
And then you

426
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
You start to work on this and what you

427
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
3 * 2

428
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Talk to people about it

429
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
I talked to everyone who is this

430
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Send my poor classmate

431
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Exactly how I put them through a lot

432
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,567
Show me people would say okay so I'll let's say I've got ten thousand bucks like what I just give it to you and

433
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,639
And you take care of it for me like why would I just go to Vanguard what would you

434
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
What are the challenges when you're really inventing something new

435
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Is nobody wants it

436
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Right

437
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
People say

438
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Hey would you like a bank account

439
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391

Account or this new thing

441
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
But no one's going to want the news

442
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Scary and

443
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
And takes a lot of time to build

444
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Financial Services

445
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Took time to get that

446
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167

449
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Think about it

450
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799

467
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639

468
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663

00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
The question what should I do with my money

473
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
One thing I found it was

474
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Everyone

475
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
They were so bad

476
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
About the thing that they were doing everyone felt

477
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Everyone felt like I know I'm not making

478
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
I know I'm not doing everything I should

479
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
I should be doing

480
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
I'd say aha there's an Insight here

This was just you you were good was going to be just you

482

Hippie hats

484
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Embarrassingly

485
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:03,039
I really thought I was going to build the whole thing myself so that summer that I was in business

486
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
I taught myself to code that you're going to build the

487
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
The site everything

488
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,743
And I did I built the first version of the site

489
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
I hate my roommate at the time Sean

490
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Was an engineer at

491
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Google +

492
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
He's one of the smartest people I've ever met

493
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,983
He kind of got me set up because Sean Owen

494
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
That's right and he was

495
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335

496
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871

It was it was it was amazing

499
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
Fortunately Sean always pushed

500
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Bored

501
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831

00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
The thing that I always tell people

506
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
For the day when they're

507
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
They make it realistic

508
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Quick as you can

509
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
That comes from Shawn

510
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Alright see you start to build a mock-up cuz obviously

511
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Businesses there's a lot of regulatory

512
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Challenges when you

513
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Trader Financial

514
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Services

515
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
It's not like just

516
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Opening up an online shop like

517
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Right you can't just

518
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
Pictures of shingles

519
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
Send your money and invest it for you

520
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
Believe me I tried went when I say I wanted to

521
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
Build a totally new kind of

522
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Company

523
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Around the customer I mean it I didn't want

00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
KeyBank I didn't want to be

525
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
A broker I didn't want to be any of those

526
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
I think they all have

527
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Bad reputation

528
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:28,543
It's for a reason they're manufacturing product and selling product I wanted to build around the

529
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
You don't have to be

530
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
A regulated entity at all

531
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
But everything pointed back

532
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
We do have to be reggae

533
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Delight as well read

534
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319

535
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
It was in my in 2008

536
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
I am I sexy

537
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Your business school

538
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
In the early fall

539
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
That I

540
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
How to chat with

541
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
Eli broverman and who's who's Eli broverman

542
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
Eli bronfman is my

543
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Co-founder

544
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
IMusic Securities lawyer

545
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
And I thought

546
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
I talked to him about

547
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
Not the problem that I was trying to solve and and he said yeah that's it

548
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,871
I can relate to that problem I'm trying to do something Smarter with my money and

549
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Maybe let me help you out with this and I thought

550
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
This is it you know it's it's

551
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
It's better with a team and it said that the business plan started to grow so what was Eli

552
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
Weis job liquid he meant to figure out he was meant to figure out what entity should

553
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:27,168
Evolved into him being RC 00 and Amanda

554
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
Matching all of our broker-dealer operations overtime but he initially was there to figure out

555
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
The right there should be an investment advisor

556
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,736
Something else and we settled on investment advisor because an investment advisor

557
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
Is ultimately there a fiduciary and someone who's bound to do right by the customer which just felt right

558
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,536
Write to us it felt like they're the right kind of organization so you like Jo-Ann's by the way how are you finding this I'm in your

559
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
Try to build you know a website you got paper servers you got a I mean

560
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,520
How much money did you have in total remember it

561
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
I mean I had a good job as a consultant for several years and I'd saved quite a bit and I was able to live

562
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,736
Live off my savings for

563
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
A couple years

564
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
Hot hands at and so is Eli Eli had save money as well

565
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
The lawyer

566
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
And so we funded

567
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
The business out of our state

568
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
And it probably didn't cost you

569
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
That much

570
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Yeah we were only paying ourselves

571
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
It's starting to cost more as we started to hire our first

572
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
But that was that was

573
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
So you have this this idea

574
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Platinum

575
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
You launch this

576
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
And you it's you at this point is

577
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
It's just you and Eli

578
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
And and your and your roommate

579
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Shawn Owen

580
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
And Sean

581
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
And at that time

582
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Right after I grab

583
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
I hope we hired Anthony strout

584
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
To been one of my college

585
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
CG

586
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
Belts online banks for

587
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
At 4

588
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
For some major Nash

589
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
National companies

590
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
And had

591
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
This experience with

592
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Customer

593
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,448
Yeah so he joined hazard

594
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
I had a prot

595
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
So what was your plan in in

596
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
In May of 2009 when you graduated from Business School

597
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
What was the plan to

598
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Get this thing stood up

599
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Really quickly

600
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,248
Yeah but one thing to remember is

601
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
September of 2008

602
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Was the beginning

603
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,648
Exactly

604
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
And

605
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
At that time

606
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
I was talking

607
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
My professor

608
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
Most of them knew that I was working on

609
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
John are you sure this is the right time to start this company

610
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
It seems like the worst time to be

611
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
And

612
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Tumi

613
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Boy that that just

614
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Drew me to it even more

615
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah because

616
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
Wow if

617
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Keep lurking

618
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Used

619
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
Frustrated with the existing Financial on

620
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Institutions

621
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
I can see why

622
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,184
Adding a loss of trust for good reason here

623
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
And

624
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
Just seems like a gradle

625
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm an opportunist

626
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
And to me

627
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
There's something about a really thorny

628
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Harry ugly

629
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,752
No opportunities Everest don't don't touch that

630
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
Time is it

631
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
This is actually

632
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Quite tractor

633
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
Because when everyone else is running the other way

634
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224
Maybe something has been missed maybe there's a number

635
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Opportunity

636
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Really I credit

637
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Starting at that time

638
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
I was a lot

639
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
I think it was lucky that

640
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
We got started

641
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
A couple other competitors that started at time

642
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Still exist everyone who started since

643
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,608
Guys either really tiny or has been acquired or this or that

644
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
At 7

645
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
It was a good time

646
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Happy starting

647
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
This business

648
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
And so you guys are planning on launching a

649
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
In the fall of 2009

650
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
So you had to get all of the regular time

651
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Crazy stuff done

652
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
You at at the site stood up

653
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
You have to have like

654
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
Money people willing to invest

655
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
The money in this

656
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,416
And so did you make it by the fall of 2009

657
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Is not that that timeline

658
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Pushing out

659
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
I remember

660
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
Wow I was trying so hard to keep

661
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
ASAP Ferg

662
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
Now I should think it's really important that I be there I can

663
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
I can't I can't like that that I need any

664
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
Anytime slept

665
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,664
And what I realized we needed a forcing mechanism and I think Anthony said

666
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
Hey we could apply for TechCrunch

667
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
And I thought hey that's an interesting idea TechCrunch

668
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
2nd Century

669
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
Is like a text on a conference where you

670
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
You're pitching compete with other Tech startups

671
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,584
Yeah and Temperance was hosting their first-ever disrupt conference in New York City

672
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
The following spring may have

673
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Mm mm

674
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,448
10 that's our launch date

675
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
And one of the rules for pitching at TechCrunch

676
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Would you have to launch

677
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
On that day

678
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
And that's

679
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
What really helped us

680
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Get up and get going

681
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Alright so you

682
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
So you hear about this TechCrunch

683
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
And you decide alright

684
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
Week until May of 2010

685
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
To get this off the ground so what would you guys do

686
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
It was

687
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Seriously stressed

688
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Septic

689
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
The context leading up

690
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Up to ten

691
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
The week before

692
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
We decided to start.

693
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Pull out

694
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Code

695
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
That had

696
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Customer sharing information

697
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
About what

698
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
Their allocation

699
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
I had this whole I

700
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
India.

701
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,152
People would be interested in seeing how their friends

702
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
What are my friends words

703
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Twitter my friends Alex

704
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
And if we started to user test and show it

705
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Everyone said

706
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Terrifying

707
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
I have no interest in seeing what what my friends are doing and you said it was going to be like Facebook for investing

708
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
Okay just put money into this Facebook was everything at the

709
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
Right in this whole idea of network effect

710
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,984
Clearly we're going to have some Network effects we got to build that into our products

711
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
People want to share all the stuff is like with the world

712
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Yes I did

713
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,944
And I learned Anna from from user research thankfully

714
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Only I want

715
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
To do that

716
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,368
So we were beer pulling that coat out

717
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,184
I'm in though in the week before we launched

718
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
We were testing the entire system in we've been testing at

719
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
4 month

720
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
And who are you testing it with

721
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Our friends and

722
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
And they were putting real money

723
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
They were putting your money

724
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,728
That time you know we had to actually start to test the pipes right

725
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,544
And thank goodness we did because in that week before

726
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
We all Ben 10 Ben deposit

727
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
I've been putting money in

728
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
No one is taking money out and

729
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Until the week before there was

730
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Splash crash

731
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
And the assistant

732
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Ave

733
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
Our partner Ryan

734
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
Was checking her account during the moment

735
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
The crack Shack

736
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
And she Paddock Sheaf

737
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Freak out

738
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Withdrew her money

739
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
And thank goodness she did

740
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Because it showed us that

741
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Withdrawals didn't work at all

742
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,888
We are going to work at all that she could not take her money out

743
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:54,752
Yeah if I get traded through but she couldn't actually get her money back LOL

744
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
So we had to go and

745
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
Fix withdrawals

746
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
And so it was a

747
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
A crazy

748
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
We can we were working there the entire way

749
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
And then

750
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,832
This is on the product side right so we've got two major things that were trying to get together on the product side

751
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
The regulatory sign

752
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392

Before we were set to launch at

00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,072
And of course the closer to the weekend so it's literally down to the where's the last day they

00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Could possibly have given us approval we got the final table

757
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,728

And Pitch this thing to the world

763

Of course I'm so excited about it

764
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
I mean I'm running through

765
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
Dispatch over and over again with anyone

766
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Listen to me

767
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
I've written in script

768
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
The entire thing

769
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
Which I would never do again and would not recommend

770
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Amanda never script

771
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,792
And I had it up until like the night before I had a Blackberry the time

772
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,864
And I was still like typing like ideas all night

773
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
And I woke up in the morning

774
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424

775
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,800

785
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856

Chris will let me just interrupt you or are you saying

855
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
If they just made the interface

856
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
And if they actually

857
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
I made it harder to use this that you'd be more excited

858
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
That's that's what that's what I'm saying

If not that's not the first won't be the last

865
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
Remind people that

866
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,712

Figure this out

926
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,048
And by the way in that time we're asking our employees to

927
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
Reduce their salaries and even

928
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Contribute capital

929
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936

930
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,568
So we were buying time is best we could until we could raise some capital

932
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
To pay to work for the company

933
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,504
You bet I'm outside gratefully they they believed in

934
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,832
What we were building and they did it was still like

935
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,416
Six or seven of you guys it was it was it was five of us

936
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
I realized

937
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
We can't just stand here and wait for checks to come in

938
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,448
So I started to build a deck and actually think about who would be the right in the

939
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,800
Target them at the time we hired

940
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,896
Attorney and set up some meetings for us in the

941
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
The first meeting that he set up Waze with Bessemer Ventures

942
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
And we went out and we pitched Rob's Davis and it was love at first pitch we said we're building this

943
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
Company that is going to help people make the most of their money and and Rob said this is

944
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
2 years I've been looking for

945
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,192
A company that would answer the question what should I do with my money and it's the best one that I've seen

946
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,800
And he said how about rather than investing million dollars

947
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
You guys raised $3000000

948
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
And we said wow you were looking for a million dollars

949
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,968
You're looking for a million we ended up raising

950
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
And in terms of the kinds of

951
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
A customer's you want to go for the idea was

952
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,256
If you've got money to invest in your Rich your fine cuz you can go to one of these wealth management companies and

953
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Dell

954
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Esl like

955
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:24,192
Hop on the phone with you and they'll give you really good service but you got to give him 1% of your money and the really

956
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,008
Open the door for Youth of a million bucks

957
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
Yeah you're saying we're going to give you a similar

958
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Service

959
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Type service

960
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,480
That's right and so all these people decided to try us out

961
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
And if that time

962
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Member

963
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,880
I just couldn't believe that anyone would trust us to manage their money

964
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,208
Because there's no fintech industry to speak of

965
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
I know online you know

966
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Eden startup

967
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Money manager

968
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
And who are we

969
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,704
So I was amazed that we got those first 500 and by the end of the

970
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Of the year

971
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Thousand customers

972
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
It took us a full

973
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,640
Year to get to 10 million dollars under management

974
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
We celebrated that wow that was a

975
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
The big number are they just

976
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:14,880
The trust that and Bayern $10 that's a lot of money right how are you making money

977
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Off that

978
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Money like you were charging

979
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Percentage of the returns

980
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
We were charging

981
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
At that time 90 basis

982
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,400
Points and we sense lower the fee

983
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
90 basis points just underwear

984
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
Just under 1%

985
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
And what is it today

986
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,848
Today is 25 basis points or .25%

987
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
It's a fraction of what the you know that the traditional mutual fund charges or the traditional

988
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Financial advisor charges

989
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
I and we

990
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
I would provide a

991
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Really incredible amount of value for that

992
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,232
So okay so soon in year 1 you get 10 million

993
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
And then like

994
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
You cure growth is just crazy I think

995
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Today you're managing like

996
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
13 billion dollars

997
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Guelph

998
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,824
Yeah we expect to be in the ballpark of 18 to 20 billion by the end of 2018 amazing

999
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,432
The way that I look at it as it took us a year to get to

1000
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
10 million

1001
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
It took us another six months

1002
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,552
To get to 20 million it took us another three months to get

1003
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
30 million

1004
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,880
It's just kept growing faster

1005
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
Damn it was a billion dollars

1006
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Wow billion was a

1007
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Big number and it took us

1008
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,120
5 years to get there and now we add a billion you know every every every month

1009
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
We just keep growing faster and faster 10 million dollars is a bad day for it now that was our whole first year

1010
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
And another slow day of net deposit today

1011
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
I mean

1012
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Obviously you're growing and this is this is always a delicate question

1013
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
Night when I ask a question but

1014
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
As you

1015
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
Started to grow let me know

1016
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Did you start

1017
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,536
Like rethinking what with a split or the ownership

1018
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
What is a mother found hers or what should be like was it

1019
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
The tens with a complicated

1020
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
Tough it's always tough

1021
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
And there was a moment where

1022
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,848
And I realized I'd done it wrong and in the early days

1023
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
What how what did you do in your life

1024
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
So

1025
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
One thing that we did

1026
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,808
Was in the early days we we created

1027
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
Provisions around

1028
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,440
Buyouts and and I'm so happy we did that when people ask

1029
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
Advice I would tell them to do this

1030
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
Because Sean remember was I was

1031
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
Founder and was involved with us from from the very beginning and he decided to go to business school he went to business school and

1032
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,288
London and we were working with him for a long time remotely like

1033
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
Like that but it became very hard after

1034
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
When the three of us were in the office and we were coming to

1035
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
Decisions during the day and then we have a call scheduled

1036
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Shining

1037
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
He would disagree in

1038
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
You know we would

1039
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
We now have to rehash the whole thing and

1040
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
It just became too

1041
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,440
Tough and ultimately Sean decided I just can't do this anymore

1042
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
And initially

1043
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,560
When I remember the day in my apartment I sat down with

1044
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Sean and

1045
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Eli and we talked

1046
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
Debat how we going to split this thing often

1047
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
I think they're just like

1048
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
In a shot and I had had this sort of like

1049
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,616
You know equal Partners view we're roommates and you know he's obviously got

1050
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Tremendous experience praying with

1051
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Atkins technical experience in

1052
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
Eli comes in and picking oh my God that he's got to

1053
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Legal experiences can be so valuable I guess

1054
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,928
I guess we're all just in it together we should have 3333 32 right yeah

1055
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
And

1056
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
I forget if it was you know

1057
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
Weeks server month of me a couple months after that

1058
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
I just felt like this isn't fair

1059
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
I'm I'm clearly

1060
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm working so hard on this

1061
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Other guys aren't but

1062
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,848
I've been thinking about this thing for years and until I think I'm back to them and say

1063
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:51,456
I think we did this right here

1064
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,784
And I was tough but you know ultimately they were

1065
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
I bet they agreed that

1066
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
The day should take smaller shares

1067
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
I'm even hearing you talk about it now

1068
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,328
You sound a little bit uncomfortable about it I understand why I would be to

1069
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,144
It's an uncomfortable conversation

1070
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,240
I don't think one of my strengths is negotiation

1071
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
I think I'm okay at it but

1072
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,384
I probably didn't negotiate the best deal for myself from that

1073
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
From the get-go there

1074
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,456
Sopra.

1075
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Desert Diamond

1076
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,296
This is a very hard thing

1077
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
Like we hear stories of

1078
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,184
Co-founders are best friends co-founders who split up

1079
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,768
It sounds like you still have a pretty strong relationship is

1080
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
Is your co-founders

1081
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
But like

1082
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:45,216
The business figuring out like you know ownership and percentages like

1083
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,544
That sucks this is not fun

1084
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
I feel really lucky to have a great relationship with

1085
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,455
Both my co-founders Eli's still on my board

1086
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
Friend and

1087
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,063
Sean is a great friend I just saw Sean

1088
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
And London

1089
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
Add a few weeks ago when I was there and

1090
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
Remain very close so

1091
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Yeah

1092
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,791
So I mean what do you say to people who ask you for advice when they're like

1093
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
I like how I feel like

1094
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,935
You know what working hard but it was my idea and and I have really been a

1095
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Engine behind this like

1096
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
What do I do what do you say

1097
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
I said those words exactly and and some others and set it just it just doesn't feel

1098
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
Verdomme given all the years that I've

1099
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
I put into thinking about this and all the time and doesn't school that I've put into thinking about it and

1100
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
I'm

1101
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,927
Here and I'm committed I know you guys are as well but

1102
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Ultimately like

1103
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,071
I'm driving this thank you and and I'm the CEO and I feel like

1104
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
I feel like we need to be fair

1105
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Did you did you have a feeling

1106
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Early on that this

1107
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
This is going to be huge

1108
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
I always

1109
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Hoped and I thought

1110
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,359
If we're successful this is going to be a mess

1111
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Opportunity

1112
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
I said when we launch it

1113
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
TechCrunch

1114
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
On stage

1115
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
If we're successful

1116
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
We're going to have

1117
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Summer camp

1118
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,903
Everyone's going to be in this space because we're ultimately changing Financial Services were

1119
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Changing the way people

1120
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
Do you see yourself as a competitor to

1121
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
Talk to a Vanguard or two

1122
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Fidelity

1123
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
Schwabe said companies that you know people can invest

1124
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
Yes and I see SSS

1125
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Is Partners as well

1126
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Is a little bit of dislike

1127
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,127
Club Venus in international services and so

1128
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
I never liked

1129
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
Really like that I thought there ought to be more competition

1130
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
But there is the sense that even though you know a customer could choose between us and

1131
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,927
Vanguard well

1132
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
You know anyone who's invested with us is also getting

1133
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Some

1134
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Vanguard funds

1135
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,119
So in a sense we're partners with them

1136
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
Are we work with a lot of the other

1137
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
At the other Financial Service

1138
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
You know John I'm just

1139
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
I'm just curious to understand

1140
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Whether there were any times where you

1141
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
You kind of reflected on the

1142
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
The world you got into which is a bad word

1143
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
Corsair amazing wonderful kind people

1144
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,855
Who are in your industry and in horrible rotten people sing with mines by the way

1145
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,415
But whatever moments were you just kind of

1146
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Thought you know

1147
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
The stuff

1148
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
This world

1149
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,559
Especially world that created the financial crisis

1150
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
It doesn't reflect my values like I don't

1151
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Know if I really want to beat

1152
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
But you didn't want to be a doctor cuz you were afraid of

1153
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,335
Discussing it was a part of you like

1154
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Disgusted with some of the

1155
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,199
I don't know the culture of the the financial world

1156
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Well I'm not

1157
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Attracted to

1158
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
Finance and

1159
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
I liked it

1160
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Remind folks that

1161
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
In Dallas there's not

1162
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,975
Really a financial industry there there wasn't when I was growing up

1163
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,815
No internet in the 80s until when I was growing up

1164
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
I didn't know anyone in Final

1165
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
And a New York always felt like this kind of

1166
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
Distance

1167
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,495
Place where

1168
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,055
In banking felt like a stinger people were

1169
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Cutthroat

1170
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,199
We're like the wizard you know it in The Wizard of Oz that I just I really felt like

1171
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,295
Make the people who do this are just Masters the universe they must be so smart

1172
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
And when I

1173
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Got into the industry

1174
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
Demystify the whole thing

1175
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
Formats.

1176
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,255
I can do this I can learn this I can figure this out

1177
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
That was

1178
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,095
I Really Got Confidence building for me

1179
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,887
And I thought I can do it

1180
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,703
Differently because they don't have this kind of

1181
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:33,823
The sense of what it is and what it should be and I'm not here motivated primarily by

1182
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
Buy money I'm motivated by something

1183
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
And that allows me to have a

1184
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
You are

1185
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
A rich

1186
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Personality and your children will

1187
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
Stand to inherit a lot of money

1188
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,671
So it sort of this weird

1189
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
Ana position that now you're and where

1190
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
It sounds like you were

1191
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,095
You didn't feel like it was fair that the ultra-rich were

1192
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
Benefiting from Aldi

1193
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,263
Rules in and the requirements of financial requirements that allowed them to enter this piece

1194
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
Now you your

1195
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
You know kind of gift

1196
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,663
Whether or not you want to do you become

1197
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
If if I become rich I think we still have a lot of work to do on paper we should be

1198
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
Yes that's right that's right

1199
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
And even then I have two daughters I want them to have a great life

1200
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
They're two and four

1201
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
The probably someday

1202
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Accuse me

1203
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
I've run doing for saying this but

1204
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
I don't want them to have

1205
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,959
I don't want to set them up where they don't have to work cuz I think

1206
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
Work is part of Happy

1207
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Do you feel

1208
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Like you're rich

1209
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
Or is that just seemed like a

1210
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,175
Paper thing I am living in the same

1211
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
Apartment that I've lived in for the last

1212
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
12 years

1213
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,111
Before you had a kid a kid before I was married

1214
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
The same apartment that Sean

1215
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
Sean and I moved into that apartment

1216
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Together 12

1217
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Years ago

1218
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Do you like paying rent on an apartment

1219
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Pay rent on an apartment

1220
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
Same place and now we've got both

1221
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:05,471
Both daughters living there between his parents live three blocks away so we've got a pretty good setup

1222
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
John how much of your success do you think

1223
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Is because

1224
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
What's your

1225
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,639
Really smart and you work really hard and and

1226
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
How much

1227
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Do you think it's just

1228
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
Just lock

1229
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Style of

1230
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,087
This question and I I have to credit

1231
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,135
A lot of My Success to

1232
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Lock

1233
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Timing

1234
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
I

1235
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,023
I have described myself as as opportunistic

1236
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
I think that's a Common Thread throughout

1237
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
All of my life I've been

1238
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Lucky to have

1239
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,519
Amazing supportive parents I was lucky to go

1240
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
So great

1241
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
High School

1242
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:47,967
With Incredible teachers and mentors that got me lucky to go to a great College I was lucky to end up in financial

1243
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:54,367
Services which was a thing that had some real thorny problems that needed fixing to to me it's not about the things

1244
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
Did I did I really believe it's about

1245
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,511
About the opportunities that have been put it ahead of me

1246
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
And it's so course I work hard

1247
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,375
But I see myself is exceptionally

1248
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447
Lucky and if that feeling

1249
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
That I've been so

1250
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,079
Fortunate and life that makes me want

1251
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,639
To help others I hate my grandfather sad

1252
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Of those

1253
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,991
To whom much has been given much is expected

1254
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:27,903
And I will be paying down the debt of luck that I've had for a long time to come

1255
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
John Stein

1256
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
Is the CEO

1257
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Founder

1258
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
A betterment

1259
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
Which at the time of this recording

1260
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
Was valued at 800 million dollars

1261
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
If you go to John's Twitter page

1262
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,311
You can see an early warning sign of his career choice

1263
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,151
He posted a Boy Scout merit badge from 1993

1264
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,711
He was in troop 35 out of Dallas

1265
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
In the badge

1266
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,039
Isn't personal management

1267
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:02,975
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things

1268
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Your building

1269
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,071
The first of quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

1270
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,167
Who wants you to know that the newest member of the Microsoft Surface family

1271
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
The Surface Pro 6

1272

Has up to 13 and a half hours of battery life

1273
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
8th gen Intel Core processor

1274
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,895
You can work for as long as you want to

1275
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
Wherever work takes you

1276
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now

1277
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
For how you built that

1278
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,975
Is it a story starts more than 20 years ago when Sherry stellenberg

1279
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Was a student at

1280
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
At Virginia Tech

1281
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
Where is Friendswood

1282
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Hangout app

1283
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:44,191
The student center and there were pinball machines around the pool tables and all my friends while we were playing pool.

1284
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,775
They take a break and go over and play Pinball and I thought they were just throwing money away

1285
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
But one night

1286
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
What are the strengths

1287
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,895
Finally talked him into playing a game

1288
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,943
One game of pinball

1289
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Begrudgingly I walked over

1290
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,831
In Jesus must have been just a minute or two but had the time of my life and I

1291
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,903
Kind of got hooked immediately and what it was that

1292
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,279
It was kind of a physical game you could manipulate the flippers they keep the ball in play

1293
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,583
But Jerry was a tech guy of

1294
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
Computer engineer

1295
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,167
Something about pinball that

1296
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Start the bug

1297
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
While the ball is rolling around this painted piece of wood

1298
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
It's not

1299
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
Doing anything other than just rolling

1300
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
Which by the way has been perfectly acceptable for the legions of pinball players who love the game for decades

1301
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
Couldn't shake the feeling that the game could somehow be reimagined

1302
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
And so in 2009

1303
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
When touch screen tablets

1304
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,487
I started to get popular

1305
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
He got an idea

1306
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,167
So I saw that technology and I wanted to figure out how to implement that in a pinball machine when we can take the physical pinball

1307
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,519
Interacting with Graphics in the same way that your finger does on the tablet computer

1308
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:57,151
Message are you set out to do just that I started with one friend who's a mechanical

1309
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
And we connected with an audio engineer very popular audio

1310
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
And after 3 years

1311
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Grace working nights

1312
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Weekend

1313
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
Jerry and his friends

1314
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:10,207
Build a pinball game where you could use physical buttons and flippers

1315
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Solange

1316
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
Actual ball

1317
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
Over an LCD display

1318
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,887
Show that the ball while it's rolling towards the physical devices

1319
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,703
Could interact with these

1320
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Virtual objects

1321
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
What games they develop

1322
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:28,639
What is called rocks which is a riff on the popular video game asteroid

1323
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:35,295
Will you take the physical pinball and other trolling around the place he'll surface it's interacting with

1324
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
Images of asteroids on the screen in mind you there still a physical component this game so the boss

1325
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
Still rolling towards physical Target

1326
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
But I we enhance aesthetic

1327
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,607
As a prototype got better and better

1328
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,191
Jerry and his team decided to show it off at a pinball Festival in

1329
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,215
Frisco Texas

1330
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,567
And so many people came to us and thought it was amazing people stay there and played it

1331
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
4 hours

1332
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,663
Surprising here is that up to this point

1333
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
Cherry Bush really thinking about

1334
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
Selling these machines

1335
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,063
He and his friends have been mostly doing it for fun

1336
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,463
But I was fortunate enough to have an aunt and uncle and saw the early prototype and they called me actually after the show

1337
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
And they said hey if you want to try this

1338
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,815
And we're willing to give you some money to get started

1339
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,167
It was a very generous investment from uncle Gary and Aunt Diane

1340
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,239
Jerry was able to quit his day job and tag

1341
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
And pay a small team of Engineers to build the pinball machine

1342
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,407
And a 2016 four years after that show in Texas

1343
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
The company shipped out their first machine

1344
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:42,367
To a handful of fans it doesn't need to be a billion dollar company to make me happy I'd be happy to selling a few hundred

1345
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
Things that you're making it a lifestyle business

1346
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
And giving people something new and different and exciting

1347
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,375
Jerry's pinball machine is called the P3 the company is called multimorphic and it's based out of Austin Texas

1348
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,679
As you might imagine

1349
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,239
Jerry's also faced some skepticism

1350
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
From pinball purist

1351
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
And some of them see this new machine with this virtual interactions and they see it as an insult to what they love

1352
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
And then they play it

1353
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:13,855
And most of the time they walk away with a huge smile on their face making loud

1354
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
That was really a lot of fun

1355
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,231
She want to learn more about multimorphic or here
