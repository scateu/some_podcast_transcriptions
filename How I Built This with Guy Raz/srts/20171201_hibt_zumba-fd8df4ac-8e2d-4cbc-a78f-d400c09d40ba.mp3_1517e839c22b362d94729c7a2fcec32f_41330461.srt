00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
But before that happened Alberto Perlman was living in Miami

192
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
23

193
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,391
1999 with all the guys my age were starting internet companies and I

194
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,487
I said why not so he launches in Latin America

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
Seems to be going fine for a short. Of time until

196
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
The Dot com bubble burst

197
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Alberto's company

198
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Collapses

199
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
So I personally was

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Out of a job and I had

201
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
No money in the bank

202
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,943
And I didn't know what I was going to do and I was having dinner at my parents house

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
And

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
My mom

205
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,879
Kept talking about bettas class in at that point fair to hear Miami he called his classroom besides

206
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Because Rumba in Spanish means to party

207
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
And then she turned to me and said

208
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Why you meet with Beto

209
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Maybe

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
If you're looking for something right now maybe you and him can start a gym together or something

211
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
And I said I don't know if I'm going to start a gym

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
I don't meet with him

213
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Sketches that means your background was in

214
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
Technology in in like

215
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Direct Market yourself

216
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Seems a weird like that's not really my thing

217
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,575
What's the thing that pops into my brain at that time was

218
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Could this be an infomercial

219
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
Could this be

220
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Something that we could

221
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
Basically sell some videotapes of this

222
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Splicing

223
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Do something with it but I wasn't sure

224
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
I wasn't sure

225
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
So the next day

226
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
I was meeting with Beto at a Starbucks isn't like what

227
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
2000-2001

228
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
2001

229
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
And she told me his life story

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Which is unbeliever

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
I grew up in

232
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
Columbia also so I knew

233
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
What's happening in the country

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
But he was in college

235
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
And Kylie was

236
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
The epicenter of

237
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Violence

238
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
And

239
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Xerosis

240
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
15 year old kid

241
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Dancing

242
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
On the streets and that's in clubs and dancing in James and

243
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
And so it was like just

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
The position right with all the violence happening in

245
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
This kid make

246
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Everybody happy

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Discount right

248
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
That's what he told me his life story

249
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
Class cuz a Zumba class interesting what a Zumba class is that

250
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
The instructor is

251
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Is always telling a story

252
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
The music selection

253
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
How they teach the class

254
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
So I went to see the

255
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
And the one thing

256
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
That I noticed

257
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Was that every single person

258
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Smiling

259
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
And I had

260
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Been a gym member

261
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
Before and I can do that normally a smile is not the

262
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
To go Facebook

263
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
People are doing

264
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
When they're exercising really heavily

265
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
People are suffering

266
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Forcing themselves

267
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,479
It's it's kind of like the drill sergeant mentality

268
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
But then there was this

269
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Plus

270
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
Which is like an oasis inside the gym where every single person

271
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Was smiling but they were drenched in sweat

272
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
At the same time

273
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
And I'm like this guy

274
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Doesn't know it but he has

275
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
Discovered like a magic pill

276
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,983
He has discovered the exercise that people want to do instead of the exercise that people have to do

277
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,591
So you said to him would you say to him do you say hey let's start a business

278
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Yeah you told me about the what do you want to do

279
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Dinosaur dino Maine

280
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Let's do it

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Conquer the world

282
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
And the funny way you know

283
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Did you take him seriously

284
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
End

285
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
And he say I know he say okay let's do it

286
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Whatever you might be to Spanish yes

287
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Perfect

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
That was a

289
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
Yeah we said we need to

290
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
Create some videos of your class

291
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
And

292
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Basically

293
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Create a collection

294
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
DVD said it was VHS

295
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
I'm actually a VHS set

296
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And sell it

297
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
On TV

298
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
So we can explain where it comes from and why and what the results are in

299
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
And so that was the original idea

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
CIT it was

301
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Would you like

302
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
He was just a boy cat video like Jazzercise

303
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Just going to sell

304
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
An infomercial on that was hopefully going to be your business

305
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Yeah like are are the most fresh in our memories at that time

306
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Was typo

307
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Remember typo

308
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,823
So we was like that was the theory cuz Beto told me

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
When people come to my class

310
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
They don't

311
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Leave

312
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
And it's because

313
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
The class is fun we say fun equals lasting behavioral change

314
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,903
I get I get that but I'm trying to scare what was the thing that made Roomba size

315
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Different from other Fitness class

316
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
More fun

317
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
I think we

318
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,863
We do the same thing that Jane Fonda do in the beginning

319
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Everything

320
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
It's easy

321
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
Second the music

322
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
Norloti music only I do weighted different kind of Indian Bank

323
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Panther

324
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,247
Anybody can do it always I will always thinking they my mom

325
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Do my class and

326
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
It went to things that

327
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,671
Better than that was very smart of the beginning is he said I want a microphone

328
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Because if I have a microphone

329
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
I will interrupt

330
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
The music

331
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
And people need to be able to hear the music

332
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
And so he doesn't scream at people in the class or

333
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
If there's no

334
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
Talking it's only visual cueing soap

335
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
With hand signals would we tell people what to do

336
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
And

337
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
The magic is letting

338
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
The music

339
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,503
Lead the choreography lead the class

340
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
And there's a moment

341
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
In the class

342
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
That we call fetch

343
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
F e j

344
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Freeing electrifying Joy

345
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
I said that moment

346
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
Is 20 minutes into the class

347
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
And the person suddenly feels completely liberated

348
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
They're having fun they're not thinking about

349
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,239
What do you need to cook that night or their job

350
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,383
Or their kids or their everything that is in their life they're completely disappears and it's them

351
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
And the music

352
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,135
So did you have to go out and raise money to

353
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
So we was July of 2001

354
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
And we went to some of our investors that had invested in spiderlabs

355
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Was it the incubator

356
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,471
And we told him about this and they said we loved it we're and we had raised about half-a-million dollars

357
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
But we haven't gotten the wire transfers yet

358
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
And then September 11th happen

359
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
And everybody backed out and

360
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Yeah we don't know what we're

361
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
We're going to do when we didn't know when I mean

362
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
For the next two months were all confused what's going to happen with

363
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
The world and you remember

364
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
It was very tough

365
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
And

366
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Then around November of that year

367
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Beto told me

368
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
My boss at crunch

369
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
Once introduced you to the CEO of crunch

370
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Set time in crunches at

371
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Is a gym chain out of you

372
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Are you part of it and so I

373
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Met with her her name is Donna Cyrus and Donna told me

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
Hey go me with Doug Levine the original founder of crunch

375
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
So I flew to New York

376
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Met with dog

377
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
And he told me listen I've seen better teach

378
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
And I love what you guys are doing

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
And I said would you like to invest

380
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
And he said I can't advise because

381
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Right now I'm

382
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
I'm selling my company and

383
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
But I can introduce you to some interesting guys in Ohio

384
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Cool

385
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Do infomercials for a living

386
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
And they might be able to not only invest but also help you

387
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
So the next day I want a plane to Ohio

388
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
To meet with a company called fit

389
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Quest

390
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,455
And I'm in a room full of total Gypsy remember a total gym

391
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,551
Chuck Norris machine Hospital total gyms

392
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
And this lady

393
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,719
And is looking at a tape that we created of his Cloud we just film this class with a Handycam

394
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
I showed it to her

395
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
She said this is hot and want to call my boss

396
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
And

397
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
Finally the CEO comes down

398
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
And says this is Banton I like it

399
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
But the special speak English

400
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
And

401
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
Cuz you need to film an infomercial with him talking height

402
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
And I'm like

403
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
Well you know what I've never spoken to him in English let me call him

404
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
So I call him up

405
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
And I'm like paper they're asking

406
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
If you

407
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Hey speak English

408
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
And he said

409
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,815
Tell them yes

410
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,471
So they loved it and they said okay we will test the same commercial license to Brand what's this class called

411
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,799
We had just that last week discuss changing the name

412
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
What was wrong with Roomba size

413
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
The word Roomba

414
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
In Spanish

415
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Means to party

416
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
But it's also means

417
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
The type of dance there's a ballroom dance called Rumba

418
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
So it was a very difficult word to trademark

419
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
So we sat

420
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
In a restaurant

421
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
And we basically went through the alphabet

422
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
Anything that rhymes with Roomba so boom boom boom

423
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
Goomba sounded like

424
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399

434
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,695

Capital One na

463
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
It's how I built this from NPR kyroz so it's the early 2000s Alberto and Beto have a

464
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,239
Business model for Zumba which is basically to make these Dance videos for people to

465
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Play at home

466
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
First they need an infomercial before they can make that they have to make sure that Beto who is the dance

467
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
Teacher can speak English which

468
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Decant

469
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
And also at this point

470
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,111
A new business partner enters the picture whose name and I'm not making this up

471
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415

Yeah exactly at least we're coming down to Miami to meet him

479
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503

480
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:38,623

Parking garage in my Pontiac 85 North Edition

Yes they do it they want to do it

506
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
They wanted to do it so Albert arguing and I had to write

507
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
The whole infomercial

508
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
A script

509
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
In Spanish phonetics

510
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
Hola hola welcome to Advanced Zumba

00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,207

512
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
This is like having a party

513
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
Why you walking out release Zumba

514
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,935
Yeah we're going to get a royalty ass and maybe we should find some other products

515
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
Salvia television we don't know we don't know what we're going to do

516
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Enter the deal was that you would get a royalty but they owned

517
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Rights to a weed license

518
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Will I see lice

519
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
Because we don't have money to do it ourselves right and we didn't know how to do it frankly

520
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
You know how to do it

521
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Yeah when you guys launches from Marshall were you making money

522
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831

00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
It was good it was good at me they sold

524
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
I remember what the number was but

525
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
It was enough to

526
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Keep the lights on in

527
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,304
Keep going but it wasn't enough to to like

528
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,424
Ghetto fund your life and light pay your rent and everything to get to another job really not really been through

529
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,472
Stoat still taught his classes

00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
To Latin America I was hoping

534
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
American brands sell foods to

535
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224

It was crazy

608
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:32,512
And this moment kept us going for like a couple years that a contract

609
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
$1000 for

610
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096

00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
That help but it was not enough

612
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
What would you guys do that

613
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
So

614
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Then

615
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
People started calling

616
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Their call center

617
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336

Bet

630
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
And

631
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
At 2 a.m. it would ring when infomercials were airing

632
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
And people would say I want to become an instructor the first three times he hung up

633
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,848
I think the fourth time he's like

00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Something Happening Here

635
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,456
And he called me Anna and Beto and told us

636
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
You know we've been getting all these calls from instructors

637
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
That they want music

638
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
They want

00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
A choreography

640
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
They want

642
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208

Community that they want event

644
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
If you want all these things

645
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Maybe we can

646
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
We can put it all together and create

647
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Something service for them

648
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
To give them everything that they know

649
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Lyca subscription

650
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
Yes and so

651
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
We would call the Pizza Land

652
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
We started brainstorming

653
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
And we said well what do we need to do

654
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,064
Said the first thing is we have to make sure that we deliver

655
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
10 times more value

656
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Then what

657
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
It costs

658
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Suicide what do they need willany choreography

659
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,864
They need music made students how do we get them students how do I get the more participants in their class

660
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
Show marketing support

661
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,008
Let's create their career in a box basic

662
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Being so

663
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
We came up with a name

664
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
We called it a Zumba instructor Network

665
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
And we launched it in 2006 in January of 2006 so we spent the whole 14,000

666
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
0 in the back

667
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,368
We created is beautiful email

668
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
It went out and

669
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,488
Alberto Antonio if 200 of them join

670
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
We will continue with this business

671
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Tencent

672
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
And we're praying please please

673
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
And suddenly

674
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,984
Instead of getting email responses we got phone

675
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
And these structures were saying

676
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,640
We loving that your lunch this and we know you guys are trying to make the

677
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
This work can we pay the year in advance

678
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:04,576
And everybody says how much and wish I was $35 a month at that point it was 30

679
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
And they said that's it

680
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
That's it for my entire career that's all I have to pay and we said yeah it's only a half

681
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
They said we love it

682
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,560
And 450

683
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Instructors join

684
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
And so that's when we said this is this is going to be our life

685
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
And

686
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
And let's make it work

687
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
At this point you guys are still entirely self-funded

688
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Yeah

689
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
It was just from

690
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
That that royalties we got and then

691
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
The Kellogg's and then.

692
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Duffy's

693
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
From the trainings and that it was all like

694
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
Inch by inch very slow growth

695
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
And

696
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank God we were always able to meet payroll of Arc

697
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Two employees

698
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Sometimes we do things

699
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
To like pay the bill so

700
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
What's a beta why don't we do a special Master glass

701
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
A because we were running

702
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
$1,000 short

703
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
And so we would

704
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
Email everybody we knew once a special master class in

705
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,920
So we would all chip in and all help each other and

706
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
And find ways to do it

707
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
Since you guys are training all these instructors teach

708
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
I need a place to

709
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,368
Teach the classes so

710
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
So where the gym is interested in this

711
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
No

712
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
They would laugh at

713
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:18,816
So I remember that 24 Hour Fitness had a class called Salsa moves at that time

714
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
And

715
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
LA Fitness add a class called

716
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Latin impact

717
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
And they will tell us like why

718
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
We have our own brand why do we need your breath

719
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:32,896
But then you when you went to one of those classes they had five people for people three people those glasses were empty

720
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
And we said no we have a formula

721
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
We have a formula that works are

722
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Class

723
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Attracts

724
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
People and people love it

725
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
It's different

726
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
And they would understand of the beginning

727
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
And finally

728
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Hey there first

729
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
Really big chain to bring it in was

730
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
24-Hour Fitness

731
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
2007

732
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
And it'll

733
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Loaded

734
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
And they had to hire multiple instructors per location

735
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Then all the big

736
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
Gym chains followed Equinox in

737
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Crunch

738
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,176
A crunch always hide it because of our initial relationship with them so they were really the first one

739
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
You guys were doing all this

740
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
How are you getting the word out about Zimbabwe was a

741
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,832
Word of mouth or where you advertising

742
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
So what I think we were able to do in 2007/2008

743
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
We had bought the rights back to

744
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
To the infomercial

745
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
From Fitness question 2004-2005 is that stopped airing

746
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
As we did our own

747
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Infomercial

748
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
And we started airing.

749
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,616
And that was helping at the word out and there was word-of-mouth and there were more people coming to class

750
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
And

751
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
When something is good

752
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
People finding

753
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
And two other people were saying well

754
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
Structure must be doing pretty well maybe I should become an instructor

755
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,952
So what was like the Tipping Point

756
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
Model really start to take off

757
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
So in 2008

758
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
The network was growing

759
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,424
But we started seeing what was happening in the economy

760
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
And we got very nervous

761
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
And I remember that we sat

762
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,312
In our conference room and we said

763
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
This is going to be a very tough year

764
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
And look at everybody's

765
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Losing their jobs

766
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
If people cannot pay their mortgage

767
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
But for the next few months

768
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Started seeing

769
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
That are

770
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Instructor training

771
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
We're getting pack

772
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
And that there were more and more people who wanted to become instructors

773
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
And we also saw that the instructors were reporting to us

774
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
That their classes were packed

775
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
Calling us telling us

776
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
We don't know what's happening but we've doubled from

777
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,800
25 people now that I have 50 people in my class what's happening

778
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
So we started asking people

779
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
And we're two things that were driving it one

780
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
Was some people were out of

781
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
The job people were sad

782
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
They turn to Zumba

783
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
And they said

784
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,856
For 1 hour and when I forget everything that is happening

785
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
And I'm just going to be happy

786
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
And

787
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
A people who needed extra income

788
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,024
Said well now I'm going to get paid to workout

789
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
And someone to become an instructor

790
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
And I'm going to

00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888

Part of my

793
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Income

794
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
Does the financial crisis actually help your business

795
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,080
Yeah we were we were a solution that people turn to

796
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Hey during those hard times

797
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,432
It happened around

798
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Around this time which

799
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
I was reading that

800
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552

Set the music and it was always hard and he said that trust me one day they're going to come

808
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
And in 2010

809
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
A pitbull came to us

810
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
And sad

811
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
What are you guys doing

812
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
And we're like

813
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784

What are you guys doing and pretty like we'll instructors are just playing it in their class

820
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,968
And he said well

821
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
Legend like radio station

822
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
You guys

823
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088

00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,440
And you guys I think you guys can break records

826
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976

And you guys are breaking records

832
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
So people was the first guy to discover

833
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
Zumba was a way of promoting music

834
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
And then we worked with

835
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,480
Wyclef we work with Daddy Yankee

836
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,344

841
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
That zumba is

842
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,912
Great way to reach 15 million people we reach 15

843
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704

844
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Does every single week

845
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
And I think that Lori RT salary

846
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
Music

847
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848

How to promote your music

851
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760

856
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,696
That we send every month to the instructor

857
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,792

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and today story starts off

950
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,520
With a poem call the roller of big cigars the muscular one

951
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
Bid him whip in kitchen

952
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:39,456
This is Alex Mackenzie and he is not a literature major he's actually building a business but he got the idea

953
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
Yeah for that business

954
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
From this verse by Poet Wallace Stevens

955
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Be finale of seem

956
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,720
The only Emperor is the Emperor of Ice-Cream the Emperor of ice cream

957
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,560
That became the name of the business that Alex started a couple years ago

958
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
He always wanted to do something with

959
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,680
But when his wife showed him that

960
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,288
Poem something clicked and he decided to take a fresh look

961
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
At the ice cream business so my wife and I hit the road we toured the country we ate ice cream at Mom and Pop shops all over the place

962
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
Place we went to grocery stores to see what was in the aisle and I was just becoming sort of bored with what

963
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
The establish Market had to offer

964
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
Ice cream truck except instead of dishing out the usual soft serve or Bomb Pops

965
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
Heat up for a much more creative variety

966
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,360
It would be so great if a family could roll up and Mom could have vegan

967
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:44,736
Strawberry sorbet and Dad could have a high fat low are southern

968
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,344
Banana pudding ice-cream and the kids could have low sugar milkshake

969
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
And maybe

970
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:57,536
Gluten free ice cream sandwich Alex's vision of more upmarket ice cream

971
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
You still at College there was a business competition so he submitted this idea any actually

972
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
What which meant he got $50,000 to launch his

973
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
First ice cream truck

974
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
The only problem his wife had just gotten a job in a place where starting an ice cream business is not

975
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
A winning idea

976
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,112
Big Sky Montana we definitely had some reservations we realize we were

977
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,256
Going out on a whim you know moving to this very remote place but you know we came out here and we were shocked to see

978
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
How many people were actually in the Town Center every night there was no one here serving ice cream in there were all these

979
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
Families with money to spend Pura just looking for something fun to do so Alex and his wife Christina settled

980
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
YouTube Big Sky

981
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
And with his $50,000 he started experimenting with ice cream all of the flavors

982
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
I began developing at home with just a little Cuisinart unit that we bought on Amazon for like 50 bucks

983
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,280
Vanilla and chocolate Alex was going for much more exciting and exotic flavors like bourbon Peach

984
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
Pecan pie on the mountain huckleberry

985
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:07,680
And eventually he found a local Factory that couldn't make the ice cream for him

986
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,288
So he bought a bad and he started this dish it out we kill it in the summer

987
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,408
But that's too much summer here starts late and ends early so it's basically

988
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
Uline August and we've been able to gross about 50 Grand in just four months in a town of

989
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
2500 people

990
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
Buy more trucks but so far he hasn't had much traction we're not a tech company we're not a medical device company

991
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:43,008
We're not Airbnb you know so we're trying to sell these really sophisticated Silicon Valley.

992
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
Tights but I'm not getting as many bites as I'd like but over the past few months Alex has raised over thirty

993
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:55,808
$1,000 from his friends and family and he's hoping to get at least one more truck to make inroads in the south

994
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,416
West and then eventually if things go well to go National

995
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah in a perfect world I would love to have at least 600 truck so I could go head-to-head with Mister Softee

996
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
And we would love to ship our stuff on Amazon and we're talking to them now about that for the moment Alex still

997
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,336
Set 1 ice cream van in Big Sky Montana and he's not making a profit but

998
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
He absolutely loves what he's doing a lot of people ask me what's your exit strategy I don't have an exhaust wrap

999
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
I grew up poor

1000
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,576
And I would be thrilled

1001
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,136
Run my own ice cream company for the rest of my life.

1002
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
That's my exit strategy to not exit

1003
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
It's Alex Mackenzie of the Emperor of Ice-Cream to find out more about Alex's company
