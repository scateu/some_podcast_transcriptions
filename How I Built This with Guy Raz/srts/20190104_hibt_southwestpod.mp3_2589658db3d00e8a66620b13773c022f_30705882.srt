Hey it's guy here and

12
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,992
By now you may have heard that herb Kelleher

13
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,320
The co-founder of Southwest Airlines died on Thursday

14
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Her boys 87

15
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
And in honor of her we wanted to re-release this interview I did with him back in November of 2016

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
It is still one of my

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,144
Favorite all-time episodes of How I built this

18
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680
Because his story

19
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
And the way he tells it

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,056
Is delightful and funny and also eats

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
Truly inspiring account of

22
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Sticking with an idea

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
When the odds are stacked against you

24
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
So here it is

25
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Here's to Herb

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
And enjoy

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
You were basically introducing is really low fares were these Airlines trying to match your prices

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:09,376
Yes in some cases they were and we told the Republic of Texas that

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
You could fly at the lower fare but if you paid the higher Fair we would give you a free bottle of whiskey

30
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
And so for a couple months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
From NPR how I built this show about innovators

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movement they built

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
AOL

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Centric Texas lawyer turned a crazy idea into Southwest Airlines now one of the biggest

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
Airlines in the world

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,992
Could you could you to start by introducing yourself mr. Keller

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Naked herb if you would her

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
Please can you just say your full name

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
This is Herb

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Kelleher

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
And your best known as the

42
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Founder of Southwest Airlines

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
How how old are you now 85

44
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Okay great perfect

45
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
We are very excited to talk to you about

46
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,520
Dumpster jump in here for like two I mentioned that before we really started our interview

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
I need some time to just chat with her and I learned some interesting things about him like to eat for breakfast

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
Normally for breakfast I have

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Cheese crackers

50
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
And what he likes to drink

51
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Wild Turkey Bourbon

52
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,392
And that he's been a smoker for

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Pretty much his entire life

54
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,488
I just enjoyed the magical

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
Mystical Aroma On Site

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
I'll smoke

57
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
So how soon after you wake up do you have a

58
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
A cigarette

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Well it's

60
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,008
The nanosecond with your cheese crackers

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
In before buy cheese crackers

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
That were the story of how herb launched Southwest Airlines 50 years

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
66 to be exact

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Herb was a young lawyer

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
He's living in San Antonio Texas

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,976
He had started his own Law Firm helping clients to start companies

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,328
And one day one of her plants got and Rollin King

68
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Cosmo

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
Hey I heard of this Airline call Pacific Southwest

70
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
Flies only in California

71
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
And I have an idea it looks

72
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,312
Let's meet for a drink Rollin

73
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,152
Came to me with the idea of setting up a similar operation in text

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
And how soon after he sort of floated this idea

75
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
To you saying yep

76
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Let's do it let's start a company

77
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
It was a very short period of time

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Maybe you know

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Like a minute

80
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,072
No it was longer than that I was just joking

81
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
But was that a very short days within days

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Within days

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
What first I was very skeptic

84
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,336
But then I did some research and discovered that PSA was very successful in California

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
The Texas supplied all the requisites for an intrastate Airline

86
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,296
Because it was a big state that had large metropolitan areas

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
Far enough apart to justify flying

88
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,232
And so Houston Dallas and San Antonio where the obvious first Target

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,815
Because they were the three largest cities in Texas

90
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
What did you know about Airlines

91
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
Well I knew nothing about Airlines which I think made me eminently qualified

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
The start one

93
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
That because what we tried to do at Southwest was

94
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Get away from the traditional way that Airlines had done business

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
So I started with

96
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
The tabula rasa blank slate

97
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
And I think that was very helpful

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
So at this point in the how old are you by the way at that point in your life

99
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
I was 35

100
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,279
35 okay so you had on your family for children

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,887
Four children and you beat that the successful Law Firm by life was it with your life

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Profitable at that time

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
No it was not notably profit

104
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
As a matter of fact

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
Warren Buffett reportedly joked about it at one time and said

106
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
If a capitalist had shot down the Wright brothers

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
At Kitty Hawk in 1903

108
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
The economy would probably be better off

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
And so it didn't have very great returns

110
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
It was constantly

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
In difficulty

112
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Why did you

113
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
Even think that this was a plausible

114
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Idea

115
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
I think it was a real or

116
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Of doing something different

117
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
Doing something that was exciting

118
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
I really always have

119
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
Had a great deal of curiosity

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
And then I thought to myself what you know

121
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Mostly adults

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
The United States of America

123
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Haven't been able to fly because

124
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
The Court's power

125
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Is too expensive

126
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
It's too expensive for you they just thought it was business people on expense account

127
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
And so

128
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
What I'm saying is that

129
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
In terms of

130
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Market analysis

131
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
There was a huge untapped

132
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
Market for flying out there

133
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
Okay see you decide with Rollin to start a company was that right

134
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
DIY actually Incorporated in March of the 1960

135
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
7 but of course I was just a piece of paper

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
And we started to raise seed money to the extent of about $500,000

137
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
We were set to go

138
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
I am Warrior Competition like at the time of their other airlines

139
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,287
That we're doing these Texas life-like flight between Houston and Dallas and end each other place

140
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:41,151
Oh yeah they proved to be our biggest adversaries because they were not exactly

141
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:46,271
Warm welcoming and hospitable we didn't get kisses on both cheeks

142
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
When we announce

143
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
That we intend it to

144
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
Create an intrastate carrier sobran of continental and trans Texas

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
Slater Texas International

146
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Really took out after

147
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,887
And I get this involved in political fights and and fights in the court

148
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
And they just thought that they would

149
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Apply their incumbency

150
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
And their financial strength

151
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
To bleed Southwest Airlines to death before I could ever fly

152
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
They were suing Southwest Airlines

153
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
Direct what was the argument what why would they send you shouldn't Opera

154
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,903
Well you know the arguments that they made in court

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
We're actually all kind of specious

156
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
And this is one illustration of where

157
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
People attempt to use

158
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
To manipulate the governor

159
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
To prevent competition

160
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
That's what they were up to

161
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
So how long does it take you to fight these

162
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
These legal challenges

163
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
Well between the time when I start working

164
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,431
Informing Southwest and the time we flew our first flight

165
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
It was four and a half years

166
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Wow it took a little pertinacity

167
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Yeah

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
During that time

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,623
The company ran out of money

170
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
Add a 1969 the board of directors

171
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
Had a meeting and talked about shutting the airline down

172
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Shutting the company down

173
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
And I said well how about if

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Iloo gate

175
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
For nothing

176
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,263
And pay all the court costs out of my own pocket

177
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,615
Would you be willing to continue on to those circumstances and they said

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Osher

179
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
So happy

180
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
What was it motivated you to fight for

181
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
For 4 years

182
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
I want this Airline

183
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
First of all I was idealistic about

184
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
Because I figured if they can prevent

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Southwest Airline

186
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Some introducing

187
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
What Southwest Airlines proposes

188
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
To provide to

189
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
The consumer

190
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Then

191
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
That is

192
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Assign

193
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
That the free enterprise system is failing

194
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
And one of the things that motivated me was to

195
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Is that validate

196
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
The free enterprise system

197
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
And another one was

198
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Of course that's it was very hot competition and

199
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
I like to win

200
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
But what's up

201
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,767
Like what I don't get is it was such a huge gamble anyway because you you could have spent those four and a half years

202
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Fighting and then winning

203
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
And then Southwest Airlines might of fizzled out anyway

204
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
I'll tell you what guy you put your finger on something

205
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Because

206
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
If you had taken a poll in

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
In the state of Texas

208
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
After we filed our application

209
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
I can show you

210
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
The 99.9%

211
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
Of the population of the state of Texas

212
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
It's like this single never come to anything

213
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
I'm very serious about that several people told me that they said

214
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
They were glad to see

215
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,351
How how much the flight energize met in that I was enjoying it but herb don't get yourself it'll never make a dime

216
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,447
Did you ever get sad or depressed me how did you keep your spirits up

217
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Wild Turkey Hill

218
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,799
It may provide

219
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
Haggai it may provide a little boost

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
But frankly my spirits

221
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Just don't get down

222
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
I don't stress very easily

223
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
I'll give you an example only

224
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,927
They have stress classes at Southwest Airlines years ago many years ago

225
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
And up

226
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
They invited me to come over and speak

227
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
You know the fella that was running the classes

228
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
He said to the class who said we know

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Herb undergoes

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
A lot of stress all the time

231
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Hotel the class how do you handle it and I said

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
I don't have that I liked it

233
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,615
That was the last time I was asked back to the collapse

234
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
So

235
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
So you I mean what you were going in and out of courtroom

236
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
For 4 years

237
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
How are you making a living at that

238
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Well I'm still practicing law

239
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,231
I mean I was doing a lot of other things during that time which led to very long week

240
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
Walmart occasion I was in the law office

241
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
For two full days and

242
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,775
At the end of those two full days I've went home shaved and 1/2 a fundraising dinner for Southwest Airlines

243
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
But that's

244
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Scott of the

245
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
The perseverance that at the Mandan

246
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
To help get Southwest Airline started while still practicing law

247
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
I'm doing many other things

248
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
So what happened to the court with the with the Southwest

249
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
It went

250
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Through the United States

251
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Supreme Court

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
And through the Texas Supreme Court twice

253
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Before we could fly

254
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
And the Texas Supreme Court handed down

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
An order

256
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
19 hours prior to our first flight

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
When was that

258
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,847
Well that was a 19th June of 1971

259
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
We start flying on June 18th 1971

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
What was the flat where they go

261
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
The first flight

262
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
Went from Dallas to San Antonio

263
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
But the one that received all the publicity went from Dallas to Houston

264
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
And we were the underdog

265
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
Okay what sort of David vs the Goliath

266
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Seattle not just one but three of them

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,911
So there was a lot of news coverage about it and that's the reason people pay a lot of attention

268
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
2 is finally getting underway

269
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
At First Light by the way

270
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
No I wasn't I was busy work

271
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
To make sure there was a second flight

272
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
Do you remember that day that the first like to Goffin

273
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
Remember why you felt that you feel like

274
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Finally this is done

275
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,671
Oh it was wonderful. I'll tell you the experience I had

276
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
When the first airplane came in

277
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
It was over a in Fort Worth American Tanger

278
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
So I went over there and there's this airplay

279
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
After four and a half years

280
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
I would have stuck my head

281
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
In the back of one of the engines

282
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
And mechanic grab me

283
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,455
Hold me back and you said you realize that thrust reverser goes off

284
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
It will decapitate you and I said at this moment I don't give a damn

285
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
At this point Southwest Airlines

286
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Advertising it starts

287
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,423
Flying many Ripple with it was a flying more than one route was it flying multiple routes

288
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
What was Dallas Houston Houston San Antonio and San Antonio Dallas

289
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Do one of those legs

290
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,943
Well on some flights we had the fares as low as $10

291
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,039
Those we had theirs as low as 15 or $20

292
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
We were about

293
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
45% lower

294
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Then the other carriers

295
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
So how are you able to do that how are you able to charge

296
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
So much

297
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Such a lower fare than the other

298
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Airlines in Texas

299
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
At through enormous

300
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Productivity

301
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
But but how I mean I'm assuming you said a few planes

302
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
What we start out with

303
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
3

304
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
And then we got a fourth one

305
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
We had to get rid of one airplane in order to meet our payroll

306
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,015
Right after Southwest start flying and so

307
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
We decided

308
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,647
That we would fly a for airplane schedule with three airplane how you do that

309
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
Ten-minute turns at the gate

310
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
We bring that airplane in

311
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
+ 10 minutes after

312
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Stopped at the gate

313
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Ditto

314
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
It would be pushing back again

315
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
And we had airplanes that you never operating

316
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
12 hours a day sometimes so each one of those additional flights

317
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,199
Representative Revenue generation opportunity that the other carriers didn't have

318
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
Okay but even so I mean

319
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Those other carriers

320
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
Like braniff and Texas International right

321
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
They were charging

322
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
Much much higher fares and it couldn't

323
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Just been you turn to plans around faster

324
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
No it's a whole condo think you're right about that

325
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
I was just giving you an example

326
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,959
Out with the 10-minute turn because it's a vivid one

327
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
Addition to that they were by definition

328
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Monopolist

329
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
They had been under 40 years

330
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
Federal government supervision through the c a b

331
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
That the Civil Aeronautics board

332
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Yes right

333
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,135
And during that time if they had a little thing Angel problem

334
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,463
Of the cab would just give them a fair increase

335
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
I hope so

336
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
That's how their fares got so high

337
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
As compared to what we were doing

338
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Since we were regulated by the caap

339
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,031
Okay so you weren't regulated in the same way but what were you doing other things like

340
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Paying your employees less

341
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,663
Well it dependent initially we were paying them less

342
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
As the years went on

343
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
We were paying them or their total compensation

344
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
I was superior to the other carriers and in addition

345
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,695
When we turned our first very slim profit in 1973

346
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
We set up the first

347
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Profit sharing plan

348
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
In the American airline industry

349
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,703
And I think they made a profit of I don't know a hundred thousand dollars that year or something like that

350
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
But that would alter course

351
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Stupor billions

352
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Enter employees pockets

353
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
And your employees were

354
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Were you nice as well

355
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Yeah we were the most heavily unionized

356
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Carrier in the United States

357
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
Are low-cost were not due to being a non-union carrier

358
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Since we were

359
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
More unionized than our competitors were

360
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
You were basically introducing these really low fares

361
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Woody's Airlines trying to match your prices

362
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
Yes in some cases they were

363
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,495
There's no question about that so matter-of-fact braniff at one point

364
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
Put in a lower fare than ours

365
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,943
What's it called an introductory Thayer course they've been serving Texas you know for 40 years by that time

366
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,527
But if any of that one of the things that came out of that was

367
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
We maintained our full fares

368
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Add we told the Republic of Texas

369
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
If you paid the higher fare

370
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
We would give you a free bottle of whiskey

371
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,399
And so for a couple of months we became the largest liquor distributor in the state of Texas

372
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
To her about flying at that time is like a madman

373
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Let me know

374
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Tumblers with

375
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Skyauction

376
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,295
Glamorous experience with Southwest was competing on price mean you will not

377
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
You were not doing in fly cocktails

378
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
Like what do people think of your service versus competition

379
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
God I got a story to tell you on that

380
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
It was Thanksgiving of 1971 remember we've been in business since June

381
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Yep

382
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
And my sister-in-law

383
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,983
A delightful lady called me mine Law Office in

384
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
And she said her butt

385
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
She said I just flew from Houston to San Antonio on Southwest Airlines

386
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
I've traveled most of the world's Airlines which was true

387
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
You know she was a world Traveler

388
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
And she said I know you're going to be a big success

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,207
You got the best in-flight service that I have ever experienced on any Airline

390
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
And I said

391
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,863
Am I glad to hear that how many passengers were on the airplane

392
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,983
She said just me

393
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
In just a minute Southwest goes National and Herb convinces Travelers at Airlines

394
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
Do not have to serve in-flight meals

395
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,807
I'm gyros near listening to how I built this from NPR

396
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
It's how I built this from NPR

397
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
And I Rise

398
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
1970s Southwest Airlines

399
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,471
They still only fly within the state of Texas

400
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
In 1978

401
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
Something really important happen

402
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,919
Congress decides to completely deregulate the airline industry

403
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
And for Southwest Airlines

404
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
That means

405
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
They can now start flying to new cities

406
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Outside of Texas

407
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Herb At this point you Southwest is expanding and your competitors are no longer just Texas airlines you're competing

408
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
American Inn

409
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
And and and Pan Am and TWA rightly National major International carriers start to become your competitor

410
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,823
Were people skeptical that Southwest would be able to compete in

411
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
In the big leagues

412
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Oh yes

413
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,247
We were described as a Texas Airline that could only be successful in

414
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
The state of Texas

415
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Okay

416
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
And then we were described as a

417
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Sunbelt

418
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Airline

419
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
They could not be successful outside

420
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
The Sunbelt

421
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
There was a

422
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Press conference for winning the Baltimore

423
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Where were the reporters there said that

424
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,263
Waiting on mr. Larry said I know you've been very successful out west but

425
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Now you're coming to the east

426
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
The most competitive

427
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
Part of the country as far as Airline Services concern

428
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,039
And I said yeah it's so competitive that when we start out here

429
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,367
We're reducing your existing fares by 60%

430
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
How competitive does that sound at that time

431
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
Were you guys already serve No Frills

432
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,351
What we were no frills we're in the sense that we were short haul

433
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
And I got it

434
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
Restrict what you can do you have relatively short flight till like peanuts

435
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
Some drinks exactly and then pretzels

436
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
That sort of thing but you know

437
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
When we start flying long haul lights

438
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
From San Antonio to Los Angeles

439
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Where to press conference

440
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Email to announce new service

441
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
And

442
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
One of the

443
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Reporters there said

444
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
What are you going to serve

445
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
Meals on those flights and I said no we're not

446
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
We're going to charge you $400 less

447
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Bertram

448
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Right

449
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,935
And I understand you can get a pretty good sandwich at Jason's for $400

450
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,287
So when I would point is you give up your life actor

451
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
Actually that was at the request the board of directors in 1981

452
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,991
Can you were still you still had your own law practice that you were doing other work for

453
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,295
Throughout the entire 1970s

454
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Oh yes yeah

455
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
And I'll tell you the truth you know I didn't really hang her

456
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Doobie

457
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
For corporate life

458
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Because

459
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,839
Little boys have a lot more freedom to do their own thing when and where they want to

460
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,703
But we hired a very excellent fellow named Lamar Muse who was a real battler

461
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
To get the company off the ground in operation

462
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
He had substantial Airline experience

463
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Bad. He did a wonderful job

464
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,991
And so you don't find me a 1981 we lost

465
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Successor to Lamar

466
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
And the board director said to me you've got to do it and it did you want to do it I felt I had to do it

467
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,512
And I'll tell you why because the start of the 1980s

468
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,096
You had unemployment of 10.8%

469
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
You had a double-dip recession

470
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,984
You had the air traffic controllers strike

471
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
Then Lamar Muse the guy we had to get the cut me off the ground he launched a competitor against just gold

472
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
Muser

473
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Southwest Engine lost a competitor

474
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,320
Yep that's 3 years after he left gold Muse there

475
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
Well I thought it was some Modern modest on his part

476
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,000
But because he called him user after himself

477
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,400
But where you at where you like what are you doing I mean we work together all these years

478
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
We bought him later

479
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Can you buy some later

480
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
Yeah when they're on the verge of bankruptcy

481
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
We bought these are

482
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
But it was there

483
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
In 1981

484
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,248
So I figured I'd better do what the board asked me to do

485
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
And come to Southwest Airlines

486
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Full-time

487
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,160
Was making money at the time

488
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Yes

489
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
We've been profitable every single year

490
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,816
For 43 years I guess now

491
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
You must be the other airlines crazy because they were

492
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
A lot of them have had good years and bad ear

493
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
But it seems like Southwest is just

494
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Has never had a

495
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Bad here

496
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Well we've had years when

497
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
You know earnings were down

498
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,504
But we've never had a loss for a full year since 1970

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Me too

500
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
And we never followed an employee at Southwest Airlines when the rest of the industry during that. Up until

501
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Has probably furloughed I don't know

502
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
A million-and-a-half employees

503
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Throughout the world

504
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Basically

505
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
We

506
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,448
Look at history and said this is a very dicey business to be a

507
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Delta Airline business

508
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Yeah

509
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,384
So we may be flamboyant from the marketing standpoint but we're going to be very conservative from the fiscal

510
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Go stand for

511
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
And

512
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Light

513
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Established

514
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Arul song

515
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,600
That we're going to pay 80% of the cost

516
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,672
List of all brand new airplanes from internally generated funds

517
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,000
And actually wound up paying 100%

518
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Promotional airplane

519
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
So we had

520
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
The largest percentage

521
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
In our Fleet of owned airplane

522
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
Of any carrier of any size

523
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
So so

524
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
What does that mean

525
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Well I mean

526
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
You're not taking on that

527
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
Right when you do that

528
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
So when you get into bedtime

529
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
You're not threatened by the deck payments

530
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,320
Which is put cameras into bankruptcy and out of bankruptcy and back into bankruptcy you know for

531
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
35 years

532
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,464
You heard from from the outside from listen to stories

533
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
The airline industry

534
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Seems so

535
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,632
Brutalight is it do you think it's more Savage than than other Industries

536
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
I think

537
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
That it's more competitive than other Indus

538
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Mysteries

539
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,824
And one of the reasons for that is

540
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
That our principal Capital assets

541
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
Airplanes

542
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
Moovit 540 miles an hour

543
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Yeah

544
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
And you know if you have a shoe factory

545
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
The fails in Seattle as an example

546
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
You can't

547
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
Within hours transport that chew Factory 2

548
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Chattanooga Tennessee

549
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
To compete there

550
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
But if

551
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
You're Seattle Air Serv

552
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Versailles you can have your airplanes

553
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
In San Antonio or Chattanooga

554
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Within a matter of hours so

555
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,080
The very mobility of your Capital assets

556
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Breeds a lot of competition

557
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:53,504
Did you like that competition. Did you like being an airline CEO and

558
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Imagine all that stuff

559
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Was it fun for you

560
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Well I have to adapt myself

561
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
Yeah I love being with the people at Southwest Airlines

562
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,976
That was like a fountain of youth

563
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
For me

564
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
They were so wonderful and entertaining and

565
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Ghetto

566
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
Great to be with

567
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
That part of it but

568
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
When your pricing lawyer pretty much

569
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Do Your Own Thing

570
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
And

571
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
It's a swift Pace wealth

572
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
Things to move as swiftly at first

573
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
What I came to Southwest Airlines full-time and

574
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
We're moving swiftly compared to the rest of the

575
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
Airline industry

576
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
But not compared to my experience

577
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,256
Were you pushing for expansion and growth and all those things during your tenure

578
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
Oh yes I mean Southwest Airlines expanded enormously

579
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
You know something very small base

580
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
But I soon realized

581
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
It was a speech

582
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
That I want to hear

583
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,408
Where a guru said if you can improve a corporation 5% in a year if that's a miracle

584
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
Oh okay I was trying to do 25

585
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
Maybe that's why I feel a little frustrated

586
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,952
So it really brought my thinking you know more in line

587
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
You know I'm taking

588
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Even if it might have seemed like it

589
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
Play a slow process for you

590
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
The fact that Southwest was growing and

591
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,240
Can Prevail in this industry is is pretty remarkable as pretty unbelievable

592
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,896
Given that you know so many of those early competitors don't even exist anymore and some of the great iconic Airlines

593
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
TWA Pan Am

594
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Exactly many other

595
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
There are very few left

596
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
What mistakes did they make that you seem not to have made

597
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
Well

598
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
We just did things

599
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Differently

600
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Like market share

601
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
You know is shibboleth

602
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Supposed

603
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
I told anybody I say

604
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,680
Mention market share I'd punch him in the nose

605
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,848
Because here all these big companies fighting over their market share and losing money and following employee yeah

606
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
Let's focus on profitability

607
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,040
And if we have 4% of the market were profitable that's better than having 94

608
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
Percent of a market and being unprofitable

609
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
What's the value of Southwest

610
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Overall

611
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh

612
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Probably

613
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
20 billion dollar something like that

614
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
One of the biggest

615
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Airlines in the United

616
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
At in the world

617
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
In terms of passengers

618
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Sunbelievable

619
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah

620
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
It really is

621
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
It's like I've had too much Wild Turkey

622
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
Fantasizing

623
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Weather when you started the company

624
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
How much how much did you invest

625
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Personally

626
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
I invested $10,000 which must be worth

627
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Quite a bit today

628
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
Imagine if will is going up some

629
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Since then

630
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
But

631
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
That's a company

632
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
That's what I thought was

633
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Requirement

634
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
Of good leadership

635
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
I was turned down pay increases

636
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Bonus increase

637
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
To set a good example

638
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
I thought for all of our people

639
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
Corsa stock that I got

640
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
Rose enormously in value but that was in lieu of

641
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Cash compensation

642
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
She will be mainly Cade with Woodstock

643
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,696
Yeah basically was socket I got to do is kick out just to give an Exemplar

644
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
When I did

645
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
The stock option deal

646
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,328
In lieu of pay raises for their pilot so they could Southwest Airlines

647
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Stock up

648
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
In lieu of a pay increase

649
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
I took no pay increase

650
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Along with them

651
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
I'm not trying to single anybody out but

652
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
There was a

653
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,224
The head of an airline that was smaller than Southwest Airlines and on the verge of going out of business

654
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,600
Do salary and bonus for three times what mine were at Southwest Airlines and that's the way I wanted

655
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,232
Are you from worried that some me know some young you know

656
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Herb Keller type

657
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,352
Characters going to come around and put up some upstart Airline and knock Southwest office

658
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
You concerned about it all the time

659
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
I wrote a letter to her employees

660
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
And

661
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:04,128
It was about my 10 for most concerns for the next decade of Southwest Airlines okay yeah

662
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
And

663
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Number one

664
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Was us

665
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
That we ignore competition

666
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
That we get complacent

667
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
That way

668
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
Get cocky

669
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208
And I use the line thinks Mullinax volume will get bigger

670
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,024
Think they can act big and will get smaller

671
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
So could happen one day

672
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
So it's possible

673
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
You know I'm up

674
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
History buff

675
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,728
And if you look at the largest companies

676
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
And United States

677
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,080
As the 19th century turned into the 20th

678
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
Most of them are gone

679
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
The central leather company

680
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
+ 1900 + 1901

681
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,320
Was the 17th largest company in the United States

682
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
But it didn't anticipate

683
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
What the Advent of the Ford automobile

684
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
Was going to me

685
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
You know what it did

686
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
It made buggy whips and saddles

687
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
And never stop doing it until it was gone

688
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
And if you look at countries

689
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Boys look at companies

690
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
They perish

691
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
If you have any sense of History

692
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,456
You realize that and you don't try to avoid it

693
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,576
You're hearing the story of how you made this happen and all the work you put into it

694
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
I wonder if you think your

695
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Just wired differently

696
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
To be able to

697
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
Put up with all that stuff for so many years

698
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Well I said yeah I probably am wired a little bit

699
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,424
For many people and they're probably very happy about that difference themselves

700
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
One of the things is that

701
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
I never look back

702
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
You know I don't spend a lot of time regretting things

703
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
It went wrong

704
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
And furthermore

705
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
I think

706
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,248
I've always had a great deal of fun

707
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Out of what I was doing

708
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
And you know

709
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
People would say to me why don't you why don't you burned out

710
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
Yeah you know I was working 100 hours a week

711
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304
Love Land Rover simplywell is easy

712
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,168
When you have a passionate joy and what you're doing you don't burn out

713
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
Herb Kelleher co-founded Southwest Airlines 50 years ago

714
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,408
And he served as CEO and then on the board

715
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
Before retiring in 2008

716
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,112
Featherweight herb Kelleher once resolved a trademark dispute with a rival airline are both using the slogan

717
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Planesmart

718
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
He was all this not in court

719
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,536
But the challenging the other CEO to a public arm wrestling match

720
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Which herb Kelleher lost

721
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,400
You can see that entire arm wrestling match

722
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
Just go to Google and type in the malice in Dallas

723
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,504
Thanks to our 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor
