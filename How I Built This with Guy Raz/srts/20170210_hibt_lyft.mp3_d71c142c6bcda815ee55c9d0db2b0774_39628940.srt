1
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:09,728
One of the kind of funny things we had to figure out was how to quickly Market to

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,568
The college campus whatever early purchases was

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
A frog and beaver costume that we

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,528
Put on I went to Cornell I was actually going to Cornell on a recruiting trip for Lehman

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
And I was standing on the quad in this ridiculous costume handing out cards about

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,512
Is carpooling service to say frog costume and beaver costume

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
I was the beaver

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,144
At the next day at the Lehman recruiting event

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
A girl came up to me and said

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,360
I see you in a in a beaver costume yesterday

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Running PR it's how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealist

12
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
Stories behind the movement

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Verizon on Today Show mermaid private cars work like taxis and in the process

14
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,496
Help build a service hours billion

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
Rick astley remember the days

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
Walking on

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Onto the sidewalk

18
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Your hand and

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Healing a

20
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Taxi

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
I mean

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
It feels like ancient history

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
But still

24
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
Even though this world of instant

25
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Car rides

26
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Just a few years old

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
We're so used to it that

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
If you like me

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
You start to get really antsy and anxious when the Uber or Lyft app says you have to wait for 3 minutes for your ride and just think

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
About how quickly ride sharing apps like uber Lyft

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,664
Totally transformed transportation in many cities around the world have

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
In most places

33
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
They've become indispensable which has also meant that

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
The competition between the two companies

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Has been really Fierce since 2012 when both of them launched the service

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,096
It turned private cars into public taxis but the amazing thing is is

37
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
Even though Lyft is just a fraction the size of uber

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
It is still valued at more than 5

39
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Billion dollars

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
And one of the guys behind it

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
John Zimmer

42
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,968
He never thought that ride-sharing would be his life's work he actually studies Hotel manager

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
At Cornell

44
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
What is interest

45
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,832
Really started to change during his senior year

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,208
I took a course that was really really important to me called Green cities

47
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
I have this amazing professor

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,096
His first lecture is the history of the world in 30 minutes kind of like

49
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
The book Guns Germs and Steel

50
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,008
And he ended the lecture saying that we're at a really important time in world history

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,640
Where population density is rising rapidly in our cities as more and more people move there

52
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
And resources

53
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
And infrastructures

54
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
That were built decades ago are becoming more and more strength

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,624
And he kind of challenges the end of the class instead

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
If you don't make this class most

57
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Important thing you

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Then I don't want to

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Because if we don't fix this

60
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
These problems

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
We're going to have major economic

62
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Environmental

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
And social problem

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
And that kind of set me on a path

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Which eventually led to lift

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
But being that I grew up

67
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
In the east coast and

68
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Connecticut in New York

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
I did feel like I had to have a financing

70
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Experience in Seoul

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
After graduating I went and worked at Lehman Brothers

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Hi in mm

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Wow

74
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Lehman Brothers

75
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
2006

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Like when we look back on that

77
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Roof

78
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,328
It was like a yeah you know the decline and fall right there so you go to Lehman Brothers

79
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
In 2006 What will what did you do there

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Samsung real estate Finance

81
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
So I was right in the heart of where everything happened

82
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
And as you said right at that moment

83
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
From 2000s

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
2008 was my 2-year analyst

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Was it

86
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Interesting

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
It was interesting for a few months but I got to say I

88
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
My interests

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
Declined probably after just about a year

90
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
And so I started thinking

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
What what else I could do

92
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
And it was actually about

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
About a year into it that I was on Facebook one night

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
And

95
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Saw

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Logan who is now my co-founder who I didn't know at the time

97
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Posted

98
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,239
On a mutual friend's Facebook page saying that he was starting a website

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Call Zimmer

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
And what like what

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Was it worth it

102
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
What's his story

103
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
So Logan's background is that

104
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
He grew up in LA

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Hitting traffic

106
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,575
He then went to UC Santa Barbara and made an experiment of himself so he can bring a car to school

107
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
And wanted to see how he could

108
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Survive without a car

109
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
And he started a car sharing program similar to Zipcar first

110
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Using University fleet vehicles

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
And he got the attention of the local transit for

112
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
The local Transit board

113
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,007
Elected him as the youngest member ever to be on this Transit boarding at Logan

114
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
In Santa Barbara

115
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
In Santa Barbara

116
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
And he quickly grew to realize

117
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
The challenges

118
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
In public

119
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Rotation and Encanto

120
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
The conclusion that

121
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Across the country

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,343
When you pay to get on the bus you really only covering about 30% of the operating

123
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
So what that means is that $3 bus for actually cost the government

124
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Tent

125
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
And as the lines get more busy

126
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
They get harder to fund

127
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
And harder to add service

128
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
Actually

129
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
The more busy they got the worst

130
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
So he came to the conclusion that public transit

131
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Rotation was broken

132
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
And while the promise of public transit

133
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Phenomenal

134
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
The reality

135
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
It was not and so

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Eden travel to

137
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Zimbabwe

138
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Where he saw people

139
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Sharing rides out of

140
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Necessity

141
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
And got inspired to build

142
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Website

143
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
That would connect

144
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
People going the same way

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Terapia able to sell a seat

146
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
In their car

147
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
And that's why he called the web

148
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
After Zimbabwe

149
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Yeah

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,751
So basically trying to build a website

151
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Like that was like

152
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
Hey I'm going this way I look

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Car sharing website

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
What used to be the you just advertise online

155
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Craigslist or

156
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
Put on a pinboard in

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Like on college campuses

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Saying driving from you know

159
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
LA to San Francisco

160
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Do you need a ride

161
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
But he was basic

162
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Take a concept and put it on

163
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Exactly

164
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Like you said we had these

165
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,119
Physical bulletin boards or digital bulletin boards

166
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Four people going along the

167
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
The same way if they're going home

168
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Spring break

169
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Fall break

170
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
But there was no identity

171
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
Or ratings behind that and so it was limited in how many

172
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
How many people actually

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
And so we thought how can we make a safe

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
And

175
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
You tied something

176
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Like Facebook

177
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
You can have a profile of the individual organ

178
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Going to share ride with

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
And follow up with ratings

180
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Of

181
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Of how that right

182
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Experience was

183
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
At which would create a safer and more broadly used

184
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
Environment for for carpooling on College

185
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
So what happens to you guys then look at this stage

186
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
You and Logan still have met right so do you email him or

187
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Call Amber what

188
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
So we got on a

189
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,431
Call I believe in and he said that he was actually going to be

190
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
In New York City

191
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
In a few weeks

192
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
And so we ended up meeting up

193
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
And talking a lot about about carpooling and

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
And I shared

195
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
Some of the thoughts that I had from that course I took

196
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Cornell we realized that we were both

197
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
So passionate

198
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
About solving the same problem

199
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
And and began working together right after that trip in New York

200
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Did you end did you guys just hit it off right away you like each other

201
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah

202
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,055
Yeah where he's become my best friend he was

203
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Best man in my wedding

204
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
He's also very

205
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Focused

206
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Common thought

207
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Apple person

208
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
It's funny story when he was

209
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Is a kid I think he was about

210
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
8 years old

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
His parents had

212
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
I just got in the TV

213
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
And

214
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
I guess a few weeks later he said

215
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
He asked his parents to remove the TV

216
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
From the house be

217
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Distracting

218
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
So I think that just speaks to his

219
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
His level of focus and

220
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
I really enjoyed

221
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
That working with him because of that that book passion

222
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Focus and helpful

223
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,943
Okay so you guys start working on zimride together

224
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
You're still at Liam Brothers right

225
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
And what was what was Logan doing at this point

226
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
So

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
He's at UC Santa Barbara to sustainability

228
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
Dechlorinator after he's graduated

229
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
He's working on zimride as a side pot

230
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Project TX

231
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
We did

232
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
A lot of the original

233
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Coding of the website

234
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
And

235
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
We didn't know whether

236
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
It was a

237
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Big business we thought it

238
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
Should be back before we were going to jump all the way and we wanted

239
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
To start working on

240
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Do we spend

241
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
At nights and weekends

242
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Working on

243
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Zimride

244
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
Just like remotely you were in New York and he was in Santa Barbara and you were just

245
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Emailing in like

246
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Skyping and stuff all the time

247
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Yeah yeah we have

248
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Late night sky band

249
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Every maybe month or two

250
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
We try to get together

251
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Logan's on he's working on building the website on my end I'm figuring out how do we get enough people using the pie

252
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Heartworm

253
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
So that it works it was really like a chicken or egg problem

254
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Where

255
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
The idea

256
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
I'm having a lot of seats

257
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Statues from on your way home

258
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
Say Cornell and UPS

259
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,735
State New York to go to New York City was exciting

260
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Yeah there is

261
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Very few bus routes

262
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Not everyone on the car

263
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Or had a car on campus and so

264
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
If I could go on

265
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Zimride Cornell

266
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
And bias eating someone else's

267
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Is car for $20 or

268
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
$30

269
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
That would be really exciting

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
But it had to be there had to be available we had to

271
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Decorate both sides of the

272
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
The marketplace

273
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
So the idea was

274
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
Like, like that how Facebook originally launched which was

275
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
You would just have these

276
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Sights at University so students could figure out

277
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Do they can eat dried with

278
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Exactly and so

279
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
One of the

280
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Kind of funny things we had to figure out was

281
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
This was how to quickly

282
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Market

283
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
To the college campus

284
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
This is kind of strange we wanted to put on

285
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Costumes on campus

286
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
And hand out information about this service

287
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Whatever early purchases was

288
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
A frog and beaver costume

289
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
That we

290
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,055
Put on I went to Cornell I was actually going to Cornell

291
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
On a recruiting trip for Lehman

292
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
But I went a few days early

293
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
And

294
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
I was standing on the quad

295
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:34,623
In this ridiculous costume handing out cards about this carpal and service costumers Beaver cast

296
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
I was the beaver

297
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Yeah like handing out flyers

298
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Yasso

299
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
We needed to get a critical mass

300
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
Table called a thousand people

301
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,007
The offering their seat so that those that went on to look for a seat could find one and it worked

302
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
And

303
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
At the next day at the Lehman recruiting event a girl came up to me while I was surrounded by a lot of

304
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
Managing directors and set

305
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
I see you in a in a beaver costume yesterday

306
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
You know the next step was

307
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
Let's sell a private Network

308
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
To the various universities

309
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
And that we were able to over

310
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
A few year. Cell to 150 universities

311
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Companies that would pay us

312
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
An annual fee for this private key

313
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Cartoon Network

314
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
So you were.

315
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
You weren't taking a cut off the

316
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
I got the feeling that people would charge

317
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Share ride

318
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Accurate

319
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Not at not at that time

320
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
YouTube the business model was a cell this University is like

321
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Subscription model

322
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,511
You were personally calling universities and pitching us to them

323
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,863
Yeah so I was personally calling and traveling to

324
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Probably visited hundreds of universities

325
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
And in those first few years how did you do this

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
In the beginning and work at Lehman Brothers

327
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Actual time

328
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
In the first year it was more about getting the product stood up and having a proofpoint

329
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Not being kind of Cornell and so

330
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
The majority

331
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,903
Virtually all of those sales came once once I went full-time

332
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
In 2008

333
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
You would like to know it

334
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Imma do that smile Evelyn

335
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Yes it was

336
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
Early 2008 and it made the decision and

337
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
At my best friend's mother actually worked in the same building as me

338
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
How when I was at Lehman Brothers

339
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,847
I told her what I wanted to do and she said how could you leave a Shore thing like Lehman

340
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
To do a crazy carpets.

341
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,247
How many people send it to you by the way you're leaving Lehman Brothers

342
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
Yeah 2008

343
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
To go do something

344
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
Yes at several people said that to me and

345
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
And then three months later Lehman was bankrupt

346
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
We knew that there were

347
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
Challenges going on at Lehman but I could not have predicted that

348
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
3 months later

349
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
That they would have been bankrupt

350
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
So you moved

351
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
To Silicon Valley Inn

352
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
In 2008 to go full-time

353
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
I'm zimride with Logan green

354
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Yes

355
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Did zimride get become profitable

356
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Yep

357
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Play computery profitable or respect

358
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
I'd say respectively profit

359
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
It was a pretty robust company in

360
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Did you see this as

361
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,535
This was going to be your thing this is what you were going to do with your life

362
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,423
Yeah I mean the dream was to start a business that had a major

363
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,543
An important impact on our world and specifically on the way that our cities are designed

364
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
And so

365
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
You know I think from an early. We consider this

366
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Our life's work

367
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,783
When you were going to basically transform carpal you were going to do

368
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
For carpooling Circle Airbnb stand for

369
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Accommodation

370
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
Exactly

371
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,583
So what happened how did you shift from like this concept of carpooling to

372
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
What would eventually become

373
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Lyft

374
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
So in the middle of 2012

375
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
It's like four years in now

376
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Yeah but four years of doing it

377
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Full time

378
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
And

379
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,151
And we stop and look at ourselves and say

380
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
How are things going

381
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
And what would we do

382
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
If we were starting over

383
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
I think that's a really helpful exercise

384
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
End

385
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
What was true

386
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
In 2012 that was not true

387
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
When we started was the proliferation

388
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Smartphones

389
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
And operating

390
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
That would enable more

391
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Short-term planning

392
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
In short distance

393
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
It was him ride you had to go on a website and

394
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Find the date on a person going right and you had to

395
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
So do it I guess

396
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
At least a day in advance

397
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,551
Exactly so once the technology shifted that would enable more insta

398
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Decision-making to happen

399
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Are our thought process

400
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
And

401
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
You guys start to think maybe we should focus on something else

402
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Yeso

403
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Weird scene

404
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Uber had started

405
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Limos on demand

406
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Black

407
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Yeah and we said you know that's

408
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Interesting from a

409
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
You know using

410
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Cheetah mobile technology

411
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
But it wasn't that interesting to us from

412
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
You're picking

413
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
In a small population

414
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
People that cannot

415
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Or right

416
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Have a private driver.

417
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
Because you're it was like a fleet service

418
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
The beginning it was just

419
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
These black cars

420
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
It was Sunday

421
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Yeso

422
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
The average American household spend

423
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Over $9,000

424
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Every year on owning and operating

425
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Car

426
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Equate silver

427
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
2 trillion dollars annually

428
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
In the US

429
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
In the car sits part 96

430
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
6% of the time

431
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
And so he said

432
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
How could we

433
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Take these

434
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Personal vehicle

435
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,175
That are parked at all time

436
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
And expensive

437
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
To their owners

438
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
And make better use of

439
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And and so the idea was

440
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
To create an app

441
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Where you could

442
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
You could request

443
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Someone's personal vehicle

444
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
On demand

445
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
Put the platform really at that point was just

446
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
Hey I have a car sitting here and I'm going to make it available to kind of rent out for an hour

447
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
No it was

448
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
Hey I have a car and I have time

449
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,895
And I'm going to go drive other people around Cry 4 for payment

450
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
And it goes back to kind of

451
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,759
My Hospitality experience of how do we create something

452
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,367
That was centered around service about treating driver and passenger with respect

453
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,743
But I'll see you got to remember what is now accepted as normal getting into someone else's vehicle

454
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Was not at all nor

455
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Right back

456
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
We had to

457
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Work to

458
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Change people's

459
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Behavior and

460
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
In the early days suggest

461
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
People sit up front

462
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
And trading this

463
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
Your friend with a car hot hospice

464
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Fatality environment

465
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
We felt that one it opened

466
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
The audience to a larger set

467
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Of drivers

468
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
And if you go in a room of our

469
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
A hundred of our friends and you ask how many of you are willing to

470
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
To drive a taxi

471
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
A couple hands

472
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Maybe go up

473
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
When you say how many of you are willing to share a ride

474
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
You know 75

475
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Hands would go up

476
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
And so

477
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
We wanted to create.

478
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
The Experience around that

479
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Not because after

480
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Many many years

481
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Of being

482
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Tina told not to

483
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
And many many years

484
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
Of seeing a yellow vehicle

485
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
And thinking that that is safe

486
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Yellow

487
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
We had a lot of

488
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
In a behavior change to the kind of push through

489
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
John Zimmer co-founder of Lyft after the break of the State of California

490
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Killed his company

491

Show

530
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
It's how I built this

531
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
From NPR

532
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
A guy Roz

533
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
So it's 2012 and John Logan we're still working on this carpool concept called the zimride and they were doing pretty

534
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,967
Welded pitched a bunch of investors in Silicon Valley they got some money

535
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,087
But around the time they decided to change course and focus on other ways

536
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
They can make car sharing accessible to Millions

537
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Basically an early version of what

538
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Eventually

539
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Hollywood become live

540
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
But before they could really launch the app

541
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
They needed

542
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Test it out so

543
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
I got in touch with him

544
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Drivers

545
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,263
So the first set of of drivers we actually

546
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Emailed a bunch of zimride

547
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Users

548
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
And

549
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
That we said hey we have this new project we're trying out

550
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
And that we love you to try it out

551
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Then we invited them over to the office and walked

552
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
True kind of the whole

553
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Experience

554
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,975
That that we were in San Francisco area

555
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Yes

556
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
And what did you tell him to do today

557
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
I drive around the city

558
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,167
Well we we first got to walk through howdy

559
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
Hopworks are all the safety standards that we had

560
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
And we let them know that

561
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
What what's going to happen is that you're going to get a request

562
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
On your phone and it's going to let you know where that that passenger is

563
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,991
That they could go pick up that passenger

564
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
And then take them where they needed

565
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
And that the Apple kind of help help them

566
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Navigate

567
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
And do do all those

568
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Pick-up and drop-off

569
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
And at the time

570
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,279
There was a suggested donation at the end of the ride

571
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
That the passenger can make

572
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
Through their credit card that was a

573
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Attached to their profile

574
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Going to be

575
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Free if you want

576
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
To be free

577
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
It was an early days you got to remember again one that this was

578
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Was very very

579
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
New in and not normal and

580
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,479
United was fault would fall in a regulatory gray area

581
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
And so one of the ways

582
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
That we we we saw around that was to say

583
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
How to make it optional for payment in the early days until we had

584
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
@ford through

585
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
The the right regulatory structure

586
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
At what point did you come up with that

587
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Set a new name when did it go from

588
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Something called zimride to

589
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
Before we launched it

590
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
At the working title was in Wright insta

591
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
But while going through

592
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
It's actually really

593
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
3 week. That the

594
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Lyft app the original Lyft app was built

595
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Very very fat now

596
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
And the brand lift

597
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
Was thought of during that period as well along with

598
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
The logo and everything

599
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Thanks

600
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
Yeah except you couldn't get LIF

601
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
That was probably take

602
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
Yeah lafc.com is owned by Otis Elevator

603
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
Okay fair enough

604
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
So you got lym

605
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
Yeah in the middle of 2012

606
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Again over 3 weeks.

607
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
The team moved incredibly fast to

608
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Build the app

609
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Come up with the branding

610
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
And meat

611
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
And background check and I'm bored

612
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,808
The first set of drivers and then we then we invited a few friends and

613
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,928
It was that we got an incredible response to this is only in San Francisco at this point right

614
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Yes

615
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
How long did it take before

616
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
You know you open this up you made this into a decimal

617
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
Anybody could use

618
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
Since it was probably dead the second half of 2012

619
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Where are we

620
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
It started to take off

621
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
We started to divert resources from zimride over to lift and I'm really in in January of twenty

622
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
13

623
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
We said

624
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
Okay we need to go all in

625
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
This is

626
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
A massive opportunity

627
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,648
This has been incredibly successful

628
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
With a small amount of focus

629
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
But that was a really

630
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
In many ways a tough moment because we had worked

631
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
4

632
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
You're for five years on zimride

633
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
And we were deciding to divert all of our attention

634
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
To an entirely new model see you guys

635
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Sold

636
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,896
Exactly so we sold them right to Enterprise Rent-A-Car

637
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
And basically did the assets

638
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
Add a contract with the universities

639
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
And retained the entire team

640
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
And went all-in on unless

641
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
So that first-year how many people downloaded the app

642
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Best gas tens of thousands

643
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,328
And you guys are your model as you were taking a cut out of every

644
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Right right

645
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
Today the rate is calculated

646
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
FaceTime

647
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Distance and time

648
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
And then lift I received

649
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
A commission off of that weather

650
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
20 to 25%

651
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
I offer the overall rate the rest goes to the driver

652
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
As well as a

653
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
I trust and service fee

654
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
So when you start this right

655
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
Did you I mean it now we look back and say oh yeah

656
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
Course is going to work but presumably like you started

657
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Face a lot of backlash

658
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Obstacles

659
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Some cities that had

660
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Pretty entrenched

661
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
Taxicab commissions and drivers and

662
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Established

663
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
Regulations about who can pick people up and drive them for money

664
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Yasso

665
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
About a month into launching left this was

666
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Later

667
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
At 2012

668
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
Received our first of many cease and desist

669
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
Not from various different governments

670
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
And

671
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
It basically said you need to stop by

672
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
And what did you do

673
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Do we read the letter and then we had already done our

674
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Like working

675
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,864
Research on the laws and and we asked for a meeting

676
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,960
I think I was followed by a second season to Sis but we eventually got

677
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
I'm eating

678
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,056
With with who with a Public Utilities Commission

679
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
Okay and our approach to regulations is to to really understand

680
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
The motivations and the needs of

681
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
Of the regulating entity

682
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,296
Because we understand they have a very important job

683
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
And we went in and asked that we said he looked

684
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Is this a matter in a public safety

685
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
Or is this about you know existing Industries

686
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,888
Anderson Public Safety of course until we said we don't own Vehicles we don't have employees driving for us

687
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
So we don't fall into

688
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,728
The category that you currently have

689
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
But we've looked at your safety regulation since that's the most important

690
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Important thing

691
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
And

692
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
We've gone above and beyond on a background check

693
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Actually still to this day for

694
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
Limos in in California are not required

695
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
We've done

696
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Driving record check

697
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
More strict criteria

698
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Eric rated insurance policy

699
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
But the million dollars and there's is and was 750

700
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
$2,000

701
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
We said so if it's about safety

702
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
What we'd love to do with you to create a new category

703
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
.

704
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
Allows you to enforce that we are doing this

705
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
These things that we tell you we're doing

706
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
But that we were able to do this in

707
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
In a safe

708
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
That way that brings more affordable

709
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Transportation

710
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
California

711
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
They were threatening to sue you right

712
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,576
They were threatening to shut us down

713
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
Enforce against the drivers that we're driving in

714
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
What are you scared of about that possibility

715
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,560
Yes cuz you'd sold out of them ride and she put all your eggs in this basket and

716
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
It could have been shut down

717
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah I think I literally had a headache for 1 month

718
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
I wish I had to go

719
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
Check and make sure nothing was wrong but it was incredibly stressful time

720
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Because as you said we switched

721
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
All of our Focus over to from zimride to Lyft

722
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,344
And the opportunity was massive and the regulatory obstacles that we're just

723
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,672
What does massive how long does it take for you to overcome

724
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Those initial

725
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
Regulatory challenges like months years at least at least

726
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:50,496
Year early for that first year if I was to pick the one thing I spent most of my time on

727
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,896
Was the government relations and was working to create a new regulatory category 4 for the space

728
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,736
And then you know not just doing that in one state

729
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
But being able to demonstrate that in in multiple cities and states

730
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:13,792
So when so when you started

731
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
To expand outside of San Francisco and La how fast were you expanding to other cities is it like every month every

732
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Cheat day every week

733
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
That kind of earlier. It was more

734
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Every few months

735
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Maybe the most intense moment was

736
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
April

737
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
24

738
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
2014 when we launched 24 marker

739
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
It's on the same day

740
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Who are your competitors

741
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Is Uber was still doing

742
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
Remind me by car

743
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah there really wasn't

744
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:48,096
There was some other companies that were trying in this in this kind of peer-to-peer

745
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Personal vehicle space

746
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
But there wasn't a large amount of copper

747
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Petition

748
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,056
There are still so many questions looming around regulatory

749
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Franklin

750
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,176
That I think Nina people were waiting back to see how that played up

751
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Your focus was on

752
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
This

753
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
What are B&B bottle where you got a car

754
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
And

755
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
It's going to be community and

756
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
The sharing economy thing like

757
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
What happened when when all the sudden Uber

758
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Started doing a brat

759
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Where they basic

760
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
Copy tramada

761
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,472
Yes so I mean we assume that because the opportunity was so large and everything we're seeing that there would be more

762
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
More competition coming

763
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
And so it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a big surprise

764
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
And

765
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
It just you I think over the

766
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
The course of the few years we've been doing this it's

767
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,112
It made us better and frankly I think both both companies grow fast

768
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
How do you differentiate

769
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Yourself from them

770
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,000
How do you make the case that actually you should go with us and not bad

771
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Yes Orr Focus

772
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
In the early days was we needed to

773
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Ensure we solved the two most important things for our customers first which was not reliability you can get a ride

774
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Ride when you want it at the best possible price once you have parody on those and now it now we do we built up

775
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Enough infrastructure

776
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,088
Enough basic driver community that you can get a ride within on average 3 minutes

777
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
In the cities then it's about the experience in today's world

778
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,560
By treating drivers better than any other company the ability to have cashless tips get

779
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
Paid in the same day

780
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
Create an environment where drivers are respected by passengers and nuts and translates to passengers be

781
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
A treated better

782
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,640
Then another service are you a competitive person like do you

783
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,456
Do you look at your competition and really one

784
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Want to beat them

785
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Yes absolutely

786
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Like how much is a drive you

787
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
That idea

788
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Auditor

789
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,952
I'd say to a large degree I used to play sports

790
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
Whether it was running track or a playing soccer

791
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
And you know I started running track as

792
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
Just to stay in shape for soccer and then

793
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
I wanted to

794
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,472
To win the race and I wanted to

795
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Go under 5 minute mile

796
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,080
And was able to do that and so I think often now today

797
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
You know where it where in

798
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Hello

799
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
What could be described as a mile

800
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Four laps

801
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
And where in lab 2

802
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,112
You know that 3 is typically in that race the most critical.

803
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Were you set yourself up

804
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
For victory in cell

805
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,000
I think we're making a lot of important moves and decisions now

806
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
That should allow us to to win the race

807
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
To take it personally like you know

808
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,728
Uber obviously has you know been a pretty tough competitor in a X or Ben

809
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
Accusations that the

810
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
But they've kind of

811
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,824
How to sabotage you or maybe you guys

812
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Diamond

813
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
It is it is a personal 2D is it something that you really

814
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Feel emotionally

815
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Yeah yeah definitely

816
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
I don't mean

817
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
Is part of it well just is it just business in

818
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Business

819
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
Days where you hate your

820
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,840
Your competitor but you always still respect them or is it really like no actually this is really personal I don't like them

821
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:04,704
I think we take it and I take it personally which drives me

822
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,568
Because I believe so strongly in what our team is working on and why were work

823
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
We believe that

824
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,176
By building what we're building we can make our cities

825
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,480
Designed around people

826
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Instead of cars

827
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
And

828
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
By having the right values

829
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
An ethics

830
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,184
We can impact Society in a way that's bigger than a transfer

831
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Vacation week

832
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
And so

833
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
I take it personally

834
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Because

835
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
We're out to win for the values that we represent

836
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
I don't let that distract me

837
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,472
I let that you know fuel the fire

838
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
And

839
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,032
I think in the early days

840
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
When I was less mature

841
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
It would it would distract

842
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
But but today I think

843
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
It just feels

844
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
The desire to push harder

845
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Set the company there's

846
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
About 1300

847
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,232
And then drivers do you to disclose that number

848
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,656
No we've said several months ago that you know last year there was over 300,000 and you can assume that this year

849
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
Have that number has grown quite significant

850
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
And we think about like these ride-sharing

851
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Companies

852
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Uber and left

853
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
As

854
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,712
The stainless permitting that we all fall come to depend on I've got the apps app for both companies

855
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
Imyfone sorry to have both

856
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
And

857
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
This become

858
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,416
Harbor Lights like there's like I can't even remember what life was like before Lyft or Uber

859
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Friday

860
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,512
And yet we have to imagine Monday

861
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,864
Something is going to replace you guys and people think of driverless cars

862
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Do you ever think about that

863
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Sure I mean it's that

864
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,104
You know I I saw the rise and fall of Lehman right before my eyes and I think that that creates the

865
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
The right sense of

866
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Awareness

867
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,736
And when building a company that that you've seen something like that

868
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:57,344
But when you look at the future you know you talked about autonomous cars

869
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
An autonomous car is not going to drop out of the sky and be able to do a hunter

870
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
That's not real

871
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
What's real is that

872
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Over the next

873
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
Couple years it'll be able to

874
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Do

875
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
A few percent of our trips

876
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
10% of our trips

877
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
50% of our trip

878
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
And

879
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
What that means for this opportunity is that

880
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,688
We're going to be able to address that ultimate goal we have of ending car ownership and providing a full out

881
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Alternative

882
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
To owning a car in fact what you'll be able to do

883
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Is by

884
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Likely a miles plan from us

885
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
A monthly subscription

886
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
Hot to handle all your transportation

887
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,536
And over the next few years some of those trips will be done by

888
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,584
Human drivers in another's

889
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
That will be done by autonomous vehicles

890
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,704
To the point that we can provide you with amazing

891
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,288
Hospitality experiences on wheels

892
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,896
Will you look back at you know

893
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,712
Carpeting Logan over Facebook and then like

894
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,552
Look on the side project moving to Menlo Park Inn

895
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
Corn your heart and soul into the into zimride and

896
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Then starting left and watching it turn into a computer valued this valued over 5 billion dollars do you sort of look at that

897
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
Dad and sister save yourself

898
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,888
Okay I can like breathe out a sigh of relief like

899
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,216
We're okay we've made it we've gone we've passed the hump

900
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
Or are you constantly worried and vigilant

901
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Everyday

902
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
Yeah. I don't think there's a acai of

903
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Accomplishment I think there is

904
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
The bar keeps getting raised and that's the bar that

905
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
That we raised on ourselves

906
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
The goal over the last 10 years

907
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
For Logan I hasn't changed

908
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
You know it was them ride

909
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
And then it was left

910
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
And then it will have

911
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
Autonomous implication

912
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Until we've accomplished

913
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,144
The fact that you don't need to own a car in a city

914
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
Until we've accomplished the fact that we don't need

915
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
As many roads and parking lots

916
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
In our cities

917
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,104
Until we allow for our cities to be

918
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,432
A redesigned around the people living in them instead of the cars

919
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,712
That are parked in them

920
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,368
Then we're not happy

921
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
Where is a co-founder of left if you've been following the news lately

922
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:19,168
Competition between Lyft and Uber has suddenly become political and I mean

923
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Political like Donald Trump political for starters Trump's travel ban prompted Lyft to make A1

924
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
Million dollar pledge to the ACLU which is fighting the ban you a lots of writers were Furious

925
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
Cast of the founder of Advisory Group

926
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
That group before that happened more than 200,000 Riders deleted their Uber accounts and all

927
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,840
All of that has led to a spike in business

928
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Turn left

929
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Please don't turn it off

930
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Just yet in a moment

931
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,024
We're going to hear from you about the things you guys are building

932
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,376
The first quick thanks to one of our sponsors Wells Fargo

933
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656

FDIC

942
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Hey it's time now for another installment of how you built that

943
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
And this one came to us from Jaya Irish lives in Oakton Virginia

944
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
And a few years ago when jaya's daughter was

945
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
3

946
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
She stood up

947
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
And made a declaration

948
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,312
My daughter she wants to grow up to be an astronaut

949
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
I so that's when I started looking around for clothes with astronaut or space team and I realize that they were really

950
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
Four girls and shirt I could have bought an astronaut shirt or pajamas in the voice part

951
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Her daughters

952
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Favorite color

953
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
What is Pink

954
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,512
I actually looked every place

955
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,864
And there was nothing at all not a single pink astronaut shirt

956
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
But as it turned out

957
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Just the right person to

958
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
Tackle this problem she actually has a

959
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,080
PhD in clothing merchandising

960
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
So I actually got in touch with some freelance designers and I created a few designs like I made a monster

961
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Truck

962
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
Which was on a t-shirt

963
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
Didn't say anything boy about it

964
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,488
I made a pink T-shirt with a race car on it I met a girl firefighter online course

965
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Also sketched out that

966
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Pink T-shirt with an astronaut on it

967
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,912
She put her drawings online she launched a Kickstarter campaign

968
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
X-rays

969
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
30000 bucks

970
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,824
And I was lucky that I had the support of my husband who is always

971
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,640
Let me know if you really believe in it go and do it

972
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
Soak with the kickstarter money

973
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,760
Jaya found a factory in India willing to make the shirts

974
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
Japan expanded her lines shirts

975
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,672
Computer code test tubes and a solar system that glows in the dark

976
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
All for kids

977
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
But there was a problem

978
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,888
Be actually had a lot of parents reaching out to us saying hey we don't have anything like this for the moms of these kids

979
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
Lots of moms who work in science were

980
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Talking about clothes for grown ups

981
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,848
I started designing dresses with things like the

982
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
Periodic table the double-helix the solar system

983
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
Equations

984
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,040
Many school teachers College professors actually on our customers

985
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,440
Tina Dixon feel great about teaching math and thing that hate America mattress because I love math

986
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,000
And if you feel like Miss Frizzle

987
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,584
Diet now has about 80 designs in their online store

988
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
In last year

989
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
Just one year into starting her business

990
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,728
She and her partner were able to pay themselves

991
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
Pretty decent salary

992
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Seriously I did not expect it to become what it has become because when I started I just did it because

993
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
My daughter wanted

994
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:21,088
And then it just grew and grew and now it's growing so fast that you're having a hard time handling this

995
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,184
Sometimes that's China or her company is called Spa hot pink

996
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,512
It's named for her daughter who is now five by the way and the monster
