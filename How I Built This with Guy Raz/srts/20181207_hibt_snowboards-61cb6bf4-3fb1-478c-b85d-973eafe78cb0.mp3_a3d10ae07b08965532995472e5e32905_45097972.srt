Hello

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
Here's our episode

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Burton

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
I mean I was like Willy Loman and I was a traveling salesman and I would

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Load up my car it was a Volvo Wagon at the time but I remember once going out with

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
38 doors and I drove around New York State and visited dealers and I went out with 38 I came home with 40

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,624
40 snowboard because one guy had given me to back the boss said this is a joke

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
Brown NPR how I built this

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movement they built

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
How did Jake Carpenter turned a childhood novelty toy

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Biggest sports in the world from it Burton Snowboards

22
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
So imagine being on an airplane in 1977

23
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,448
You sit down you strike up a conversation with the guy sitting next to you you ask him what he does

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Try something like

25
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,544
I make sleds for the snow except

26
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
You standing there

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Skateboard

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,968
You have no idea what he was describing you couldn't have imagined it was in

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
What are years

30
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,832
Snowboarding would become a multibillion-dollar industry

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
And if that person next to you or Jake Burton Carpenter

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
There's no way you've predicted that one day

33
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
One out of every three snowboards sold worldwide

34
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,704
Would be a Burton Snowboard and not because he invented the sport he didn't

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,312
But there's probably no one on earth who did more to popularize it

36
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
And it didn't happen overnight

37
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Ten Years After Jake founded Burton Snowboards

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,040
Fewer than 7% of ski resorts even allowed snowboarding

39
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Today

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
It's hard to find one that doesn't

41
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,744
Anything about Burton Snowboards

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Celtic culture around snowboarding

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Culture

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,168
It was inspired in part by Family ski trips to Vermont

45
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Glenn Jacobs

46
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,288
My dad sort of figured it might be something fun for a family to do

47
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
When I was around I guess

48
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Seven or eight and he would take the whole family

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,248
I just always had this attachment to snow I mean I

50
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
Tomato with mint no school end

51
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,648
Still my favorite thing to do in life is go up to my kids rooms and

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
In those days are behind me but

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
Time to get up for school and then after they get up elements of snow day

54
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Winter in 1966 there was a brief craze across parts of America for an hour

55
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Novelty toy called the snurfer

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,360
As in snow + surf was basically a stand-up slide that

57
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
You could ride down a hill

58
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
A carpenter was one of the thousands of kids who bought one

59
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
For ten bucks

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,392
It was a 4 ft long piece of wood that was about six or seven inches wide

61
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
No edges

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
When you stood on it on this Earth

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
Staples it gave you traction and yet a rope attached to the nose

64
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,424
It was a little bit like you were riding a bucking bronco just getting down the hill

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
But it was fun

66
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
And I

67
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,080
Brunswick made them they sold 800000 or something like that

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
But it developed a sort of called

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
In a positive sense of the word

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Nike friends and

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
We would do it together and we would modify them

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
For me

73
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,392
The surfer was the opportunity to serve who's basically surfing on snow

74
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Surfing on snow

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
Not always Jake's childhood was

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Free great even idyllic

77
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
But then when he was about 13

78
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Things started to unravel

79
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Jake's older brother George was

80
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Killed in battle in Vietnam

81
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
And a few years later

82
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
His mother died as well

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
And for Jake

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Hey what's up

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Pretty tough time

86
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
Even ended up getting expelled from his boarding school

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
I mean I was a wiseass

88
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
And when I was young

89
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
To a fault

90
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
End

91
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
When I got kicked out of

92
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
Brooks was the school and I went up to see the Headmaster

93
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
It was a head master 1

94
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
My father was

95
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
And when my brother was there

96
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
It was brutal need my dad made me get in the car and go 5 hours see this guy you know for a 5-minute conversation

97
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,103
And then a long drive home and that is when I decided to turn my life around and start

98
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
Applying myself to whatever the hell I did

99
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,807
Did apply himself by figuring out how to take what he was good at

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And make money out of

101
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
Jake's first Venture was a small Landscaping

102
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
And then after college

103
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
He went to work for an investor in Manhattan

104
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
In the back of his mind

105
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
Never forgot about the snurfer

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
In about its potential to be something much

107
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Much bigger

108
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Yai

109
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Really from the very beginning of Surfing for me

110
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
I saw as

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
Something that could be developed

112
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,503
And I was sure that Brunswick was going to do it or somebody was

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
And nothing happened

114
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
But you know

115
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,975
In the back of my mind I always knew it could be a sport and I didn't have a business plan for a site but I did the math that

116
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,839
If I can make 50 snowboards a day I can make $100,000 a year

117
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
And that would be

118
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Awesome

119
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,447
You thought I'm going to I can do something in the thing to do is

120
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Makeup much better Surfer

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Yeah make money on it

122
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
So I started the company in 77

123
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
Because you were living in Manhattan that the

124
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
The time right yes and I made my first

125
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
Prototypes in my apartment on the Upper East Side 80s

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
Shop in your apartment in like

127
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
Table saw and stuff in or I was just clueless then as you are now

128
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
I did not know how to do it I was a loser in shock last

129
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,423
School like my napkin holder was by far the ugliest or The Warriors

130
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
And so there I was with a saber saw

131
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
In my apartment making them

132
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Like out of what

133
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
Yeah I would the very first

134
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Skype with modifying some Surfers

135
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
First ever round and then

136
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
I said I got to move to Vermont

137
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Why this company

138
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
We not going to start a snowboard company in Manhattan

139
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
So I left my job in New York City in

140
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Like early

141
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
December at the winters here and I start a landscaping business

142
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
When will Spring start

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Radiant Moissanite

144
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
I had a car station wagon a narrative in the family on

145
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Fox garbage bags a couple of rake

146
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
That's what I started like landscape business with

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
Manufacturing is a lot tougher than mowing lawns

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,479
But I thought okay it's winter now the time start the company I almost missed the next one

149
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
Literally it took so long to develop a product

150
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
And if you finance

151
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Get the money

152
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Well my

153
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Because my mother died

154
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
Young age when my grandmother died

155
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
She had some dough and instead of going to my mother came to

156
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Me and my two sisters

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
And so I inherited almost $200,000

158
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
I spent a hundred and fifty of it

159
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Developing Burton

160
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
So

161
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Your middle name is Burton

162
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Yes

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Carpenter so why did you call the

164
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Snowboards

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
I just always had this

166
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Interest

167
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
And the guy was named after

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
John house Burton and I

169
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Doctor

170
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Burton was a

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Cooler name

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
And I wanted to name it boards I mean boards was part of the name was Burton boards

173
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
And then I

174
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,447
Drove down to Montpelier Vermont and Incorporated went to the

175
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
We so cold that all the paperwork and everything was a big moment for me

176
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
Incorporation

177
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Or

178
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
And maybe Burton Board they started it

179
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Some form of

180
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Trademark

181
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271

So you okay see you you moved to Vermont and then to start this thing and then

184
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
What was your next step

185
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
Yeah so I went to this company called

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Shushan Bentwood company and they made

187
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
Curved wood for people that made furniture out of solid Ash

188
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Oh wow

189
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,823
So my first prototype was a piece of solid Ash that was just put in this thing to curve the nose

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
And then I

191
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Just start writing

192
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
The money I was like literally made a hundred

193
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
But all those under prototypes they weren't all solid wood I got onto laminated wood vertically laminated and Horus

194
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
Zardoni laminated like

195
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
Plywood I went to a friend too

196
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
Live in California who had a surfboard company

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
And they would let me make

198
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Boards in their Factory at night

199
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
And I would take a surfboard blank which is

200
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Six or seven feet long and maybe three or four inches thick and by the morning I have whittled the pink down to us

201
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
And they were just these guys were so cool but they laughed at me when you went to these Factory you said I need you to

202
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Give me this curved piece of water this piece of material

203
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
What is a 4 what would you

204
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
Tell them I'm in the store for there was some awareness

205
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
It has been around

206
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
So I was telling him that I was

207
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Making a modern rendition of an

208
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
And I always feared that like the minute

209
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Ski companies caught wind of this that

210
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
They were just jump on and I'll be out of business in no-till nobody care

211
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Nobody cares

212
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
And it wasn't just you like

213
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
With this thing like

214
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
Messing around on Hills

215
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Dude I was so alone yet

216
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Giver come across people like what what is that

217
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
What are you doing

218
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Yes it was

219
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
To the point

220
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,647
Literally if I was in a plane somewhere to ask me what I did I would make something up

221
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Cuz I was just too

222
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Embarrassing

223
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
Dai concept of snowboarding wasn't something that it would be like saying today

224
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Yeah I ride cloud

225
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,287
Like that's my job I make state board for cloud skateboarding for sure

226
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
SuperSU at what point were you able

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
How to say I got it I've got this is the one I'm going to make

228
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
I hadn't thought about this in a long time but

229
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
I remember that specific moment on Mount Washington

230
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
In June

231
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,719
And you can hike up Mountain you know that you know would have been June of 78

232
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,583
And I'm hiking up there and Hellman's Highway was a trail and I had to board

233
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Orwell just testing the final

234
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
Test and it was horizontally laminated

235
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Rock Maple very much like Escape

236
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
What's better and more flexible

237
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
And I wrote

238
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
Now you know just hiking uploaded writers like okay

239
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
And then I've decided on the construction now so I go out and I

240
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Rent this place that's going to be this little

241
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Factory

242
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
And I hired to relatives

243
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
And a friend

244
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
To help me

245
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Take these pieces of curved wood and

246
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Shape them

247
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,263
Drill them paint them with fins on them but mad on them with bindings on them

248
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
It was a long process and we

249
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
As I said my original plan was to make 54 today that was always sort of my goal because you thought that they were just going to this is going to blow

250
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
Glow up

251
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
I majored in economics

252
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Call Ajay

253
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Classes with

254
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,999
Nobel Prize winners but I don't know if I really understood supply and demand

255
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
YouTuber shot

256
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,679
In Londonderry Vermont with Burton boards written on the front of it and big letters who are the kinds of people

257
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Coming into your shop in Londonderry

258
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
Vermont

259
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
And sing out by 1

260
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Yeah it wasn't

261
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
People

262
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Out for a walk

263
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Buying a snowboard in

264
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
We didn't sell any maybe a few t-shirts but

265
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Are most people found out about us that would come there and

266
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,975
People we would advertise in the skateboard magazines in a little bit and ski magazine to spend some money there I mean I

267
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Because there were these pockets

268
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,863
Around the country in Michigan and Arizona are these places were people

269
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Hatsune

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,007
And like me and they sort of stuck with it and they got it they understood it

271
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Cat first year

272
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
What kind of feedback are you getting from people

273
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,991
Who bought them do they love it they were day like this is going to change the world

274
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Yeah it was

275
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
I mean I was

276
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,671
Like Willy Loman and I was a traveling salesman and I would

277
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Load up my car

278
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
It was a Volvo Wagon at the time and I remember once going out with

279
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,935
38 Star Wars and I drove around New York State and visited dealers and I went out with 38 I came home with 40

280
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,543
40 snowboard because one guy has given me to back that he bought instead

281
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
No One Is Your Love

282
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Pua would visit ski shops

283
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Bicycle shops yeah that was my first

284
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
And then ultimately

285
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
You know some

286
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Surf shops in

287
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
It was in the beginning skateboard shop surf shop ski shops nobody wanted any part of it and he did you have will udisc

288
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,999
Did you think maybe this is not going to work maybe I should

289
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Just got paid

290
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
Yeah I had some I had a few days it was tough

291
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Getting out of bed

292
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Just motivating myself

293
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Right I mean you are getting rejected all the

294
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
All day long

295
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
And you're all by yourself

296
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Yeah

297
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
And I am like I'm an emotional guy and you know grabbing boss

298
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
People winning

299
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Always happen

300
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
So I had to let go of

301
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
My chihuahua doesn't my friend very quickly

302
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Olympic Games

303
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Back to me

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
And you're too because we made enough boards

305
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
In that first winter I don't know what are we made of

306
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
1050

307
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
We made an effort

308
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
3 years today just sitting here box but yeah they're pretty much done

309
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
So I had one high school kid helping me out

310
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Part-time and now is it

311
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
Did you guys sell their first year

312
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,135
First year was $300 3/52 year was 700 I member one day and

313
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
That second winner of selling

314
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,255
Packing up to 700 forward and thinking

315
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Wow that's

316
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
You know that's over doubling

317
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
So what happens

318
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
Net first unit second ear when you go from

319
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
302 700

320
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
Why why did you double

321
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
The number for was it just

322
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Black

323
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Who is just getting out there Word of Mouth

324
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943
I'm in marketing

325
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
You know advertising placing ads in these

326
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
Ski Surfer skateboard mags

327
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
I mean I remember going to check the mailbox cuz dealers really weren't that interested

328
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
You know

329
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Stores

330
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,303
And so we would send out these brochures right from your one we had brochures and

331
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
We would send them out with a little male or four minutes

332
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,959
And I would go to get the mail every day and I remember looking in the mailbox and would be like either

333
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Nothing

334
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
Couple of envelopes or Sundays are be five or six envelopes

335
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,663
Then you open up the thing in it that is cruel order form and you can get it

336
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
You'd open up the envelope it'll be

337
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
It up two t-shirts or something

338
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,879
And then you'd open up an envelope would be like for snowboards for a family in Connecticut I mean

339
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
I can remember it so

340
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,487
Clearly and where could you actually use them

341
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
I'm assuming you couldn't

342
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Take it to ski resort and just go down

343
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
Nobody was presented

344
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
I mean

345
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Skiing at the time was 20 bucks a day

346
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
It was a lot of money so this was an opportunity to

347
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
Express yourself and have fun out and do with friends and

348
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
It was

349
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
A cheap way to have a lot of fun when it's snowing

350
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
You could not

351
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Going to Resort

352
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
And to be honest

353
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
I didn't start as a resort

354
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
You didn't tear no it wasn't that wasn't it was like

355
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
A low-cost alternative to

356
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
Denny's kids

357
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Who

358
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Then I started to hiring more

359
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Maybe your

360
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Free to watch

361
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
To just help

362
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,359
Assemble these boards put them in boxes and get them out the door still doing all the assembly in that place in Vermont yes

363
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
And hand

364
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Powerline

365
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,735
Yeah they were just help me get the boards out the door

366
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
This one Resort Brahma you could drive up to this Village that was

367
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
What are the way up the mountain

368
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
So we would buy one of the car drive up to the Village

369
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Everybody would

370
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,815
If there are four of us one guy would stay in the car the other three with snowboard down the hill

371
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
And then we can meet at the bottom and do it again and again and then ultimately

372
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
Snowcat drivers would give us rides and

373
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Bribe snowcat drivers with 6 pack or something you up to a point of the mountain

374
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
It was so challenging to ride those boards

375
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
People now they have these vintage races naked on

376
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,367
Also words and I for the life of me don't get it I mean it's you know

377
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
Hard but

378
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
It was just easy on rebellious I mean

379
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,583
What snowboarding and Burton did as we revolutionize

380
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Winter life

381
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Dandong

382
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
This was the beginning of it

383
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
When

384
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Really start to take off

385
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:25,759
Well I mean in terms of the sport or my company I mean it was nothing

386
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
I think

387
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
Now in the context of starting a business people think of

388
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,463
Internet companies investing explode and they wanted there just was not

389
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
A defining moment in the context of

390
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,119
The sport blowing up I mean they were big Milestones along the way and

391
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Timer

392
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
Calling at the worst new sport

393
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
Yeah that would have been

394
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Early 80s

395
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
And part of that time

396
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:59,551
Sing the worst new sport was they said it was more about raging hormones and this was his rebellious young man

397
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
That were making it happen and then

398
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,951
Cool girls very courageous

399
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
Women got into it and started doing it

400
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
And I realized okay

401
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
We're not

402
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Going to lose any more money

403
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
We might not make money but I can you know manage

404
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Manage this financially

405
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Play so

406
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
It just

407
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
Grew and grew and grew but at a manageable pace

408
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
Why didn't ski resort allow snowboarders

409
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
In the beginning

410
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Well it was it was

411
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,391
Actually famous cases Stratton which was Resort when the First Choice let us know where this guy at Stratton

412
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
It's in southern Vermont

413
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
And that this guy

414
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
Broken his leg because of some

415
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Sign or something skiing

416
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
Annies through the mountain and ID try to get

417
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Definitely got a million dollars

418
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
So there was this liability

419
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
I'm there's this just

420
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Paranoia about

421
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Getting sued

422
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
That's all that was their fear but

423
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
They ultimately would give us a chance and we would lobby with them and their kids sometimes help than we would Lobby Resort

424
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:06,367
Shorts and then if a big Resort like that and then Bramalea to come along in Magic Mountain

425
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
It took years

426
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
But it was

427
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
There was no stopping at that point also I guess

428
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
Start identify people who are really good snowboarders and and

429
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Sponsor them

430
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,591
Yeah we'll for a minute there these kids at work for me just happened to be

431
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
The best and then

432
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
There was a writer Great Khali who actually wrote for his company sends you started making snowboards after we did but they

433
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
Pretty well-known skateboard company and this guy Craig Kelly wrote for them but we were good friends that always.

434
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Don't cry gif

435
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
You ever had the opportunity

436
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
We would love for him to ride for us and then Sims ultimately sold his company to Biggers

437
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:57,823
Skateboard company and so we got a deal anymore for me and I paid him $17,000 a year

438
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
And this guy was on Craig Kelly was a godson all Wheaties Birds

439
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
He was burned all over his

440
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Yes

441
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
So having him

442
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Represent Britain

443
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
That was my pre transformational

444
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
It was beyond Transformers

445
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Cuz you're out all of a sudden not only

446
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Give this advertisement

447
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
But you got the coolest

448
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
And the best guy

449
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
You can do all this

450
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Cool Staffing

451
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
You got kids saying that's no lie

452
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Well

453
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,799
I want to try this and I guess Burton's the way to go cuz this guy uses Burger

454
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
You know what that's

455
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Pretty much it

456
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
Craig made the sport cool and the brand cool

457
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
When did snowboarding start to get bigger

458
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
The ski companies must have thought well

459
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
There's money to be made here right like

460
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
K2 in Ruston LA

461
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Did they start to make snowboards

462
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,815
It's just so funny that this ski companies were so

463
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
Oblivious to what was going on in front of their eyes

464
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
I mean

465
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Talk about

466
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Close minded

467
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
You know

468
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,823
Rescue earlier destroyed

469
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,383
Rumors that some cucumbers going to start making in the neck

470
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
We went from being

471
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Fly in the windshield

472
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Straight through all of a sudden

473
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
We became a threat

474
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
In just a minute had Jake dealt with the competitors

475
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
I wanted a piece of the action stay with this guy Roz you listening to how I built this from NPR

Gyros

487
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,224
Early days for Jake Carpenter

488
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,600
Building Burton and build the whole sport of snowboarding

489
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
Sometimes lonely

490
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
But because he stuck with it because the sport cut on

491
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,584
The biggest companies as you can imagine started to notice

492
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,448
And all of a sudden the market for snowboards so lonely anymore

493
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,568
Okay so when when the big ski company started to to make snowboards

494
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,224
What happened to you guys well by the time they started making a weird maybe on the 3rd of the resort

495
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
And then

496
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,576
They didn't want the sport to happen right I mean these

497
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
He companies did not want snowboarding succeed

498
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
So didn't like ski company

499
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
I mean people

500
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
Did perceive them as not being a real deal

501
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
And we didn't keep that a secret I mean we made it

502
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,448
Pretty damn clear that we were the real deal and

503
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
What day did

504
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,568
Have manufacturing ability and some of those French and Austrian companies were

505
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,872
Subsidized by the government

506
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
To keep their factories going

507
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,992
So, cost perspective they were lower-cost producer

508
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
For a minute there

509
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
But it was just they were too late

510
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
They missed the boat

511
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Did you ever have

512
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Is snowboarding really begin to take off in the

513
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
Did you ever face serious threats from

514
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Competitors either big or small

515
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,984
Well it was always like in the early days was a rivalry between bird and Simsbury

516
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
We've doubled the number of snowboards sold

517
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
For the first 20 years I think of

518
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
The company so

519
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
Sims with red one point K2

520
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Was somewhat of a thread

521
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Got more aggressive earlier on

522
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
But now we've been

523
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
We've been the number one

524
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Manufacturer

525
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
Snowboards

526
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
What's the day I

527
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
You know what I mean even though you

528
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
Addthis market share this little customer base

529
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,704
He's had a lot more money to work with

530
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
And you were

531
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
Your money was coming from sales

532
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah and ultimately we were borrowing money from Banks

533
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
I was very secure

534
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
And then

535
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
We would get bigger and bigger and obviously we're doubling our sale so we're doubling the money that we need from the bank and you need some money

536
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,392
Is the money for marketing and for what

537
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,488
We needed the money to make the snowboards because in this industry and skiing

538
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
We didn't start this

539
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
But you do shipping the stuff and whatever

540
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
August September

541
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
And then you don't get paid until

542
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
December January

543
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,496
So it was always working capital we've never needed long-term debt

544
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
But we've always had this need for working capital

545
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,920
And so we would work with these Vermont Banks and we'd get up to a certain levels have like three times

546
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
And then we get dresser level I sent you.

547
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
Maybe if I were going to bail

548
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Never cuz we were late on a payment or

549
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Young people money that we owe them

550
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
But they just sort of figured you know this has been a good ride we're going to

551
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,560
Bail and then we go to a bigger bank and then a bigger bag and then

552
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,144
We borrow we still borrow some working capital but it has become

553
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
Less and less

554
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
At any point did you think about

555
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
Going public doing IPO

556
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
Seeking venture-capital outside investors

557
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Anything like that

558
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
Yeah interesting Lee

559
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
There was this one company called ride

560
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
And they started out

561
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
And then a guy that work for us what to work for that new sort of a mid-level manager wasn't was a competing snowboarding company

562
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,304
Convenience opening company you want to work for them and then they went public

563
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,352
Can they at a very low price

564
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
And the stock went up to

565
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
It's split and then we're up to

566
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
35 box was up to 70 on it

567
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,544
Non-solicit evaluation

568
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
Which was a millionaire all of a sudden and I felt this

569
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Enormous

570
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Amount of pressure

571
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
Like I taking care of my people and yeah I bet

572
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
And like

573
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
Just am I doing the right thing here and so I went and I met

574
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
With

575
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
A couple of big

576
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
New York

577
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
Investment Banking firms and I

578
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Couldn't deal that the Bible I just was like this is nice

579
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
And then all of a sudden

580
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Right stock

581
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Which was it 35 bucks at

582
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
The time went down to

583
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
2 Box

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Because they have these expectations

585
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Is that

586
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,616
Like Wall Street just they take things and they

587
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Project

588
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Unrealistic

589
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Expectation

590
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
So ultimately people have realized

591
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
Working for a privately held company

592
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
As many many advantages

593
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
I guess it was in like

594
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
98 snowboarding became an Olympic sport

595
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
You I know that you don't like to

596
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Say this and you deny it but

597
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:52,544
You are widely credited as the guy who really made snowboarding what it is and

598
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,128
This is became an Olympic sport

599
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,248
What did you think when that happened like that must have been a pretty amazing moment

600
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
It was

601
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Not

602
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
Cool moment at all

603
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,072
That was not the answer I was expecting what happened well

604
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Best witches

605
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
International ski Federation

606
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Swiss

607
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
You know whatever governmental body and they

608
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm control the scene and then they started having snowboard competition

609
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
When they just said

610
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
Aside from the ski races and we were wondering what they were up to

611
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,320
And then they just arbitrarily decide okay so what's going to be the Olympics I mean they didn't even give me a phone call they never

612
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
How old is anything

613
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
I

614
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Will take credit for pioneering

615
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Miss Barton you would think

616
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Then you might

617
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,768
Pick up the phone and tell that person what you're up to or

618
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
How do you think we should do this

619
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
None of that they just arbitrarily

620
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,936
It's like the baseball player that finds out he's traded when he reads in the newspaper

621
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
And then I go to the Olympics

622
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:59,360
We've got our team there and then I get to the venue and they got snowboarding misspelled

623
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,200
How to spell as well you spell it with a W snowboarding

624
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,552
But that as a no hyphen boarding is in Nagano Japan

625
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Not a good sign

626
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Right so

627
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
And then they proceeded to have the

628
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
The racing thing was

629
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Heart conditions

630
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
And then

631
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Decided it was a

632
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
Driving rainstorm

633
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
And they say okay we can have that

634
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
Monsanto we would never have this

635
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
Prestigious event in the rainstorm

636
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,032
But they can go they can get

637
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
Risk life and limb and not be wearing goggles

638
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
It's raining so hard

639
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
And so

640
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
But nonetheless

641
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
They've gotten

642
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,576
Better and they're doing it better and better job in the American armed it's a form of

643
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Rob National associations

644
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,720
They care about this morning I've got some people to care about the sport they're trying to do better but

645
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,816
The last Olympics the venues for the freestyle stuff which is what

646
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
People care about

647
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
For the half pipe and slopestyle that the Bengals have been

648
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Really sketchy

649
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
As your company grew

650
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
Describe the culture of the time

651
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Was it I mean

652
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm looking at you right now and I cannot imagine you ever wearing a suit and tie

653
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
And being like a boardroom boss

654
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
Schleich do you have your

655
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,184
Meetings with your top team instead of how do you

656
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
What are meetings you know you look at my office

657
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
It's

658
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
3 sofas and

659
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
Do chairs in a coffee table and there's no desk

660
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
Senior composite board meetings at cellphone

661
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
Put your feet up

662
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
Bring your dog to work and

663
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,128
132 registered dogs are between always heard of

664
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
Keep track of the number and

665
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
It's

666
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
Resembles snowboarding

667
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Lifestyle

668
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,832
Edward tribe and we

669
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,976
Are so focused on the sport everybody in that cup you know damn near everybody in that company so bored

670
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
And cuz that's our source of energy that's where you recharge your battery

671
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,192
Jake I'm going to be in late today. Snowboarding

672
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
It's

673
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Pretty much

674
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,080
The Dramamine if it snows over two feet it's an automatic

675
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,616
Day off at all company

676
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
And last year they were

677
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:15,808
3 of those days which is almost too nice I mean I like people to work to on that

678
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
It's

679
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
But people come in late and work late

680
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,208
You know people work hard there so that's

681
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
As long as people are giving us a solid effort I get it if they want to get up there and catch a few runs on a great day

682
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,984
You're a your wife.

683
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
She she actually at some point became

684
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
Took over as it as a Company CEO right

685
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
Yeah

686
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
What's the story there

687
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Well she came

688
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
And went and then

689
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,576
She was even CFO for a while this is nearly days and then

690
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:53,696
When we had kids she backed off some she wasn't working as much then and then

691
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,256
When the financial crisis hit which was

692
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Really right here Vine

693
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
The big one

694
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Lehman Brothers All That

695
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Hit you guys

696
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Well

697
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
The bank

698
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
Charge this 4 million dollars to change one paragraph

699
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Car loan agreement

700
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,664
Which was called a covenant when you're borrowing money

701
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Your earnings had to represent a certain ratio compared to how much money or borrowing

702
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
And we

703
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Slipped on that one

704
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
It was a very tough year

705
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
And we weren't losing money we were making money

706
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,024
But literally they said well you broke his coming in so

707
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
You're going to pay a $4000000 fee

708
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,864
And that

709
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Boy I mean

710
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
With the lay people off

711
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
We weren't making the money that we had been I so we had snowboard

712
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Is the recession

713
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
Yes exactly

714
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
But you know what it's

715
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,408
Always been a youth Rivermark and it's kids and I mean people would buy

716
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,968
Two or three snowboards a year

717
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Can you look at

718
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Italy or Spain to very big Market

719
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
It's for us

720
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,672
And the unemployment rate amongst people under 20 was 50%

721
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,232
It was a very tough

722
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Stop time

723
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
And now

724
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Through this process

725
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Of this

726
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Crisis and I think it's not unique to Burton

727
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Art

728
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Company culture kind of got

729
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Destroy happen

730
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
Well I think a lot of people would

731
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
Blame other people

732
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
First things

733
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Negative things

734
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,784
What's the weather happening in there would be finger pointing in

735
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
The culture of our company

736
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,904
Was messed up and at the same time

737
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
I felt

738
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
You're no women in our top manager

739
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
And that

740
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
Just felt wrong to me so

741
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,400
I got in there and I been Donna came along with me and

742
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,728
At that level we were running the company and I brought her and

743
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
Serta specifically that

744
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Help with the culture and get

745
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,152
More women in leadership positions at Burton

746
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,480
When you see the culture I mean I'm just trying to get in through the

747
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Innuendo

748
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
What's it like

749
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Growish was it like

750
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
Male solo Macho was it like

751
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,952
I am what was the thing you want to change

752
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Well

753
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
I mean you're not happy when

754
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
You're being managed by fear

755
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Or

756
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
For you

757
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,496
Instill fear in yourself that you're going to lose your job or

758
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
It's just you need to make people

759
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
People have to understand

760
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
When and why

761
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Stuff happen

762
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Or you responsible for any of that

763
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Friday event

764
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Fear-based up

765
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
Well I think

766
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
IPod

767
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
Many of the people that were

768
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
In and around it and I think that

769
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,328
We were all responsible to a certain extent I mean I don't think that's ever been a

770
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
Tactic that I've used hopefully

771
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
But I certainly let it happen under my nose

772
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,520
Do you think that that you have a hard time

773
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
With criticism

774
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
And I said because you know

775
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
It it didn't really problematic right if you're unwilling to

776
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944
I want to listen to somebody

777
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
It says listen I know you built this thing

778
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
But I'm trying to make it better listen to me

779
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
No that's

780
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,928
Couldn't be more true but less and less and less every year I mean I

781
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
Did every job that count

782
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
IMEI made

783
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
The first board

784
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
And for a while there I mean we might have had

785
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,632
50 employees and I was convinced

786
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
Not in that in a bragging way but I could do anybody's job

787
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Better than

788
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,568
But that's not the case anymore you know we've been Engineers now that I don't even

789
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
Do you have a hard time having a conversation with him

790
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
I got better at it

791
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,248
And I had the sense to

792
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,552
Surround myself with people

793
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Better

794
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Red things

795
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
Then I am that I'm not good at it

796
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
That's been good enough learned

797
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
To delegate

798
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:44,352
That's not an easy thing to learn how to do specially when you're detail-oriented learn to let go like that

799
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
You have to trust

800
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
Beyond trusting you have to let him screw up

801
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:53,312
Young live with it and live through mistakes and if they repeat the mistakes and that's not

802
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
It sign

803
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
Burton's made every mistake in the book

804
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
But I don't think we've made too many

805
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
Twice

806
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,344
Why can I'm sure at certain points you were offered money to

807
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,952
I just didn't take those phone calls you could I mean

808
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
You could have sold this company

809
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Open like a philanthropist and

810
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,168
I don't know a better life for sounds pretty cool it's like a pretty great life

811
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
Well I

812
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,288
For a long time if people ask me that question I would say well

813
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
I think I've become a couch potato and

814
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Egyptian watch

815
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
SportsCenter

816
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,992
So you don't snowboard funny but

817
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
I mean it's the best job in the world why would I ever walk away from it that's

818
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,392
Selfishly admittedly

819
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
That's always

820
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Ben

821
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:46,816
Part of it and I think they were doing a great job and we're humming along if if we were

822
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
Really struggling

823
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Might be

824
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
More appropriate for me to look at that more

825
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Seriously

826
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
Important is money to you

827
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
Is being rich to you

828
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Well

829
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
To be brutally honest

830
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
I mean

831
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Bye

832
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,992
Enjoy having

833
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,040
Eligibility financial aid

834
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,392
We're going surfing for a week in the Maldives next week my all family

835
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
And we're going to have a speedboat it's going to take us to the lineup

836
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
It's going to be epic and the stuff that cheap

837
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,144
So I love that and I would be a liar if I told you I didn't

838
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:27,008
But it's not the most important thing in life yeah

839
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
You're a really tough couple years

840
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Your chest

841
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Now

842
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,432
Internet recovery of it

843
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Any surgery

844
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
I guess in 2015

845
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
And then

846
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
And then before that you had

847
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
Heart surgery

848
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Right

849
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
And then you battled cancer

850
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Testicular cancer

851
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
Yeah and I dealt with the whole process of chemotherapy which is

852
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
Dreadful

853
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
And in them

854
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
Tell lender that I was in a plane and I had a pulmonary embolism which

855
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Really

856
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Still

857
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Affects me

858
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
And then I came down with that

859
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
Miller-fisher that form of gamma ray

860
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Miller Fisher because

861
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
A lot of people know about this but

862
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
It's

863
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,088
I guess it's an autoimmune disease that can make you temporarily

864
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Paralyzed

865
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
So

866
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
Like what was that what was going on like

867
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Why did you even discover

868
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
What was going on

869
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Well I'd gotten a knee replacement

870
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
And then I got home

871
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
And I was with the doctor

872
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Next day in

873
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
I started seeing double and and

874
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
I told him that he's like

875
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Check it out see if

876
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
I might just go away

877
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
The next day I was seeing double

878
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
And

879
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
I felt really lousy

880
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
And I wait till Donna went to work I didn't cheat

881
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Through so much

882
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
With me and

883
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,440
And so I went to Dartmouth-Hitchcock and they

884
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Barry

885
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
Quickly analyze what was going on and

886
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,936
Within 24 hours of meeting be in there they said if you have always take you out tomorrow you won't be able

887
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Swallow

888
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
Open your eyes

889
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
Next day won't be able to breathe

890
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
And were they right

891
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
Yeah that's how it went down

892
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,064
That's what you get to the hospital and you are confined to the bed

893
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
Surprise you for 6

894
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
6 weeks

895
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
You couldn't move your body

896
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
Hours or days

897
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
And I was there for

898
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
Over 6 weeks

899
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
You're like a prisoner in your own body

900
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Yeah

901
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Very much so

902
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
I think it's like

903
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
ALS

904
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
Handstand do a couple of weeks

905
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
So first of all

906
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,664
How do you breed

907
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Do a ventilator

908
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
And

909
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
The ventilator was

910
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Behind me

911
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Could hear it

912
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Pregnancy

913
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Did you have

914
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Feeling in your body

915
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah

916
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,488
Yeah my wife would stretch me every night

917
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Can I get Siri

918
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
Feel that

919
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Repeating 2

920
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Did you think your aunt died

921
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
For sure

922
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
For a minute

923
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
And then

924
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
You're my wife did

925
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
You know she told me I was getting better and

926
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Eventually I would see these little

927
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Improvement

928
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
What you start to notice

929
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
You know that I could open my eyes

930
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
And that I do.

931
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
I was showing the physical therapy right for me

932
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,752
And then I could do something a little better than

933
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
The day before

934
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,920
And once you get to that point then it's game on. It's up to you

935
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Is that it

936
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
Experience change the way you

937
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Live your life

938
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
And you interact

939
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
To the people you love

940
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
Well I sure as hell don't take my family for granted

941
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Seymour in

942
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
I do live life

943
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
But the moment I mean

944
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
Much more than ever I mean I think

945
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
It happens through some

946
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
I don't know why or how

947
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
You're dead to me

948
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
Emma's put into perspective

949
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
All your success

950
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
And wealth in the thing

951
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
But you built like

952
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,552
Obviously that stuff matters but like in the context of your life

953
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Nothing else

954
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Really matter

955
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
Yeah yeah that stuff could have been further from my mind

956
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
I think it is now though now I'm like prepared to die

957
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
Really yeah I am much more so

958
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
I could

959
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Die

960
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,984
Get hit by a bus walking out of your studio and I still think I'm

961
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Luckiest

962
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
China world

963
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
Because of the life you had yes

964
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
Could you ever have imagined

965
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
When you were

966
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,456
And that first you need to fire your

967
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Employees in

968
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
That you would have built something this big

969
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,440
I have no idea that what would happen over and I saw a sport

970
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
But I did not see

971
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,864
Shaun White on the cover of Rolling Stone twice or snowboarding be in the Olympics

972
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
The stuff that's happened

973
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,288
And it's been the athletes would have made it happen then we've facilitated it but it's been

974
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Exceeded

975
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,944
I wouldn't even say dreams cuz I never dreamt anyting on the level that were on Now

976
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,344
Chapin Carpenter

977
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,744
By the way Burton just celebrated 40 years in business since Jake built that first snowboard in the barn

978
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,816
Londonderry Vermont back in 1977

979
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:43,936
And despite his health issues Jake still snowboards 100 days a year

980
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
Always winners fresh powder

981
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,783
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the

982
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Things your building

983
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,647
The first a quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

984
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:07,487
Who wants you to know that the newest member of the Microsoft Surface family

985
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,767

986
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,351
Has up to 13 and a half hours of battery life

987
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
8th gen Intel Core processor

988
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
You can work for as long as you want to

989
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Ever work takes

990
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

991
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,223
Time now for how you built that and today we're updating a story we ran

992
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,319
About a year ago so my name is Jana. I'm from Scarsdale New York

993
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
And

994
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
One day I was just so sick of opening my refrigerator and seen Brown guacamole Brown guacamole

995
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
We've all been there right

996
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,119
You scoop out the soft avocado flash imagines

997
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:51,007
Onion salt maybe some cilantro you stick it in the fridge and then a couple hours later

998
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,847
That bright green dip looks kind of gross

999
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
This is absolutely a problem that people have and I saved them would you like a container that prevents got your guacamole from turn

1000
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
Turning brown

1001
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,415
Oh my God so anyway about four years ago Jane started to experiment in her kitchen

1002
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
She made a lot of guacamole

1003
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,863
Start to observe that guacamole change color if I make some and put it in a bowl with

1004
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
Saran wrap it turns brown

1005
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:22,239
But if there was some way that I could eliminate

1006
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
That

1007
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Air index

1008
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
Space

1009
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:30,943
Then maybe I could solve that age-old problem so Jane recruited her step-sister to help out

1010
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,015
They found a designer and together they came up with a

1011
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
Plastic container with

1012
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,599
Cut up a little elevator underneath it

1013
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,671
It pushes the guacamole to the very top

1014
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,999
So there is no space between your guac

1015
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
And the list

1016
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
And then you simply

1017
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
Close the tab to cover the air hole

1018
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
Put it in the refrigerator

1019
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,239
Forget about it literally forget about it I mean

1020
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,823
A week however long you're going to eat your guacamole it will not

1021
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Turn brown okay so they had the right design

1022
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,735
But for two years they ran into one problem after another

1023
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
They were using the wrong

1024
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,855
Cheerios or little elevator thing wasn't spinning properly

1025
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
But finally

1026
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
A couple years ago

1027
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
They got out of the factory into the market

1028
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
And they called it

1029
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
The guac lock

1030
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
You can lock anything up

1031
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
So

1032
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,727
Tuna fish egg salad you know chopped vegetables pesto hummus

1033
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
In the more you can smash it and remove the air holes

1034
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
The better it's been saved

1035
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
Searching this is not my main problem with guacamole because

1036
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
It was to lock your

1037
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:45,183
Meaning of kids ask the guacamole Toledo before your desk up

1038
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,327
That's a good idea that is a problem in my house that's our problem I get into the kitchen I just feel like green

1039
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
Guacamole around the mouths of my children I feel your pain

1040
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,287
Nationwide like a child exactly

1041
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,847
What actually is very funny that you said that

1042
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,687
Because a lot of people say I never have leftover guacamole why would I need this

1043
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
I'm going to always say to them is

1044
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,527
Now you can make in advance

1045
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
