00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504

All of these Services got started to

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Solve this exact

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Problem

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
About 5 years ago

74
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
What's really thinking about

75
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Eaters

76
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
He was thinking more about the rest

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
To get more of their food out

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Into the world but

79
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Didn't have an easy way to do this

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Someone Tony was still a student in Business School

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
Handsome friends build a system that links

82
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
Local restaurants to Hungry customers

83
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Drivers who were available to deliver the food

84
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
They started with a simple web page

85
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Restaurants

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Tempe Honda Accord

87
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
5 years later

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Is valued at over

89
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Billion dollars

90
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
And it's done over a hundred million deliveries

91
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Across the country

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
But getting to that point

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
What is so simple

94
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,456
Tony didn't start out with lots of connections

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,784
In fact the only started to learn English as a boy

96
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,600
Tony was actually born in Nanjing China

97
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
And when he was 4

98
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
His father got into an engineering program at the University of Illinois

99
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Urbana Champaign

100
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
His mom left behind her career in medicine

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Started waiting tables

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
It is a kid

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Tony got to work to

104
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Trying to

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Fit in

106
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
New

107
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
American School

108
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
There wasn't a lot of diversity at that time

109
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,919
Not in the late eighties and early nineties

110
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
And so I'd really two ways

111
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
To learn English

112
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,831
Russian an early learning lashai my own one was watching lots of TV

113
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
Nsic how you got my name

114
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,975
I am your name your name is no my Chinese name was

115
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Shouxing

116
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
And

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
When I got to the US none of my classmates

118
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,191
Ignore my teachers Asian kid in school

119
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Registration for Merced shoe Shank

120
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
And as I

121
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Was learn English watching

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Lots of TV to do it

123
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
I saw many episodes of who's The Boss starring Tony Danza

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
Pretty much at the age of 5 I walked

125
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
With my dad to the immigration office in

126
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Legally change my name

127
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
Inspired by Tony Danza from who's the Boss

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Absolutely

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
Did you did you do any like

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,727
I did have a couple of businesses so so I'm

131
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,335
We didn't really come with a lot of money and sold it in order for me to let you know

132
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
Buy Nintendo games or

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
I knew basketball I started working at a pretty young age I wash dishes inside my Mom's restaurant

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
The one that you

135
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,183
The one she worked for dishwasher I was a dishwasher I'm a very good dishwasher today

136
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Emerald lawns

137
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
And I realize actually at a very young age

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
That

139
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Walt because

140
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
The Lawns in Champaign or very large

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
Use Flash to make a business out of that

142
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
And I could actually charge

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,359
Money for different shapes or

144
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,431
We invested in a old lawn mower

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
And Oates go door-to-door and ask if I can cut people's grass

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,343
And I started realizing overtime actually if you cut grass a different heights

147
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
Can come up with different shapes

148
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
I'm in patterns

149
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
Look like a u.s. flag US flag into someone's lawn service at first use

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
You said first use the mower

151
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
To to make the stripes and I could cut him a different High

152
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
And then what I would do is a task

153
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
I can borrow one of their

154
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Clippers as well

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
As

156
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,199
I am blanking my trimmers those are

157
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
And if actually make

158
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Different shapes in the lawn

159
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Carlisle giant American flag

160
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Many hours

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
But when you really want a Nintendo

162
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
And you have no money in the bank

163
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
You do what it takes

164
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Did you ever have any inkling as a kid that your parents

165
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Struggling

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
I had a

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,823
Maybe when I went to middle school had had small observations of it

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
For example

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
The Weeknd

170
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,271
Ford lessons for me or sports uniforms

171
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
We lived in a fairly small apartment compared to some of my friends who had

172
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Single family homes

173
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
I lived off of the

174
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
No free lunch program

175
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Pretty much

176
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Kindergarten through middle

177
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
I'm sorry I think it's small

178
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Semblances of bad but I think

179
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
For most of my childhood

180
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
I didn't think too much about

181
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Just just to be clear

182
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Your mom was a doctor

183
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
China

184
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
She was a doctor and she effectively had to give up

185
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
Her credentials because when she immigrated to the US

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
No institution in the US would recognize her credentials

187
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
What's from China

188
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
And so as a result she

189
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
How to go backwards

190
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
So she worked as

191
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
A waitress inside of restaurant you worked as

192
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
A babysitter she works

193
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
A hospice

194
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
And and you know she did that for

195
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Well

196
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Yours

197
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
Before she could save up enough money to open up a mouse

198
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
And

199
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Basically relive

200
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Regain her life

201
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
And why your mom was doing all that stuff your dad

202
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
But since he became an engineer

203
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
And Agassi is first job was in

204
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,975
California see you guys move out there how old were you when you moved California

205
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
I was

206
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
15

207
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
So you guys move out to where where where do we move the San Jose

208
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,215
So you probably given where you move to all of a sudden risk-aware

209
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
People that were people who look like you where you felt right if you are now only occasionally almost

210
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
Play going back to China One of maybe three kids now write it and it in Illinois am I grade that

211
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
Asian and I moved to San Jose and like wow

212
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Yeah this is it

213
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
This is a surprise

214
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
Yeah and my opening conversation with

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
The principal

216
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
That was one where he

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
And other Educators that says that I was like 2 years behind it

218
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
And it's mainly because I no idea how come

219
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Additive

220
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
School system is here in the Bay Area

221
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,967
Hear it in the midwest especially where I grew up you were recognized for your athletic abilities

222
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
I definitely wasn't cool to be the smart kid

223
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
In class

224
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
I'm out here

225
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah there were math competitions there were

226
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,071
After school and I work my

227
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Tell off I am

228
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,471
I was miserable in my first year it was just day and night

229
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
All I did

230
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Was

231
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Pretty much

232
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
Call First catch up because I actually was behind and then secondly

233
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Do a lot better

234
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,271
And I remember looking the teachers in the eye and said

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
I'm going to graduate as valedictorian of your

236
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Wow

237
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
You said that I said that

238
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
It was almost an instinctual response it looking back it was

239
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Certainly

240
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
A bit presumptuous but but before years later that happen

241
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
You were the valedictorian High School

242
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
I was

243
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Okay so you going to college

244
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
At UC Berkeley

245
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
Play and then it eventually you go to Stanford for business school

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Yeah and

247
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
What are the things that you do in business school is you

Yes I'm a witch

250
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Spoiler alert

251
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Beginnings what will eventually become doordash but

252
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Tell me about

253
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
This project that

254
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
That you

255
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
Different for a class

256
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
What was it

257
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,143
Well this time it was work on a

258
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Customer audience that you're passionate about

259
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
And try bunch of

260
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
That was really what my co-founders and I kind of gravitated towards my co-founders and I we all met

261
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Really because of an inch

262
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Sheridan

263
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
For local

264
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
Were they in a class with you

265
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
But they work so you all set around said

266
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
How can we help local businesses like

267
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Scale largest

268
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Make their

269
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
Their operations more efficient

270
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
We didn't even know what problems it was work on it

271
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
I was just that honest ever passion

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
And Annie reach each person

273
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
And their own personal

274
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Connection

275
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
With a local businessman was clear with my mom

276
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
I've watched

277
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
4

278
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
In the world of local business for

279
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
20 + years growing up as a head

280
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
I've always been a fan

281
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
And we started by talking to a lot of businesses in the Bay Area

282
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
All sports

283
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
What were you asking them

284
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Asking them about

285
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
It is there was a magic wand

286
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
And we could take away any problem for you this week what would it be so you would call up a restaurant say hey

287
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,863
Antonia Muggs tuna Stanford

288
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,239
And work on a project and if you do magic wand WhatsApp one problem you can solve that's what you got to do

289
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
What are they telling you what's their problem

290
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
What were there a few movie it with her diffuso in her challenges with Staffing winter challenges with

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
How do we know where customers find out about us

292
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
And enacted first idea that we had worked on was really an idea towards helping them better understand where their customers

293
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
It was more of a marketing solution

294
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Amware

295
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,887
Put a tablet at the checkout and ask her simply when a customer was checking out

296
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
Or how did you hear about this

297
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
And I was actually the very first idea we weren't

298
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Alright so we're that I Diego what happened to it

299
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
We realize that

300
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
While it's a

301
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
Helpful idea

302
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
I'm that it wouldn't be the

303
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Fastest way to help small business so the maybe we can help until you where your customers are coming from and you can

304
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
Play more dollars into those marketing channels

305
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Maybe we can just getting more costume

306
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
And and that was when we started

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Gear shifting rr34 attention towards how do we do

308
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
So

309
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
How do you do it

310
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Well we started hearing about

311
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Challenges with delivery

312
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
And

313
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Delivering like

314
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,431
From restaurants Florist some retail stores industry bizarre because

315
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Deliveries been around

316
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Forever forever

317
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
And

318
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Yet

319
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Outside in New York City

320
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
I'm just Vanowen does delivery

321
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
85% of restaurants in America

322
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Don't deliver

323
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
See you were hearing from Room restaurant saying delivery delivery delivery and then

324
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
What to let me tell you that one customer said that this is a

325
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
A cake store owner

326
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
And her store is

327
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
5 Hertz router

328
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Maybe the size of your studio

329
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
And she would say things

330
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
About turning down tender

331
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
15 Motors

332
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,343
This is material this is very very mushy when you're making cakes expensive

333
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
And is a member of how many orders my mom would use

334
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
To do in her restaurant in Illinois

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
10 of 15

336
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
She was turning them down why

337
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
Because she had no way to deliver them

338
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
She didn't want to do it herself K she in a shoe she was a one-person show many of the days

339
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
She cannot afford to hire cannot afford to hire

340
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,663
And an in when she did try to hire you know she had this challenge of wild

341
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
You know

342
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Only sometimes with a driver's biz

343
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,879
Because you know when there was a spike in demand than the maybe the drivers very busy but the most days the drivers doing nothing

344
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,975
But she had to pay the driver obviously for for both the uptime in the downtime

345
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
She literally had copies

346
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Love

347
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Customers

348
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Payment for

349
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Formation and details

350
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
That she cannot fulfill

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
And so this is just crazy this is this is one America

352
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Turn down all these effing credit cards

353
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
And so that was really

354
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Turner eye towards

355
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Is there an opportunity in delivery if so what

356
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
So at that point

357
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
You guys start to do some research

358
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
To find out who did research to figure out

359
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Why is delivery not a thing

360
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,303
Outside in York City and the side thing we did was can we run a small pilot

361
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
You're at Stanford campus

362
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
To test our ideas on the 1st

363
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
We would do deliveries for

364
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Services like dominoes

365
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Or FedEx

366
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
And we would learn

367
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
How does deliveries actually work

368
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
What do you mean you would do delivery she would go and which is B drivers

369
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,319
Uou are you apply to Domino's real just be a driver you actually went to go

370
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Work for Domino's

371
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Yeah so you guys were

372
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Your students

373
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,511
Stanford Graduate School of Business but you also add these like part-time gigs

374
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
Working as drivers for FedEx in Domino's just

375
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Really to learn about how this works

376
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
We were just trying to figure out how delivery work

377
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
Has none of us had background

378
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Analogous

379
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
And so we learned a couple of

380
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Pretty interesting observations

381
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Is it the first to us was

382
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
Is so hard as a single store

383
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
To know how many drivers to put in the

384
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
You know if there's for example a football game at Stanford

385
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,255
Wait times would Skyrocket sure you know we would we would we would know what to do if you know how to flex out the number of drivers

386
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
And this will happen at a florist to

387
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
If there's Valentine's day good luck

388
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,935
You know we're calling this the store owners are literally calling

389
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
All of their families

390
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
And relatives is Denver flower delivery

391
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
You can't Flex up okay but then think about you know

392
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
A normal day of the week

393
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
We're literally were folding pizza box

394
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Set the drivers because

395
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
Isn't the volume until you have this

396
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Very

397
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Difficult and inefficient use

398
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Of expensive labor

399
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
Nana and sewage consumption

400
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,607
Is becoming more last-minute isn't it strange that the way these goods are brought to us

401
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Required dance

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,471
It is just this weird juxtaposition to us that says

403
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Maybe there's something here

404
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
And and soul

405
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
We set

406
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Let's just do something on Stanford

407
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Campus something simple

408
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
Let's pick one thing to deliver instead of trying to deliver

409
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Everything

410
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
Guichos restaurants

411
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Because

412
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
What people eat 20 to 25 times a week

413
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,839
And we had research that 85% of them did not do their own deliveries in fact all the restaurants we have spoken to in the Bay Area

414
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
0

415
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
And so

416
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
When we saw that we said well

417
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Okay is that because

418
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
Or is that because of something else and so that's what that was really the Crux of all we wanted to

419
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Alright so you decide to

420
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
To test this Theory out

421
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
And how end

422
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
What did you do

423
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
But what were you or were you offering in but how did you do it

424
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
So on Saturday

425
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Weave belts

426
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
A website

427
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Palo Alto delivery. You guys all knew how to do this

428
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,327
Weed edible building website

429
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Fairly straightforward

430
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
I'm and what we did was we put 8

431
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191

432
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
I'm Palo Alto delivery.

433
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
And a mom

434
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Local restaurant local restaurants

435
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,479
There was a Google Voice number that I sign up for that would ring cell phones of all of my classmates in NFL

436
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
And

437
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
And those at

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
So you end and did you partner with these restaurant you called me said hey

439
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
We do not do that did you ask your permission

440
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,303
Would you not eat dinner in the beginning that you just picked a restaurant State restaurants I'll be like today

441
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,423
There was Bangkok Cuisine which is a Thai restaurant there is Oren's Hummus which was a

442
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
How much do Middle Eastern hummus food

443
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
There was a Chinese restaurant

444
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
There was an Indian restaurant

445
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
I'm there was a salad bar

446
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
An end

447
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
People could call the number

448
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
And just order off the menu in and suit

449
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
How are you going to make money if the restaurants didn't know

450
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Who is Eva

451
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,439

I'm Soo

453
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
We would take the orders as

454
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Basically

455
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
Phone operators and we would do the deliveries or south

456
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
Was a janky webpage

457
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Can you call the number

458
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,151
Can you call the number say hello it's Tony from Palo Alto delivery may I help you yes and they would say sure I want

459
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
A big bucket of hummus

460
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
And some pita

461
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
And

462
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
You know some

463
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
Baba ghanouj music rate

464
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
And then how would you know how long it was

465
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:13,791
We will make it has to read it in the beginning would guess at least 45 minutes

466
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
And we drive to

467
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
The store call Oren's Hummus first Jose

468
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
On the way

469
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
And we would place the order

470
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,943
To pick it up on the half of the customer show up at the customer and use so I used to work at the square as well

471
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Well so take a

472
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Square card reader

473
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,367
Summer internship is square

475
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
Padme Scarlet Square card readers and with me

476
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,743
So I would plug into my phone and use that to

477
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Received

478
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,071
Ascension meaning you were just being reimbursed for

479
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
For buying there food at the hummus bar yes we weren't we weren't losing money we just weren't making meme

480
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
And how quickly the time you put it out there

481
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Until the time you're

482
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
Phones rang Tituba

483
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Did you start getting orders

484
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
We got our first

485
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Order

486
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
45 minutes after actually after lunch

487
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
And that was

488
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
Very pleasant surprise

489
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,975
The only way this customer could have found us was by typing in Palo Alto delivery into the browser

490
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Drinking her and finding a

491
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
Yeah and and you know this customer

492
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
Places an order at a at a Thai restaurant

493
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
I'm cuckoo delivery

494
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
A microphone near me

495
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
And then when you showed up at his place

496
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Did you say thank you so much for

497
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Grad students at Stanford Business School doing this research

498
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Or did you just say here's your food

499
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
We actually did the formal wear

500
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Taped all the

501
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,135
Oh yeah she ever ask for permission in that end with my phone and ask them how you

502
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
What About Us

503
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
You know that and a few other questions

504
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,583
He was like okay thanks for the food he was really friendly who's actually visiting author

505
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
And he was a bit of

506
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Tri-Rail spared himself

507
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
And an infuser supportive of avalor

508
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
So you

509
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Decide that you're going to keep

510
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
Keep this going

511
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Yes how are you if your Google

512
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
Voice phone was going to ring presumably

513
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
21st a day and the

514
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
You and your

515
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
Co-founders had to do all the deliveries

516
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
How did

517
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,647
And that works well as a bit of a limited term

518
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Service so we should we only offer

519
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,584
Conservice when we were not in class in Dakota

520
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
Killer acid

521
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Available

522
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
It in so this is this was certainly not

523
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
That is certainly

524
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Not a venture but

525
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
So how long did you guys do this for we did this

526
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
We did this

527
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
5 month

528
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
And what were you doing

529
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
I mean every time you were doing a delivery

530
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
Will you recording like how long it took you would you like a

531
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
Book or like a spreadsheet they were putting numbers in

532
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
Yeah but they're few things are said that it is three

533
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Major questions are mine.

534
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
Your number one was

535
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Do people want

536
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
How much

537
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Are people willing to pay

538
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Payforit

539
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
Number two

540
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
We were interested in ER restaurants in certain working

541
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,272
So as we started getting orders we would talk to the restaurant and ask him it is this something that you know

542
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Valuable

543
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,368
Is it either would you pay for the service AdWords

544
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
Instead of a customer paying a premium

545
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Will the restaurant pay you guys yes

546
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,280
And in the final question was

547
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
As you mentioned we were in class

548
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Set the timing so sometimes those diff

549
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,496
The cult I'm being in class and on a delivery at the same time and so we started trying to recruit

550
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Drivers

551
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
So we're trying to figure out what

552
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Can we do that

553
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
People be

554
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,248
The willing to use their own vehicles with people be willing to know how much

555
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Do they need to be

556
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Repay things like that

557
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Those are the three areas that were really

558
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
At what point did you and your co-founder say

559
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
This is our business

560
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
Where can I

561
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
What what

562
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
What information did you get

563
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Did you gather

564
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
I convinced you

565
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
This was going to be the same we're going to try to do

566
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Yeah I thought there wasn't there wasn't that moment what we're doing such little volume we were we were delivering

567
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,896
I may be 5 to 10 orders add a half of them from our friends

568
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
ATS home

569
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,272
Shirley from the data it would have been to

570
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
Too far a jump

571
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
Around 2 to say there's a business year

572
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
But you know I think two things kept us going one was just enjoying working with one another right and then second was

573
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,376
We kept getting positive answers to the questions we were asked

574
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,496
You know is this something that consumers wanted is the something that restaurants were willing to pay

575
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Or is this something that drivers

576
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
We're willing to

577
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Partnered with

578
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
And so

579
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
It was more incremental

580
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,504
Then and there wasn't these you know step-function jumps per se

581
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
We are very small service dog

582
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Did you strike a deal with any of these restaurants in that time too

583
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,232
Are you sure you didn't we did so some of them lecture will give you like a percentage of the sale all of them

584
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
But it's not what you were bringing them a whole lot of business

585
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,912
No the first check I remember cutting to a very popular store today

586
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
West Fort Wayne $1 and some change

587
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Machine is not scalable

588
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
It was not very scalable I'm in Newton

589
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
All things that summer

590
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
That we did we're not scalable mean

591
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
I remember graduating

592
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,112
From Business School

593
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
And two days later while my classmates were

594
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
Define down under exotic vacations

595
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
I was delivering you

596
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Hummus in my Honda

597
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
When we come back in just a moment

598
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,288
Italian shoe went from delivering a hummus in his Honda in Palo Alto

599
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616

622
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
So it's

623
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,768
2013 Antoni Shoes company Palo Alto delivery

624
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
It's really growing a whole lot

625
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,656
And it's clear he and his Partners need more money to make this

626
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
Food delivery service then grow

627
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,800
They decide to apply to the Y combinator accelerator program

628
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Aunt

629
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Well

630
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
They get in

631
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
So that's like

632
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Golden ticket

633
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Right

634
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,112
I don't know if we've used it as a going to take it as much as just the next step on the way to

635
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,928
You know of our project because of some very small

636
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,464
At the time we were

637
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,072
You were high-fiving each other when we did 20 orders a day right this yeah I'm not a very large serve

638
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
So it was certainly not obvious that

639
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Did that there would be this

640
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,776
So what does y combinator get you does it do they do they give you cuz I don't give you a whole lot of cash

641
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
They gave us $20,000

642
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
And then they get a small piece of ownership yes

643
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,480
And but you're in this thing which is very prestigious and of course all these

644
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,112
DC's are black vultures circling around y combinator looking for the next big

645
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Sing

646
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
Then what was 20000 bucks I mean

647
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
Was it still a webpage with

648
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
PDF

649
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,096
Of menus it was still White Pages

650
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,168
It got a little more sophisticated we we we

651
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
We evolved from the PDF

652
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Send an invoice

653
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,384
Two actual store Menu Pages for a customer can order it wasn't it was still all wet though

654
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Nothing on your phone

655
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
So so at the end of Y combinator

656
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
It culminates into

657
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
What's called demo

658
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,160
Yes where you pitch an infant with there before tea companies in in our group

659
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
And all three companies

660
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
Pitch in on stage to a group

661
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
Ambassadors

662
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
What's an investor

663
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm going to listen to this and I'm going to say

664
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Tony

665
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
You're really smart and impressive guy

666
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
You present really well

667
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,336
I just don't understand what the big deal like how is this going to be different than

668
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Is GrubHub in theirs

669
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
This and there's Daddy what are you offering

670
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
What did you say

671
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Set the

672
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Building link

673
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
6 pistols not a food delivery

674
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
And you know

675
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
Our goal is to

676
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Not just do food

677
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
But we need to start somewhere

678
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
And we need to show value from day one

679
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,448
And this is the best way to serve businesses

680
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
So how

681
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,800
Much money did you guys were you able to raise out of those

682
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Pictures

683
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Should we raise

684
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
$2000000 a two-point

685
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Pretty amazing

686
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,464
It was it was a bit of a harrowing experience because her bank account was doing the link quick laid to 10

687
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Between 10 and $20,000

688
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
I had that you know from grad school as didn't my co-founders yet I had a wedding also

689
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
Upcoming my own wedding that I was struggling to pay for it so I had to take a loan

690
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
Well that's true

691
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,664
So alright so what was that $2000000 1 to get

692
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
You got what I mean

693
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
You what did you need to do with that money

694
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
We needed to prove that the service was viable in a

695
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Indian market

696
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Brighten and in one area

697
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
So we chose

698
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
San Jose

699
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
But you couldn't do that with webpage you had to at this point I'm assuming

700
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Build an app

701
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah so so

702
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,728
After graduating y-combinator we launch harappans

703
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
First of the month after

704
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
What do you call Palo Alto delivery that pointer or doordash

705
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,968
Y combinator we launched as doordash come up with that name

706
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,808
So it was a bit of a nerdy experience but we

707
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
I feel fatter than I am

708
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,952
What would a few very simple criteria who wanted a name that is easy to spell

709
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
A name that was two syllables or less

710
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Whose domain name is available

711
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,888
And there's a three criteria and we run a script across

712
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,288
I'm doing at the crawl Mia many third-party services that list websites to go daddy's of the world and found

713
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
So for $9 and ninety

714
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,200
$0.05 realtor

715
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Purchase doordash.com

716
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
And who your driver

717
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
They're mainly ourselves

718
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,648
It was my co-founders and me and the early employees at doordash we did

719
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,440
All of the deliveries for the first

720
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Almost

721
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
To run the business and you are delivering

722
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Yes sound

723
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
So it was a

724
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
It wasn't exactly 24/7 but it was

725
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Very close

726
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
And

727
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
What was it that you were

728
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
In that year

729
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
Trying to figure out triangle

730
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
Information where you trying to gather

731
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,992
We're realizing that the most difficult part of what we do with

732
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Consumers Parkinson traps you

733
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Three parties

734
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Not just two

735
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Is that

736
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,184
You have to put a lot of products

737
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Consumers don't see

738
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
How do you get the order to the rest

739
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,608
How do you reconcile orders if they go wrong

740
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
What about

741
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,936
Payments how do you actually

742
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Tide of the accounting

743
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
That restaurants are already doing

744
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,848
How do you know which door you should be entering

745
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
If your driver

746
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,944
Delivering cuz all these things save precious

747
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Minutes

748
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
Which also saves money

749
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Forget 4

750
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Consumers because if we can save

751
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Cost out of the system

752
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
We can get lower fees

753
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,208
So who was doing all of the

754
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
Coding and the

755
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
The data analysis and

756
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Sucking all that stuff in an organizer

757
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
Michael Saunders LED engineering

758
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,544
And a lot of other early recruits we had an unfair advantage of friendship

759
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
We would happily hire a lot of friend

760
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Most of the.

761
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,944
Initial early Insurance Murphy still at doordash today

762
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,528
I'm black but that was really the early crew that built the product

763
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
How did you get the word out

764
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
About him

765
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
An n

766
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
How did unions start

767
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,304
We employed a packet that that that that that work for free while at Stanford campus which was at the

768
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Time we

769
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Weird print out flyers

770
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
I would stuff take out bags at restaurant

771
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Cheers that you're the challenge though

772
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
Printing is not free

773
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
And we

774
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
You know that that summer

775
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
When we were just testing this

776
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,200
Project out with printed out hundred thousand plus

777
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Copies of

778
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Fibro

779
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
Every single color printer

780
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,136
Campus and intensive into mystery right

781
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
School's Out

782
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Yo no students are supposed to be on

783
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
Campus but yet all the color printers in the tunnels need to be replaced every day

784
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,656
I'm innocent when we launched San Jose we did something very similar

785
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Printed out flyers and we

786
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,776
Are distributed them to the different restaurants in the restaurants got the word out

787
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,896
So will you on the phone all the times restaurant trying to

788
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Explain what you did

789
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Trying to get them to

790
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
Sign up with you or to partner with you

791
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
Absolutely I went door to door to door to sign up or first 50 restaurants

792
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,720
And and and later honey we we we we we evolved into phone calls and other

793
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Other ways of reaching the rest

794
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
After the first year

795
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
In San Jose

796
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,144
When did you decide okay this going to work what's glucose Annex City

797
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Hatsune

798
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Lexus San Jose

799
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,080
Over a 3/4 matter of time is growing very very very fast

800
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
And

801
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Once we discovered that

802
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
That's when we decided to

803
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
Raise our next round of financing to see if we can take the

804
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
Beyond the barrier

805
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
And you needed that money

806
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
Create new technology

807
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,000
The cranial technology by hiring people to hire salespeople

808
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,352
I'm when we launched into a city we have to make sure drivers on the road and so

809
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
Pay Dashers on the road

810
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
We have

811
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,264
To spend on marketing it was really

812
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
Top rated business we need at the Capitol

813
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
What's the time of this reminder because my understanding of doordash is

814
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,248
There's an app for the user like I have doordash on my phone

815
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,296
And then the restaurant has a different app

816
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
LS driver has a different

817
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
Yes that's a really expensive

818
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:09,792
Do all that back in technology it's even more complicated that we have to then build a lot

819
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Figure out how long it's going to take

820
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
For this delivery

821
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,472
What's it going to be for deep dish pizza versus a salad

822
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
What is it coming in the same order

823
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,360
How do you even start will you get into the lowest level of detail

824
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Tells you have to

825
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
So this is this is why

826
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,248
One of the best things that could have happened to our company

827
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
Every single person two deliveries

828
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
And customers

829
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
Every single day for

830
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,440
Actually we still do this today we do this again once a month instead of

831
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Yo everyday

832
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Every single person in the company

833
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
You become an expert

834
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
You learn about differences

835
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
You learn about the nuances of

836
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
How difficult is

837
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Parking versus

838
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
If the food is in a different aisle from the drinks from a different aisle from the desserts you learn how to Kool-Aid

839
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
You learn how to build that into

840
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
The software

841
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
So that you can scale us across country

842
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
It is like Stitch fix

843
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
Witches yeah they sell fashion But ultimately

844
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
You're really dead

845
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
Yes what were many ways where to find math

846
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,608
Play we we we are at we are collecting lots of information which one is

847
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Digitized

848
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
The physical world we're trying to understand

849
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Where is every

850
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Parking lot

851
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,544
Or try to understand where is every construction zone

852
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Wears Valley

853
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
Where's every elevator inside of a mall

854
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,712
And how does it work is the delivery fee is how much

855
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,552
The delivery fee is a range from a dollar 99 to 5

856
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
So did there's two ways that time doordash makes money on doordash make money from the consumer

857
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
So delivery fee than doordash make money from

858
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,792
The restaurant

859
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
And so

860
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
It's really you know the combination

861
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
I'm the next model work

862
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm serious like

863
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
When you

864
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
Think about

865
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
This

866
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
Disaggregated world we live in rice

867
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Can

868
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
This industry

869
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
The logistics industry

870
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Support

871
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,272
Doordash GrubHub ubereats

872
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,624
Postmates on and on and on do you think they can all coexist in that

873
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,696
What are do you think there's ultimately going to have to be one or two winners

874
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
So it is a very giant space as you mentioned

875
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,864
There are when we were doing our research trying to come

876
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
5 years ago there were 800

877
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,472
Plus companies just in third-party Logistics

878
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,824
I know we know about the FedEx's in the UPS is a horse in the Postal Service

879
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
There are

880
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
800 + companies just delivering parcels

881
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
That we research

882
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
And I'm sure around the country

883
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
The offline world is so much

884
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Bigger and disaggregated to your point

885
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,976
You're the second thing I would say is when you look at the

886
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Our current industry

887
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
The restaurant industry

888
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
It is not yet even online

889
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,448
95% of orders still happen through

890
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,264
A phone call or an in-person visit only 5%

891
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Occurs through

892
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
An internet connection

893
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
I know we talked about a lot of these other

894
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Services

895
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:10,272
But the fact of the matter is that we are in the very earliest endings baby gigantic industry

896
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
And we really remember started this all started because of a want and desire

897
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
Stop logo

898
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
It's also giving doordash

899
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
Clarity

900
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
To go and get all the detail

901
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Even the ones that don't seem scalable

902
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:31,264
There's for example late Cheesecake Factory that we deliver from in San Francisco

903
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
It's on the 6th floor

904
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Of them all of Mesa

905
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,408
Tamika in downtown

906
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
In Union Square in the shopping district it is very hard to make this delivery

907
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,136
And to make that one deliveries from that one store happen

908
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
With the find dedicated parking

909
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
That we negotiate with the mall

910
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
We have to find

911
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Dedicated access to the mall elevator

912
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
That only employees and actress

913
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
Received that we have to figure out how to

914
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,776
Get Waters from different stations because that's where sold a large

915
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
So to make that one store

916
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Happen I am losing sleep

917
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Just thinking about

918
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Trying to figure that out

919
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
There's just one problem

920
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,064
That's one of 242 Cheesecake Factory one of 200000

921
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
Tony I am really interested in

922
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Just up

923
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672

928
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,216
Different major investors wear your evaluation

Billion dollars

931
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592

Project confidence

935
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
And you got to believe in this thing but

936
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
That's a lot of pressure

937
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Does that feel like a lot

938
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Usher

939
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
It's a lot of responsibility but it's one that I feel very very

940
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Lucky

941
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
I mean

00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:05,216
He think about it are you just wired to think of it that way even

Shield diamond

944
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
So I don't necessarily focus on

945
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360

Why are we doing this

950
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
We're doing that because the business is on the streets

951
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,368

I guess when my brain

957
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Thinks about that

958
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,544

People going into stores

1000
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
We're still social creatures

1001
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,512
We're still going to go hang out with her friends or coworkers are spouses and partners

1002
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072

I mean it's different serve different

1007
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408
Measurements butt

1008
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
From what I understand

1009
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
You don't have the biggest market share

1010
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Reign of the biggest chunk of market share yet

1011
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,880
But I have to assume that the goal right to catch the greatest

1012
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Share market

1013
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Do you feel like you're

1014
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
Heading in that direction

1015
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
We've been the fastest growing service

1016
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
In space for the past

1017
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Here and

1018
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,776
Actually the biggest service in about 60% of the population in the u.s.

1019
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
So

1020
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,895
We have ground to cover as we were not the first service

1021
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
Wishing very very good about the tractor

1022
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,831
And we feel very good about the fact that

1023
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
The ideas that we had come up with

1024
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
A few years ago

1025
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
Around servicing merchants in the best

1026
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
Way I really prove

1027
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Proven that well

1028
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Can you even imagine

1029
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
What you would do afterwards

1030
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
Once a company goes public or

1031
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,055
Is sold whatever happens you know once everybody cashes out

1032
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
What do you think

1033
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
I haven't given that a lot of thought

1034
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
Yeah most of my days are

1035
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,783
Pretty obsessed over

1036
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319

1037
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111

00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
In the business we haven't given much thought about

1041
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
When I

Where am I going to have the most fun in the least regret

1047
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495

1048
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
That's

1049
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Women join today

1050
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
How much of your success to trip

1051
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
Scale and hard work

Intelligence and how much of what

What's happening

1054
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
Do you think it's cuz of black

1055
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
There's a lot of luck

1056
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Involved

1057
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
I'm in in shaping a lot of circum

1058
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,559
It is it's it's absolutely combination it's a short answer but but when I think back

1059
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
In my life

1060
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,655
I've come a long way on the shoulders of a lot of grapes

1061
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,727
Cool I was going to meet in school

1062
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751

1063
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:28,639
Things I studied in the past but somehow have magically made its way back into my life today

1064
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687

1065
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,247

Fortunate circumstances for me

1073
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,655
On foot side of course there's a lot of hard work

1074
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,983
And I think you know the hard work

1075
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
And skill

1076
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,103
Is is really not of one person

1077
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
And I think that's the thing that

1078
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,967
Sometimes people forget I think

1079
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
We live in a world where it's

1080
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063

And please do stick around because in just a moment

1110

First a quick thanks to one of our sponsors

1113
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Belching

1114
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,175
It might sound like MailChimp only does email marketing but

1115
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,991
They can do a lot more to help your business grow

1116
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,575
With landing pages audience management and automation

1117
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
MailChimp

1118
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
More than mail

1119
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:54,559
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1120
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
A Story begins

1121
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
Few years ago in Miami

1122
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Ashlyn cook

1123
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Airdog

1124
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
So my dog's name is Winston and he is a German Shorthaired Pointer he is liver colored away

1125
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,967
Ashlyn was working in Miami in the fashion business and Schmidt a guy named Dean

1126
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
Also had a pointer we started hanging out and running with our dogs taking the dogs to the beach and

1127
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Eventually it turned into more

1128
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,511
Ashland and Dean and the dogs Winston

1129
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
Eventually the humans in the story started dating

1130
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
Things are going great

1131
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
Then earlier this year Dean got a job offer in Boulder Colorado to Ashland decided

1132
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
The assigns

1133
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
Get out of Miami and head to the mountains

1134
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
To the four of them

1135
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
To humans to dogs

1136
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Relocated

1137
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
Ashland pet cigarette what's

1138
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:52,927
What to do next I really wanted to do something on my own I had had the entrepreneurial bug for over a year at that

1139
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Point and

1140
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,535
I knew I wanted to do something with dogs but with a little twist

1141
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,887
So we had bounce ideas off of each other for dog food

1142
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:06,751
And honestly I just thought of a food truck for dogs just came out of my mouth

1143
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,311
And we looked at each other like is that a thing

1144
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
Well it turns out food trucks

1145
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
For dogs work

1146
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
Nothing

1147
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,759
There were a few scattered across the country but nothing in Colorado

1148
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
To Ashland and gene pool together their savings they

1149
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
Get a loan from ashlyn's Dad and

1150
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
They bought a

1151
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Custom built

1152
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Trailer that

1153
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
Looks like one of those vintage models from the 1950s

1154
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
They have that iconic

1155
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,887
Paint job where half of the bottom is a different color

1156
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,983
And it has that canned ham shape with the rounded edges

1157
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
And after she ordered the trailer

1158
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:44,895
Ashland got together with the local Chef to come up with a bunch of recipes for healthy.

1159
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,223
With no salt no sugar no fillers

1160
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
And Winston

1161
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
Ashland pointer

1162
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
He was a good taste

1163
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,903
Tester for us because he is a picky dog of finding out like

1164
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,207
Okay he really like this one

1165
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,303
He didn't like this one I remember I tried to make a dried banana tree

1166
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,399
But he would put in his mouth and spit it out so I realize okay

1167
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
Winston does not like bananas

1168
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,031
But Winston didn't like some of the other treats actually came up with

1169
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:17,151
Pumpkin apple spice cookies zucchini squash biscuits and one of his favorites

1170
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
Bison burger jerky it is made with just three ingredients

1171
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
Ground bison which we do Source from a local bison Ranch

1172
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
Cranberries and organic flaxseed

1173
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:34,047
I know this stuff sounds like food you might order at one of those farm-to-table restaurants right but of course Ashley

1174
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
What is Target demographic

1175
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Was just dogs

1176
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,191
And the dog Centric nature of her business

1177
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Actually proved to be a problem

1178
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,567
When she started to apply for the permit she needed

1179
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
To launch the truck

1180
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,455
The most challenging part was defining ourselves as a new category

1181
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,551
A lot of the Cities would say what we only allow food trucks for humans

1182
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,647
Other cities would say well no one's ever come to us with.

1183
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,743
Type of business before we have no idea of how to define you guys

1184
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
So we ended up going the route of Jessie

1185
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Full on getting all the permits of a

1186
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Keep human food truck

1187
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,935
So finally this past June

1188
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:17,055
Ashland started parking the truck at breweries dog parks in farmers markets

1189
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Salt lamp holder

1190
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,639
And since then things been going pretty well

1191
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,991
Treats are popular and a major sign of customer buying

1192
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:30,367
A lot of the dogs are starting to recognize the truck oh absolutely stable

1193
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,207
Literally jump up to the counter with their two front legs and

1194
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,279
Stand up at the counter it is hysterical

1195
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327

1197
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
