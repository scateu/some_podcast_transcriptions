Okay Auntie this week show and this one got a

30
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
Ton of amazing feedback when we

31
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
First granite

32
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440

00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
How to replace the vacuum

35
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
A bag with a psychic thing I suggested

36
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Let me make some real money and they said okay

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
From NPR how I built this

38
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movement

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,528
Now that persistence and turn them into one of Britain's most successful

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Entrepreneurs

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
Just a question

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Who invented

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
The light bulb

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Thomas Edison right that is the name that

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Usually comes to mind

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Because Edison is

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Probably the most

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
Famous American inventor in history

49
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
He held the record for the

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
The most patents by a single person

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Actually invent the light bulb

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
Took the existing design for a light bulb

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Best light bulbs

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Only work for a few hours

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
In Edison

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
He made a much

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Much better life

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
That's basically what James Dyson

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Bed with the vacuum

60
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
A product that had been around for almost 80 years any product so associated with

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
1 brand

62
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Betty much

63
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
The English-speaking world

64
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
They're still called Hoover's

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
So as you're here

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
James Dyson

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Much like Thomas Edison

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Used a kind of trial and error design process

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
For that vacuum

70
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
A prototype in a shed in his backyard

71
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Tinkering

72
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Making small changes and then testing

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
In fact he made over 5000 prototypes

74
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Before perfect

75
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Journey as a

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Adventure started a long time before he

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Created his now famous vacuum

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
England right after the second world war with

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
His brother and sister

80
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
His dad was a classic teacher

81
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
Boarding school but one chance was about 9 years old

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Is Dad

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Died of cancer

84
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
My mother

85
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Saurik coming news

86
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Then we we didn't

87
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
It was more of a

88
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
What's the price to Austin it was too high

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Very private Kyrie.

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
When trained as a teacher and

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Teaching

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
The school which is the school

93
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
We have to pay to go to the one with your dad

94
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
Boarding school

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
United States Navy had insurance

96
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Being a little time

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
So the school said where you can come

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Us borders

99
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
App for free

100
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
We had a free education

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Atlanta Craigslist

102
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
R35

103
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,464
Money and comfortable family as yet had a good education

104
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,815
She got to deliver this boarding school which is

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
Probably pretty harp music

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Is a kid

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Lost your dad

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
What do you remember about it

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,823
I might have one thing that was it was quite difficult because I was at school in my father tortured

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
School

111
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
There was a memorial service for him much

112
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Which of course

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Old school hat

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Pretend I didn't see the boys but if you want it

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Decatur

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
Set match lot to me but no Norful.

117
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
The boys around me

118
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
And indeed I think getting away to boarding school

119
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Just office

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
It died

121
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Got should have stayed at home

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Amen my brother and sister

123
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
And my mother

124
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
That was probably a pretty harsh thing to do to a nine-year-old

125
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,727
But this side are in England. Do not sending people away to boarding school

126
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
Will toughen them up

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,871
Probably does.

128
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
So I had to remind myself unless anybody else

129
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
And I think it makes you very determined

130
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,391
Very very determined to prove something

131
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
The teams wasn't quite sure how he would eventually prove himself and after you finish school

132
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
He managed to get a spot

133
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
The Royal College of Art in London

134
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
And he decided to study Furniture Design

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
And then architecture and structural engineering and his first job out of college was for Fairly promise

136
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
British engineer and inventor named Jeremy fry

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
I just got married

138
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,391
And he says well I'll give you a design Joel 2

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,255
And what was it about the you that interested him and why would he offer

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,631
Utah light employing young people

141
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,239
What Bryson pedal the right attitudes and ideas so he gave

142
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Opportunity for young people

143
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
So I started designing one to two things

144
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
The third thing I designed for him

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
What's this high-speed landing craft

146
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
This was a

147
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
A Moonlighting

148
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Java TV

149
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Because his main business

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Was making valve actuator

151
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Oil and gas pipeline

152
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
This was his iron

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Invention

154
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
He had a side gig that was

155
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Inventing

156
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Boats

157
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
Well that just hit invented a boat

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
The theory was that flat bottom boat

159
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Is the most efficient

160
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Planing Hull

161
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
It's not very good in Heavy Seas be on this year

162
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
But because it's

163
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
I'm flat

164
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,247
Why is Robert custard

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
In those World War II movies when it's storming the beach of Normandy

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Yes except

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
That those are not flat.

168
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Oak that fish shaped house which is why you see the troops I mean to Wade through chest-high water in order to get to the

169
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
West we could land Streisand

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
So he had this idea to build

171
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
This landing craft

172
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Car transport craft

173
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
That and he said that you hate

174
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
I got this idea can you

175
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
How to design

176
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
And that's exactly what you said

177
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
It was a simple as that

178
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Because

179
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
I've never designed a boat

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
And I'd ever designed anything in fiberglass

181
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
And a butthead.

182
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
I'm free this wonderful attitude

183
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
You think

184
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Think about doing something you just do it

185
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
Any hated experts

186
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,543
Did he teach you how to make things because of her designer

187
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
How how does that work

188
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,663
But yes he did I mean we've taught how to make things at college

189
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
But about one thing we went to his house of wealth and we have to make a prototype

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
He's supposed to weld atossa. Caldwell

191
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
He said book gun try

192
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
So I just went off and did it

193
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,351
Like you described a of a welding autodidactic welding Iron Man Welding courses

194
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
I saved a life

195
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
How to use engineering tools

196
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
By myself

197
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
So you have your prototype end and does fry say

198
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Let's try Sally let's put this out on the market

199
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
A pretty much that

200
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
And I said I'd that I know nothing about selling he's as well be ridiculous you designed every Square minute

201
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
Tomato head every Nuts and Bolts

202
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
You know everything about it Sagat and sell it

203
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
Which is what I'm

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
And who's buying it was it

205
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
Was it designed for the military initially

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
Well minute for use construction use oil companies

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
As a diving platform

208
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
As a brick building

209
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
So it had many many uses

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
And

211
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,943
I mean within a couple years we were selling a hundred or more yeah

212
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Very successful business

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:58,111
Why was it was a very fortuitous meeting early in your life that

214
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
She was older than me

215
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Oh yes yeah yeah some 20 years old

216
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
The Father prayer

217
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
Mental

218
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Taught me everything I know

219
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
So I guess you worked with

220
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
With Jeremy fry for a couple years and then at a certain point

221
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
You decide

222
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
You don't want to come see if I can start my own business

223
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
High for 7 years

224
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
It all

225
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
And he offered

226
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
The fun man I said that

227
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Sorrento designs

228
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Anime

229
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Bull barrel

230
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Pictures of wheelbarrow

231
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
The ball inside of a wheel can come up with an idea to design a

232
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
New kind of wheelbarrow

233
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Well because I was fixing up the house

234
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Doing a garden

235
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
And I noticed

236
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
The deficiencies

237
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Metal wheelbarrow Wheels

238
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
That's why they unstable is binary legs

239
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
The Lexington to soft ground will sink into salt

240
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
So as I used one

241
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
I started to redesign

242
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
And it was quite a good project

243
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
To do

244
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
As my first business

245
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
It's because it is relatively simple

246
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
At least I thought it was some

247
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
What was it what was different.

248
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Well it had this big

249
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Balloon

250
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,767
What was that

251
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
It was actually a plastic football

252
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
It's quite interesting past

253
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,615
Buy some purple rain

254
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,711
This 360° rotating ball and it would it was more stable

255
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
And it was most stable it didn't sink into breaking ground in your garden that didn't damage your loan and it cuz it didn't sink on

256
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
Why are wheelbarrows like that today

257
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
The difficult thing that's been sending

258
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Because

259
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
The traditional

260
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
Hardware stores is I wear then and a few garden centers

261
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
They didn't want to sell it

262
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
So I used to sell it to Little Adventures Benson the newspaper

263
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
There's always next incontinence

264
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Cancellable miss Kiss

265
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
They would be the sad part 4

266
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
The wilbury strange molten looking at you nicely designed I think real better

267
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
And I started to get checks

268
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:15,327
See how this company the ballbarrow and seems like it's going pretty well so well that never made Monday

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
What happened there's no money in real virus

270
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
A very good lesson to learn

271
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Not many people buy wheelbarrows

272
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Types of very small Market

273
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
I will bear spray cheap

274
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
No wheel bearing

275
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
Manufacturer has a Salesman or designer or an engineer

276
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
They just make the same thing they made

277
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah with the yeah

278
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
And we have to explain why it's different than Besa

279
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
That was so fun I mean

280
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Pictures sent to the market

281
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
But never made me money

282
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:46,559
Should I should have charged a lot more understanding is that you actually went when you took in investors

283
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
You kind of gave the patent over.

284
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
The company is that right

285
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
I signed the passengers that company

286
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Which was possibly mistake

287
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Yeah why why'd you do that

288
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Well it's quite normal to sign the past

289
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Tow company

290
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
That you work for

291
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
As I do not know

292
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Wake up with all my

293
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Jennifer Walls

294
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Feathered vest

295
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Just came in

296
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
And

297
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
The thing was that I didn't really own anything

298
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
In the company of puffins

299
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
And I know I need about 50 Cent's the business

300
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
That must have been frustrating and here's your your idea comes out of your brain and you don't even own your own ID

301
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
No but

302
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Sometimes one needs to go through

303
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
These Rites of Passage

304
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
To understand the importance of

305
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
The importance of a name

306
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
Having a majority share in your in company or even olish as

307
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Not charging enough for the product

308
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Running a business doesn't make money

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
All these lessons of a very important lessons to learn

310
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
And feel this Saturday

311
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
I guess it was around the time of You Are

312
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Wanting to

313
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Make new products right to what

314
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
What were you thinking of

315
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
Well I've had the idea for the vacuum

316
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
It's a long story Beltran

317
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
Keep it very short

318
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
The frames for the wheelbarrow

319
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Instead of

320
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Painting them with

321
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Wetpaint

322
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,295
That we had elected to use a thing called epoxy KC

323
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
But the way you get the epoxy on

324
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
The frames is the spray the powder

325
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Electrostatic

326
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
I will back frame is REI open

327
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
Thanks a lot of the surprise going to miss the frame

328
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
And have to be sucked away

329
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
Robinhood it go whenever the factory

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Say you have a job

331
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
The back of a spray booth

332
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Sucking away

333
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
Vape out of this mr. Frank

334
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
Michael is very inefficient

335
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Kind of people who made this

336
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Equipment

337
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Smart people used

338
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
And I love that use John site times

339
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
I've seen John Sykes

340
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Samsung Sol Mills

341
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Eclectic

342
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Find soda

343
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
So I'm going to cop it one of those

344
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,863
But I saw like Fullmetal I climbed over the wall at night and took some soda measurements

345
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Examined

346
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,239
I mean came back and gave it two weekends we made one that was about 34 High

347
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
How does a cyclone actually work

348
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,895
Cycling is littering outside online

349
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
You have to blow into the system

350
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
The most out of the system

351
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
But it is exactly why in Buffalo

352
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
I meant that spins around the world

353
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Are the actors off of centos

354
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Military discount gets into the center

355
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
Because it's too busy spinning around the walls of a buffalo

356
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
By centrifugal force

357
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
That's the basic principle

358
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,263
And cycling for widely used in the industrial vacuum machines at work

359
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Cleaning factories

360
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
It was widely used

361
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Cement factories

362
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
Paint factors oil filter places that had lost it.

363
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,271
That had to be sucked away by the central vacuum system

364
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
Assume that this is a very good example

365
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
But you seal the ducting

366
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Sucking away from all the souls never

367
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,743
Set to on the roof by the 8th you say a site plan

368
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Huge metal cycling

369
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
How do you connect that to a

370
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
Well

371
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,239
Over the two weekends while I'm welding out this 34 Highway

372
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,543
I realize the point of this song

373
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Which is that it collects dust all the time

374
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Without blocking o clock

375
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
I wondered

376
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
If you can make a small bottle and put it in a vacuum cleaner

377
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
So when I finish the welding I rushed home

378
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
I made a miniature one

379
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Call Boden

380
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
Scotch tape

381
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
And connected it with a piece of hose

382
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
To my Hoover

383
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
And bushes around the house

384
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
Anticipates work

385
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
99

386
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,455
What just explain to me what was the

387

Problem with a regular vacuum cleaner in a bag of me that you were you frustrated by then did you hate vacuuming like

388
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
He was It was a

389
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
Problem with vacuum cleaners at these

390
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Is basalt

391
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Well

392
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
Just put my retirement and time

393
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
We had a vacuum cleaner

394
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
. board what was

395
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Bills

396
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Is the most powerful

397
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
In the wild

398
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
Episode of spaceship shape

399
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
About to fussen diameter

400
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
For the huge motor

401
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
PayPal

402
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Anthem

403
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
I was using it one weekend to the suction MS

404
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Professor

405
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Thai massage nearby

406
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
I couldn't find any

407
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
So I took the back out

408
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Under the end

409
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Contiprocontact salt into the

410
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Garbage can

411
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
And put it back in the vacuum

412
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Michael

413
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
This is great

414
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
How to get rid of eye bags

415
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
I just don't

416
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
I don't know better suction

417
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
6 divided into the bag at Wilson duffle bag is

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Completely empty

419
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
I still have no socks

420
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Buy some new bags

421
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
Okay back I'm putting it and you back in

422
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
And I got good socks

423
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
So I thought to myself what's the difference between

424
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
The one I've emptied

425
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
I'm the one I just bought

426
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
And I look

427
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Lackawanna

428
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
And you can see

429
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
In my mind I

430
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Is the poison

431
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
In the back what blocked

432
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Respond.

433
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
So I suddenly realized

434
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
What was going on here

435
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
You replace the bags because they blocked

436
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Yeah

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
And I thought there must be a better solution

438
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
So at that time.

439
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,159
House for sale because you're still involved in that in the ballbarrow company which had

440
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Investors Jeff goes Batman say

441
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,815
Hey I got this this vacuum cleaner idea to look at what I suggested

442
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
The idea to the other tractors let's make this vacuum cleaners

443
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:50,591
They they didn't what they said was that was a stupid if there was a passive vacuum cleaner Hoover

444
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Will someone else would have made it is a huge comfort

445
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
Because

446
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,415
I thought

447
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
Improve the technology

448
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,119
Yeah quite happy salad bags

449
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
I think my suggestion that we make a vacuum cleaner the final straw they kick me out

450
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Phone company

451
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
I was unable to start developing I went back to my friend Jeremy fry until

452
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Are there for vacuum Finney voters

453
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Excellent so he put up

454
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,191
49% the capital of borrowed 51% from the bank how much to get tomorrow

455
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,263
Well it was about forty or fifty.

456
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,383
You did not have any of your

457
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
A big mortgage

458
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
3 kids

459
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,295
So I started making prices

460
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Lights.

461
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Recycling

462
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Where did you do this

463
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
In the shed behind my house

464
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
So you

465
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Did this in your backyard

466
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
Yes and you borrow the money for the money

467
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Lydia was little

468
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
Like start selling these things

469
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
Yes but what I thought

470
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,055
We thought rather was that we'd get it to work and then with licenses

471
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Adele someone like

472
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
C URL

473
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Trying to build this and you're doing this day and night

474
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Yes

475
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Nice butt

476
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:42,463
I would like was it like trailer trailer was it

477
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
Exactly that it was empirical in Thailand Perico cuz this is before the days of

478
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Computer simulation

479
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
Iris building 1 prototype

480
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
That's what I'm making one change it

481
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Time

482
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
I need what if

483
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
That one change made

484
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
I'm Sorry by progress

485
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
The requested number problems to solve

486
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Firstly

487
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
About time state-of-the-art

488
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Was the cycling

489
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,879
Only good at separating dust. About 20

490
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Because I had to get it down to Hoffa

491
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Cigarette smoke

492
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
That was the first problem

493
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
And the second thing was that

494
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
I found it

495
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Has

496
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
I'm fly

497
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
But got straight through the sights

498
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Not be collected

499
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
And I built 5127 privatized

500
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
Before I got it right

501
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Iterating and doing this in your backyard

502
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,623
How are you earning a living how are you paying your bills how are you

503
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
Providing for your family

504
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
Well the money that I borrow from the bank

505
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
And the money that

506
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,095
Dairy-free protein was essentially paying my salary

507
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Plus a few costs

508
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
Can I get the cost to a minimum

509
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
And once you got a prototype

510
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Up and running

511
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,919
Did you go around and try to pitch the vacuum company's executive at Target

512
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
Container companies in one or two other domestic plants company

513
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
But

514
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
Beijing really want to do anything they didn't want to change

515
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
I wanted to Adam said that she rather like selling paperbacks it's like a

516
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
Essentially they were curious but didn't want to license

517
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
How bad did your financial situation get pretty bad

518
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
What's up we both had skills I'm she's an autistic

519
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
And she could always teach awesome

520
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Which country did I do something even cost lessons

521
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
And I could always on money maker

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,840
We had practical

523
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
But we had that back up

524
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
But with all of those companies

525
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
UCSB companies telling you

526
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Not really interested

527
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
Did you ever get nervous did you ever think about your

528
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,296
Packing it all in and then end in going getting a safe job as a designer for big company

529
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
Think like react

530
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Has the office

531
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Suspect

532
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
And I can see that they what time.

533
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
What is a good idea

534
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Without good reason

535
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
I think it's a really good reason then I would have gone there

536
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,776
What about your friends and family work when using teak oil full size mattress

537
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,872
Weird thing that he thinks it's going to be a big deal

538
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Obsessed mad

539
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
But the thing is never to take advice is amazing

540
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Even

541
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Some of the most

542
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
Successful entrepreneurs that have been on the show

543
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
I had sleepless nights they were

544
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Bad anxiety about

545
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
About what

546
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Well I did I didn't I did

547
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Thoughts

548
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
I haven't sold a basic belief

549
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
I think partly from

550
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Success

551
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Apropos

552
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
I'm from

553
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
They

554
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,592
High-speed landing craft which a lot of people wouldn't buy it because it didn't look like a baby

555
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,944
Having having introduced to very strange looking very different

556
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
You technology

557
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
You can make a successful

558
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
If it genuinely works pyside

559
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
Coming up the story of how James Dyson's design for a new vacuum

560
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
No one wanted to manufacture

561
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,352
Eventually became one of the best-selling vacuums

562
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
In the world

563
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,472
Gyros near listening to how I built this

564
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
NPR

565
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Hey everyone just a quick thanks to

He says

598
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,432
Play Welcome Back to how I built this from NPR

599
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
1985 companies to try and licenses new vacuum

600
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
None of them are interested and most don't even return his phone calls but finally

601
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
That year a small company called Apex decides to try making and selling Dyson's design

602
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
In Japan

603
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Yes

604
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Very small Japanese company

605
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
Never made anything before in his life

606
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:52,384
To make it for them

607
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
And they were to sell it

608
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
What does it look like compared to what

609
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
We think about Dyson

610
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Cleaner today

611
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
It looks much like

612
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
Upright machine

613
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
James accept his pink

614
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
And it has a lot of exposed hoses

615
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Bit like the pompidou building in Paris

616
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
So you can see exactly what the school

617
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,472
Quite similar to the early Alpine machines we sold here

618
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Tattletale

619
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,104
Well I think considering it was $2,000 it did quite well

620
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
Rick isn't like today's dollars is like six thousand bucks

621
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:32,320
It's a lot of Monday it's a lot of money I unfortunately there was some quite rich Japanese people.

622
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,648
What is the licensing agreement with the chapel

623
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Enough money to pay

624
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
Well yes it save me from Bank

625
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
They put it that way

626
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,704
See you if you license to to this company and they were kind of selling okay

627
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
What made you at a certain point

628
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
I should try and sell these myself

629
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,384
Well I was sending some

630
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
That's a ridiculous high price

631
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
It didn't really satisfy me because

632
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
I wanted to sell a loss of a reasonable

633
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
So I

634
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
Set Blackhawk Credit go on like this license

635
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
People that suck

636
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
I want to make

637
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
But I can say that I want to design that I can do I want

638
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
And I want to sell it in the way that I want to sell it

639
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
So I decided to

640
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
Barcelona

641
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
I was not completely on my own eyeballs house

642
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Germany flag

643
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,920
My partner and I went well. Able to try and borrow money to start my own business

644
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
I thought I caught a good track record

645
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Designed the new technology

646
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
Lycosa successful licensee in Japan

647
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,624
And I thought that I oatmeal to raise money

648
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
The problem with

649
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Adventure capitalist

650
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Is that they all thought that because I was in engineering design.

651
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
I knew nothing about making and selling

652
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
Things that I could possibly make

653
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,776
So they will tie me down

654
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
But which I mention eternally grateful because I'd have to get an equity I went to a clearing Bank

655
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
And by some miracle they agreed to lend me $600,000

656
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
But I also the bank manager off to us and he said

657
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
Well I would want a big lawsuit

658
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
I saw that you had two termination there's a lawsuit in America

659
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
With someone who copies

660
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Oh so I buy this point

661
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Somebody already copied your idea

662
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
Yes my photo of five-year lawsuit

663
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,592
Reminders to settle it very successful

664
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
Name something is this bank manager. He lost his wife what you thought of the fact that didn't have back

665
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
And she said one.

666
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Exactly what I want

667
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Determination

668
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
To win a lawsuit

669
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
That's his wife.

670
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Light bags infection

671
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
And presumably you had to put some collateral down like your house

672
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
The house exactly

673
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,960
My wife and I had to sign the house over to the bank getting nervous for you

674
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:01,312
Thinking about that

675
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Enza

676
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Off Highway until I had

677
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
That's a very small amount of money

678
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
To build the tooling

679
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
And it cost the whole of the six

680
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:16,160
1000 pounds sterling is the

681
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,464
Plastic into the makeover component okay

682
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
Now one of the things about tuning is it you

683
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
If you make any changes

684
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
That's where the tool make and makes all his money

685
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
It's like a builder

686
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
She make changes to build

687
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Stockpiling

688
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
I said to my

689
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
Feather engineer

690
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,872
This is it I'm going to my money so this is it

691
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
It changes

692
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
We goes out tooling

693
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
And I put the tuning in a plastic

694
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Plastic

695
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
Are there any reusing hallstatt Factory

696
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
I said can I use the other half

697
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
To assemble the vacuum cleaner

698
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
And I said yes

699
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
So I had

700
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
In a few people that dig this assembly and Thrift

701
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Foraged

702
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Myself

703
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Rihanna

704
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
One salesperson

705
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
And1 money person

706
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008

Make the pots and I paid them

708
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
At the end of 60 days

709
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,432
And so I had to go and get some motorcycles some orders

710
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,992
How how did you sell who did you sell them

711
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
How did you know where to go

712
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Well when I went everywhere

713
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Nobody would take it but

714
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
In those days the web mail order catalog

715
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
Remember the Sears mail-order.

716
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Well I will

717
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,328
What's Black Sails but in England one or two people who have catalogs like

718
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
That is because

719
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
I spent a day with Abaya

720
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,240
Who was so curious about this funny man

721
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,616
Instead of yellow and silver

722
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
I spent a David

00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Anthem

724
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
The end of the day he said

725
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
Why should I put your vacuum cleaner

726
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,440
An isotope because you're boring

727
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
I just looked at a long time and then you said okay I'll give it a guy and he have to be the biggest metal

728
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,448
How much are you selling it for

729
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,776
199 lb

730
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
3 * what are those

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Vacuum cleaner for sofa

732
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,456
Didn't any of these these catalog company say this is just too expensive is to

733
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Jurassic

734
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
I will know the price is concealed because you paid on the drip

735
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
You paid the same amount per week

736
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
So they did not show the

737
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
The full price all you could have

738
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Baseball print

739
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,840
But why would somebody take a risk on something that was untested that they did not

740
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Ever seen before through

741
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Catalog

742
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,496
Because it it look different at his promise with no loss of suction

743
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Identify bags

744
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
And everything goes into another

745
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Catalog

746
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
Set my first

And then I got into quite a famous job coach John Lewis department stores

749
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
Looking to compete with a big Alexa

750
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
4 multiples

751
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
They wanted something different

752
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
For which they could charge more money

753
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
But it's very quick

754
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
And this was

755
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
1990

756
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Trey

757
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Not tonight stream

758
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
So how long

759
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
WhatsApp before you wreck

760
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
I was in the black

761
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
From the first month

762
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
On

763
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
I was going to pay my employees

764
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
And let making a profit

765
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
As my distributions.

766
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,720
And I I could any get into the shops if I promise to advertise on television

767
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,768
How did you do that as of the money to do that

768
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Well I did

769
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
So I said to

770
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
The first retailer

771
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
I said good luck

772
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
If you order 10000

773
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
I'll put all the profit on

774
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,056
Isn't the television

775
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Which I did

776
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm sorry my strapline the banding to say goodbye to

777
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
The bag say goodbye the back so I have this woman explaining

778
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
The Dachshund

779
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Police auction

780
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,600

781
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Ndk wax

782
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
Ritz Naples

783
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
From that

784
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
I guess within 2 years

785
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
This vacuum cleaner

786
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,960
By 1995 this becomes the number one selling vacuum cleaner in the UK

787
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Yes

788
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:20,640
Were you just blown away or you or we just think of yourself

789
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
You just have to carry on

790
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Rialto

791
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,624
A new fashion lots of a canister version

792
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
I'm really starting to export

793
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
How much revenue

794
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:39,072
Were you making by the time you or the number one best selling back in the UK what was he had no Revenue

795
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
Hundred billion dollars

796
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
In 2 years

797
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
That's incredible

798
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Guess I mean it it's up

799
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
It's a very steep draw

800
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
And that doesn't happen

801
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
It's happened of course in the tech world that mean this is a real

802
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,552
This is a real thing that people can buy and take home

803
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
We're making real money

804
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Answer

805
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
See people buying the vacuum

806
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
And liking it

807
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Commenting

808
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
It was tremendous that that was actually much more exciting

809
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
And how did you get into the US market which is your

810
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,216
I guess became your biggest Market in the world

811
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Yes

812
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
The first year we didn't do any effort

813
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
But even getting in with different

814
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
Because everybody said I what you might have been successful

815
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
America's height difference

816
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
And then

817
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
Junior buyer

818
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
At Best Buy

819
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
I took mine off at

820
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
For couple of weeks

821
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
I'm said to her boss

822
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
Look is that she is what it says it is

823
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
It works really well and it doesn't

824
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Police auction

825
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Best Buy

826
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Took it

827
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
End

828
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
The first year we didn't do any appetite

829
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Sold

830
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Pretty well

831
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
This is like 2002-2003

832
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Exactly

833
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
And then we started getting into bondage

834
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Let's say we decided to put all that money

835
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
I love you bestie

836
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
Intuitive

837
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
And so it wasn't my suggestion

838
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
The summer set

839
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
But why didn't you do that

840
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
Explain what you did and why you did it

841
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
Just like you on TV

842
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Mets on TV

843
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
Taking a vacuum cleaner apart Shanghai TalkBack

844
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
And then chain

845
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Am I psychic

846
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
And you know that Americans are suckers

847
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
S4a

848
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
British accent

849
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
Well I didn't know that

850
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
How about you

851
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Why does it suction

852
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
And why mine doesn't

853
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
There is a spider by simple approach

854
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Michelle sturgeon

855
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
My house

856
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
And it was a very successful

857
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
We started selling very fast

858
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Good

859
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
As you grew and grew and grew and grew I mean eventually

860
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
You began to sort of expand out to

861
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
A whole range of products mean

862
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Air filter

863
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Bladeless

864
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Fan

865
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
Anybody was gone to a sports arena

866
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
Orem movie theater in the US or Sterling the US and probably

867
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Elsewhere

868
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Has use the Dyson hand dryer that you

869
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
You just put your hands in and out of

870
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,392
Begin to expand other products

871
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,440
Well fast meet at the fan

872
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Bladeless fan

873
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Explain that to me

874
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
Yes yes

875
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
You accelerate the Iran

876
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
That draws another

877
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Event

878
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
Expand

879
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
Volume

880
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,336
That you're creating a new create a negative pressure

881
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Suck from behind

882
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
So you pull it more

883
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
So you end up

884
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
Multiplying the original AR-15

885
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
20 *

886
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Are simplified

887
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
But that's the basic Prince

888
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,256
I am not sure I entirely understand it but it is amazing

889
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
To see that thing works

890
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Participants who

891
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Blow

892
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Really powerful

893
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah

894
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
And of course you have no blades

895
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,640
I'm curious about your the way you learn business because you really are an inventor

896
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
And designer

897
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
And you don't strike me as somebody who's interested in

898
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
Administering a company you're doing the book

899
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,440
Sore bunch of meetings or maybe you are are you how do you do those all those things

900
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
Well I have to do all those things

901
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Beginning

902
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Better

903
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
As the company grew I

904
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
Did more and more the engineering

905
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,472
And now I spend it at 95% of my time doing that

906
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,056
But I was the CEO for the past 10 years

907
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
Absolutely happy

908
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
Doing anything other than engineering

909
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,456
I will do those other things if they need to

910
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Do I still resent the time I'm doing that

911
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
I wish I could be with my engineers

912
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,696
I think I really love doing I'm doing what I think is the most important thing

913
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Did you feel a sense of

914
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Secretly a sense of

915
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
Schadenfreude that you

916
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,960
Or right and the people at the ballbarrow company were wrong and those

917
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,056
Other vacuum companies were wrong when they turned you down do you secretly think

918
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
No no I'm on to the next thing I'm going to

919
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,432
Everybody makes mistakes

920
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
50% what I do is

921
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Wrong

922
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Actually that great

923
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Mistakes great

00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Cast of The Bold Mariner

925
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Namaste

926
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
I've never made the mistake of giving away equity

927
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,840
You own 100% of it you don't have to answer to shareholders

928
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Venture capital

929
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
That's wonderful

930
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Pretty simple

931
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
You are

932
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Just two people understand

933
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
Cuz you went from being deeply in debt

934
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
In your early 40s really having nothing

935
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
No money and

936
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Weekend

937

Private yacht

940
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
I mean that's

941
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Crazy 8

942
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
To think that not that long ago

943
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
In middle age

944
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Yuan

945
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
Yes yes it is

946
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
Anyway that it's

947
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
I find it quite nicely

948
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Much later in life

949
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
I think it would be very different

950
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Had to happen.

951
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
And you guys are still big wrist protector

952
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Developing electric car

953
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
That's a huge fun

954
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
But I am able to do it and that's the big difference

955
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Hi I am able to

956
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Take a long time for you

957
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
And invest large sums of money

958
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
And take big risks

959
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
Huge privilege to be in that

960
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024

00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
Because

970
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Lucky's around

971
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,904

Succeed by doing huge amount

And then having great stamina

976
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Understanding that

977
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Other people say finna

978
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144

979
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424

Accelerate

981
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
That's when you start weaning

982
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Yeah

983
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Waze

984
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
Developing new technology that

985
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
When you feel like giving up

986
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,736
Is precisely the point everybody else gets up

They said he was knighted in 2006 the latest Forbes estimate puts his net worth at 5

992

1015
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,407
Hey thanks so much for sticking around

1016
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Time now for how you built that and today we're going up to the story that begins with a TV producer named Mike's

1017
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Sorrentino

1018
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:07,231
As part of his job Michael be out in the field using his smartphone to take pictures for his company's website

1019
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
I would be in a place like Louisiana after the

1020
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
BP oil spill

1021
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
I was constantly having to wipe smudges from my camera lens

1022
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
I really good shots meanwhile people were starting to worry about whether cameras in your phone could get hacked and

1023
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,319
I kept wondering things

1024
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:37,183
Do you have a camera that you carry around all day everyday but it doesn't even have a lens cap

1025
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:42,559
So Mike figured he would design an iPhone case where you just slide a switch of the top

1026
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:48,959
Cover up the camera lens and on the inside of that lens cover is a fabric lining in it also wipes the lens clean

1027
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
How many smudges

1028
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,311
Show a pretty great and simple idea

1029
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,639
Around four years ago when Mike first thought of that be said

1030
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
First thing

1031
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
I got a patent this good that attorneys really expensive

1032
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
My wife gave me the great advice of

1033
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
Do some side work

1034
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:10,207
And find a way to finance your invention

1035
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,327
Meanwhile he worked with an engineer who helped take his paper sketches and make a

1036
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,423
Prototype with a 3D printer but at the same time

1037
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
He was getting some pushback

1038
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,311
Even close friends were like this is a dumb idea

1039
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Why are you doing

1040
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:32,735
Right people keep saying hey bike your TV producer why are you trying to break into the iPhone accessory business

1041
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
The mic says they

1042
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Kind of had a point

1043
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Yeah I'm not one of these

1044
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
OtterBox or Speck or one of these major brand phone case companies who gets the specs in the designs of these phones

1045
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:47,327
Before they come out so I got to wait for the phone to come onto the market

1046
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,727
Then I've got to go to the Apple Store and measure it and then send it to the engineering that it's a lot of back

1047
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,311
By the end of 2014 with the help of

1048
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
$20,000 that you raised on Kickstarter

1049
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:06,527
I found a factory in China to make his first run of iPhone 5 and 5s cases with lens caps

1050
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
MN

1051
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Somebody give him a tip

1052
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:15,231
Somebody said to me if your products already in January you have to go to the Consumer Electronics Show you how

1053
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Have to be at CES

1054
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
So that's what my did he got away the camp out in someone else's booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in

1055
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,775
In Las Vegas there were a lot of people that came up to me and said

1056
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
I feel like they should be on the market already

1057
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,247
Text know Mike says he was actually the first guy to come out with an iPhone case that has a lens cover and

1058
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Either right

1059
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,111
And our logo is something I made up in Microsoft Paint a little

1060
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,207
Phone case that looks like a little pirate got an eyepatch that's why I came up with the name

1061
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
IPad case because it covers up the

1062
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:54,911
Cameras eye since you launched the eyepatch case for years ago Mike's been doing a pretty modest business

1063
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
Sold about 7,000 so far but he's trying to profit and he's about to release for new models

1064
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
And he says

1065
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,663
It's great doing this business as a side hustle to video production

1066
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,783
I work in an industry that was all about ideas and content and things that you could not touch

1067
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:16,159
Should I have a physical tangible product in my hand was so incredibly rewarding

1068
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
Do I find out more about the company or he
