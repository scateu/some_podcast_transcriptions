Here I am supposed to be going to college. This thriving businesses

28
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
My dorm room I was buying computers and keeping them up

00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
Capability and then reselling them so

30
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
I advertised I bid on state contracts

Back before it was fashionable to drop out of college to pursue your start-up even before people use the term

45
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Start up

46
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,792
Back in the ancient days of the 1980s

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
The dorm room Miracle story you've heard of

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Was Michael Dallas

49
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Today the company

50
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
Is in Norman

51
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Beyond Darkness worth

52
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Billions of dollars

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Dell has sold more than 650 million computers since Michael Dell founded in 1984

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
And what's amazing about this

55
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
Is the money it's not even the idea

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
What's amazing about

57
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Michael Dell

58
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Because he's not a

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
Back-slapping sales guy

60
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
Doesn't come across as

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Particularly charismatic

62
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,656
He's actually on the quiet side maybe even a little shy

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
Michael grew up in Houston in the 1970s

64
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
Just as digital technology was taking off in that City with companies like Texas Instruments and then later

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Compaq

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
His dad was a doctor his mom was

67
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
Financial Consultant

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
And guess what Michael would become a doctor

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Like his dad

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
But even from a young age

71
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
Michael Dell felt pulled in a different direction

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
He was

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
The numbers

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Remember

75
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,400
When I was a small child my dad had this adding machine

76
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,240
Is a Victor adding machine says before the electronic calculator

77
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
And I was just

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Fascinated

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Youku

80
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Add up numbers

81
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
With this machine

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
And really big number

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,320
Should I make this like mesmerizing sound every time it did it

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
And it is I just kind of love that

85
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
And then I remember when I was about 7 or 8 years old

86
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
I bought a calculator it was it the first

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Semiconductor base

88
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Calculator

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,752
And I was fascinated that this small machine could do complicated math problem

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
So yeah I got I got very interested in this stuff

91
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
It also turned out that

92
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
About

93
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Equidistant

94
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Between my

95
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,296
Junior High School in our in our house

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
There was a RadioShack store

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
And so

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
When I was riding my bike home I could

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Stop by the Radio Shack store in C

100
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
The

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,863
He don't early forms of the of the personal computer and hang out there until they kick me out of the

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
The store and what are you

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
It'll like kind of entrepreneurial as a kid

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah I I kind of like to business

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
I had all kinds of businesses

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,551
No selling baseball cards I had a Stamp Auction

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
I got a job

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
At 8

109
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Gold

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,535
Coin and Jewelry store and I was to negotiate with people that were selling things and

111
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Buy those things the lowest possible price

112
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Because the owner gave me a

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
Percentage of the cut

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
And I rather you'll Sue

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Worked for the local paper for for sometime

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
Yes oh I got this job

117
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
Working for the Houston Post newspaper

118
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
Doesn't exist anymore now they think they combined with user chronicling

119
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
My job

120
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Along with

121
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Hundreds of other

122
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Mostly

123
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Teenagers

124
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Was

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
2

126
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Call random people on the phone

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
And try to sell them

128
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Subscription to the Houston Post newspaper

129
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Harbor Freight

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
And I observed

131
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Three things

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
The first thing I observed is that

133
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,847
If you sounded like the people you were talking to they were much more likely to buy the newspaper from you

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Like like you

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
You put on a text like as heavy Texas accent

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,551
Yeah I'm not going to do it for you here but I think you can you can use your imagination

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Okay so

138
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Second thing I observed was that

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
People that were getting married

140
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
We're much more likely to buy the newspaper

141
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,167
And then the third thing I deserve is it people that we're moving into a new house or residence

142
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
We're also far more likely to buy the newspaper

143
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
How did you know who is getting married

144
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
And who is moving in

145
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Will you talk to him

146
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
You strike up a conversation

147
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
You just call people and say and ask them about the

148
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Themselves I guess this is like

149
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
At that time people were perfectly happy to help

150
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Strangers personal details right

151
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,207
Yeah so I observe this and what I figured out is that

152
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
In Texas when you as a sister in many states

153
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607
When you want to get a marriage license

154
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
You have to go to the county courthouse

155
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
It turns out this is public information

156
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
And among the information that you

157
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Give to the county

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Court

159
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Is the address you want the license

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Sent to

161
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
So

162
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
With this information I devised

163
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
A

164
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Direct Mail

165
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Program

166
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Where I

167
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,463
Send letters to all of the people that had

168
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Applied for marriage licenses

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
In a 16 County area

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Surrounding Harris County

171
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Which is where are used to text

172
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
And I hired a bunch of my

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
High School

174
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Pals

175
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
To go out to Aldi's County courthouses and

176
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Type the names

177
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Into

178
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Small

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Apple 2 computers

180
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
And I sent

181
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
Massive Direct Mail campaign

182
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
To all those people that were applying to get

183
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Marriage license

184
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And

185
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,095
There were also at that time in Houston there was a building boom and there were these very large

186
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
Apartment and condominium complexes

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,751
They were going up and so I would go to these buildings under construction

188
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
And sort of figure out

189
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Who was in charge

190
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
And

191
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
Say hey I'm from the Houston Post newspaper

192
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
And

193
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
You know we've got this great offer where

194
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
Your new residence

195
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Get the paper free for two weeks

196
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
And all you do is fill out this will form

197
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
You are a high school student

198
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Yes

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
How much money did you walk away with

200
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,631
I think about 17 years old and I made a little over $18,000

201
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
That year this is like freakishly precocious of a

202
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
Have a high school senior

203
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,383
But it's just weird that you would even know to think of doing those things don't you think

204
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
I didn't really think about it like that I just did just seem like

205
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,575
It seemed like a good idea I was pursuing it was working

206
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
I did tell you things it didn't work but

207
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
That worked so I kept doing it

208
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
$18,000

209
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
What did you do with that money that that must have more money than you'd ever seen in your life

210
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
I bought a BMW

211
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,031
I wanted I wanted to BMW

212
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
What did the other students

213
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Think of you today what would did you have this reputation as I got the

214
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,967
Business Wizkid in in high school or or

215
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Like what did they think about

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
You know I

217
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,879
I don't really know and I and I didn't really care

218
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,511
So I was sort of keeping to myself and I had a few friends but I wasn't

219
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
The most social of

220
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Kids

221
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
But you must have been somewhat social because

222
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Cuz you weren't going out at

223
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
And selling stuff

224
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Strangers

225
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Sure

226
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Social app to make the sale

227
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
So you are on the one hand doing this entrepreneurial stuff and then I guess you were also

228
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Just really into computers

229
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Yeah

230
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Are the original

231
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Computer

232
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
That I

233
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
And I got my hands on

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
At home

235
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Was the same one everybody else had one

236
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Which is the Apple II

237
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
To ya

238
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Yeah and one of the

239
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Beautiful things about the Apple

240
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
Apple II was that

241
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
All of the circuits

242
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
In the Apple

243
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
2

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,031
Were discrete circuits that you could understand so

245
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
You could go in and start to

246
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Don't play with those and modify them

247
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
And

248
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
Reprogram the BIOS and

249
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Upgrade the system and

250
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Take it apart put it back together

251
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
So

252
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
You know when you would take apart

253
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
The something happened

254
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Cure

255
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Around 19

256
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
81

257
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
IBM

258
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Introduced

259
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,703
The IBM PC and that was sort of a very important moment because

260
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
If you dial back the clock

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
To the late 70s early 80s

262
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
In Addis company IBM had a leadership

263
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,735
Of the part of the economy referred to as

264
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Information technology

265
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
Unlike any other company at any other time

266
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
History

267
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
They were by far the dominant company

268
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Introduced the IBM PC

269
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
This to me seemed to be a very important moment so I

270
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
Try to understand everything was going on about that and so

271
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
When you took a part this IBM PC

272
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,847
That was selling for about $3,000

273
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
As far as I could tell it was about $600 worth of parts

274
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
What you bought one and you took it apart just to

275
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
Check the inside out

276
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Sure yeah

277
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
What else would you

278
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,023
You got it you got to take it apart and understand if you don't take it apart

279
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Philly most people buy computers to like

280
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
You know at that time again

281
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
To do basic

282
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
You know accounting and word processor

283
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
You bought it to take it apart

284
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Well

285
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
What is understand

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
And you don't understand it you have to take a nap

287
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
And I remember in

288
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:33,247
1981 I was 16 years old I just gotten my driver's

289
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
And they had this

290
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Thing called The National

291
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Computer comp

292
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
In the Astrodome

293
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Time in Houston

294
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
And I

295
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
You know soon as I got out of school

296
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
I would

297
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Rush over there

298
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
And

299
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
They had

300
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
All of the computer companies

301
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
Of note in the world in the Astrodome and they were showing off their computer prevent amazing coincidence

302
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
That's because you went to that convention which happened to

303
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,527
Take place in Houston that year just happened that year and it just happened to occur like

304
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
A couple of months after I got my driver's

305
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Yeah so

306
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,439
Yeah I mean there's there's there's definitely some luck involved

307
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
And that convention

308
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Not only were you there

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
But Rod canion went there to who went on to start

310
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Compaq and Dell

311
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Came out of

312
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Document

313
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
Yeah well in and I remember in my chemistry class

314
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
In high school

315
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
The guy sitting next to me

316
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Was telling me that his dad

317
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Had just

318
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Left

319
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Texas Instruments

320
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
To go

321
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
Start this new computer company

322
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
He was one of the early geyser

323
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
That compact

324
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Amazing

325
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Cu

326
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Let me see you graduate high school

327
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
And then you go to T or C to to UT Austin

328
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,983
Yes it was a pre-med major and

329
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
You know some of this was the programming from my parents

330
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Because

331
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,943
My father was a doctor my older brother was a doctor

332
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
In a lot of my cousins were doctors

333
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
End

334
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
I always thought

335
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
The doctor and hand

336
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
When I

337
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
Started going to school

338
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
You know my parents weren't

339
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Around all the time

340
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
My ride cuz I'm I'm in Austin or Houston

341
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
You're pretty far away

342
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
She got a lot of free time on your hands

343
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
So I start

344
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,775
Exploring this whole computer thing further

345
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,335
And one of the things that I

346
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
Noticed

347
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
About the

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
Computer business was that it was very

349
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
It took a really long time for the Technologies

350
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Did you get

351
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,391
From the people that made it to the people that were buying it

352
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
And it was

353
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Actually rather

354
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Expensive and

355
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Slow to occur

356
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
And to me that was frustrating

357
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
So you are a yours

358
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Student at UT

359
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
You're supposed to be doing pre-med

360
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Training

361
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Right and you

362
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Start to think

363
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,823
TC market like there's an opportunity here is that

364
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
What you start to think

365
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
So

366
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,199
I was in this mode of

367
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
Buying computers and

368
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Souping them up

369
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Capability

370
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
And then

371
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Reselling them

372
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,047
And it was just sort of a fun thing to do a way to make some money I loved

373
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
The computers

374
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
And

375
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
It was actually working out great

376
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
What would you do you would go and find like

377
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Second hand

378
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Computers and

379
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Take them apart and

380
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Rebuild them and then

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Sell them to people

382
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
No no I was buying new computer again

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
And I would

384
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Upgrade them with

385
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
More memory

386
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
And actually the main business

387
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Became

388
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Putting hard drive

389
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
In those machines so back then the original

390
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
IBM personal computers

391
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Had no hard disk drive

392
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
So what I would do is

393
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
I would

394
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Buy a couple of these describes

395
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
Buy a controller card

396
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
Write some software make some cables and make a

397
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,895
Hard disk drive system that you would put inside an IBM computer and then

398
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Instead of

399
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,271
260 KR 320k floppy disk drives

400
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
It would have

401
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,903
A 10 GB hard drive height which is the time was something amazing

402
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
Sounds ridiculous today but 10 megabytes then was

403
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
That was like

404
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Unbelievable

405
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
How long would it take you

406
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
To upgrade one computer

407
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
It didn't take that long

408
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Pentagon

409
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
What you were doing

410
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Maybe

411
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
30 minutes 45 minutes something like that so you could do a bunch

412
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Computers ARROW

413
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Osher

414
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
Yeah no problem in between classes

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
But you really weren't studying you weren't there's no way you were doing your score

416
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,927
I was I was definitely slacking off on the school work

417
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
During that time yes but who would you

418
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
How did you find customers it was oh Craigslist it was no

419
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Avenue words

420
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
18 or 19 years old I guess who did you even know who to sell these two

421
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
I advertised

422
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
In the in the local newspaper

423
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
I bid on state contracts

424
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
And it's kind of funny the the state

425
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Office

426
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
That was responsible for buying

427
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Computer equipment and everything else

428
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
What's about three or four blocks for my dorm room

429
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
So I could just like walk over there

430
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
And they said they would give you all the

431
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Dockets for all the

432
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Things that the state

433
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
Wanted to buy how did you even know how to do

434
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,239
Do that you know I don't really remember how I figured that out but I somehow figured it out

435
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,079
And you know but Mike my biggest customers

436
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
We're

437
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
Universities in the area

438
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Doctors lawyers

439
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
The architect

440
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
I think like that suit weren't really buying computers

441
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Did the time end

442
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Most of the students

443
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
That I knew

444
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
They weren't really interested in computers at the time that sounds

445
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Like crazy right now but this is

446
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Stacking

447
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
1983-1984

448
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
There weren't very many

449
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
People that had

450
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Personal computers

451
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
I'm hoping that I don't sound like a broken record

452
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
Thinking Michael

453
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Here you are

454
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,807
You are an eighteen-year-old kid I mean you probably look like a a baby and you were going around

455
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Hawking computer soap

456
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,695
Like why would these Architects or business Banner lawyers

457
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Have taken you seriously

458
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,839
Well I guess I figured I'd knew what I was talking about

459
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Nobody ever

460
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Said well I'm not going to

461
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Buy from you because

462
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
You don't look

463
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Departer something

464
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,079
Think so I think the early adopters of computers

465
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
We're

466
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:57,759
Sufficiently Technical and geeky that I was able to relate to them in a way that that resonated and so

467
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
I didn't have any problem

468
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
How much money

469
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
I was doing about

470
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,255
50 to $80,000 a month

471
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
In business

472
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
When I was in my dorm room

473
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Wow

474
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
That's insane

475
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Amount of money

476
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
I mean

477
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Did you tell your parents that you were

478
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
But you're making this much money

479
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
No

480
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,687
Now I didn't now that they did eventually

481
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Going back to

482
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,319
Late 83 now they became very upset with me and

483
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
Said you have to stop this and

484
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Focus on your studies

485
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,023
So you got to get your priorities straight no what are you doing with your life and

486
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
All that

487
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Stuff

488
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
And

489
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
You know I agree to do that

490
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
You know it was like going cold turkey

491
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Or something it just

492
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Alaska

493
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Send about 10 days and

494
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,383
I actually realized that this was more than

495
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
A hobby were

496
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
A nice way to make some extra

497
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,319
For cash on the side while I was going to school but actually something is very passionate about

498
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
So during those 10 days I sort of

499
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Mapped out the beginnings of

500
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
Kylie was going to

501
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
Finish up my freshman year

502
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
But then

503
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
Watch this is a real official business

504
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
And

505
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
You know I eventually made a deal with my parents that

506
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
I would do that and if it

507
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
Worked out it would continue and if it did not go back to

508
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
School

509
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
It's it I can just imagine how exciting it was

510
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
Your 18 +

511
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
You're selling your

512
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
Start a company basically without even realizing it I guess

513
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,231
What was it that was more exciting was it all this money that was coming in or was it just that

514
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
You were just selling a bunch of computers

515
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,375
Well it was probably a little bit of everything mean

516
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
The opportunity

517
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
Or and what became

518
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Dell computer Corporation

519
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Was more more apparent

520
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
And

521
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Yeah why you couldn't

522
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
CL

523
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
Three or four years

524
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
See far enough out

525
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
That

526
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
Tell you keep going

527
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
So you were I guess for the first couple years or the

528
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
At least for the first

529
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
2 years you were just buying off

530
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
The Shelf computers and making them better

531
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
That's right

532
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
What we started

533
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Upgrading

534
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Other people's computers

535
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
And then we

536
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Started making these

537
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
Hard disk drive upgrade kits that became the main

538
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
Business of the company selling

539
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
Hard disk drive subsystems

540
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,991
Add and memory kits to upgrade the computer when you say Michael and you say we who who were the Wii

541
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
You started this by yourself in your dorm room

542
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
And then

543
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Who did you bring on to help you

544
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
Well I always say week is that makes

545
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
The salad is more of us

546
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,303
What I started it was just me

547
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
But I hired about one person a week

548
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Every week you know for the first

549
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,519
You're so that it became more and more and

550
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
Number one time we had this customer

551
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Who wanted to come visit us it was

552
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Martin Marietta

553
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Which is

554
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Now part of

555
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
So much bigger company

556
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
And a guy wanted to buy like a hundred and fifty of these kits

557
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Which was

558
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
Emma Frost pretty enormous order

559
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
And

560
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
He wanted to come to Austin and CR

561
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Factory

562
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Operation

563
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,144
So this was a little bit scary because

564
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
It sort of look like a massive dorm room

565
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
Was it wasn't the

566
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Moe's

567
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Put together place

568
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,968
Actual dorm room

569
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Yeah

570
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Yeah we we are growing quickly and so we

571
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
You know we tried to clean this space up and

572
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Put on some

573
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
Semi respectable business attire

574
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
I'm at the hard drives and here's how we

575
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
Ensure the quality controls and

576
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
We're sure we can

577
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,288
Beecher demand for this order 450 units

578
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
And

579
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
He says what are those

580
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,224
I said well those are the computers that we have to format the hard drive

581
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
And by this time

582
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
We'd actually been

583
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
Assembling our own computers

584
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
Just to format the hard drive

585
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
Just became too expensive to buy them from other people

586
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
And

587
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
He said why don't you sell those

588
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
And

589
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
I was like

590
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Oh

591
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
That's a great idea I should have thought

592
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
We were so busy

593
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
Making these hard disk drive kits that we hadn't really

594
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Thought

595
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
Make your own computers

596
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
When we come back in just a moment

597
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272

599
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
It would make Dell one of the biggest computer companies

Slow and steady growth of a business

629
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Early struggles

630
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,480
And all the hard work that went into getting off the ground

631
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,528
But in the mid-1980s

632
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Pretty soon after Michael hired

633
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Is first Engineers to

634
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
To start making the first Dell computers

635
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
From scratch

636
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
They were selling so many

637
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Computer so fast

638
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,608
Betley started to compete with the biggest name in Computing

639
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
IBM

640
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
IBM at the time had a

641
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
6 megahertz

642
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
286 computer

643
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Did they sold

644
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
For $3,995

645
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
So

646
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
The Wii introduced

647
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,712
A 12 megahertz

648
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
286 bass computer

649
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
And we

650
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
Sold it for $1,995

651
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
So

652
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
Our computer was twice as fast

653
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
I was half the price

654
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
How did how are you able to do that

655
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
What we still made a decent margin

656
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Selling them

657
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
And

658
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
I think one is we had some clever engineers

659
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
And

660
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
We had this

661
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,800
Great supply chain we created

662
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
It's okay

663
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
When we would sell let's say

664
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
200 computers in a day

665
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
We would

666
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
Give that signal back door suppliers

667
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Who would

668
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Everyday or every

669
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
Few hours deliver parts

670
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
To our Factory

671
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah and then we would

672
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
You know ship those computers out out to the customer so

673
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
We had a

674
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,984
Unbelievably efficient supply chain that we created out of necessity because we had no capital

675
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
That also meant that we had the freshest

676
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Parts

677
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
At the best cost and is it cost

678
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
The materials were coming down

679
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
We

680
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
Benefit from that and we could get the latest technology

681
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,832
To the customer faster than anybody else and you didn't

682
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Uur Direct

683
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
To Consumers

684
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Company

685
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Retail shops are not selling delcamp

686
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
You have to call Dale or

687
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Foxtail in order computer

688
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
At the time that's right

689
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Except

690
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Most of our business wasn't to consumer

691
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
I was a business

692
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
It was the business

693
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
But that's

694
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,128
What you just said is that actually common misperception lot of people thought only consumers buy from delve yeah

695
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
That's actually not what was happening we were selling to

696
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
All sorts of

697
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Companies and governments

698
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Small

699
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
And medium-sized businesses

700
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
That was most of our business

701
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
Even from the beginning

702
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
That point

703
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Like the late 80s

704
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
What did you have in mind for the future like what was

705
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
What were your ambitions

706
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
The company

707
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Well

708
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
We had some pretty big operation

709
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
The first one was we said

710
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
We want to expand

711
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Globally

712
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
It's pretty clear to us that

713
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
If you were only successful the United States

714
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
That would be good enough

715
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
II was

716
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
That we had to go after

717
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Selling to big companies

718
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Because

719
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
If you didn't sell to the really big companies and

720
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,304
The biggest governments in the world

721
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Well you weren't going to

722
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
B

723
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
Irrelevant company

724
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,496
And then the third one was we said we had to differentiate

725
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
On the basis of service

726
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,640
And we created this thing called on-site service

727
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
And

728
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
Today would be a very common thing but

729
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,784
Back then if your computer broke

730
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,880
You had to put it in the trunk of your car take it back to the computer store

731
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,232
And then they were taken it off somewhere

732
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
You'd wait weeks and weeks and

733
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Supposed to get it back and

734
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,376
So we came up with this program where

735
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Calls on the phone

736
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Before the internet

737
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
And

738
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,384
If you had a problem we help you resolve it on the phone and if we weren't able to resolve another phone we send

739
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
A

740
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Technician

741
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
With parts

742
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,528
To your location to fix your computer on site

743
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
And we did that

744
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
All across the United States

745
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
And

746
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
And we thought

747
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
The minute we analysis our sales will double

748
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,536
You know because it was like so much better than what we were doing before

749
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
3D double instantly

750
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
But after about three months ago so

751
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
I want to listen to perspective because

752
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah we think about

753
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
Like really young

754
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Entrepreneurs

755
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,688
And we think many people think Mark Zuckerberg or

756
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
The guys who made Instagram

757
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
Instagram

758
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
You are 21 years old

759
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
I mean

760
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
That time

761
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,392
Dell was already doing like Malta

762
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Chipotle

763
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
10 20 30 million dollars in sales a year

764
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
I think we're 66 million

765
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
That year

766
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
I was I was 21

767
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
56 million dollars

768
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
Sprint Moment

769
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
An out-of-body

770
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Experience Ramona

771
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
Don't invite you

772
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
But think about this

773
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
21 year old

774
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Name Michael Dell who

775
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Running a 66 million dollar

776
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
How many minutes is

777
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
Unbelievable right I mean it's it's

778
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Almost

779
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
Possible to imagine that

780
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
The Happening

781
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
Yeah certainly

782
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,000
The song but I was more focused on the future and thinking about

783
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
How do we become

784
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
Three times larger 10 times larger

785
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
What new products

786
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
Are we going to launch into

787
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Do we have the right Talent

788
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
How do we

789
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Expand

790
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
And if

791
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
Get more sales people

792
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
What was your lifestyle like

793
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
Time I mean did it change where you still living like a

794
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
21 year old

795
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
All of a sudden

796
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
Did you start did you buy a giant mansion

797
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
How to change the way you lived

798
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
You know I

799
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Wouldn't say

800
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Massive changes

801
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
I did

802
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Buy a nice

803
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
House

804
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
I wasn't

805
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,168
Wanting for things but I didn't really have a lot of time to

806
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,216
Consume things and

807
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Was really focused on

808
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
I mean it

809
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
It sounds like you were so busy that you were

810
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,848
Get your full

811
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Everything that you were doing

812
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Jobing

813
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,712
And you didn't even have a personal life

814
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
Just working all the time

815
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,368
Yeah that's a that's a valid assumption I did

816
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
Couple years later

817
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
Take a little time off and

818
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Managed to

819
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Find

820
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
A fantastic partner

821
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
And get married and and

822
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
Have kids and all that and that's been

823
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Amazing part of my life

824
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,800
I was actually motivated to do this

825
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Impart

826
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Bye

827
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

828
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:47,552
Yeah and the reason I was motivated to do it because of them was because they were not married

829
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,624
And they were about 10 years older than I was

830
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
And

831
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Having had the

832
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Prince that I had

833
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
As a child

834
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
With my family

835
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
That's what I wanted

836
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,120
I wanted that family

837
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
I wanted that

838
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
Experience

839
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
And I didn't want to be

840
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
A single guy

841
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
In his 30s or Beyond

842
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
That didn't have that

843
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
What was

844
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Stress you out at the

845
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Because it seems like you're so

846
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Even-keeled

847
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,064
That you don't actually sound like you get stressed out but I

848
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
Have to imagine there were things that would stress you out

849
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
We had plenty of stresses I mean

850
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
I remember one time

851
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,024
We got this letter from

852
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Something called the

853
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,376
Federal Communications Commission

854
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
The FCC

855
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
And apparently

856
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
Computers fall under something called the

857
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
Federal Communications

858
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
Commission Class B device

859
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Which means they have to be approved

860
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
By the FCC

861
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
So I did not know this

862
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
And

863
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
You know they basically said you have to stop making these things

864
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Wow when was this

865
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,976
This was back like an 86 87

866
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
So

867
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
If we had

868
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Follow their instructions

869
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
Yeah we wouldn't be on this podcast

870
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
Yesterday so if you had a business

871
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
Yasso

872
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
Fortunately I had some pretty smart

873
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,336
Guys who sort of said well what you need to do is

874
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Call this lawyer in washing

875
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
He's going to help you fix

876
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
So I called up this guy and he been one of the

877
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
Prior commissioners of the FCC

878
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,136
He said he said okay here's what you need to do you need to go down to this test range

879
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
You test your

880
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Computers

881
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Immediately

882
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
I need to submit an application right away

883
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
And

884
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
Make sure they comply by

885
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
And so we did all that and then he went to the FCC and said hey you know these guys are

886
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,568
Honest forthright people they just didn't know

887
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,664
Now they filed their application and they want to do the right thing and

888
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Here's what we're doing and

889
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
We're able to work through it

890
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
So yeah I mean the first

891
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
345 years

892
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
There were

893
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Actually several

894
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
Things like that I remember

895
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
There was a thought at the time that oh wow IBM's going to

896
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Take back this whole

897
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Idea of the person

898
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
Computer and won't be an open ecosystem anymore

899
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
And

900
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Bi-weekly

901
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
All be out of business

902
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
That didn't really

903
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Materialize

904
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
So you guys

905
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:25,760
Decide to go public I guess in 1988 you do an IPO

906
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
And raise tons of money and

907
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Why did you why did you decide to do that by the way

908
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Because at that point

909
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
You like ice owned

910
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
The entire camp

911
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,256
Well we needed the capital we were

912
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Growing at

913
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Like eating

914
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
2% per year

915
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
And the company was only

916
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
4 years old and we were expanding into

917
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,824
All sorts of new countries we were expanding into new product lines

918
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
And we also

919
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
Wanted to be more of a

920
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Appear with our customers

921
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
And

922
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,320
Being a public company someone enable us to do that because

923
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Customers could look and see that we were

924
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
You know a real legitimate company yeah

925
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
You know that that was helpful.

926
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Here's what I think it's harder to

927
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Prefer lightskins wrap your head around which is

928
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
You were

929
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Expanding by an order of magnitude

930
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
To every year

931
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
There was huge

932
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
Amount of Revenue coming in

933
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
But yet that wasn't enough

934
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Cash

935
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Capital for you guys

936
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
How to expand

937
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,456
Sure all the revenues not profit we weren't we weren't a software company

938
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
And so

939
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,320
We did need some Capital to finance the the growth of the business

940
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Send

941
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,672
Hire more people open new offices open new factories

942
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Fueled

943
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
It systems

944
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
We absolutely needed some cap

945
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
Am I getting that money were you able

946
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
How to say okay

947
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Now we're going to

948
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Bibl

949
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Bigger than

950
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Well

951
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
We definitely wanted to to to be the biggest

952
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Hand

953
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
I would say

954
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
Changed a little bit in that time frame

955
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
2

956
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
You're competing with Compaq

957
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,904
And one of the things I think I learned along the way was that if you obsess

958
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
On the competitors

959
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
You could be making a really bad mistake

960
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
And I think that was definitely true

961
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
In the case of those two in the sense that

962
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
We had a better business model and if we were trying to

963
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
You don't just look at them

964
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
We would

965
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
Miss opportunities by

966
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Not listening to our customers

967
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
And

968
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
How did we get

969
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
From a

970
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
A company that

971
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
Then started in a dorm room to having

972
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
Half a billion dollars in sales

973
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Well we did it

974
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Because we listen to yeah and we learn

975
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
I guess

976
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Fight

977
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
The year 2000

978
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
In to mm

979
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
2001

980
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Dell

981
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Computers

982
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
PCS

983
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
Because the number one

984
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Brand bite by sales by market

985
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,336
Become number one more than combat more than IBM

986
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Yes

987
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
What did

988
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Do you remember

989
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
Finding that out

990
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:06,272
Yeah you know we sort of have this celebrate for a nanosecond

991
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,392
Sometimes a little longer but you know we were focused on

992
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,744
How do we keep growing how do we expand into

993
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,352
Servers and storage and services and software and

994
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,192
How do we solve the next unsolved problems and

995
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
You know 2000-2001

996
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
We would have been thinking a lot about China

997
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,592
Ian India

998
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
The Emerging Markets

999
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,456
Yeah so there wasn't a lot of

1000
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
Dwelling on any particular success

1001
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
So I mean

1002
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
The company

1003
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,904
The story of Dell

1004
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
It's pretty remarkable week

1005
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
Seems like

1006
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
From the moment you started selling

1007
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
PCS out of your dorm room until 2001

1008
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Success after

1009
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Success after

1010
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Just like there was no moment

1011
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
Failure there was no

1012
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
There was no real struggle is that true is that isn't right

1013
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
No that's not right at all there were plenty of struggles and certainly if you go back and look at the history there

1014
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
Are you fine

1015
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
All kinds of

1016
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
Missteps along the way and

1017
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
Dead ends and

1018
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Mistakes

1019
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,488
What was the dumbest mistake you did you make cuz it Doesn't

1020
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
My Columbia

1021
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
It doesn't sound like you made any mistakes it sounds like you were

1022
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
Preternaturally gifted as a high school

1023
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Kitsune understand business

1024
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,056
And then you understood computers and then you just started the successful company so

1025
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
What was the

1026
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
What was a mistake you made

1027
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,272
Okay so 1989 we created something called Del units

1028
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,368
Which was which was a software

1029
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Prior to the whole Linux

1030
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Wave and Unix

1031
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
It was

1032
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Pay

1033
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,536
Well used operating

1034
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
System in mid-range

1035
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Computer sis

1036
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
And

1037
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
It turns out we were

1038
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Really

1039
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,336
Early at that and that was a that was a really bad idea it was a kind of a horrible misadventure

1040
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
It cost the company money did it

1041
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
Sector stock price

1042
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Sure ya all that

1043
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
Around the same time we also had a

1044
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
Wildly ambitious

1045
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Engineering program

1046
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
That

1047
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Artima cooked up

1048
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
And

1049
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
It was too big of a technical leap

1050
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
Project failed it was a project

1051
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Call Olympic

1052
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
We had

1053
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
Problems with our inventory control early on

1054
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
You know

1055
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
We had

1056
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
All kinds of mistakes

1057
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Fortunately none of them were fatal and

1058
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
1 things I learned a long long time ago

1059
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,480
You know when you find a problem fix it as fast as you find it

1060
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
And look when your

1061
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,368
Pioneering in a new area with a new business model

1062
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
There's no Playbook there's no

1063
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
You know you have to just

1064
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Learn by doing

1065
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
And you have to into it

1066
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
An experiment your way

1067
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Through the problem

1068
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
I'm curious about

1069
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
2004

1070
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
Step down as

1071
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Is the CEO of Dell

1072
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Leave the company

1073
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,640
Is a virus a Fortune 500 company

1074
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
Been already for more than a decade

1075
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,296
Huge revenues did you just think okay I've made it on 39

1076
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,344
Time to move on and start

1077
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
A different phase my life

1078
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,208
Not really you know I didn't really think about it as stepping down I had

1079
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
This partner

1080
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
In the company Kevin Rollins

1081
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Who was

1082
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
The president

1083
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,912
Running a company together

1084
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
And we did everything

1085
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Together

1086
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
And

1087
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
I decided okay

1088
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
Ubco

1089
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,384
For a while I'll be chairman I'll still be very involved

1090
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
And

1091
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,712
After about two years

1092
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
You know the industry started changing pretty rapidly and the board

1093
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Okay to being said

1094
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Yaje we think

1095
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
You should go back to being

1096
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
See ya

1097
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Yeah I mean

1098
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Happened during that time

1099
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Because

1100
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
Accounts that I've read

1101
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,376
There was a decline I mean

1102
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
A 2004 Dell starts

1103
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Lose mark

1104
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Cher

1105
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,312
And then a couple years later HP becomes number one PC seller

1106
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,408
And then you come back in 2007 so what was going on in those three years

1107
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,224
Well I think the market was changing

1108
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
I think

1109
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,576
There were new things starting to emerge

1110
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
The cloud

1111
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,720
What people call the cloud today and it was starting to show up

1112
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
I think we weren't being aggressive enough

1113
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
In

1114
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
Changing the business

1115
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,168
Given the ships that were happening

1116
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
You know

1117
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
It's a change or die businesses

1118
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
Quicker dead business

1119
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
And the board asked me to

1120
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,896
Come back into the CEO role and I was happy to do it

1121
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
That like around that time

1122
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
The the quality in the service of

1123
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
Abdel was

1124
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Was in Decline

1125
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
But the company was getting a lot of heat

1126
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
I'm sure you saw that criticism

1127
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
So how did you do

1128
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
How did you deal with it

1129
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
Look I think I think you can

1130
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
In any anecdote

1131
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
Extrapolate

1132
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,496
But there were definitely some areas where we could have been investing more in innovation

1133
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
And

1134
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
We

1135
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
Change the focus of the company

1136
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Starting around 2007

1137
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
2

1138
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Understand

1139
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,600
And what we needed to do to be an unimportant relevant company in the future

1140
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
And so look at my eye

1141
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,488
Felt then and feel now deep sense of

1142
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,864
Responsibility and commitment to the company and I'll care about the company after I'm dead

1143
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
What is that meal care for the company after I'm dead

1144
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
It means that

1145
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
This is a lifelong Pursuit for me

1146
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
In terms of

1147
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663
Helping the company reach its full potential and

1148
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,247
Y'all certainly my dream is at the company persist well beyond

1149
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Mylifetime

1150
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Which

1151
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
You know

1152
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
I'm still pretty young guy so that I think that's a

1153
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
Many years away

1154
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
I wonder Michael how much

1155
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Which of

1156
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Your success has

1157
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
To do with

1158
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,143
You know your hard work and your brains and you know

1159
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
Intuition and how much of it is luck

1160
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Good question

1161
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
I don't really know

1162
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
I'm sure there's some

1163
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,919
Element of luck there is probably lucky

1164
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
A lot

1165
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,551
Yeah I feel like I was really lucky to be born in the United States

1166
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
That's probably the biggest Stroke of Luck right there

1167
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Because I think

1168
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,463
United States

1169
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
You know you have an opportunity

1170
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
2

1171
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
Start a business and

1172
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
When your

1173
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
20 years old and you show up

1174
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,471
And you want to sell something to somebody

1175
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
You know they they don't look at you

1176
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Too funny

1177
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,847
So I think that was my biggest Stroke of Luck

1178
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,479
I was just being bored here in this country and having the opportunity in the freedoms that that's afforded me

1179
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
That's Michael Dell

1180
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
Unless you think of a Dell computer as the nerdy John Hodgman character in the DC versus

1181
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
Mac commercials

1182
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,071
Dell computers have actually been used by the good guys in the json

1183
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Bourne movies

1184
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,935
Spider-Man Captain America even Mission Impossible

1185
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
In fact in 2016

1186
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,567
Del was the number one brand featured in movies

1187
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
More than Sony more than Mercedes

1188
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,943
Vans or Adidas and yes

1189
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
More

1190
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735

Thanks so much for sticking around in the

1209
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
Before we jump into this is

1210
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Installment of how you built that

1211
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:33,407
Quick warning if you are a parent of small children you are about to hear about poop

1212
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
Poop and barf

1213
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,759
Because those two things are at the very heart of

1214
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Hannah England Fitness

1215
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
She has two small children of her own

1216
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:48,511
3 and 8 months and if you've ever wondered what happens inside one of those family changing room

1217
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,327
Walk into the bathroom

1218
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
And

1219
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,727
There were two moms one was at the changing station and her baby

1220
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
I just had a blowout like major like up the back all the way to the neck

1221
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,527
And this is going to be a situation that every mom gets them so

1222
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
Sounds into

1223
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,343
And by the way every dad I mean

1224
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
I've been there and kissing

1225
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Once you've cleaned up your kid

1226
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
What do you supposed to do with all those soiled and disgusting clothes especially when you're not at home

1227
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,655
I just cringe when you have to stick that in your diaper bag

1228
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,983
And then when you have to open it after a full day

1229
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
It is not pleasant

1230
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
After the clothes have

1231
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,895
Best ER in your diaper bag for a day

1232
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Is may become impossible to

1233
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
To get the stains out

1234
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
All the Scott Hannah think

1235
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,159
I came up with this idea when I was putting my three-year-old

1236
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,975
The bed and I came out to the living room

1237
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,279
Just started describing to my

1238
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
Sister-in-law and my husband

1239
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,935
This bag that's soaking bag and I and I kept filling in the blanks what if we could

1240
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
And what if it had this

1241
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
And then they looked at me and they're like

1242
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:09,407
Well it sounds like you just invented it and what Hannah and vision was a watertight plastic bag

1243
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
That you could keep

1244
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
In your diaper bag

1245
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
It would have a soap pod in it

1246
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,855
Kind of like the Pod that goes into your dishwasher so that when your kid pooped her

1247
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,391
Barfed all over her clothes

1248
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
You just throw it in the bag add water and well above clothes when soaked in soapy water

1249
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
While you went about your day

1250
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,167
And then I kind of just hit the ground running because

1251
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:37,567
I thought I need this in my life

1252
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,199
Ascentra bunch of samples of plastic bags and she and her husband began to test them

1253
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Immediately

1254
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:50,111
Fill it with water and seal it and hang it upside down in our living room

1255
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
And kitchen to look for drip

1256
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Then leaks because

1257
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
We want these things to be able to hold up in a mom's diaper bag and that's like going to come back but it was really good

1258
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
Nothing worth

1259
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,215
The bags are breaker the zippers are come on down and waterwood

1260
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Everywhere

1261
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
Chopin I kept calling around until she found one manufacturer in Wisconsin who seemed to know

1262
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Exactly

1263
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
What she needed and he goes well I think we're going with this deal that's actually really aggressive for your utility

1264
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
And I said exactly wanted to be aggressive

1265
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,439
I feel so aggressive

1266
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,231
But you would have to use scissors to

1267
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
To get it open

1268
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:33,119
And then Hannah found another manufacturer to make a very gentle soap pod

1269
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
And finally

1270
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
She designed the outside of the bags with

1271
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
Classy black and white stripes

1272
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,127
I wanted the design itself to not scream like okay this is a bag for

1273
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Soiled poop

1274
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,831
Kickstarter campaign to raise about $12,000 and for a while it looked like she wasn't going to make her goal

1275
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,951
But then, an amazing thing happened the accounting software company QuickBooks

1276
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
Found out about her

1277
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,631
QuickBooks has this program where is support small businesses until someone from QuickBooks enter a message

1278
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:12,031
Buy a Kickstarter that basically said they were going to back you for the rest of the way it just showed up on our

1279
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Kickstarter thing

1280
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
And my husband of course was going nope this is some weird fraud thing and I laughed at him and I'm like

1281
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:25,343
What kind of fraud puts money into your bank account normally they take money out

1282
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
Hannah was right it was not a fraud and just a few weeks ago she shipped her very first

1283
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,047
5000 bags

1284
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
To those Kickstarter backers

1285
