And then like Ariana's introducing me to fill angelini's but a terracotta is like

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192

NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists story

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Lego

29
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
On the show today at Auntie Corporate email inspired Jonah Peretti

30
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
I need to build two of the most powerful news organizations

31
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Internet age

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
So if you want to walk into an office building

33
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
And get to an elevator with whole bunch of other people

34
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
You wouldn't necessarily pick out Jonah Peretti

35
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,704
Is the media Mogul in the elevator

36
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
Looks more like a graduate

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Pretty young pretty casual end

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,664
When I met him a few weeks ago for a conversation in front of a live audience in New York

39
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
He was a course

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Pairing a hoodie

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,320
I want to I want to start by asking you the question about

42
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
This were the tech uniform cuz everybody wears hoodies

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
What

44
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,000
What is the story what is it I mean the country wife hoodies

45
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
People get mad if you don't wear them

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
You know

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,776
You know if I like wear a nice button-down and go to a meeting or disappointed

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,152
Kind of wanted it's like a startup hers right

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,736
So even though he might

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
Traditional media mogul

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
By almost any definition

52
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,952
He is because Jonah Peretti co-founded The Huffington Post and new site that

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Totally disrupted the journalism world

54
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,608
And if you stop there that would be impressive enough

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
He didn't

56
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,520
Wow at Huffington Post he started to Tinker around with an idea that would become BuzzFeed

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
A company that just six years ago

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
Didn't even employ a single journalist and today

59
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
It has a bigger news team than most newsrooms in America isn't a journalist

60
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,672
She's not a coder he's not a businessman and he doesn't come from money

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
T might be wondering

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
How do you do this

63
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
12

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Just after Jonah graduated from

65
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,936
College classes in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz in Northern California

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
I had to decide

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
What to do next so I was trying to decide whether to be a teacher or work at a startup

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
And then I love teaching and I made money by teaching

69
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
I saw there was some

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Thing where you could get hired as a teacher

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
And I just

72
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
On a trip with my

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
My mom and I walked into it

74
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
And they were like I was like I don't like you don't need one

75
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
And there was a school in New Orleans that

76
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
That hat was just starting a

77
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Computer education program

78
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
And they had gotten a grant they got all these computers

79
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,639
And I flew to New Orleans the interview for the job and it was the Newman School in New Orleans in their logo is a

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
An alligator

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
And I

82
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Present to a bunch of

83
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Second semester

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Seniors

85
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
I taught them how to

86
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Do web design and make it animated

87
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
And I animated the school

88
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Mascots of it

89
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
The alley I'm just right now you can't

90
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Ally audience that make alligator with my finger.

91
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
And I

92
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
And it's like would move its tail and open mouth

93
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
And they were like

94
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,567
Oh my God by the alligator thrashing about the coolest thing

95
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
And I talked to do web design and I forgot to like clothes one of the tags on HTML and so that none of the pages works

96
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
The lesson totally failed but this

97
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Animated gif alligator save me inside

98
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
I got hired and seems like that experience cuz you were there for 3 years

99
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Yeah School experience was

100
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
For you meaning you started to

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Look at technology

102
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Especially the internet

103
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
He starts for develop

104
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Early

105
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Ideas about

106
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Eventually lead

107
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,031
Where you are today what were you exposed to where were you

108
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Thinking about

109
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
I mean I was thinking about how to connect with my

110
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
My students

111
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
And send to get them to learn things and get them excited

112
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
And that is something that

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Had heavily influenced the way I think about

114
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Because I didn't give you think about content from a

115
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
From at the time print and broadcast

116
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
You think about making

117
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
He's something that you push out

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
My audience

119
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
But if you're in a classroom teaching

120
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,095
25 kids that are in front of you

121
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,679
You really start use quickly start to learn that the really good teachers

122
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
AR

123
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Shaping the curriculum based on the feedback they are getting from the

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Students are trying to

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
Read the room and read the audience and get

126
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
The more engaged

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
So I was denied I was designing

128
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Virtual

129
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Role playing

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Historical role playing in virtual world

131
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
Some of these like early the ER things like the late 90s

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
And so we do social protest letters using the Microsoft Word wizard you know we could do kind of a neat

133
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Topic of technology

134
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,143
From the reaction of the students I could get a sense of what was

135
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
Getting their brains going and do and do

136
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
So how did that lead you to

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Tube to go to MIT to study

138
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
At the media lab

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,199
I went to the media media lab because there were really smart people in educational technology artificial

140
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Intelligence

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
People who are thinking about learning and Tech

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
So it was an extension of the of the

143
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
The interest in Education Plus

144
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
Technology

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
So in 2001

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
You're at MIT your

147
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
And you decide to order a car

148
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Custom pair of Nike

149
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Can you

150
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Explain

151
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
What that was all about

152
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,103
So I was procrastinating which is what students do when they have to write a long paper someone told me that Nike had launched

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
A service we can customize your shoes

154
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Which was a new novel saying

155
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
I went and so I think first try to four letter word in it with ject

156
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,111
And so I was trying to figure out how the system work and

157
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
You could you could just ask just to clarify you could

158
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Get any word you wanted printed

159
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Nikes

160
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Air Nikes

161
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,143
Yeah they have blacklisted a bunch of words I was trying to figure out which words they Blacklist and

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
And then I put the word sweatshop

163
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
And and

164
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,335
It went through sounds like and get a pair of Nikes that say Sweatshop under the Swoosh

165
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
And

166
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
The

167
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
The

168
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Next day I got an email

169
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
From a Nike Rock saying that the word Sweatshop is inappropriate slang

170
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
And so I just responded the email and said it's a note in the dictionary me the shop or factory workers toilet around a healthy condition

171
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,863
Can you can you send me the shoes and then they wrote back another excuse and we're having this back

172
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
Which if you're procrastinating writing paper this is

173
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
Perfect right here just like back and forth

174
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
And then eventually they said we reserve the right to not put them until you have to change the ID and I said okay I'll change the ID but can

175
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
Can you at least send me a picture of the 10-year old Vietnamese Brothers

176
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Together

177
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
And then I didn't write back after that

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
You were the first internet troll

179
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
I'm sure there's trolls that predated that

180
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
So you didn't get

181
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,399
Where you buy where you like an activist did you was a something I was near and dear to your heart

182
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
I wasn't an activist a dread

183
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
News articles about

184
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
About sweatshops but it wasn't an expert on it and then I ended up

185
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,967
And I pasted his email together and sent them to a few friends and then if it came with

186
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
Yeah the exchange with Nike I pasted together sent to a few friends and then it became an early email forward so if you were my

187
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Remember the Dark Age

188
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Use of social

189
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Everything's called email for

190
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,535
Where people would forward something they thought they liked their entire address book

191
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,351
So this ended up I started getting emails from

192
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Strangers

193
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
And then it's already hit the activist community of people who really knew and cared about the issue

194
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
And people who

195
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
We are with 70.3

196
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Brett the marriage proposals and I like various

197
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,271
Goodbye Stranger sending me things which in 2001 is weird that all of a sudden strangers are emailing you people even using the term viral and

198
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
2001

199
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
It was not anything that anyone really thought about a real anyone's radar it was pre before Facebook before YouTube

200
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
You know it wasn't something people thought about today

201
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
BMO horror it starts at 2

202
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Spread and

203
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
I get thousands of e-mails back

204
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
Strangers and then reporter start calling me and I didn't know much about the Sweatshop issue but I ended up in this Today show with knife

205
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Maggie's head of global PR

206
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
And

207
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,967
Katie Couric like talking about in a sweatshop labor and I never been on

208
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:02,367
TV before I don't know anything about these media you all these questions by Sweatshop labor and you have to represent that position

209
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
Did you do some homework beforehand

210
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
So Katie Couric is a pro and she sensed how weak I was

211
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
You know so

212
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
So like when you have David and Goliath on your show you don't go hard at David you know so it was I was very nervous but it

213
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Wasn't

214
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
She wasn't too hard on me

215
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,199
Do you do you know how many people that email exchange reach

216
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,599
There were various news for the pride to ask tomato this probably reach 9 million people or this but you know back then

217
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Email forwards and things like that where it was really hard to measure it really hard to understand what's going on at saliva

218
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Topic

219
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
How does the step work How can I

220
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
Student with no context in the media reach millions of people

221
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
About an issue he does knows very little about

222
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
And

223
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
And

224
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
This does not seem

225
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Like the way the media

226
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,735
Supposed to work it's supposed to be there's an executive or an editor or someone who determines what lots of people

227
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
Will see and this was just a emergent thing we're sending it people resulted in

228
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
More people seeing it

229
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
People became the

230
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Distribution the way that

231
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
It's Brad was

232
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
The audience became the network yeah

233
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Do people at MIT at the time cuz I mean

234
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
They were

235
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Epidemiologist

236
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
I studied contagion and

237
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Wingspread

238
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
We the people went up to you just said

239
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
This is a

240
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Total fluke

241
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
This is a one-off

242
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Candy repeat

243
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,151
Well my my good friend Cameron Marla who went on to be the

244
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
First data scientist

245
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Data scientist

246
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Facebook

247
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Was

248
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Observing this

249
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
The Nike women spreading and he's pea-sized exactly that

250
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
He said

251
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,767
These kinds of behavior phenomena are rare and the hard to predict sand and so this is not

252
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
This is not something that you can

253
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,167
Repeat until that kind of drove me to say oh let me try to make more of these let me let me prove Cameron wrong

254
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
So he's saying to you this can't be real

255
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Located in your saying

256
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Maybe I can

257
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,871
Yeah and then Duncan Watts another another friend who became the

258
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Because I was looking

259
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
Ladder stand is he figured out the mathematics

260
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Six Degrees of Separation

261
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
SmallWorlds

262
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
I'm worried people had this concept that everyone is connected through

263
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Perfusion jobs

264
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
He also had a very pessimistic View

265
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
And would say okay

266
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
It's hard to make things go viral

267
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Antarctica

268
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Replicate this

269
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
And so both of them

270
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Try to find a Trader

271
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
So would you do

272
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
So next thing I did was with my sister's stand-up comic

273
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
People ready

274
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
I'm from Brooklyn Nine-Nine

275
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,223
Chelsea that's so

276
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
So Chelsea was not on Brooklyn Nine-Nine band though she was like

277
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,439
Doing the Parkside Lounge to terrible audiences and like just starting her comedy

278
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Career

279
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,095
But we created something together called in New York City rejection line and the concert was in your city rejection line

280
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,239
Is it was a phone number where someone was hitting on you and wouldn't take no for an answer you could give them your number

281
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
But it actually what it was a local New York number

282
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
And when you called you get an audit automated rejection message

283
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
So it would say

284
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,759
The person who gave you this number doesn't actually want to talk to you or see you again

285
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,367
You can press one to speak to a comfort specialist you can press

286
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,439
At 2 to hear a sad poem written by a kindred

287
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Spirit

288
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
Or you could press 3 to cling to the unrealistic hope a relationship still possible

289
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
I don't see how various comic friends record each of the

290
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Messages in the phone tree

291
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
And then after that we tried to call black people love us

292
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Which was a website

293
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,151
That look like it was created by these two super white people Sally and Johnny

294
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
Thor so proud of having black friends they created whole website to celebrate it

295
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
And

296
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
It it really like depicted what now people would call microaggressions you know so it's like testimonials like Sally loves to touch

297
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
My hair you know and

298
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,399
We ended up on Good Morning America with Diane Sawyer talking about race in America

299
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
So well

300
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,847
Andy of projection line was like we are on CNN talking about relationships

301
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
So it was this weird thing where you could make something that would take off and on the internet spread to lots of people and then

302
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
And reporters in traditional media with the NBA Live

303
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,671
Oh I discovered this on the internet

304
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
And we each project

305
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
The timeline for the spread. Shorter

306
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,607
Does the Nike email diffused over something like three and a half months

307
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
And then rejection line was like

308
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
2 months

309
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
You know and then like a little

310
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Two free weeks

311
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
That you know so

312
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
We should we start to see and I was just 2001 2002-2003

313
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
We don't want to hear

314
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,015
And and the internet and social got much more connected or even just

315
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Send spam 2001-2003

316
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
And by the time you get a 2000 6 7 8

317
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
People are trying to make things go viral and it starts to become a science

318
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Social in a YouTube is

319
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Get you know taken off in

320
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
People are thinking about this as being away this

321
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Distributing media for the

322
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
First time even though

323
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Small

324
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,007
So how did you meet us around 2003-2004

325
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
2005

326
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
You get on the radar I guess

327
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
People who wanted

328
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
The Huffington

329
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
How did that happen

330
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
So can

331
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Lair

332
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Was a

333
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,879
Retired from NFL retired executive and he had

334
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
He really cared a lot about

335
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Gun control

336
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Sharon wanted to figure out how to use the

337
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
The internet

338
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
To do political ad

339
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
The political Act

340
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
And so he

341
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,495
Put together a group of the smartest people on the in the Internet space that could come together and advise him

342
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
And

343
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
I was not one of those people haha

344
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
Duncan Watts was

345
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Enzo Duncan Watts the guy

346
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,551
Before about the Six Degrees of Separation Guy Kenny at Red Duncan's book and it said you have to come to this thing

347
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
Play Duncan calls me names like this

348
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
Is rich guy wants me to come to this thing to help him figure out the internet and like you'd be much better at that than I was

349
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
And I think I said well

350
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
You know

351
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
I don't know like

352
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
It seems kind of like going to Midtown

353
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Seems kind of like a hassle

354
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
He said well you know and Duncan hit broken

355
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
His leg skiing

356
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Season cast

357
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
He's like whoa

358
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
This guy told me this guy has a driver

359
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,599
And he says that after the meeting I can take his car and go anywhere in the city

360
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,231
With Anna and I was like oh that sounds kind of cool stuff

361
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Because it's like we're get to drive around

362
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
You know I'm there and

363
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
How does he disappear

364
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,871
Like Jeff Jarvis is Taiwan about blogs

365
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Someone doing mobile stop telling about that

366
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
And I talked about the Nike email and

367
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Manteno Macon

368
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Diary of things that are

369
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Shared on the internet and he's

370
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
Cont sort of ended not just with me but a few other people like yeah let's do let's do it let's do it

371
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
And so I ended up working on a project with him

372
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
And it was

373
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
A lot of fun and use Greg

374
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,263
Fun person to work with and had a lot of different Springs that I didn't have like I've never done anything in business

375
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
I'd been a teacher in

376
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Orchid academic environment

377
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
At the end of the end of working together for a while he said let's

378
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,991
Let's start a business together like I know you know the internet I know business

379
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Like let's do something together

380
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
And you said yes right away

381
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
And I said yeah sure and we like shook hands and and

382
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
And we didn't know what the business would be though

383
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
You know so it's kind of like

384
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
And then and then he ended up meeting Ariana subsequently

385
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
I came back from the meeting

386
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Does everyone in

387
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
Then business and media and

388
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
New Politics

389
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
And she's bringing it all together and imagine if you could bring that online

390
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
I-30 he started saying no

391
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Lennar company with Ariana and I was like

392
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
What am I Googling her

393
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,231
Then I was like I have to meet her at the LA to go meet Ariana

394
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
What was your first impression ever

395
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:14,399
Well I got there late at night and she's an end so I went and I didn't meet her I just went

396
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Sleep in her guest room

397
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
So I wake up at 7 like 6 in the morning which for me is

398
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
Super 7 it whatever it was it felt so early to me and I come out and Ariana is having breakfast

399
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
So then we have our meeting she's talking about

400
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:34,367
You know what she wants what you want I don't even really remember I just was kind of what you know is like talking to her and she was

401
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Char meaning

402
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Martin

403
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
Really you know fun to talk to you and then

404
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
A little while later she's like

405
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,839
You have to meet feel angelini's he's running for governor of California

406
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,935
And then like Ariana's introducing me to fill angelini's

407
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Ariana is like

408
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
He's like a digital genius.

409
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,111
I live in New York City I don't work

410
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
Didn't even know that Phil angelini's was you know

411
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:14,815
A person until right earlier this morning and now I'm going to be a digital

412
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,727
Do I fly back to New York and Kenny's Lego what are you thinking I was like yeah let's do it

413
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:28,127
Wow so I did I kind of thought it will be it'll be an adventure it'll be to apply these ideas

414
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
About

415
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,807
Virality on the internet to a bunch of different one-off project plans a company with a new thing and so it's

416
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Felt like an X

417
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,903
Stagefright to do that the division of Huffington Post

418
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
It's going to be like a left

419
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Swing

420
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Drudge Report

421
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Yeah I think

422
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
He said you know what every industry if there's a

423
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
The coke there's going to

424
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Barbara pepper

425
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
I see and The Drudge Report out there by

426
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
By themselves and it never

427
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Political mediator

428
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Strong

429
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Right-wing thing there's always room for a left-wing

430
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
And the internet was being

431
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Underutilized by left

432
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,039
Winger Progressive site there was a kind of you to admit it was a kind of utopian

433
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
Left-wing blogosphere but there wasn't

434
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
A

435
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Site that was run like a

436
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Accompany in a

437
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Business that way

438
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,535
That have that perspective and I think any had a strong Vision that that would work

439
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Ariana as well

440
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,399
And I was like I was more of a I had ideas about

441
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
How to grow some

442
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
The Intern

443
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
I was still kind of in that

444
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Mine said it wasn't that I was

445
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Shaping

446
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
The division of

447
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,919
How can I post in a way I was trying to think okay how do you make the most out of

448
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
The Ariana's Network

449
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
Bringing those people into the blogosphere and how do you make the most out of

450
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
A sticky front page with links

451
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
People come back I was thinking it kind of those kind of

452
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Yeah and we

453
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Didn't even have article page

454
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
We have block we don't have blog post which were the only permalinks on the site and then the headlines all clicked

455
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
Out to others

456
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Other sources

457
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
And so

458
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
Really the election drove a lot of the early growth

459
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
And as we go

460
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
Approach the election we had to think

461
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,663
How are we going to continue to grow after the election

462
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
We're going to just

463
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
Died after the election 2018

464
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Yeah yeah

465
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
About with dates

466
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Yeah I know so

467
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Within a year

468
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Rhe months

469
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Starting

470
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Almond Avenue

471
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Can post you started this side project

472
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Thing you called BuzzFeed lab

473
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Before we talk about what it was what

474
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
What was it that you couldn't

475
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Do it happens in

476
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Post-it

477
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
That I don't know that kind of gave you the snitch

478
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
To do something on your own

479
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
I couldn't play an experiment

480
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Much as I wanted we were right from the start

481
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Building a company and trying to grow it

482
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Really fast Huffington Post

483
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
You know I think I when I

484
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Ariana asked me

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
What's the earliest

486
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
If we could launch

487
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Stopping in post

488
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
And I think I told her a date and then

489
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
She announced

490
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Austin the Press like

491
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
3 days before that or something or like everything was like

492
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
So

493
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Rushton

494
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
Fast N

495
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
If there wasn't a real are in Dior

496
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Experimentation

497
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
A research

498
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
So I learned a lot having a post about building a business

499
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Startups

500
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,832
But there was feeling that way to figure out media how media work what does it mean when people can

501
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Can share media to come to disc

502
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Distribution

503
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Throwing things out

504
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Still trying to understand I couldn't do it half

505
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
If I started the lab or I could

506
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Continue to play and do

507
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Research you were trying to figure out

508
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Why people

509
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Share things rather than white people.

510
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
Just click on

511
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Yeah why do people share things

512
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
What what's going to happen to the media industry if

513
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
The distribution is

514
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
People sharing with each other

515
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Consumer powers

516
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
It felt like that was a big chef

517
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
And you're from the Nike

518
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Email wear

519
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
What does it mean that a student can reach

520
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
Millions of people without a gatekeeper

521
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Blessing

522
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
And what's that going to do to

523
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
The entire media industry and entertainment industry what's the politics

524
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
Like that was a fascinating big question and it gets into

525
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
Psychology what matters have you bought gets into social psychology of how do people want to represent themselves to other people what do people want to

526
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,408
Share with other people and why and what value do they get when they share all those kind of questions

527
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
That I was fascinated by and

528
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
John my partner BuzzFeed

529
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Wegmans

530
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
John Johnson

531
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Diving

532
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
Is a more academic type guy as well and so he was very

533
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
State in

534
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,768
These questions and also in funding BuzzFeed he gave you some seed money

535
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
It started when we started John just paid every month

536
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,312
At least like your other Founders stories right Rite Aid like mysterious millionaire who like

537
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
Like fun size totally unviable business

538
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
In just a moment we'll find out how Jonah turn BuzzFeed into a very viable business

539
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
I'm gyros near listening to a special live episode of How I built this from NPR

540
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
Port for this NPR

541
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,648
Podcast comes from American Express open

542
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
We know that listeners to how I built this are curious

543
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Curious about how good ideas

544
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Businesses

545
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
And chances are you have some good ideas of your own but as you know in business

546
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
There can be a lot of roadblocks

547
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,568
American Express open knows how hard it can be to get things done

548
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,432
And they want to help with money and no house so you can turn those ideas into a

Visit open.com

550
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
To get business

551
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Hey welcome back to the

552
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
Special live episode of How I built this from NPR

553
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
I'm guy Raz

554
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Joey trap 2008

555
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
And Jonah Freddy's

556
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Still at the Huffington Post

557
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
But he started the side project

558
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
BuzzFeed labs

559
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,064
He starts to Tinker with an idea question really that

560
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
I'm still pretty new at the time

561
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
A question was

562
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
How do you use the internet

563
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
The spread content

564
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,048
The vision was to try to solve the bigger problem of

565
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
What does it mean when

566
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
When the people become the distributor

567
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
And what does it mean when people sharing

568
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
It is how people too

569
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,568
Discovery do anything it took to solve that problem

570
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
So it might be developing tack

571
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
If you double a tack it might be

572
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
Hiring really creative editors

573
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
You can make

574
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Listen quizzes

575
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Eventually as news started to be shared on The Social Network so is building a journalism function but that happened later

576
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Really it was

577
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
Finding things that you thought could be viral like

578
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Well like I mean Bowie

579
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Cat videos

580
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,584
Right or like the dog on

581
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Skateboard

582
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Was it

583
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Was that

584
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
What you were experimenting with originally

585
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:23,360
We had something that was similar to block decks with where it where we would crawl sites and look for acceleration we had a chatbot that

586
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
It would then send out links

587
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Two people but you can only have one

588
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
20 people can

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Connected to it so

590
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Didn't wasn't

591
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Scalable business

592
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
We

593
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,928
Built some tool that was great left-wing and right-wing sites and and then show the differences

594
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Between left and right

595
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
Lefferts right thing

596
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
We're just doing lots of experiments to try to understand

597
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,680
Who is reading BuzzFeed was it I mean

598
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
The time how many

599
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
People were clicking on this

600
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
We basically double Their audience every year from when we launch

601
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
And it started with something like

602
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
$200,000

603
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
300000

604
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
People a month and where was your traffic

605
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
We had some of it coming from a small widget

606
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
On Huffington Post

607
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,904
Because having it was only at politics content so we had a little little link SM other content

608
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
And then someone was coming to react

609
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
To the site

610
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
And

611
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
Then when Facebook and Twitter became bigger

612
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,400
That's really when BuzzFeed was viable because the whole thing we're obsessed with was

613
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Social

614
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
And the first

615
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Social unlocked

616
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
Internet memes and humor then it unlocked

617
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
It you started to have things like cute animals and

618
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
And things like that

619
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
And then eventually you news and then

620
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Entertainment video and kind of everything

621
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
And so as as social became bigger we were able

622
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
The grow long with it

623
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
And how did you

624
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
How did you do that I mean you were

625
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
A major

626
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
Person having imposed

627
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
You've got the side hustle what were you doing where you like doing it

628
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Nights and weekends how did you

629
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Will you going back and forth

630
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,960
I was just sort of walked between Chinatown in SoHo

631
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,056
I would pick up Vietnamese sandwiches for the Outpost people on my way on my way

632
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,128
You would you would not have sandwiches on a day-to-day basis

633
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
There's a jewelry store in Chinatown that has these amazing sandwiches in the back of the jewelry store and so I would walk from BuzzFeed

634
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
BuzzFeed when it had a people

635
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:14,208
And then I would do is a traffic meeting at HuffPost with all the editors work focus on growth and traffic

636
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
People asked you

637
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,864
What is a Busby thing that you're doing did you say I intend to build a Mediacom

638
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
How did you think of it at

639
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
What early early on when John

640
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,872
Was funding it and we had no revenue and it was like a lab I mean we were technically company but we were

641
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,664
Exploring experimenting

642
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
It was only when we started to get a little bit bigger we launched

643
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
The website BuzzFeed we started to have

644
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
People there

645
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
The workers jobs

646
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Was was

647
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Tide BuzzFeed that I thought

648
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
We should raise the money

649
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,328
It isn't from John I also did never took a salary at BuzzFeed in the early days but live entirely off

650
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Opposed

651
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,704
And I feel guilty that my friend was like funding this

652
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
Company and I wanted to go find some

653
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Outside Capital to build Buzz

654
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,104
I mean I just imagine you're going to

655
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Potential investors

656
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
You're like well we're trying to create this

657
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
Staying when I really sure it is really Justin viral

658
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Content

659
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Sister before

660
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
People really

661
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
Talked about that

662
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Were there that's what you were like

663
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
I don't I don't believe that what you're trying to do

664
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
You're nobody wanted in bath

665
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,768
I have our first pitch deck is

666
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
We we put it online

667
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
And so you can actually go see our first pitch dial

668
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
And

669
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
And

670
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
I don't know now that BuzzFeed has done well and grown people think oh that's a good pitch that you should pattern your fish I caught that but everyone rejected

671
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
Our pitch

672
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
And really the first

673
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
If the first

674
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
Time we were able to raise money

675
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
What you know is from SoftBank which also has invested

676
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
Post and they

677
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
Then there was another

678
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
A firm that wanted to invest

679
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
But they told me I had to leave huffpo

680
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
And so once there was another friend that said you

681
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:56,864
You have to leave her post in the hippos investors like no don't leave well if that's the best you think that's great you know

682
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
And so did you I mean

683
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
Were there any moments even before

684
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,752
Because this is still

685
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
BuzzFeed

686
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
This is still before you

687
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Started to create original Khan

688
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
Was there a point where

689
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
I don't know but if you could

690
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
They've been under

691
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
I mean

692
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
I think

693
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
We

694
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
We were able to raise money before we ever

695
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
We're about to run out of money but it was hard

696
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
And so I think any

697
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Any startup

698
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
He in the early days you're questioned the viability and you question

699
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
You know

700
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,680
Is this going to

701
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
To let you know grow the way we want it to grow

702
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
Why was it important for you

703
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
To essentially

704
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Transition into creating

705
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Mortar Media company that made

706
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,272
I mean you could have just been an aggregator

707
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
And found the best

708
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
Cat videos and dog out Neo dogs on wheels

709
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
End

710
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Probably still been profitable

711
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
What was the turning point in your mind that where you thought you know

712
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
What's higher team will start making our own

713
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Stop riding around

714
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,704
Investors didn't want us to hire journalist

715
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Our reporters are

716
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Many people other than

717
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Engineers in business

718
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
You look at all the big

719
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Tech companies in

720
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Silicon Valley

721
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
There their monocultures of Engineers in business

722
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,480
They Don't Really hire people who make

723
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
And create content

724
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
It's expensive and they'd rather have a model where are you

725
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Just go to the platform and then

726
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,512
The content comes for free cuz that everyone post their their baby pictures are their own viral videos or whatever it is

727
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,352
And so that was the main feedback from investors we don't want to invest but

728
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Because you're going to have to hire all these people and that's it

729
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Expensive

730
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
Nne and our first investor deck was like why are some people but their test pilots for technology and maybe won't hire

731
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
That many people could you probably wouldn't have been able to even raise money if we

732
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
If we said or plan

733
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
Has the higher

734
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,504
Lots and lots of reporters

735
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
But I wanted to solve the problem

736
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Like I wanted to understand how do you make things at so meaningful that someone wants to share it with someone else in their life and in order to

737
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
To do that you can't just build a platform cuz if you just build a platform people will

738
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
You're not involved in the attacks

739
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:09,728
Procreation and if you look at my the earlier work we're talking about it's things like rejection line black people love us tonight

740
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,824
We are making the content and Trust understanding how it spread in

741
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,664
By varying the content of tweaking the content improving the content finding new sources

742
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
The inspiration

743
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,272
New sources of creativity you actually it actually has a huge effect on health

744
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
Thanks read it so I wanted to solve that problem so I needed that I needed creative people

745
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Bolted to do that

746
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
It seems me outside and it made

747
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Be different from the inside versium

748
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,096
Insidious of the big train play was in 2011 when you hired been

749
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
A Politico

750
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
To be the editor and chief

751
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
BuzzFeed

752
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
That was obvious

753
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
I always assumed that the

754
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Golub

755
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Yadiel

756
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
And that was to really

757
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Expand your

758
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Your original

759
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,504
The main thing was that we were doing

760
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
BuzzFeed started the iPhone hadn't come out yet

761
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
Twitter was what you had for lunch

762
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
Facebook with how you met up with you

763
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Your friends

764
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,536
And the only content peopleshareworks cute animals

765
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
An internet memes

766
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
And

767
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
That's the kind of stuff we made in the early days

768
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
We started to notice that people are sharing news on Facebook and Twitter and that was new and we got very excited

769
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Now we can go into the news business

770
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
And we we felt left out of that because we started to see news being shared and we on a day when there was lots of news

771
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Like we were kind of didn't have much

772
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
To do

773
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
And so we could hire Ben Smith

774
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
And we are

775
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,744
Alexa another general election coming up we learn from Huffington Post

776
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
That building at

777
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
News business in the run-up to the election is a good time to do it and go band join hired a really great crew of

778
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
Reporters beat reporters covering the election

779
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:52,128
And we built our news business and in that election and then we're safe were they able to grow it

780
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
I want to I want to just a question I asked you about

781
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
A very controversial

782
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
He took earlier this year.

783
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
Post the contents of the Trump dossier

784
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Right which was

785
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,144
Which which suggested that there are all kinds of things that happened in the hotel room

786
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
Russia etc etc

787
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,496
Buzz the administration

788
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Before you mystery

789
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
Christian was inaugurated

790
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Crazy

791
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,152
You think that's the point where they went crazy

792
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Do you think that that

793
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,976
I mean do you think that you would have done that again you think that was the right

794
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Decision to make

795
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Given that

796
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
You know there really isn't a whole lot of

797
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Consensus about whether it was a

798
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Accurate

799
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
He is

800
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,264
I definitely think it was the right the right decision and the reason

801
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
We publish today

802
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Was because

803
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
You had everyone in the senior levels

804
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:01,248
The government and media talking about this document and referring to the document

805
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
Even in public

806
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Communications

807
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
You have the president present like any brief

808
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
On the on the document

809
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
But the public was totally in the dark

810
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,072
You know he had CNN say no this document exists in here recently talked about people should at least have exposure to

811
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
So this was something

812
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,168
Could be hugely important to the

813
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
The country

814
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
And

815
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
The public didn't know

816
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
Didn't know what was going on I just knew something was up

817
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Yeah and it felt you know so we we think

818
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
The news is really

819
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,040
Particularly with the internet news is really moving from.

820
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,696
A long. Where you would trust a few news anchors to tell you this is the truth than you had to kind of believe them based on their Authority

821
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,536
To the public really wanting to see the work and understand what's it what's actually happen

822
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Opening day

823
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
Doesn't it in a sentence

824
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,472
Feed into this narrative that that Donald Trump has that the news media is fake news

825
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Just went when

826
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
There are things that are

827
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Is there a danger of

828
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
That is well well I think that definitely

829
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,016
There is a danger of having the president call everything fake news

830
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
And it makes it very hard to to know what is that word even mean yeah we were very clear and careful what we published

831
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,024
This was a document that was circulating that some things in it we were able to

832
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Determine were not true

833
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
And that there were many unverified sayings

834
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Send a document

835
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
And in that we are publishing it to the public

836
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Could see what was being done

837
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
That we weren't publishing it saying this

838
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
This is a bunch of

839
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Things that

840
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
We're verifying its

841
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Atreyu on the contrary lyrics

842
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Reporting out

843
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
What was X

844
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Play happening what the conversation

845
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
Something message to BuzzFeed

846
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
In your your business model is

847
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Is around

848
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Advertising

849
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,536
And one of the things that you guys really pioneered was

850
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
People called native app

851
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Sponsored that branded

852
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,008
Which is which is controversial in the you know the news

853
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Is basically

854
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Appears to some people

855
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
To be alone

856
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,920
To be indistinguishable from

857
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Reported piece

858
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
What what

859
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Tell me

860
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
The thinking behind an and why

861
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,112
Did you think that was the right way to go

862
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,232
It actually isn't that first pitch deck which it it it it was I looked it

863
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
The best

864
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Businesses

865
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Is on the internet

866
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
And they tended to use some form of native advertising

867
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
So Google

868
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
How to search engine

869
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
You enter a keyword in and it would give you a bunch of

870
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Relatedly

871
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
But it also give you a bunch of related tables

872
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
And that's how they made their money

873
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
And what that meant was the core engine that Google built

874
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Search

875
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Would help

876
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,904
Serta consumer with Organic links and would make them more money with paid links and they can invest that money back into making search

877
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
And so

878
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,584
That was a very different model than when you looked at Publishers like at Huffington Post it was so frustrating to me that we build all these tools and

879
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Allergy to grow Huffington Post

880
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,008
In the way we made money was banner ads that were powered by some other technology company that we didn't control

881
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,056
The often slow down our site

882
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
And made it harder to read or blocked so you know the content on the site

883
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,272
Emily got better at making a technology for for editors and writers and audience

884
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,344
We didn't actually get better at making money that was like someone else

885
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Jobs

886
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
And I want to make that same mistake I want

887
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
B

888
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Core engineer BuzzFeed which is

889
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,816
Creating amazing content people love and want

890
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
Share across the Social Web

891
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,704
To also be our business model where we we can take all the things we learn at

892
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
And apply that four-door advertisers

893
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
The one likely example

894
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
When

895
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
Quizzes got really big

896
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:44,992
A month after that we could have a branded quiz for HBO which is how will you die in Game of Thrones

897
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
And you answer questions and I'll be like you'll be trampled there you'll be beheaded

898
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
And

899
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Like

900
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
It was

901
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,048
Summit got a million views users loved it the byline with HBO it was clear it was about HBO

902
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
But it allowed us make advertising

903
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:06,496
It didn't suck and we got better at making something like quiz we also got better at May

904
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Making money and so that was that was

905
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
How do you know

906
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
How to make something go viral. Cents for it

907
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
I mean are you

908
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Is it just

909
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
Something that you intuitively know how to do

910
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,112
It's as complicated as human psychology

911
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Which is why it's so interesting

912
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,720
Does Ubuntu think the reason humor works LOL

913
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,376
And the reason cute animals work so well is that their natural ways people bond with each other and do you go out for drinks with your friend

914
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
And people are telling jokes

915
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
The next day

916
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,496
You don't remember the specific jokes

917
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
You just remember you last with your friend and you feel closer

918
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,200
Why do you Pat the family dog and everyone gathers around you feel closer to the doggy feel closer to everyone in your

919
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
In your family

920
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,832
Feeling the same emotion at the same time or laughing people is a way of bonding with people

921
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
And so

922
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,696
When we started BuzzFeed everyone thought of content of information to get in people

923
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,024
Are people going to read it and get the information

924
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,096
We had it inside the content was on social

925
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,168
With a way of connecting with someone in your life and building a closer

926
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
A relationship with

927
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
And then from there it started to

928
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
Expanded whole bunch of different areas

929
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
You

930
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
Share this content you express your identity

931
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,456
I'm from you know if if I'm from Oakland and I see something in about Oakland that's like

932
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
What signs you grew up in Oakland

933
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
I will share that

934
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,672
Cuz I want my friend to Ulta broken open to connect with me but I also want people who didn't grow up there to know what it's like so that I can

935
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,560
Can feel closer to them and so we started it always think of the perspective of the audience and what are their social needs what are the jobs that they

936
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,680
Want to achieve in their life what are the things that matter to them and can we use content as a

937
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Kind of glue

938
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
Tattoo help him do that

939
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
While you were

940
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
And why you were Building Company in

941
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
And as you continue to develop

942
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
The company you are the CEO

943
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
How did you

944
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Learn how to

945
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Tubidy

946
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
Do that job I mean

947
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
That wasn't what you were trained to do you go to Business School

948
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Have that

949
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
No I'm very unqualified for the job today

950
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,560
That I have to figure out how to be

951
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
The CEO of

952
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm see I'm still figuring it out

953
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:14,240
It's a constantly learning in the company changes so much every year that I have to

954
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
To learn about I read lots of books

955
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080
Ira lots of Business book

956
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,152
I read Harvard Harvard Business review on airplane

957
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
That's like really yeah

958
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
Because

959
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,576
I didn't go to business school and I didn't know you know so

960
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
I'm actually Harvard Business Review is a

961
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
A good example of

962
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Pick up of

963
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Why people share

964
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
The people liked

965
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
To say that they read Harvard

966
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,328
View or share article from Harvard Business review

967
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
Because it

968
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
Seems like they're smart

969
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
And like

970
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
And it has the word Harvard in it

971
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
And so even if

972
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Even if I didn't

973
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
Read Harvard Business review

974
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
You might still might say that

975
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
So people would think

976
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,711
How he's qualified to be a CEO he read an article

977
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
In Harvard Business review

978
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
You guys are still a private company

979
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,903
You

980
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
You got an offer from Disney

981
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Tempted to buy BuzzFeed

982
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
I guess in mm

983
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
From what I've heard a pretty pretty

984
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Nice offer

985
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
How much money by the way do they have

986
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
I don't remember

987
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
So so why why did you turn down

988
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,895
I think that part of it is it as a

989
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,687
Got thing or an emotional thing where you

990
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,015
I just didn't feel ready I felt like there's a lot more we had to build

991
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,855
I'm at the time we were really a website and our video business it just started

992
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Was growing so much

993
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
And I knew that that was going to be a big part of our fee

994
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Future

995
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,535
I valued our independence a lot and thought that there were a lot of things

996
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
We could do

997
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
On our own

998
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
I worried about being part of a big company

999
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,447
And being so so small relative to

1000
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
My Donuts were

1001
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
I feel like we wanted to figure out how to invent

1002
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
The future of media and how things should work in the future and wanted to make sure we had the independence to do that as so-so

1003
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,295
So could you maybe it would have maybe would have been great but I see

1004
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
You know I'm happy with the decision and

1005
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
We we've been able to do a lot of things

1006
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Company

1007
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,655
You your company that the last valuation was like 1-1 1/2 billion dollars and maybe value higher

1008
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Now

1009
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
When you when you

1010
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,007
Think about that number one and a half billion dollar

1011
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,847
It is made you whether you like it or not a rich person

1012
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
You're rich man

1013
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
Does it mean anything to you does it

1014
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
The paper number

1015
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
Do you sometimes think

1016
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
I'm so rich now

1017
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
I mean I feel

1018
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
Fortunate that we available

1019
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
Build the company 2

1020
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,119
To be something that is valuable that other

1021
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
People think is

1022
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,679
Is worth

1023
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
You know what is a valuable entity and the

1024
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
Real thing that I value is that

1025
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
That the valuation is set

1026
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
Through investment and the fact that people have invested

1027
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
Dennis has given us

1028
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Resources

1029
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
To build big things

1030
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
In the future and said not

1031
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
I think day-to-day like

1032
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,623
How are we doing this quarter how are we doing

1033
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
This weekend

1034
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,463
Think be able to think much more long-term

1035
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
Play weekend

1036
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
Wework what are things going to be like in

1037
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
2 years and 5 years and how do we build towards that

1038
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,399
And you can't do that unless you have a high valuation

1039
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
And people willing to endure

1040
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
A lots of money

1041
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
How much of your success

1042
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
What happened to Yuan

1043
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
The creation of BuzzFeed

1044
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Is due to your

1045
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Brilliance

1046
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
And talented

1047
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Hard-working

1048
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
How much of it is

1049
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,343
I don't know the people self-knowledge on these things is the best

1050
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
Knowledge

1051
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,695
I I think that in general

1052
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
There's a huge amount of lock

1053
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
I think there's also there's concept of

1054
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
You know

1055
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
Mark Zuckerberg who runs Facebook

1056
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
Partly he gets smarter by running Facebook like once you have some initial success you get access

1057
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
Two people and ideas and data

1058
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,175
That allow you to synthesize things and so

1059
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
I think that is

1060
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Is also

1061
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Yeah really important

1062
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
And then if you know if you can grow something

1063
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,903
7% every month you can double it every year and if you do that for a few years

1064
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Goten

1065
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Size of atoms

1066
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:22,815
You stay at something long enough and you learn as you're doing it and you prove it you do it

1067
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,679
Initial little bit of initial lock can be turned into something much bigger over

1068
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Overtime

1069
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
But there's a there's a huge amount of Lock and privilege

1070
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,847
And an opportunity of where you're born and how you

1071
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
And I think that

1072
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Is a

1073
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Is a prominence

1074
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,783
I think for a lot of people hearing a story it would say

1075
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
It would sound very

1076
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Seamless

1077
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,879
Jonah you know does this

1078
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,183
Spiral thing with Nike and then

1079
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
He gets

1080
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Connected to the people who start hockey

1081
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,559
Pekin post and then that happens and then he's able to

1082
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
BuzzFeed

1083
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
And

1084
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
You know in bus

1085
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Just scales

1086
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
What is it

1087
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,215
About startups

1088
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
That

1089
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,079
That either you didn't understand or other people that Utah

1090
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
Ask about Starbucks.

1091
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
What

1092
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
Like it's harder than it looks

1093
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
What kind of scan is it

1094
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
I mean is that right

1095
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
It is very it is hard yeah

1096
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
That's really hard

1097
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
I think you have to love

1098
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
The fact that

1099
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,511
First volunteer to get the money question you're asking

1100
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,559
It's not a good way to make a lot of money

1101
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Sometimes

1102
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
Fortunate make a lot of money in startup

1103
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
But mostly

1104
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,983
Fail and when I think about the New York texting in the people

1105
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
That I knew over the years

1106
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
Lots of really smart creative people

1107
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
So much effort

1108
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
In the building startups that

1109
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
Various reasons often outside of their control

1110
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Didn't succeed

1111
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,599
It so you have to love it and you have to love the struggle and you have to love that it

1112
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
It's hard building something new and having lots of

1113
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Petition having

1114
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
About what you're doing and having

1115
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Big big incumbents trying to

1116
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
Higher your people or businesses

1117
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
It's it's hard it mean it's it it requires

1118
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Being

1119
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Really liking

1120
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
How to do hard things

1121
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
In a push against

1122
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
Against struggle like I think I think

1123
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
When you think about

1124
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
Any worthwhile Endeavor though

1125
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
It's hard like

1126
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
Exercising

1127
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
If you want to get in shape it's like

1128
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
Gets hard he know or

1129
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
You know if playing video games

1130
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:27,999
Like you know certain levels are really hard like there's anyone here play video games I mean

1131
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
And at like

1132
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,119
With video games if you start it on level 26

1133
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:38,239
Terrible you just I get destroyed right but if you play your way up to level 26

1134
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
