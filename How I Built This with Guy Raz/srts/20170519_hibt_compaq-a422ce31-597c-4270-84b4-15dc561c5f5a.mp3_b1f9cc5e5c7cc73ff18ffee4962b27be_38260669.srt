Well they take over and push everybody out

00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
In February of 1984 IBM introduces their own portable into the

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
Our order stopped because before it actually was introduced they were showing it to

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
The dealers and customers in they just stopped arguing ours that was that was a very very life for us

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:48,896
We have his Factory running full speed and no place to go

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,040
From NPR how I built this

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists stories behind the movement

15
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
Canyon personal computer startup Compaq to go on the biggest computer company in

16
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
In the world and one

17
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
If you have a PC at home or at work and

18
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
Some software like

19
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
Word or TurboTax

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
It doesn't really matter if you have a Dell or an HP or Toshiba because if it's a PC it will

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
PC software that makes perfect sense right

22
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
Believe it or not in the 1980s in the early days of personal computers

23
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
That is not how it works

24
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
If your computer was say in IBM

25
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,408
Well you needed software written for and IBM

26
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,992
And IBM was the biggest player by far

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
Some people thought that IBM would eventually Crush all the competition and become the only piece

28
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,512
All that changed when Rod Canyon started Compaq

29
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
Wasn't your typical Restless entrepreneurial guy infected he had a good and stable job at 10

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,264
Texas Instruments as an electrical engineer and he was pretty happy there

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
One day in 1981 is managers assigned him to work on a new project and it was something

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Believe would not work

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
Until he started to get frustrated

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,392
Basically was being told to go spend the next two years of my life being my head against the wall

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
And end up in failure

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
So at that moment

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,864
Rod started to talk to to close colleagues at Texas Instruments Jim Harris and Bill mirto and

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
Basically said maybe we should leave

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
We met

40
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,776
And talked about how we're going to go start a company

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
And a lot of startup companies in California and Silicon Valley

42
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,504
One of the first things we realize is G these guys are having fun they're making a ton of money in

43
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Running smart and we are they just

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
They're just out doing it themselves

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
There's also this awareness that something really big is going on in that personal computer Market when I be

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Diameter the market in August of 1981

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
We realized that

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
That market

49
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
It was going to explode

50
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:25,312
And then what happened is fall comdex came along

51
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,920
We went out to the conference and saw all of the companies and all of the things going on in twitch

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
That did it we went back to Houston and talked about

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
We're going to miss this if we don't get going so

54
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
Jim Harrison III turn in a resignation

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Right away

56
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Amaretto

57
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,232
Waited because

58
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
His wife was about to deliver

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Their first child

60
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
And you had a family to write

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
How many kids did you have

62
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
3

63
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,752
Were you nervous at all about just quitting without any income coming in I mean

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Were you worried at all about doing that

65
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
You know I don't remember being worried about it

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
The three of us none of us had any

67
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
Money to invest so what we did was we saved up

68
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Money and the idea was

69
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
We'll give ourselves a runway length

70
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
The six months

71
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Come up with an idea and go get funding

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
You know I think

73
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
This was an adventure

74
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Let's go see what we can do

75
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
So what did the three of you serve land on the idea that that

76
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Eventually turned into combat

77
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
Well the the idea came to me

78
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Actually one morning

79
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
It was strange how you remember those

80
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Pivotal point in your life but

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
I was thinking about the idea for a portable computer there were

82
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
A number of them that existed at the time

83
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Probably

84
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Just guess

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
15 or 20

86
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Well most people

87
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
Remember the Osborn

88
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
It was made out of

89
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Cheap molding and sort of

90
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Strung together

91
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
It had a 5 inch diameter screen

92
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,055
It had two floppies but you could have mediately see some ways to make it a lot better in a week

93
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,639
We decided we could do a 9 inch screen in about the same size box

94
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Well that seems small

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
Turns out it's about the same size is

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
What the

97
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
Original iPad screen is

98
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,695
And we could make it rugged so that when you carried it it was

99
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Not damaged

100
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
But

101
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
Not worth really spending the time on unless we could

102
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
Get some software that already existed

103
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Cuz

104
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,543
I had learned that the key software like spreadsheets and word processors in and others

105
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,943
Every different brand of computer had to have its own version of the popular software program

106
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
So I said well

107
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
What if we could make

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,087
This great portable run software that already exists

109
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
I knew that the IBM PC

110
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Was relatively unprotected it would be a

111
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
A challenge but it could be reverse-engineered

112
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Legally

113
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
And we could make our computer

114
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Run the same software

115
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
And that was the idea that the send a chill down my spine wow

116
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,591
What's wrong with this idea there's there's got to be something wrong with it it's too good to be just

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Hanging around here

118
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
At what point did you say okay we have an idea let's go look for money

119
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,575
So I called up Jim Harris and then later got bilmar to involve and we

120
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
Thought about it talked about it and decided you know that that would be a great product if we can do that

121
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
Let's put together the business plan and so that was the next thing we did I mean

122
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
It was very quick from the 9th of January

123
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
To when the idea came up to the 22nd of January when we met with a venture cap

124
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
We basically

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,895
Put together I am a very short for page business plan and prepare to meet and discuss

126
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
And what did they say when they die

127
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Well

128
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
They were coming into town for another meeting and we

129
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
But this business plan in front of a man

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Begin to describe it

131
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
And

132
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Then they started

133
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
Talking to each other either one of them said

134
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
Yeah I had this idea you know like three months ago

135
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
And I said well

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
If you think it's such a good idea why aren't you more excited about it and I said well

137
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Look

138
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
We like the idea we like you guys

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
But we're new in this

140
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Industry

141
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,455
So what you need to do is we need to send you out to Silicon Valley and go meet with Kleiner Perkins

142
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Enough

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
They all the best then we will

144
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
So we

145
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
We basically flew out to

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
To Silicon Valley and we went in to meet with Jon Dore

147
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
And we spent

148
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
A good morning probably 3 or 4 hours

149
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Being

150
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Questions

151
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
And

152
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Turn off

153
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
About a week later

154
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
We got a call that they were willing to invest in

155
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
So

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
It was a go

157
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,991
Okay so it's 1982 I guess and and you've gotten your investors and in what

158
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Did you get to work building a prototype

159
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Well first thing we do is

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Begin hiring people

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
The three of us

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
We're sort of

163
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
The head of each area but we need

164
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Engineers mainly to go figure out how to reverse engineer in hell

165
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Designer things how so we hire three engineers

166
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
And importantly they basically had to build something

167
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Pretty similar to an IBM PC

168
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
Except pretty similar didn't cut it and you had to be

169
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Exactly the same in order to run the software

170
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
From an internal temp

171
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
So they are

172
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
They came to Workforce right away

173
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
And again

174
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
First reverse engineering a product

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
And then designing our own

176
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
But were you convinced that you guys were going to succeed

177
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
You know it never crossed my mind that we wouldn't

178
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Succeed and as I look back now I think

179
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Well that was such a long shot

180
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
You know our expectations were very low

181
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,871
What is exceed mean if it didn't mean become an industry leader it didn't even mean become one of the leading cup

182
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
Is it Matt build a company that doesn't go out of business

183
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
That has a product

184
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
That solves a real need

185
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
And you don't lose money on it

186
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
We felt like we know how to do that

187
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
How long does it take

188
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
For you from that point in

189
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
I guess the first story has early part of

190
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Nice 82

191
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
Until you had a working prototype

192
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
So we

193
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Start the company February 16th

194
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
And from March until

195
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Early June

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
We had our first prototype ready

197
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,991
The deadline was determined by the national computer conference

198
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,343
What's just happened to be held in Houston that you're the only time I think it was over in Houston

199
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,647
The show 2

200
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Potential dealers

201
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Central Computer store owners who would sell it

202
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,607
Tube magazine writers who would write about it when it came out in a to get feedback

203
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
And others basically to find out

204
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
What people thought about this product

205
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
So you come up with this prototype

206
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
And at that point

207
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Where are you even Manufacturing

208
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
These these computers

209
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
We built

210
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Factory

211
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Inside a leased building

212
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
The north Houston

213
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
We heard manufacturing people Vape

214
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
Put up reproduction Lionheart people trying them on how to build it and

215
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Began to build

216
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
The product

217
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
And we had a plan

218
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
That basically allowed us to build

219
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Probably I'm going to say 20 25000

220
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Computers

221
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
By the end of 83 we didn't begin actually turning out

222
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Finished units until January of 83

223
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Just to be clear

224
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Portable computer in 1983

225
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
You're talking about a

226
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,063
A machine that way

227
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
28 lb

228
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
20

229
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,183
This is not even hand luggage on an airplane

230
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,791
Well we did use it as hand luggage but there was some skepticism about that

231
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
Nelly that you had to plug in Ethernet

232
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
People began to call them

233
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
Transportable computers which is more accurate

234
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
It was also very rugged

235
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
One of our key engineering Talent

236
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
What was the building

237
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
So that it

238
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
When you dropped it

239
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Survive

240
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,503
And of course your portable would run any software

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Written for the

242
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
And another competition did that right

243
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
That's right

244
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
And basically

245
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Layton 82 as we had our first prototype

246
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,327
Bill murto and then I joining because there were a lot of computer stores around the country

247
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
We would go out and make an appointment and go in and and show

248
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
The computer store owner

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Our product

250
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
And

251
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Show them the computer they like the way it looked and when we

252
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
Show them how it works it was very nice

253
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Screen was nice

254
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
But when we told him okay just pick a

255
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Any of the IBM

256
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Software

257
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
Off-the-shelf tennis shrink wrap box

258
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,695
And put it in the computer and see if it runs and when they did that and it ran

259
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Their eyes

260
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Lit up

261
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
They got excited I thought about it a minute and they wanted to order some right there

262
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
Let me say something like okay I need five of these next week or I've got it I'll give you an order for 25 if you can ship them

263
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
In the next month

264
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Bill and I got back to Houston and compare notes

265
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
It was like women every one of these dealer said the same thing

266
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
What we just stumbled onto is this

267
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Pent-up demand

268
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
For portable version of the IBM PC

269
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
It seems solid but we've never thought of our product that way

270
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
This is a portable computer if it's a niche

271
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
And you have software because it runs all the IBM software

272
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
But if you just step back and turn that over and say

273
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Everybody out there has an IBM PC and they're off

274
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
And what they need every one of them needs one more one or more of is

275
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
A portable version of it

276
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
And we happen to have that product

277
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
People were wanting to take

278
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
Leasing home for the weekend or even overnight 2

279
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
To finish their work they want to take them out to customers to show them

280
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
Their work and so it was a much bigger

281
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
Market than anybody anticipated wants

282
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
We had all the ingredients together

283
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,911
Weren't weren't you worried in 1982 when you are going to dealers and showing them your product that

284
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
And it's saying hey you know this is basically

285
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
This could do everything and IBM could do

286
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
Acceptance portal where you guys worried that IBM would come after you

287
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
No because we hadn't broken any laws

288
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah we did reverse-engineer the wrong following

289
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Advice from

290
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Top notch

291
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
Intellectual property lawyer so we were very careful around that

292
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,023
The product was not protected by patents and any other way they unfollowed more or less

293
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
The General Industry Direction and so

294
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Building a computer that was

295
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
Similar or close to it was not a problem at all the fact that we

296
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
Took the time to figure out exactly how there's made the software work

297
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
And made ours do the same thing it was not illegal

298
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,295
It sounds like you guys really want this in a stealth way that IBM probably didn't even

299
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
Care about you thought you were just probably just above a flyspeck of a company

300
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
That was making this product

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
And when you launched it in 1983

302
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
I don't even even know who you were

303
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
Oh no no they had no idea nor did they care I mean even after we began to the store to get some positive

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Live results and getting into stores remember we were portable they didn't have a portal so initial

305
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
Play it was very easy for them to ignore us because we were truly

306
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
Fly in that first year 1983

307
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,815
How did the company do we sold 111 billion dollars worth of Compaq computers

308
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Wow

309
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
Expanding like crazy

310
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Beginning of that year you just had

311
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
A few hundred maybe like less than a hundred people working

312
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
We had about

313
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
About a hundred people at the end of the fur

314
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
That's about right and about 600 by the end of 83

315
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
So you can imagine

316
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
How much hiring we were doing

317
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
And expanding and

318
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,975
Now this was not a one thing at a time this is a multitasking

319
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
Bringing on very competent people in every area so they could

320
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
Here's what needs to be done and go get it

321
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
How how much were you selling that

322
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
First portable computer for

323
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,799
It was it listed for 2995 for a single floppy

324
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Unbelievable

325
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,943
And who your customers was it businesses was it individuals

326
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
It was mostly businesses

327
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
But

328
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Surprising number of individuals could see the value in it

329
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
And if their company wasn't buying it for them then they would do

330
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
They would buy it for themselves

331
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
3000 bucks for this computer in

332
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
Tens of thousands

333
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
IBM is starting to notice

334
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Oh absolutely

335
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Absolutely

336
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Hey

337
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,799
You know in February of 1984

338
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,127
IBM introduces their own portable into the market now

339
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
I order stopped because before it actually was introduced

340
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,527
They were showing it to dealers and customers head

341
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
They just stopped ordering Arce

342
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,671
What's the song that if IBM Market they take over and push everybody out

343
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
We have the factory running full speed

344
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
And no place to go

345
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
That was that was a

346
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Very

347
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Very life-threatening

348
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
So you guys are freaking out

349
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,031
We're freaking out the industry speaking out it's like they're girls compact you know they're there

350
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
They had a good run but it's over when we come

351
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
I'm back at ride Canyon made sure that it wasn't yet over stay with us

352
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
How I built this

353
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,487
NPR

354
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,959
Hey thanks to our 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this hiscox

355
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Hiscox

356
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
What's the business insurance expert to understand

357
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Each business is

358
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Is as unique as a

359
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Fingerprint or a barcode

360
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
Taylor's intelligent resolution

361
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
Every business has very specific needs

362
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
Which may explain their 97% customer service rating

This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

367
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
Capital One is reimagining banking

368
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,983
I offering accounts with no fees or minimums that can be open from anywhere in 5 minutes Capital One

369
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
What's in your wallet

370
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Capital One na

371
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

372
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Harrah's

373
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,271
83 was a really good first year of sales for Rock Canyon and compact

374
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:31,391
But to put it in perspective compact sold about 53,000 computers

375
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
IBM

376
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
700 in

377
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
50000 computers

378
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,887
And so in 1984 when IBM decided to come

379
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Pete with combat

380
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Head to Head

381
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
Everyone knew it was a major threat

382
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
So tried call together the management team

383
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
For an emergency meeting

384
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,199
You know what do we think we ought to do well the manufacturing of people said

385
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
We got a lot of temporary people

386
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
We were hiring so fast

387
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
They came out as temporary is initially in

388
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
And we can lay all them off immediately and we can really cut back production

389
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Got docker cost

390
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
And it was it was a I have to say a very dire

391
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
Down to the meeting everybody was like you know it's all over

392
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,983
Took all that in and added it all up and I realized

393
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
You know if we're going to come out of this

394
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
With a happy ending

395
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
There's only one way that's going to occur and that is

396
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,735
Let's assume for a minute that IBM's product is not better than ours

397
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
That maybe it's a limited Supply and the Dealer's once they see it

398
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
Begin to order our product again

399
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
We need to have product available to fill those orders

400
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,583
So here's what we're going to do we're going to keep building these things we're going to store them and wait for the artist

401
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
To come

402
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,727
But the orders never come yeah we're in deep trouble but you know what we're in deep trouble anyway if they order

403
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
That was the plan

404
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
I'm not sure everybody was

405
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
I'm bored with it but that's what we went off and did

406
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
Weird storing these things in the in the trailers

407
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,575
Tractor trailers 18 wheelers back and parking them in our garage

408
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,623
Parking lot when that filled up

409
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Borrowed space and Friends parking lots around the

410
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
The town and buy

411
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Mid

412
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
February we had about 20 of these trailers full of computer sitting around you

413
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
So what happened how did you survive that

414
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Well

415
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
What happened is IBM introduces the product

416
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
The kick the tires

417
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
It's announced that it is in limited supply for a while

418
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,223
It was not a better probably want to buy a product they just wasn't better

419
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
And so just as we had hoped almost there

420
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,647
Best possible situation is the orders came in and we had the computer

421
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
To feel them it's like they had been holding them back and so not only were they arguing isn't normal right they were sending all the orders that they

422
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
I have been holding

423
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Everything fell into place

424
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Just at the right time and then we took advantage of it

425
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
So what explains

426
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
What explains the fact that they didn't

427
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,383
Fresh you I mean it it sounds to me like it was one of two things it was either

428
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Total luck

429
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,783
Or it was that the IBM portable computer just wasn't that good or maybe both

430
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Well anyway you look at it it was luck

431
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
I mean

432
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
It was it was a lot of luck involved but what happened is

433
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
We have had a year

434
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
To build great relationships

435
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
With the dealers the dealers actually liked having

436
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Somebody other than IBM

437
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
Because I be almost the yuan on the 500 pound gorilla

438
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
In any case we continue to sell like crazy and outsold I've been portable throughout the year I think by the end of the year we

439
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Route selling

440
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
Seven or eight to 184

441
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
By the end of 84

442
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
And

443
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
We tripled

444
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
To 329 million in our second year

445
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
So by your second year you've tripled

446
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Sales

447
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
What was the first time you remember

448
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
Compact becoming part of lyca of the mainstream conversation in america

449
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,567
Well it depends on how big the mainstream is I think by the end of 83

450
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,383
Everybody in the industry knew about Compact and we'll sort of

451
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
Marveling at what was going on here

452
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Now this idea that

453
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
People can use all the same for referrals

454
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,672
All the same things that were designed and built to run in the IBM PC with it was software or Hardware would work on our computer

455
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,304
IBM may be underestimated as they didn't really study what it made our products success

456
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
They could have easily put us out of this

457
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Did they come out with a real comprable

458
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
The product

459
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Yeah and it wasn't once you guys show that

460
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
You could build an IBM clone

461
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
A lot of other companies

462
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Realize it was possible to do the same thing right

463
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,480
And the fact that we took off and set sales records main everybody else

464
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,344
Did including by the way the big guys h p t i

465
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
Violate followed suit but by then we had

466
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
Really establish ourselves

467
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
In the market in

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
You know the thing that took us

469
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
From 600 million and 80

470
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
6 to 1.2 billion in sales in 87

471
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
We came out with our own desktop which was

472
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,848
Essentially three times faster than IBM's desktop for about the same price and begin to establish

473
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
I'm selfish not only the portable company

474
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
But also the high-performance company

475
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
The PS2 in 1987

476
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
So it could not be cloned right

477
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Yeah

478
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
That's right

479
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,936
That was an attempt to take this thing that has gotten out of control mainly due to Compaq

480
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,752
And bring it back under IBM's control

481
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
Comes out with their

482
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
New architecture and claims that this is the way to go

483
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
That that all architecture has run its course

484
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
It's going to run out of gas very soon and so

485
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,576
You don't want to follow it to the end you want to get on this new horse

486
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
And IBM has it

487
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
And so let's go

488
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
And

489
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
That's what IBM

490
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Marketing

491
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Strategy got them in trouble

492
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Because

493
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,656
This thing not only didn't run all the softer it didn't run any of the software

494
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,800
IBM's new computer did not run IBM's own software

495
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
It didn't

496
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Now they came out with new IBM software

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
So if you wanted to buy this new product

498
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Youku

499
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Buy all new peripherals and all new software

500
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
And they would claim that it would help

501
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Performing ething else in the market

502
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,184
Set the time the right and you're saying that

503
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
Emily companies many companies already had

504
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
PCS and software IBM was saying

505
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,448
Buy the Snoopy s2o and you're also going to have to invest in new software

506
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:41,312
You make it sound crazy to them it was normal that's the way the industry had always worked and then

507
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
They still hadn't bought into this end up

508
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Standard

509
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
People

510
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Believing that

511
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:51,808
An understanding that it was important to be able to run your old software on a new computer

512
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
It never happened before

513
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Compact pioneer.

514
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,464
And then they wanted to get rid of it as quick as they could

515
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,560
Was there a moment where you were worried that that actually would succeed

516
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Oh yeah

517
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
No they never questioned it

518
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
They had a

519
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Good chance to

520
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
Succeed now what kept us going and what

521
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
I guess gave us

522
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
Confidence that we had a pretty good chance was

523
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
We outperformed to IBM's best products

524
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Every step of the way

525
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Until there was

526
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,320
It also significant part of the industry that looked at the IBM's claims

527
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Lionel magazine

528
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Aren't afraid to write

529
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Compaq outperformed cibm by

530
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
5200

531
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
In spite of it being a BM

532
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
We're holding onto a pretty

533
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Solid position in the market

534
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Because

535
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
Ours was always higher-performing

536
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,080
It seems like at any juncture

537
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
In your first several years

538
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,688
IBM have they just done

539
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
Something a little bit smarter

540
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Strategically

541
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Could have crushed you

542
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,136
There's no doubt IBM could have crushed us a number of different ways

543
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
And at that point in time

544
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
I can ride so it's it's a five years from the time you launch to to the time you're doing a billion dollars in Revenue

545
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
That's right

546
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,312
How to change your life your own personal life changes all of a sudden you like

547
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm assuming you're you become, rich guy

548
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Yeah

549
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,272
It'll certainly compared to where I had been I was rich but then again we

550
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
We knew that that was a fragile part of it

551
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
I did get a divorce in 1980

552
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
7

553
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
I know it was

554
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Sad part of

555
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Of what happens in the

556
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
And a terrible

557
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
I'm sure it has something to do with the stress associated with

558
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
All the work

559
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
The time I spent at work

560
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,776
So in 1987

561
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Going through divorce

562
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
A simple divorce

563
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Hard

564
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
IBM comes out with his new computer

565
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Designed it to basically

566
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Put you guys out of business

567
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,624
How did you deal with cope with all that happening

568
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,952
Looking back on it I would say it's probably denial

569
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
That's pretty effective tools not letting things

570
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
Impact you as much as they might end

571
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
Other situations is something

572
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
You have to do there I'll be done

573
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
I felt like I was

574
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Learning as I went and I was

575
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
Doing a good job

576
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Louis personal turmoil

577
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
If you want to throw up another layer on top of that

578
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,296
RadioShack tried to buy us in late 86 in early 87

579
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
So that was going on

580
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Same time all this was happening

581
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
So you were just

582
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
It says your personal life you were just kind of

583
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
You compartmentalize that you were you just had to

584
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,888
Put that in a box and focus on the stuff and not let that

585
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Depress you

586
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah

587
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
No

588
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
I've got three kids

589
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
And they're getting to be

590
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Teenagers in

591
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:01,248
There's a little league and there's all of that and I'm trying very hard to get away at the right time you'll see a school play

592
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,832
That's where most of the stress came from trying to do it all

593
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,184
If you could just cut off part of it and say I'm not going to worry about that it would be one thing

594
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
But

595
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
Trying to do it all in and not drop any balls that was pretty stressed

596
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Where you going home

597
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,728
Eating like takeout Chinese food I mean

598
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,544
Crashing usually yeah I know I

599
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
See pictures now

600
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
Of media

601
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,968
During a fast food in a McDonald's bag or a Wendy's bag

602
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
How you just ate when you could that was sort of secondary

603
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Getting everybody

604
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
You taking care of getting the meetings done getting

605
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
Decisions made

606
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Yeah you can look at my role as making decision

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
Yeah I was making all the decisions but all of the key once I had to be involved in

608
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
And they're always a lot

609
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
I guess about

610
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
Like what 10 years after you guys lunch

611
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Compaq

612
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
You

613
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
Drafted to the board of directors

614
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Did they fire you

615
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Almost exactly 10 years later in the front

616
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Why what was going on

617
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Well

618
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
There's several levels of

619
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,672
Looking at the Dynamics there that on the surface it's a matter of disagreement over how fast

620
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
2

621
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Move into the lower-cost arena

622
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Like-like lower-cost PC

623
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Yes

624
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
The chairman of the company Ben Rosen

625
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:28,544
Thought we ought to move very quickly and so quickly that went back we got to go buy a product from

626
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,104
The Taiwanese or Japanese or Korean

627
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Supplier

628
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
And my argument was look

629
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
It's Not What It Seems

630
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
We can get the market as fast

631
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Is anybody

632
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,416
With our own design and I think it's a board meeting

633
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
The board decided to replace me with the number two guy with every fiber

634
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Hot headed

635
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
How'd you get that news

636
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,120
Well we had a board meeting were been proposed

637
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
That idea and I left the room and I

638
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Deliberated it

639
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
For quite a while and then made the

640
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Decision to make the change

641
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
But it was clear that was the direction they were going on I knew that's what it was going to be

642
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
I was also somewhat burnout and I was

643
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
Strange mindset

644
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Yeah I kind of wanted to get out of that

645
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
That pressure it was

646
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
It took me a while to really look back and understand that I was

647
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
A big part of the problem of why it ended up going down that path and I and I regret that

648
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,096
But it is what happened and

649
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,400
I guess under the stress I was under and kind of

650
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
Gotten into this Frame of Mind where I need to get away

651
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
The

652
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Disagreement over the low cost

653
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Speed to Market

654
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Was just the Catalyst that

655
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Allowed it to happen

656
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Almost

657
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
Guided it to the point where I

658
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
It's going to be far

659
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
So when you were at me this is the company that you found it

660
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
Who built

661
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Yes

662
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
And then you were

663
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Removed from the

664
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,304
I think a lot of people hearing that would say God that sounds like ocean and just

665
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Cuz it's your idea

666
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
You created it was your sweat

667
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
And then

668
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Who is taken away from you

669
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Brazil

670
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
From your perspective

671
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,616
That was fine you you weren't kind of your time

672
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Was was over there

673
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Nose be clear

674
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Where are you

675
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Fortune 500

676
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Corporation

677
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
In a world leader in a big industry

678
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,976
And just because you started the company doesn't give you any right to continue to run the cup

679
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
Are the dates to be run by somebody that can make

680
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
Good decisions and can manage

681
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
That complex in operation

682
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
Which I think I was doing

683
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,728
Okay or maybe even

684
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Very well up to that point in time

685
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
So that's

686
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
I don't see that as the reason

687
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,408
That I needed to leave I think it had more to do with

688
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
My friend of mine and sort of a burned-out

689
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Situation

690
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,112
You were in your mid-forties at that point so so pretty

691
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Pretty young guy

692
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Accomplished a lot

693
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,840
Did you walk out of the company with a vino financially secure for you except for life at that point

694
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Yes absolutely

695
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
No course

696
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
Continue my life actually the the home life

697
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
Became a much less stressful and

698
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,920
Then I got involved in investing in and some startups in early-stage companies and try to help them succeed

699
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Not all of them dead

700
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
But then

701
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,344
Probably evolved to where I really just like helping entrepreneurs start their company in

702
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Try to help them avoid a lot of mistakes

703
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
Do companies make

704
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,352
Compact was such a Powerhouse in the eighties a Fortune 500 company

705
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
Does billion dollars in Revenue with a

706
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
In 5 years

707
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
And then you think about all of the companies that

708
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,568
That it was associated with her that we competed again

709
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Do you know

710
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
Apple IBM

711
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
Dell

712
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,968
Microsoft

713
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Texas instrument

714
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,088
All of those companies still exist

715
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
And compact

716
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Doesn't

717
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Existing Wireless folded into 8

718
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Being a brand is no longer

719
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Here

720
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:05,120
In anyway is that a cautionary tale for some of these powerhouses we see today like

721
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
Snapchat or Uber

722
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
Or Facebook I can't even imagine not exist

723
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:15,616
You know it really is that's certainly something I

724
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,712
Didn't Envision when I left I guess I just wasn't thinking that far down the road

725
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Yeah of course you never know the future

726
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
The decision to merge with HP was a financial decision

727
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,024
But the end result of the way it happened is it compact no longer exists and that is sad because

728
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
It's got such a great

729
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
History and played such a key role in actually forming the way the world works today

730
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
And yet

731
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Most people you run into on the street

732
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
I've never heard of

733
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Compact

734
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Crazy in it

735
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
It is crazy yes it's sad but

736
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
It's also life you know that's that's a

737
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,552
At least we started out to build a company that would last

738
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
And I think that's the case with ain't you don't feel like it

739
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
Dell or Microsoft or Apple

740
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,512
The leaders of those companies maintain enough control

741
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
To make sure that it never

742
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Got into the hands of somebody to look at it

743
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Purely from a financial

744
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Standpoint

745
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
If I had been there

746
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
If I'd been leaving the company

747
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
We would never have sold

748
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
We would have

749
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Figured out a way to

750
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Solve the problem

751
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
How much of your of your success at compact was

752
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Because of

753
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,416
Just your hard work and and and smarts and the hard work of Jim and Bill or

754
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
And how much would a wizard lock

755
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
If you would ask me that in

756
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
The 80s

757
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Play the ladies

758
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
I would probably have said it was

759
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
90%

760
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
Intelligence

761
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,056
And insight and work

762
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
And 10% luck

763
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
But to tell you how

764
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Perspective changes with time I would say today it was

765
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
It's the other way around

766
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,088
We did a lot of good things we came up with a good idea

767
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,672
But if you look back at any of the things that could have gone wrong

768
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
And what if

769
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
Either slows down or stopped us

770
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
I mean there's a

771
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Endless list of those

772
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
So the fact that

773
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,472
Yeah okay we dealt with those issues as they came along but the fact that there was a successful path even available

774
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
Is pretty pretty doggone lucky you found it

775
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
Compaq computers with bill murto and Jim Harris in 1982 Rod still lives in Houston

776
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
Where he mainly invests in other people startups

777
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
Tell me the story of compact David and Goliath struggle against IBM was the subject of a very

778
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Cool documentary

779
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
It's called silicon Cowboys what kind of computer do you use today

780
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Pair an iPad Pro

781
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

795
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,208
Capital share a wall with your neighbor

796
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,768
He'll Melanie colon story

797
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
I just resume

798
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
I was sleeping and all of a sudden I heard this huge pounding on the other

799
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,104
Side of the wall and what was going on is my neighbor was watching some sort of Thriller movie

800
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
The base was literally shaking my bed I have been there Melanie anyway

801
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,088
Imagine Melanie first try to talk directly

802
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
To them one time I went to my neighbor's door I knew they were in there I could hear them talking but they wouldn't answer their door

803
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
Melanie and her husband Louis tried everything

804
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:28,288
Stomping your foot on the ground

805
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,640
Ask her friends in the apartment industry is there anything that we can use to help us with this and

806
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
There is absolutely nothing

807
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,552
And so we thought Abby neighbor to neighbor notification tool where neighbors get notified each other

808
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
Completely anonymously and confidentially about a disturbance from the neighbor into finally about a year-and-a-half ago

809
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,816
Melanie and Lewis hired a team to start developing an app which they named

810
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:56,704
App that as an apartment app and search that works the property management agrees to use the app

811
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Send over the blueprint of the building

812
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,592
And then when neighbors have issues they can log onto their app

813
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
Anonymously contact the actual unit they're having an issue with Joe has a name

814
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:14,112
A bird that is playing their music too loud upstairs he can select that square

815
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,256
Choose a preset notification so this one would be betting for a please turn down your music

816
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
So he can feel like that and then send it to the neighbor upstairs and then that neighbor is able to respond with

817
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:33,056
Resolved or sorry not me property manager can also see if the neighbor has responded or

818
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
If an intervention is required

819
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:40,736
Donnie Lewis beta tested in a big apartment complex in Missoula Montana with a hundred units

820
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,344
It went really well everyone is really excited about all the tools that were available

821
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
And how easy it made communication with staff and residents

822
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
And last November Melanie quit her job as a nurse to work full-time on app that there's definitely been time

823
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
Times where we thought you know what we are literally putting all of our money into this and how easy would it be

824
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
To go back to our day jobs but at the same time it causes so much stewing and us.

825
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,200
That we can't even stand the thought of it and we get right back to work

826
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
That's Melanie Kalonji founded app

827
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
App with her husband Louis

828
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
The partnering with 32 apartment buildings in the Denver area where they live plus buildings in Missoula and Chicago

829
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
I will start using ACT up this summer
