1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Weren't any of the investor saying you don't have a tag team you don't have a chief technology

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
Yeah it makes perfect sense to have how many people do you think you pitched over that

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Yes two months. In San Francisco

4
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,976
Directions

5
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Ramen PR

6
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
How I built this

7
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,704
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists

8
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Stories

9
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm guy Raz and I

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
Iowa college student named Melanie

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,368
Turn her passion for making better yearbooks into the design platform

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Now value

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
At over a billion dollars

14
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
So there's a story that I think a lot of

15
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
People have tails

16
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Make a difference

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
It's basically a version of this

18
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
What time

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
You are a very clever business

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,736
He was an idea for a super useful product or a service that would make your life

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,624
Play Easier mine was actually one cup coffee maker I swear that was my idea but

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Like most people

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
I didn't do it and if you're like me

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,120
You didn't have time to work on it or the money or maybe it just seemed too overwhelming to get started

25
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,752
The way the story always ends is that a couple of months later maybe a couple of years later

26
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
You're shopping in a store or you're surfing the web and there it is I can remember the very day I

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
I saw the one cup coffee maker at Target

28
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Someone took my exact idea and made it happen

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
Because every business starts out as an idea

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Put a turn an idea into a reality you have to get started even if it means starting out small

31
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,448
Plant the seeds for a business to grow before someone else does

32
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Melanie Perkins here she did have a big idea

33
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
She wanted to transform the entire desktop

34
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,480
19 years old but instead of feeling

35
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
Overwhelmed by the scale of Rydia Melody

36
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Focusing first

37
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,512
One little piece of the idea that she thought she could make work

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,096
Which happened to be an online tool to design and publish

39
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,704
I grew up in Perth in Western Australia

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
Her mom was a teacher and her dad was an engineer

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
Mid 2010 graphic design program

42
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Publisher and she was frustrated at the program

43
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
So difficult to learn

44
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Completely silly that you take so many instruction manuals and so many steps through the Myspace

45
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Basic of things

46
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,936
She just wouldn't take a host messages go anywhere the buttons well and how to design

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
It seems very apparent that

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Leasehold

49
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Desktop pricing would be

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
Completely okay cannot dated in the feet

51
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Feature

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
Very oversized Asian fit taking on all of these different Industries

53
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Post office

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Locksmith

55
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Rubber Industries is okay

56
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
I thought Robin people using things like clipart

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
They should be able to have access

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
Beautiful templates like design history

59
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
But at that point in time I've

60
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
Is 19 and I had no business experience

61
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
And so

62
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Robin trying to take honey

63
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
High road is as I know he's really big companies

64
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
Expose take on school yearbooks in Australia you keep saying

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
When you say weekly

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
My boyfriend Tenkai sounded clay

67
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,848
And you're still together later

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
You decided to start

69
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
Like a web-based

70
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
People design

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Upon the idea of

72
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Of your books

73
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Weihai

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
The decision for all

75
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
For taking on the entire world design

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,631
But you will seem to be like a really pressing need because school teachers and get starting today the same that had no design experience

77
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
I might see my mom put together School yearbook for hair school

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
People with no design experience respect

79
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Did you say something

80
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Look professional

81
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
And I realize that it be a really easy thing to do

82
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
Because it's such a strong locket made for these people to Crate

83
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Gearbox

84
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
So how do you go from having that idea

85
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Chili

86
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
Like what was your next step cuz it was you and clever

87
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
He was also 19 live 2020

88
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Fusion Bowl

89
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Fusion books

90
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Right if you guys lie

91
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Coders or software engineers

92
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
Find an interview every software development company info

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
And white people told us

94
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
We're completely mad but how did you even have the money

95
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
To pay them

96
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
I got a 50 Grand line from friends and family

97
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
Which was awesome and then we got 5 grand back

98
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
So that was a mock

99
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
You went around your friends and family

100
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
I have this amazing idea

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
We want to develop

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Of a web-based

103
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Software

104
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Solution for pi

105
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
People designing your book

106
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
That's exactly right

107
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Are Clif have a little bit of cash

108
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Can you go round two

109
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
Software developers in Perth

110
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Could you eventually

111
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
I'm does it's amazing company code in depth

112
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
And

113
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
I I would even if I have 80 page description of exactly what we wanted to do it like I had wireframes bruise off

114
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
Like you sketched out pictures

115
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
To the house what every single button was going to do a how it's going to whack

116
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
Like these projects we ended up being bike

117
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
5 times bigger than I anticipated but they were very kind to just like we've had a fixed-price contract and what was going to make this

118
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Better than anything else

119
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,943
Available at the time I think there's just nothing much available all over these desktop base program

120
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
Sir Robin have everything having to send the e-mails back and forth and collect all those files I wanted is to be collaborative and

121
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Online and really simple

122
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
Cuz at that time if you want to make a yearbook page you would just

123
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,743
Microsoft

124
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,327
Worder door like yeah Mac software to publisher

125
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
And then also it wasn't just that pot you didn't have to go get you your stock photo easel stuck illustrations

126
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Sexy make it look really good

127
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
And sorry to be so many different things you haven't pieced together the Cradle by Mike really really happy

128
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,295
Email that page to somebody and say hey what do you think they say it but you wanted something

129
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Everybody could kind of jump in and make changes

130
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
That's correct

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
So you go to the software company in Perth and how long did it take

132
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
For them to

133
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
To build up the sock

134
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Because about 6 months

135
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
Before we had a fancy duration and then immediately started a second iteration

136
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
And and

137
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
Remember what year this was that with a 2008

138
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
2008 so you

139
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,639
Just put it up there on the one-handed yearbook seem like a really nice Market

140
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Right because it's

141
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Yeah one time of year

142
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,271
On the other hand

143
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Actually

144
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
It's a surprising that there was nothing really

145
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Out there

146
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
To make it easy

147
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
Yeah absolutely and on the plus side as well

148
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,351
Because a yearbook actually has to get printed that was however to monetize

149
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,191
Give the software away for free and then actually sell the physical yearbooks

150
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
So the idea would be that

151
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Somebody would go on their design their yearbook

152
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Hit submit and then you guys would

153
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Take that

154
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
And then print it

155
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
And you would make money off of

156
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
From the actual printing

157
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Yeah

158
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
So what happened

159
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,367
I've got 16 schools knotfest yard which were very excited about

160
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
And then

161
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
We ended up getting printing presses in my mom's living room

162
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
How did you how did you

163
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Put a how did you get printing

164
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
68006 Hadley

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Really cool deal where they said that they give us

166
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,775
The print afraid we paid for the inkan touched it and I kind of believed

167
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
We had like a

168
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
A newspaper article empath and they

169
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
Everything sore that article about you guys yet and they saw it

170
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
Have I felt that that help Adam would become a big Printing Press Company one day

171
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Why so they gave us a printer

172
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
A couple of Xanax

173
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
Actually and say we would have a printing press

174
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Going for 24 hours

175
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
For three months a year

176
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Atrophy printing out AZ

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
Yearbooks and then we drive you to a binding he's not actually do this

178
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
The finishing in The Binding

179
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,751
Did any of the schools know that

180
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
You guys were like 1920

181
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Easel

182
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,687
I don't imagine so

183
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,831
Within your first year do you remember like what kind of Revenue you did

184
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
The first year Revenue would have been very modest but it was enough to be able to afford to do marketing next year so we just ran

185
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
Investor profits every year into the next year

186
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
And very fortunately I guess we had become profitable quick Lakes of us would have no company immediately so the

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,079
First you had 16 School II you had 50 schools next year we had a hundred schools and then it was like

188
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
300

189
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,271
There was growing that quite rapidly did you start to think about building listen to

190
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
Something bigger by 2010

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
I can imagine

192
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
You can start to see this thing has legs Yes actually the original idea of taking on

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,215
How well do design and make it easy for a brown was actually planted right from the start and then we narrowed it down to you

194
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
But we can't look around people be like we used to design a Canteen menu than a newsletters and a school fire

195
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
Tires actually there must be more technology available now that does that

196
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Honestly wasn't

197
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
But then in 2010

198
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
I meant do Thai who is this

199
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Silicon Valley investor

200
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
I'm here and

201
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
He was just talkin about all these companies and startups

202
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Like when I first had him steak

203
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
It sounded like a windows were holding you out

204
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
You met him

205
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
What was he doing there

206
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm who is speaking at a conference

207
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Listen to that

208
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Yeah so

209
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Even though like we should have

210
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
A company with that we've been calling but the only thing that we knew at that point in time is over a small business that really struggled to get away from the

211
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,135
Didn't have a credit history and those whole well to start up so we're taking on big Industries

212
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
Throwing up to him after a station

213
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Someone there

214
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
Kylie shisui and said he's going to cool company

215
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
And

216
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
He said yes if I went

217
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Scrapy happy to me

218
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
And you said oh okay great

219
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Ticket number

220
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Yeah

221
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
That's exactly right

222
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Answer

223
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
As soon as I met him I realized that was the next level

224
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,503
And that if I could do anything we possibly could to get there

225
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Cjis email

226
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Can we talk

227
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Well yeah I kind of was like hey I'm going to be in Silicon Valley just going to be in the area

228
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Did you really have plans that point are you just thoughtful

229
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
If I just say that I'm going to be there and he says the guy who made out with another guy

230
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
And sorry

231
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,359
Could not have been more than I actually even responded to my message

232
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Yeah

233
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
I was just completely dumbfounded

234
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
So you

235
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,599
Ticket to San Francisco and how long was

236
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
Were you planning on going out for coming out for

237
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
I plan on coming out for 2 weeks

238
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
My brother was living here

239
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
And I thought I'd come and visit him about going to this meeting that I was absolutely

240
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
Afraid of his understatement

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,263
Answer in between the time that he said that he would meet with me and coming here

242
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
I put together

243
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
My

244
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Business plan

245
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
The future of publishing with what I tied it and it had a picture of us beating Microsoft Office

246
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
And a whole bunch of other companies

247
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Say we met on University Ave

248
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
And I'm at a cafe

249
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Table card for lunch

250
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Say I brought my

251
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
I physically printed my pitch deck

252
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,191
Which I also didn't realize was put on Coldplay

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
A computer right that

254
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,359
I totally didn't notice the time

255
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,967
Netflix stapled I was sitting there like I had my paper pitch deck hands like Jeff and iPad

256
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,575
No I was like trying to sleep two pages in my deck and

257
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Explain about the

258
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
Future publishing in Harrogate to take a noise

259
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Companies

260
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
And try to eat my lunch and

261
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
And he was there wrapped

262
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
Like engaged know he was on his phone the whole time it was

263
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Sorry okay I felt like the biggest flop

264
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
And

265
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,031
But very forcefully when I went Jaime I had an email from him and he said if I

266
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
If I detect him he'd be happy to invest

267
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
Yes I hate actually they need

268
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
Messaging a lot of dick

269
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
People

270
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
I'm an HTC

271
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Me to them while during the meeting so he was actually the phone messaging

272
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
Yes I

273
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
The next meeting I had was with last recipe

274
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Listen he co-founded Google Maps

275
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
And meeting him

276
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
Completely blew my mind because

277
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
I really didn't know

278
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
It sounds like

279
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
Desire but I had no idea that people that made

280
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Big world changing companies with

281
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Regular niacin

282
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495

00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
I'm and meeting laws

284
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Completely changed by

285
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Deception about was possible

286
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
When he met you he said

287
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Either something here

288
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Yeah we enjoy having an incredible conversation

289
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
4 hours

290
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
We both had a really similar view of what the fit

291
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,159
Feature of communication and Publishing should be like

292
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,767
So does a fee philosophies one of them was that over time

293
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Industries with converge

294
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863

299
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
That all these industries would

Come together and be in one page and then discuss for 12

301
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783

Teaching people how to tame

Are you just naturally kind of

338
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Gregariousness

339
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Outgoing was it easy for you to just show up like

00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Say I'm actually not actually really introverted

342
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
But when I have a go live

Interesting time because we knew that though this big amazing opportunity over here

00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
But it was really hard to make progress with

361
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
Heaven on the other side

362
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631

Batavian

00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Wild-like

366
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
I'd left him with old Hardware

367
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Pretty much summed it up

368
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
So

369
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
3 months

370
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Your cheer for 3 months

371
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Was it exciting or you

372
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Encourage did you feel like

373
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
This is moving forward

374
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
I think every day I felt like I'd make a little progress

375
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
By the end of the three months I didn't have a tag team and I left feeling like

376
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Biggest failure

377
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Because

378
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
I had not lie detector

379
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
Which meant that I had landed investors which meant that alright done

380
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
In my view at that point in time was like

381
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Nothing

382
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
I left a lot but I hadn't actually

383
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,223
When I was going back to pass I'm on the Fly I write a list of the things that I did

384
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
2 Chainz and one of them is like

385
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271

386
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
Which of the little group body with but then

387
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Then move the company from Perth to Sydney

388
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047

Welcome back to how I built this from NPR

440
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,383
Something you should know before we get back in the Melanie story is that deal time

441
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,967
The VC investor Melanie met with at the Palo Alto coffee shop

442
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Kitesurfing

443
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:39,391
Bills taken these two things better capitalism

444
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
And kind of combined them into a conference

445
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
Capitan called Mai Tai

446
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Is that one building that was Melanie

447
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
Basically told her hey Tiff

448
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,911
If you like I can invite you to this event

449
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Is there about your idea

450
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
Cuz I made it seem like I was really interested in kitesurfing and sorry he said that if I

451
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Kaiser

452
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,759
Please conference where a lot of a Saison I'm invested with a

453
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Say I went to Kaiser and felt like I was going to be

454
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
My life is really frightening and what does he do

455
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,839
Talks like during the morning and then everyone kites Us in the afternoon people there

456
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
A hundred and

00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959

459
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
And kitesurfing by day

460
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
And then

461
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Mingling at night

462
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
You went to both you and Chloe we both win

463
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199

464
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Sza weight

465
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,879
Thunders yester's that's exactly right so what did you do

466
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,743
Were you say we went schedule to talk or anything but one and one of the events

467
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
We just said I can we talk tomorrow can we do a pitch

468
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
I'm at this is like it

469
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
10:00 at night

470
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
And eventually he said yes

471
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
Say we end up like to stay up until 6 a.m.

472
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Prokaryote picture

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
The picture of life

474
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
And eventually got off in The Wiz

475
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
Sorry incredibly nervous in front of everyone but

476
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Apparently didn't do so bad

477
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,063
AXA of Shutterfly came up and said he would be

478
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Peking twin bed

479
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,184
And a number of other people said that they think about the injuries or

480
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
It would be came to invest as well

481
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,352
What does that mean does that mean like I winch I'm ready to write you a check now or does that mean

482
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
I'm interested in further tok

483
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
In talking more about

484
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
Feather talking more about this

485
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
You say who else is going to reinvest before we invest is Buzz the general feeling

486
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
If you had to get enough people who are interested to invest

487
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
You did not leave now

488
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Stack of checks

489
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Snotty nose

490
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Is there a

491
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
Okay so the next

492
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,488
Super Mario you went back to San Francisco

493
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
And what did you do over the next

494
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
Six or eight weeks like that you was at

495
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
Did you start a pitch potential investors out

496
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Is that what you're doing

497
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
Yeah pitching everyone includes

498
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
It worse to pitching out of fur

499
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
Other engineers at this stage we student have an engineer

500
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Repitching

501
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Any venture capital

502
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,272
List or angel investor that would take a meeting

503
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Weren't any of the investor say

504
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Hey this is a really cool idea

505
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
You know Fusion seems cool but

506
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
You don't have a

507
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Chief technology officer

508
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,032
Yeah it makes perfect sense to have how many people do

509
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
I guess 2 months.

510
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
I don't know you.

511
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
Between this like the first year

512
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
And

513
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
That year. It would

514
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
A400

515
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
People more

516
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,256
I didn't count the time I was going through my rejections the other day I was looking at some of the emails and

517
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
What was it

518
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,472
They catch you going when you were just getting rejection after rejection

519
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
I think he does know the game you're playing

520
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
And

521
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
You know we wanted to build the future publishing and

522
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,504
We knew that this would like in my head this is just absolutely the feature there's no way that things

523
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,832
Baby desktop-based anymore everything was very evidently movie online

524
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
Is no way that things are going to be fragments Jack Russell eating

525
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
It was going to be easier for people

526
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
I'm sorry

527
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,024
I really wanted to create that even though it was frustrating

528
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
It was a say I knew it was a pretty important thing today to get people to see the same

529
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Featured ideas

530
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,728
Yeah but I think it was really beneficial because we got so many different

531
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Questions

532
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Now I'm coming soon

533
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
People not liking what we're doing at all

534
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,200
M&W really had to know what we're doing and really her final strategy say every single day would go back and revise up

535
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Pitch deck

536
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
Every time we got a really high Quest

537
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
That was very right in front of

538
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
To the hardest question to answer

539
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
At the front

540
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
Robbing people sitting

541
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,512
I'm going through the entire pitch and then like all but you're the same as some ran

542
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Got nothing to do with us

543
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Waiting for the side not Pitch that quick

544
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Should the Gap in the market

545
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
And all the other companies

546
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Beyblade

547
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Peach cobbler

548
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
I'm a lot of people would say that he knew nothing about design

549
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
They don't know anything about industry in

550
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
That was a reason to not invest

551
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
So we made it

552
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,992
One of the first pages I pitch that keeps paying the industry and where we believe this huge gap

553
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
This was in 2000

554
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Okay so what say I'm one of these investors

555
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
The berry I would say

556
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,976
This looks cool but has a lot of questions for you

557
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
First of all

558
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Tech team we're detecting

559
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
He would say what

560
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
So we've already due to company with Fusion books you demonstrated that we can make a profitable company that's made out of gravelord

561
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Internationally and

562
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
We're just going to take it onto the beach

563
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,128
I can totally understand why nobody wanted to invest

564
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
And then I would say and I was like why

565
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Microsoft

566
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
Google can they see what you guys do with

567
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
The crush you because LG

568
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Just put something else out

569
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Way bigger and and

570
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
I mean you just kidding

571
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Right away

572
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,536
You sound totally like one of those invest and what would you say

573
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Wade say

574
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
There is a

575
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Is Hugh Jackman

576
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Because it's

577
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
It's kind of up to actually create the

578
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
Music industry the future publishing

579
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
You would have to completely cannibalize horrendous

580
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,360
And if you look at the years of publishing over the years

581
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:24,736
Beside roof with metal plates that we moved into the tot setting and paste up his ex became the second sliding up his check

582
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,040
We then moved into the desktop

583
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Ciara and then we are now moving into the

584
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
Near which people is going to be online

585
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
And what you see

586
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Darren vest

587
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
Is it noisy industry fire has actually ever been able to go from one industry to the next and actually still maintain being the market leader

588
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,704
And say we every single time there was a new era I need my cat later a mess

589
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
And so we believe that muckalady can be up

590
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,104
And then I would say okay but I Know It looks interesting but you guys are

591
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,920
Play Australia like why would you guys consider

592
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Replicating here making it

593
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
Moving your team here

594
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Say it depends weight when you lost his quest

595
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,904
At a certain point in time we end up fighting an amazing co-founder Cameron.

596
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
3 headband I'm at Google

597
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
And so he was going to basic

598
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Australia

599
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,072
And we will submit another amazing guy from Google

600
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Eli said

601
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
Best whoever whacked with side 800

602
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
I'm so sexy

603
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
Cheap stuff to buy

604
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,568
And Dave Dave had white in the US that he was

605
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
Australian he's going to be in Australia

606
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
And sorry

607
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
It's sort of status

608
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,808
Swing the pendulum towards Australia and the government in Australia had these matching funding thing where they would match it

609
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,648
Every dollar that we got from investor

610
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
To stay to stay in Australia

611
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,048
To Dave Haunted Mansion he what he ends up becoming your

612
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Your Chief technology officer right

613
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
He was really talented engineer working Google

614
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
I'm sure he's very well paid at the time

615
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,128
Instead

616
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,224
Well he sucks the time on Google

617
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Design pitch deck

618
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,832
I can probably claim the number 1

619
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,952
I went on to Dave and Dave

620
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
When Psych

621
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Interested in what we're doing here

622
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,120
So he was a little bit concerned about joining say what I did

623
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Was I went to his Facebook page and I took

624
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
2 page and I put together a

625
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Pitch deck

626
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
And said Riordan

627
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Amazing adventure to come and join in 3 trailer

628
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
Peachtree publishing and taste the face of the internet

629
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
Using storylines from this Friday so I take it from him

630
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Indication

631
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
I think that definitely moved it in the right direction I think they realize we have a lot of passion and we're going to do whatever it took to

632
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,816
Okay so now you've convinced a few

633
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
High-profile

634
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Join you

635
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Only play together

636
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Build the

637
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
You're still

638
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Pitching investors getting

639
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Projections right

640
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
When did that change

641
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,664
We had enough people that was somewhat interested it hadn't reject

642
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Strategy

643
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
We're rather than asking if he wanted to invest

644
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
We ask people

645
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Advice

646
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
And you can go back and you can

647
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,976
Say hey he's going to give me some advice I'd love to show you my penis back and then I'd give us some advice

648
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
That means I didn't Thanos cost at this point in time due to give you feedback

649
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
I like how you going to meet us another month

650
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
And look who's on the things that we said we're going to die

651
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
And once he had done that enough time

652
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
I realize that you actually do the thing

653
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
You say you going to do

654
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Kind of had enough people at that point

655
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,320
The kind of interested we kind of in demonstrating that we could do what we said we were going today

656
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
And then

657
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,648
At the tight end because we had

658
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
We are all the sudden

659
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
How much did you

660
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Percy Brown

661
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
So we

662
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Winterize 1.5 I think we left

663
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Saint Francis

664
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
This game we're a 750

665
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,032
But then over the coming months and not feeling at that roundabout

666
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
One point

667
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
6 I think it got to

668
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
First time you ever subscribed

669
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
And then the Australian government gave us

670
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
She got three million bucks

671
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
This is what

672
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Early 2003

673
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Yeah 2012

674
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Tofu year of development

675
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Between lending investing

676
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
Actually launching the product

677
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Peanut Thai recipe

678
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
Like what the hell is she

679
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
I like it a long time so I like

680
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,984
The Lean Startup with a big deal back then

681
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
Amend

682
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,360
Launch and eat right and you do something to the weekend and see if people like it

683
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah but the whole point

684
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
Was it really called

685
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,992
Things to make simple MN great Fairground accessible

686
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
I mean say that took a lot more

687
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
What times in a week

688
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
And so you spend that you're developing this thing and then spend a lot of time like

689
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,072
User-testing making sure that people actually understood that people are scared of Designing cuz

690
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,680
People condition for their whole life thinking that I'm not creative account design things

691
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
Millions of these things. Challenges that I'd come in there

692
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
Change the color of a circle and put a hat in the monkey know these little silly challenges that built up people's confidence with a design abilities

693
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,736
So that we took a while

694
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
And and

695
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
Why you were

696
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Building building out this

697
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Technology

698
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
To write how many people did you have to iron that first year

699
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Before you launched

700
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
I think we had about

701
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,888
15 days so you had

702
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
Sounds exciting

703
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
I just the flip side of this all of a sudden you got

704
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
$3000000

705
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Other people

706
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
You've

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,272
You've convinced he's really talented Engineers to join you

708
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
You got

709
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,856
Other people who've like giving up their jobs to

710
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Come and work for you

711
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
That's scary

712
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
That's a lot of

713
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Responsibility

714
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Yeah Def

715
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
I actually went up at laws and

716
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Started to think about his whole world bench

717
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Capital and taking people's money

718
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
I realize that I had to make

719
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Decision at that point

720
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
Time to defrost going to Petit Spa

721
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
I would have to be

722
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
At least

723
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
Partially okay with the idea of it no backing out

724
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
And why that

725
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
It was something that was important enzyme

726
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Really know someone that

727
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Likes to give up ever on it

728
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
Thank you but yeah it's only with water pressure

729
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Bereghost

730
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,232
So incredibly happy for it to have gone from something

731
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Make where everything was external so trying to convince

732
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
People to join my team

733
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
It was entitled like a cocoon

734
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,192
Work really hard to make sure that this is an amazing product

735
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
And I like

736
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Microphone

737
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
So you guys launched

738
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
I guess in August

739
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
13 in

740
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
And you're ready with us online graphic design and

741
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Publishing tools

742
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
Single out

743
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Website goes live

744
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
What happened

745
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Do people come to it right away

746
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Fortunate that be

747
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Because we had

748
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
So high Free Falling

749
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Vested in that first round

750
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
When we

751
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
Land that says running backs

752
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
We might we announced it

753
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Pick up some TechCrunch coverage we're pretty certain about that and we end up with

754
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Fifty thousand

755
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
People before we launched

756
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Lisa Boucher was like Viagra

757
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
Occasionally initially

758
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Stokes. Out that wasn't saying what we're doing

759
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,064
Then yeah we we launching August 2013

760
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
We spent a lot of time prior to that engineering its

761
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
If he would have an amazing

762
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
Is there an end to share it with others

763
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
And that certainly happened inside

764
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
Within the first

765
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Every month

766
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
The biggest and best ever

767
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And what

768
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,544
Explain what the business model was it is like you it's free to use right like you can just go and design anything

769
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
Description

770
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:52,736
Play one of those philosophies right from the start with what we wanted designed to be accessible to everyone we want to be free

771
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,832
Completely Freddy's and then you can purchase images $4

772
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:02,464
And so it would mean like if you're in a putting together your school assignment are you or you just a really small business

773
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,024
Crate get your social media off the ground you can afford to pay some

774
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Mindful Gray

775
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,120
And then we also you have

776
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
I paid off

777
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Springfield

778
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,264
If you would like to save your brand colors and fonts and logos

779
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Amenakin

780
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
I'm going to

781
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Penny offering

782
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
Subscription

783
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,200
Design like

784
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
A yearbook page right

785
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
I can go and design it

786
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
I want to actually download

787
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Do I have to pay

788
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Nights at Freddy's

789
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
That's free

790
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,536
We wanted we wanted to ensure of a free product with a complete value late like you can go and get your thing completely free

791
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,424
Do you guys have ads at all

792
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
So how

793
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
You need it

794
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
Pretty significant percentage of your

795
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Users

796
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
To buy images

797
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Because

798
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Building this technology is expensive

799
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,272
Yes if the concept was that we'd give away the sofa for free

800
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,088
But then you could purchase images you could touch response

801
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
Ticket purchase

802
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Potentially layouts

803
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
But we're currently giving them away for free

804
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
But the idea is that you would always be able to have that bass product

805
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Free for everyone

806
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Amend

807
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
We're actually profitable

808
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,288
Designs in 40 countries I can have it delivered to your door

809
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
How many people do you have working

810
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,200
314 Alaska, but we're growing really rapidly.

811
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
I'm sorry 300

812
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
50 year in Sydney

813
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
I'm in the we have a team in the Philippines as well I mean I'm really surprised about and I'm LOL

814
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
Actually is that it sounds like you just

815
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,608
Didn't make any mistakes after you washed it it just sounds like you

816
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
You put this

817
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Great product out there and there were no bugs

818
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
And everybody's happy with it is that

819
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Is it true I mean

820
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
I am I'm like waiting for the disaster story where are you know you launched it and then like

821
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
Crash for 4 days or something

822
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
All right I'll give you I'll give you a tidbit

823
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,880
I'd certainly hasn't been smooth sailing but I guess I'm always is focused on the neck

824
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Mountain to climb

825
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Safe example

826
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Play we had

827
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
I just told you the entire back

828
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
Story of only of the effort that has gone into getting it

829
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Launch

830
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Sorry I was back in San Francisco are you sleeping

831
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
Probably the apartment he was actually away

832
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
I'm sorry to say about myself

833
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,568
Before I told my dad to go to sleep and someone breaks and bodyguard

834
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Breaking bargo's at your best

835
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
About to

836
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
An article came out

837
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,480
And they that they are out of

838
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
We had a

839
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
Not very good products

840
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
And that

841
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,184
We had cheesy photography and said it wasn't very easy to use

842
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
And

843
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
I filled you that point in time like

844
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
The last

845
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
6 years of my life was Crush

846
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Very

847
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Fortunately that

848
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
It was a bit of a

849
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Everyone else

850
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Vicodin

851
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
And get what we're doing

852
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
So

853
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,896
As you scale and grow and hire more people

854
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
300 +

855
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
People

856
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
You are the CEO you're the boss

857
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
The company

858
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
I'm your self-described

859
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Introvert

860
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
You're sitting here you

861
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Seem like

862
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Just ate

863
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Kind

864
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Andrea Lee

865
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
Delightful person

866
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
And

867
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
Sometimes you have to

868
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Beetalk

869
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
The clu

870
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Decision

871
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
The fire people you have to

872
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Review

873
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
People you have to have difficult conversations with people

874
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
Have you

875
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
How to learn how

876
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Do that or

877
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
Does that come naturally to you or do you

878
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Avoid doing that

879
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Think everything every single day

880
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Bright from the start is Dana Landing Cove

881
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,880
Has been people that haven't worked out over the years

882
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,464
We try to just have the nicest conversation try to actually

883
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,792
Listen to understand that why it wasn't working out try to

884
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Curse them to actually make them better

885
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,680
Is every dead every single stage the same things to learn

886
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
And I don't think that

887
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Yeah some things never get easier

888
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
But you just have to figure out

889
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,872
What is the best thing that you possibly can do and when is he died

890
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
I think that's one thing that I'm pretty good at he's just in time letting

891
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
End of the Earth

892
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
It's only been a lot of things to learn

893
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
You you guys

894
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,112
Get a valuation of a billion dollars

895
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Sunrise at Australian R Us.

896
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Us

897
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Fitness test this year

898
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,048
Yeah given that you are like one of the

899
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
First Australian uniqlo

900
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Does that

901
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Increase the pressure on yuan

902
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,496
Super proud of it and you know

903
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Carry on

904
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
I mean do you feel

905
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Any of that weight

906
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
I think the ironic thing is like

907
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
Since I was doing my Simonton you to avoid water pressure on myself and for that same price. Testifies today

908
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
Like if courses different at different magnitude

909
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,952
But I think I've just always feel a lot of pressure on myself have always wanted to do

910
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
The best I possibly can

911
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:57,120
I'm and now yes I feel I would responsibility for the livelihoods of a lot of Asti members

912
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
But I think

913
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
That

914
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
Yeah that same pressure of just like trying to do my absolute best every single day it's his that's kind of been continuous

915
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm just curious like hundreds of thousands of designs that then created

916
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,088
Tatted up until this point with his tool that you brought into the world like

917
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Jimmy favor

918
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
To me the stories that really touch

919
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
Watch me are like 20000 nonprofits

920
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
And this is everything from

921
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,632
People trying to end poverty to cure cancer

922
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
I seen the stories

923
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
They're pretty damn cool like

924
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
We had a lady found her best mother who she created appraiser uncover

925
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm posted on Facebook

926
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
Found a best mother

927
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Who sings so many people post their resume that landed them a job

928
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
Or are they just like

929
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,368
So many stories every single day I like

930
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
Look for Twitter and I say so many tattoos

931
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Stories of

932
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,072
That one philosophy of design should be accessible to everyone is actually being put into practice

933
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,608
Cuz I'm having real welding

934
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
How much of

935
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Of all of this

936
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
This amazing story.

937
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
B2

938
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
Your skill your intelligence your hard work and how much

939
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
I think it's a really interesting

940
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
Question because I think that

941
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
If you zoom out of lock

942
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
He say where were you born

943
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
Paleo parents

944
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Hey what was the education

945
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
You're heading good health

946
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
It is so many lies of Locke

947
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
So if you look at all the voice thing

948
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Be luckier

949
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
On the other side of it

950
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
I feel like we planted enough say instead of eventually one of those

951
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Grace

952
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
And so that's kind of another version of like he's like

953
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,080
Maybe a thousand Saints and what are they saying screw

954
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,176
And so you could come back to me that day the local hardware for planning a thousand Sage

955
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
I'd say a little column a little column B

956
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
How how old are you

957
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
31

958
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
231

959
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Amazing Amy you're so young but

960
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
You're a veteran I mean you've been

961
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
In the startup world

962
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
You are 19

963
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Like you started your first

964
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
Real company

965
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,376
So you you a lot of experience mean you got

966
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
12 years of

967
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Experience

968
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Doing this

969
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Raising money

970
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Starting a business

971
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Creating a brand

972
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Marketing

973
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
What do you

974
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
No now.

975
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
You wish you knew when you were

976
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
2324

977
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
I think one of the wonderful things

978
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
About these hoes

979
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
Experiences that I didn't know a lot going

980
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Intuit

981
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
I think that learning

982
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Every single day as Hikari

983
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Has actually been one of them

984
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Is critical pods

985
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,328
Because I think if I need all the lessons that I had to learn over the last 12 years

986
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:39,168
I would have been incredibly intimidated

987
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
How do I listen to

988
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Statistics

989
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,032
Example and thought that that was something that I should

990
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Be afraid

991
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
That probably would have dissuaded me

992
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,688
Every single day getting spending the day Fenton

993
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
But at the same time I love

994
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,344
Taking on the theme to The Impossible from the outside

995
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
I don't know

996
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
When you don't know

997
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
What you doing tonight

998
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Then you can't really be afraid of it

999
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,632
Is Melanie Perkins co-founder of Canada

1000
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
According to company statistics from mid 2018

1001
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,104
Online designer polishing tool is now used by over 10 million people across the world

1002
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
The new designs are created on the site

1003
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Iterative

1004
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
20 per second

1005
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
And by the way

1006
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
Kelly says she does not kitesurf

1007
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Anymore

1008
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,440
But I did it for five years and I can now officially hot tub spray

1009
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:38,048
But I felt for 5 years like I was kind of repeat my last I'm retired

1010
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Take risk

1011
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,472
Seeing things that are kind of calculated inside my risk loss ratio

1012
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407

Tristan corriveau

1031
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
Portland Maine

1032
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
2 years ago

1033
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,503
Tristan was staying at a hotel in Boston

1034
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
When he did what

1035
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Many of the Stewart Hotel

1036
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
He went to the bathroom

1037
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Open up the box of soap

1038
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,927
I'm washing my hands

1039
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
Bar of soap that he's about to toss aside and

1040
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,095
To think this must happen a lot everyday in hotels

1041
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:49,727
I was really curious about it I decided to just look it up and he discovered that most hotels

1042
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,031
Throw away their used soap

1043
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
More research

1044
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Found a nonprofit that

1045
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
Does take old bars of soap

1046
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
And recycled

1047
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Tristan.

1048
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
Great butt

1049
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
What if we could turn that soap

1050
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Into liquid soap

1051
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Make it available in bulk

1052
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Cut down on plastic waste

1053
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
You buy soap dispenser plastic

1054
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,607
You put an extra saying you had it for a few weeks maybe months and then you go get another one

1055
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
And you multiply that by

1056
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
300

1057
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
Million people

1058
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,079
Washing the hands everyday and all the sudden there's a lot of plastic bottles out in the world

1059
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
Calling hotels

1060
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
In Portland Maine

1061
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
And a lot of them

1062
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
I'm were sending their soap to the nonprofit

1063
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
But

1064
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
They had to pay a membership fee

1065
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
And the cost of shipping

1066
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
And some of the smaller hotels couldn't afford that so

1067
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
There soap just

1068
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
Went into the trash

1069
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
And one of those places

1070
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
The Press Hotel

1071
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
Really hated doing this

1072
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,351
So Tristan got in touch with manager

1073
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
And he said hey

1074
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
I can help recycle your soap

1075
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
For free

1076
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
She was just like this is amazing like

1077
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,823
We've been trying to figure out something to do with our soap for so long

1078
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
We would love to work with you we'd love to give it to you like

1079
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
Let's do this let's go

1080
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,735
Yes yes let's go

1081
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
Sex

1082
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
What do I do now

1083
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
Tristan has found his idea all the way through

1084
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,463
A week later the Press Hotel happily gave him nearly

1085
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
50 pounds of old soap

1086
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
And

1087
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Kind of gross

1088
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
There's dirt on it

1089
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
You can end up on the floor

1090
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
It picks up little

1091
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,519
Pieces of like paper and dirt and show step one

1092
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Clean it up

1093
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
That's just a really tedious job

1094
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
Set over

1095
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:37,503
Venom soap and scrape everything off of it into another bin in 5 hours

1096
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
Scraping later

1097
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
He was on to step two

1098
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Which was

1099
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
To liquefy

1100
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,439
Cyst inside a DIY Community online

1101
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,535
Really into making their own liquid soap from new bars of soap

1102
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
Dave grind it up and

1103
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
Boil it down and turn it into liquid hand soap for their

1104
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
Are you sat home

1105
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
So I thought this is really easy

1106
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
But

1107
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
Old recycle tow

1108
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
That was hard

1109
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
Tristan knew that

1110
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
Some people would worry about

1111
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Soap

1112
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
Return to step 3

1113
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
The experts

1114
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
He consulted with the biology Department

1115
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,647
The University of Southern Maine and they suggested using

1116
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Autoclave

1117
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
It's like a steam sterilization

1118
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,559
Process and it's very common in dentist office

1119
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Sin tattoo studios

1120
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
Is a way for them to

1121
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Sterilize their tools

1122
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
Put in autoclave cost

1123
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
$4,000

1124
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
Money Tristan did not have

1125
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
What he did have was

1126
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Used soap supplier

1127
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Press Hotel

1128
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,455
And proof that the autoclave process

1129
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
And that was enough

1130
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Secure a local business

1131
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,831
To buy an autoclave

1132
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
And so armed with a new autoclave

1133
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
Tristan move to step 4

1134
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Actual product

1135
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
I put the guy that first batch and

1136
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Great

1137
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
Perfect self I'll go sell it

1138
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,375
Until we started by contacting

1139
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,679
A friend who owns several Portland restaurant

1140
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,007
In a friend electrician hang a few wall display

1141
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
In the bathroom

1142
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
Everything was looking

1143
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Wait

1144
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Then

1145
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,407
3 or 4 Weeks Later

1146
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,991
I get an email that's like hey that's the soap is separating

1147
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
Pretty much all that's coming out as water

1148
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
This

1149
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
To put it mildly

1150
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
What's a minor disaster

1151
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,719
240 year Tristan searched for an ingredient that would

1152
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Stabilized

1153
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
But one that was also a

1154
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Eco-friendly

1155
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Cornstarch

1156
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
Flower

1157
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Even recycled wood

1158
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
Key ingredient

1159
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Turned out to be

1160
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,335
Baking soda how did I miss that

1161
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Finally by the

1162
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
Fall of 2018

1163
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
After two years of troubleshooting

1164
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,783
Tristan had a marketable recycle liquid soap

1165
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
He sells it by the gallon

1166
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
An enlarged

1167
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Refillable glass bottles

1168
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Speaking to his mission

1169
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Cutting back on single-use Plastics

1170
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
The Press Hotel

1171
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
They're using his soap in their Lobby bathroom

1172
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
And they're also

1173
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Still supplying him with

1174
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
Pounds and pounds of used bar soap

1175
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Deven

1176
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,031
Times when I felt really overwhelmed by the amount of soap that I'm getting

1177
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,383
And I've asked them hey can we put collection on pause and

1178
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
They always refuse

1179
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,991
Now if you got to keep Collective

1180
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
