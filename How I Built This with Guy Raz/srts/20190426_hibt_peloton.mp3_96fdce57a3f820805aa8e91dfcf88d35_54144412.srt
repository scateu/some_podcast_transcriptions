Fitness Media or technology

Billion dollars

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Account for all the money generated by the Fitness in

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
History in the US but

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
If you factor in gym memberships alone

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
It's around 30 billion dollars a year

47
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
And that number is

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Is growing

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Because

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
People are becoming more

51
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Health-conscious

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
A lot of that growth is

53
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Being driven by what

54
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Call the

55
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Fitness category

56

Things like bar yoga

57
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Spin Studios

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,656
A smaller gyms that do one thing

59
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Really well

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
All of these options is that

61
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Post Park

62
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
You need to book a slot

63
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
Which is fine if you're super organized

64
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Not so great

65
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
You forget

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Which is where John Foley was

67
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
Back in 2011

68
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
You realize

69
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
A spinning class

70
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Can only accommodate the

71
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
20 years

72
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
30 people in the room

73
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
Basically the class couldn't be scaled beyond the number of spin bikes available

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
But what if you could scale

75
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
What if that very same class

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
Reach a thousand people or

77
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
5000

78
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
People or an unlimited number

79
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
You didn't even need to make reservation

80
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Heidi has started this

81
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Swirl around

82
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
John Foley

83
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Shake it

84
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
There were a few problems for starters

85
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
John knew nothing about the fitness industry second he didn't know much about technology least things like

86
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
How to make software

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Was in his forties with kids

88
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,192
The mortgage and they're pretty safe job

89
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
And finally this is a common situation

90
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
Didn't have any money to launch it

91
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
And yet just years later

92
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
John Foley isbill Peloton

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
I'm into a business that's been valued at more than

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
4 billion dollars

95
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
How did he get there

96
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Well we invited John to tell a story

97
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
In front of a live audience

98
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
In New York City

99
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
John actually grew up

100
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
A small town in the Florida Keys

101
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
His dad was an airline pilot and his mom stayed at home to help run the household

102
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,728
John's first shots order in fast food impact in the 1980s

103
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
He would work at McDonald's Wendy's

104
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
And Domino's Pizza

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
But by the time you got to college

106
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
John moved on

107
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Candy

108
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
When I was 19 years old I got a co-op job in Waco Texas at a manufacturing plant making Skittles

109
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Starburst Snickers and Twix

110
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
It was modern-day Willy Wonka we meet 6 million snicker bars a day

111
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
Wow just for North America

112
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Wild stuff

113
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
I wore a hairnet

114
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Hard hat steel toe shoes in a uniform

115
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Working midnight shift

116
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
For five years to pay my way through college

117
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
Idaho

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
I don't recommend it

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Don't have your kids do it

120
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
Cuz you you studied industrial engineering

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
And so

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
The Mars job was really kind of the

123
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Through school or was that

124
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Potentially going to be a career

125
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,815
Yeah it was good was both it was going to get my foot in the door so you can get a job when you grabbed

126
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
And so when you were at at Mars

127
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
You are mainly doing like

128
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
You are on the production line for all those six years

129
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Exactly yes

130
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Candy

131
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,639
Chocolate M&M Skittles

132
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
Skittles and Starburst manufacturer North America

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Managing 200 people

134
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
While I was 20 years

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
2 years old

136
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
Had a great experience in and it felt like

137
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
A good job that pays well and they treated me well and I

138
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
I saw myself spending the rest of my life in Waco

139
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Yeah

140
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Can you eat Skittles today

141
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
I don't

142
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
No

143
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
They're great

144
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
There they are good

145
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
She get your

00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Feel of Starburst

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Skittles

148
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
And then you

149
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
I guess you're the first, maybe grown-up job was

150
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
With a tech company

151
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
In your early 20s yeah there was a little Bridge there where

152
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
I went out to LA for kalkan

153
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Pedigree Whiskas Sheba pet food

154
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Which is a division of Mars

155
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
So 25 years old I said hey

156
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
I realized I didn't want to spend the rest of my life

157
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,863
And I requested a transfer within Mars to La where I start making pet food and Vernon which is

158
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Is the Meatpacking

159
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Talk about lights pretty

160
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
Pretty Grim scene on itself

161
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
But that was that what's got me to La and then I made the jump over to

162
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
And what was that company

163
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
So it was it was a 1996

164
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
And you guys all followed it like I do or know that in 96

165
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,599
The.com was exploding the internet was a thing

166
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,951
And there's come pick out citysearch.com a lot of you might remember

167
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
I went over and you guys appreciate this now it's

168
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
You guys know this

169
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Dot-com startups

170
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
What are super fun super dynamic

171
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
There's interesting people it was

172
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,287
Quite a contrast to the manufacturing World in Waco Texas where it's people who are going to

173
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
How to punch in the clock literally literally punch the clock

174
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
And so was a totally different person and I just fell in love

175
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:48,319
With the idea that you can work with great people the challenge you to motivate you that they're your age and they're

176
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
Also ready to take over the world it was it was I found my people over

177
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
But you decide after

178
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
What are your two in La at citysearch to go to Business School

179
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Let's go to the Harvard Business School

180
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
That's right and coming from you

181
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
The Florida Keys and going to Georgia Tech resin engineer and then beating Waco I just didn't know the world and I wasn't very exposed I wasn't very sad

182
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Fabian wasn't very confident

183
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
And all these hot shot people at citysearch bro

184
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,319
Way over educated and they all wanted these fancy schools and I was very intimidated by him they work

185
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,903
Internships at Goldman and Mackenzie and there were this and that

186
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,231
And so I just didn't know that whether I can hang with them

187
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
And my brother-in-law encouraged me to apply to Harvard

188
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
Stanford in Columbia I said you're going to go to physical try to go to the one of the best

189
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
I got the rejection from Sanford

190
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
But luckily I got it I got an HPS

191
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Sand

192
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
And I was very excited it did

193
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Many ways changed my trajectory

194
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,503
Because it gave me the confidence to know that no one is that much smarter than the next person and

195
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Everyone's trying to figure it out and

196
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
And so it was it was a transformative

197
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Opportunity. There you didn't feel like

198
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
You got there and thought you know what actually

199
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
That they're not that him

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Any more impressive than anyone else

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
For sure

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
After 2 years I got there and was incredibly intimidated

203
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,543
The Vinewood you talk when you know when you're when you grow up in New York City and your parents work at Goldman Sachs

204
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Your talk I don't know what investment banker

205
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Dove TI be the bank of the keys

206
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
And I was

207
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,527
That's where you got your check cashed at the bank to me

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
So I didn't know anything about much

209
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Xiamen

210
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
And so it was it was

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
Alright so you get out of HBS

212
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
And

213
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
You got all these options what do you where to go

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,607
Itsfunneh I got a job at BMG music which was the

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Being always be with my dream to work in the music and

216
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
And it was in 2001 it was a recession and so I accepted the job and six months later when I was set to start

217
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
I was going to go away to Italy for

218
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Are weak

219
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,015
And I called the HR Director and I said hey I'm going to be out of the country for the next week if you need to reach me who's there

220
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And she's like oh my gosh

221
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
No one's called you

222
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,695
And I said why you need to talk to someone so

223
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
Turns out because of the Napster

224
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
Disruption was right around that time where music industry is being decimated

225
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
My job is going away my old apartment at going away

226
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
Wow and so I was sitting there

227
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,359
Coming out of HBS in this recession with no job and I had to sign a lease in New York City in

228
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,735
I spent four months trying to get a job calling back people there like of you trying to sound screw you

229
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
So what we're doing.

230
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
So I went back to to what was then IAC Ticketmaster City search the people that I work with prior

231
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Truth be told my brother-in-law who is this

232
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
The CEO of Ticketmaster

233
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Pick me up

234
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Up and dusted me off

235
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
And giving up

236
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Opportunity

237
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
A kind of force

238
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
A roll because he

239
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Cared about me and him and it was

240
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
It was a moment that

241
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
But I need it

242
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
So take it to your Ticketmaster Ticketmaster owned by IAC which is a

243
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
Bigger so it was still the same people that I had left they just bought this tiny

244
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Company called evite.com

245
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
The interesting that you appreciate this a lot of

246
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
Budding entrepreneur is listening this

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
David Ford I believe 45 million dollars into building Evite

248
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
And I think we bought it for $3000000

249
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Because it was

250
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
2001 and everything in Crash

251
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
And so it had one point 120 people

252
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
I got it down to six

253
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Sour like running a startup within a bigger

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Organization

255
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
That's right

256
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
And this is a tiny tiny business

257
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Effectively meant nothing and so

258
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,343
There was a lot of pressure but we were The Little Engine That Could we saw it becoming something massive and so

259
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
We put pressure on ourselves that a lot of fun trying to

260
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Pull a rabbit out of the Hat

261
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
We grew it in a substantially from

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,119
Call the million dollars top-line 225 million top-line and profitable so

263
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,983
You know in in relative terms successful but still meant nothing to anyone that I say

264
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
So you are

265
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
I guess still in your maybe late twenties or early thirties by that point

266
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
La that's right

267
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
And were you married

268
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
I was not right around that time I think it's 32 I was meeting my wife Jill who was living in

269
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Who's who's right around

270
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Take me back to

271
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Is it to your mindset at that time were you

272
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,375
Were you entrepreneurial and the way you thought about the world did you think you know

273
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
I think I want to run a business or will you really focused on the kind of

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Security in the stability of working in a big organization

275
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Right around that time I was

276
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,735
Starting to become off parole in mine cuz I was surrounded by these type of people in your seeing people take risks and get the reward and I

277
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
I'm starting to become I have more belief in myself

278
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,647
There was enough of that conversation on the water cooler that was starting to get that bug

279
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
To go to

280
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
And I guess

281
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,047
Assertive towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s you jump

282
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
To Barnes & Noble

283
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
That's right

284
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
So my

285
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Buddy Ganem William Lynch

286
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Became the CEO Barnes & Noble

287
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,871
And everyone knows that Barnes and Noble 2010 was challenged Visa V Amazon

288
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
But

289
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Do any of you read Barbarians at the gate

290
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Birthday

291
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
I'll probably come he's attacking something and try to take it private

292
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,855
Taking a company private sounded like a pretty fun

293
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,207
Pirate type Nino take the ship exciting challenge Nicole

294
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
That was so cool

295
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
But we weren't able to do it

296
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,887
I mean you were involved with a digital side of ours until we know what's going on with the details

297
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Surviving free fall

298
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,287
So what was going on with with a part of company you were running

299
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Imagine it was

300
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
Play losing all my exactly trying to compete with Amazon

301
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
15 years late

302
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
I mean you don't wish on your worst enemy

303
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Competing at Amazon in their in their core category right

304
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
So it was pretty rough and yes yes we were losing money

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
So what are you starting to

306
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
At that point

307
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
2010/2011 starting to think

308
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
All right I got to come up with an X thing

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
Yeah I mean at this point I'm anxious immuno 40

310
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
I wanted to

311
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Be in a bag

312
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
And I'm just kind of spinning my wheels and

313
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Haven't found anywhere to anywhere to go

314
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Sorry

315
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Coming

316
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
But you said you wanted to be

317
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Big what do you mean by that what it would that actually mean

318
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
I don't know I'm a competitive guy and I study I study

319
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
Everything I read every Business book I've listened to every how I built this

320
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,191
I really am a student of business and and

321
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
After

322
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
Years and years and years of this

323
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
I say I think I'm as good as that for that person I just heard

324
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
You know some of my think I'm better

325
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
Until we know what about me I think I can do it they give me a chance

326
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
And so I was

327
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
I'm starting to become pretty anxious and wanted to approve my

328
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
2

329
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,391
2011 you're still at Barnes & Noble

330
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
And

331
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
You

332
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,327
Get an idea for a company that would become the one that you not run out

333
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
So

334
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,519
Like a lot of New Yorkers I'm guessing a lot of you here Boutique Fitness was exploding in New York City

335
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
SoulCycle flywheel Barry's Bootcamp yoga been around for a long time I done spend

336
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Back in the 90s in LA

337
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
And I hit I clearly felt that the boutique

338
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
Instructor-led group fitness high-energy programmed experience was better than

339
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Then going to the gym

340
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
It was more fun than going for a 6 mile run by yourself

341
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,191
It was more fun than going to the old big box gym and trying to throw around the way to get on a treadmill and get yourself excited

342
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,263
And so I had tasted this content

343
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
And I said this is

344
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
This is good people want this I want

345
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
But it was at a different location at somebody else's time going to pay a lot of money to get that experience

346
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
And interesting Lee my wife who

347
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Is

348
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
Probably works out two or three times more week then I do she's

349
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
The poster child

350
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
For the stuff

351
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
She premeditated workouts for the week

352
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,399
And she'll say okay next Thursday morning to wake up at 6 and go to this class until the Beast schedule and reserved my bike

353
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,751
And I just didn't do that I didn't don't have that Gene

354
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,359
Thinking at 10 at night before I go to bed, am I going to set the alarm tomorrow

355
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Right

356
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
And that's how I think it's effectively because the good locations in the good instructors are sold out so quick

357
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
But I wasn't able to go to that why was box out of it

358
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,183
And I said if these classes sell out these 50 bikes sell out

359
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
And 30 seconds

360
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,607
Would there be 500 people up if it was infinite room would there be 500 people that wanted in with me

361
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,447
Pier two thousand people in New York that would want that great time and a great instructor

362
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
If you could

363
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,615
Skillet globally would there be 50,000 people in 5 million people that would want that great instructor at great time

364
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,455
And so I said it did it just started to scream distributed technology play

365
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
And obviously I knew enough about technology that

366
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Yeah I got me excited

367
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Do you talk to your wife right away dude

368
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
This amazing idea or was it more of a Slow Burn

369
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
I think it was an amazing idea

370
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
It was

371
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
You're with your words your words not mine

372
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
They were it was

373
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,543
I think it came to me and I said I think you can digitize that experience

374
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
And build a hardware and software platforms

375
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Consuming Fitness.

376
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
So the light bulb went off what was the description you gave us

377
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
Google take me back to 2011 I'm at your house and you like a guy

378
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
I have this great idea

379
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
What are you what are you telling me

380
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
Yeah it's it's effectively Peloton bike it was yours a big screen

381
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
And

382
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
Here is a bike that talks to the screen so you have metrics

383
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Competition motivation

384
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
UEFA leaderboard

385
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
You have great

386
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Instructors

387
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
I knew enough about

388
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
The content in the celebrity that you could

389
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
If you had the global scale

390
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
You could pay for the best

391
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Constructors

392
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
And in all these things a content is King

393
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
Has a lot of you guys are connoisseurs of the category you know that

394
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
And sometimes you're

395
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Say yoga

396
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Your yoga instructor

397
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Is more important than the yoga studio

398
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
If your yoga instructor went to a different Studio you might follow him or her

399
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
And so the content really

400
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
Is is important I said we could get the best people

401
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
And so I explained the whole thing and I did go home and talk to my wife about it

402
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
She knew the categories you knew me

403
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
And she's nodding and luckily she was behind it very early because

404
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
You know I think something for the rest of this

405
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
Podcast rent talk about the bone-crushing next 7 years

406
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
Thanks thankfully she believed in in the idea

407
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Who's the first serious person you called

408
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
How to say

409
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Can one tell you about this

410
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Cuz

411
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
You needed to

412
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Presumably

413
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Do this with somebody else

414
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,959
Yeah there were there were three phone calls I made my mentor John Pleasants he and I he just started job at Disney

415
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
And so he dragged me on a Disney cruise

416
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
And what wait we pulled out to spin bikes and I was pretending the coach him through as I say there's a screen e r a

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
And I was on the bike

418
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Coaching him through I would like

419
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Stand up

420
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,343
And if any

421
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,999
So I cycle right now work on Yahtzee and turn it off and I work and true for

422
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
10 minutes of

423
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
The pho class

424
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
He said I get it

425
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,167
That was better than I would have done myself until the light bulb went off in his head so

426
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
He was an early investor so I got him

427
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Then I called to my co-founder

428
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Mitsubishi

429
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,407
I'm using to store general counsel in one of my best friends and he knew how to start a cup

430
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
Your pregnant with starting the company and have a backer

431
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,647
What you do then what do you write for parade in Delaware

432
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,511
So he was instrumental and he was a very smart guy and so he advanced

433
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
That you know you wasn't just the legal guy who sent you

434
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Couponer never sent

435
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
And then a third co-founder Tom cortezi

436
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Who is just

437
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
It worked with you at IAC before and he's never start another company with

438
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
He's just so can do and

439
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Positive and so I sat with him

440
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
IPic remember there was a bottle of wine and some

441
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
Sushi takeout

442
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
And at the end of it he's like a man

443
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
So with you get a little bit of momentum of getting some other people on board and Things become more real

444
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
When there's other people that jump in the Box

445
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,839
So it was that easy to convince those guys to

446
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Presumably leave their jobs

447
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Or

448
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,239
Do a side hustle with you on this by the way you are still at Barnes & Noble at that

449
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,567
I was but truth be told by his so it was about

450
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
2 years before he left his job

451
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
So he was Moonlighting so he didn't have to take the risk

452
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
And Tom was out of work

453
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Wasn't

454
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,855
You always want to go to somebody's out of work.

455
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
Play trying to find a co-founder right is the best type of co-founder

456
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Alright so you got these

457
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
You got these friends and you got to start

458
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Coming up with a concept but

459
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
From what I understand what are the first steps

460
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
You did was

461
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
To go out in

462
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Just raised him

463
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Amend

464
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
People you knew or people in your network of people that those guys knew the seed round was Route was relatively easy

465
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
It was $400,000

466
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
That a 1.6 million pre-money valuation

467
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Pinto 2 million post

468
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Any raises from like

469
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Hungry people

470
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
I know this was this was from I think eight people

471
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Alarm and it was

472
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,143
People who just knew me and trusted me and log me in and worked with me in the past

473
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
So it was my best friend's dad who

474
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
I had some money not a lot of money but enough that he was going to give me 50000 which was the big check

475
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
And then my brother-in-law who

476
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
I've made a couple million dollars in his life so it was

477
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
One of the richest people I knew

478
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
And he was going to give her number at the text

479
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,159
I said we are you in 425 and he said you send me a picture of 50 Cent he's like no I'm in 450

480
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,023
He's either very excited he's a very excitable guy

481
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,191
So you were like raising 25000 50000 here and there and the valuation was 1.6 million.

482
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,847
So initially Rydia was let's just buy off the shelf

483
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Stop

484
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
The Shelf bike and let's

485
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Getting off the shelf

486
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
Tablet and let's try to do it

487
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,063
Yeah that's right I'm in it for all of you biting on spinners

488
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,440
Software is he is easiest to appear software company is easiest to do

489
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
And it's easiest to raise money

490
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
Every venture capitalist is looking for the next Instagram

491
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
Were you put

492
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,656
$250,000 in an 18 months later it sells for a billion dollars

493
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
So we were trying to think can we be software

494
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Only

495
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,104
I'm started to look at the but we started to do deep research on the on the bikes in the category

496
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
And

497
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
As you probably know

498
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
Fitness equipment categories in

499
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Incredibly Dope

500
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Noatak

501
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
No design

502
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,112
I just didn't feel like it was a bike that met the bar of

503
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
The call if call you if you wanted

504
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
So then we start thinking guy let's make it bike

505
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
And let's have a dongle

506
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
To plug in your iPad

507
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Everybody's got an iPad and I kept coming back in my mind to the clock radio

508
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
When your Holiday Inn

509
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
It has the iPhone 4 dongle

510
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:08,128
And I said I don't want to be that company that looks so dumb cuz your product is

511
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,712
May be relevant based on some of other companies Hardware Cycles

512
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
And so I said I think you got to make the tablet

513
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,320
Height by the way this wasn't me this was

514
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Channing Tatum we were coming

515
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Us together but

516
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
These are the decisions we make

517
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
2

518
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
You got some seed money you get some office space I think in

519
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
In Manhattan

520
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
And even before you started

521
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,936
Think about the actual bike right you went to

522
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
Flywheel you went to SoulCycle you said hey

523
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,824
Do you want to partner with me on this is that

524
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,408
That's right we went to SoulCycle

525
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Have instructors you guys

526
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,504
Jeff Studios you guys wanted this is what you guys do

527
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
We're technologist

528
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,624
We're going to build a Hardware in soccerplatform what about we come together

529
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,208
Seems very obvious that would be good for us and good for them

530
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
So I can joint venture

531
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
Yeah exactly

532
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
And we got we got

533
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
A couple weeks into a term sheet with flywheel and then they backed away they just got through financing around and it didn't make sense with her

534
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
New investor

535
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
SoulCycle

536
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
He was tricky though the only there was enough human chemistry

537
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
But the team they were

538
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Very big

539
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,784
We were nobodies so the conversation was kind of

540
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
One sided

541
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Write in a way that I thought it would be

542
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
Conversation equals

543
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
But they they were doing so well

544
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
I'm getting so much

545
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
Affirmation from their community

546
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
That it wasn't a conversation of equal so it didn't

547
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
So it didn't work out

548
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
And

549
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
You decide are we going to build this bike by the way

550
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
You still were going to

551
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
It's like SoulCycle classes in flywheel classes

552
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
I'll give you like going to the class

553
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
I did yes

554
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
And what were you laughing

555
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Well you have all of us very quickly got kicked out of flywheel and tolls

556
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
You're saying that you are not

557
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
A class and somebody

558
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Yes

559
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
They like monitors there like they're like oh there's John Foley he's going to be our competitors to what what happened

560
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
The very territorial category

561
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
Especially New York

562
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
The flywheel and SoulCycle and you had to join Elizabeth

563
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
On the show right now

564
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Friendly with

565
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
But that because

566
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Because

567
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Give me the roots Aukerman

568
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:28,672
Defection duration started with them when they separated

569
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
And she she's amazing woman I love her

570
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,560
She went to start flywheel and so

571
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
There was a lot of vitriol between the two

572
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,168
And I understand I made it wasn't

573
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
It wasn't personal it was its

574
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Competitive

575
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Alright so you got

576
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Some seed money

577
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
And you've got to

578
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Build a bicycle now

579
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
How do you even

580
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Start like

581
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
What are you

582
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
Like what are you going to go to find out how to build egg

583
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
Stationary

584
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Spin cycle

585
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
Yeah we went to Taiwan to trade shows

586
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Superfund by the weather

587
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:08,096
Incredible to go to Tie Fighter by Eva Air to Taipei and go to one of the trade shows your mind is made

588
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
Really opened up with so much

589
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
Manufacturing and

590
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Schoology

591
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Most interesting stuff ever

592
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
The Wii

593
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
What's first two years of

594
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,616
Pulling the thread through the technology and doing prototypes and

595
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
Testing and

596
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
Taking the dog food and getting people on the prototypes at

597
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
It was so fun

598
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,624
The tough thing was those years we just didn't have any money so we were always about to run out of money and when you

599
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,952
When you have a vision and you have people and you you need

600
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,584
Capital to build a business and when it's not there it's very scary and very stressful so

601
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
Yeah mon Ramen when you went to

602
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
Manufacture of spin bike is really

603
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Expensive

604
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
So

605
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,312
Did you start to go to VC firms and ask them for money

606
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
I would bet a pitch three times a day for 4 years

607
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:58,016
Between thousands of angels that ended up giving the first we have a hundred angels

608
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
2 / 10 million

609
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
But in order to get a hundred Angels at my success rate

610
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
I probably pissed

611
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
3000 people

612
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Wow

613
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,280
And then the 4th at the 400 institutions that all said no all of them

614
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
All of them

615
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
I'm so it was a hundred angels

616
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,424
They gave its 4:10 million and then finally after

617
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Almost three year tiger global

618
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
Which of the New York city-based venture capitalist thankfully

619
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Because the valley

620
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,616
Sandhill Road the valley

621
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Didn't see what was happening

622
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
In New York City with the

623
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Did the guy go out there they would say there

624
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
Two types of biking out here John mountain bike

625
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Viking road bike

626
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Straight

627
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
And that they just didn't see what was happening and it was it was a blind spot for them so luckily there while you're there were some venture capitalist and Lee fix

628
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Television area

629
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Tiger global

630
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Saw it at

631
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
And maybe they were the

632
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,824
Over that three-year period from 2011 to 2013-14 when you are pitching and pitching and pitching relentlessly

633
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
Pitching and also you know

634
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
Run a business

635
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
That must have

636
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Should have been difficult I mean I can't imagine there

637
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
Maybe not but I can assure you wouldn't have had some self-doubt

638
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
Sure there were there was there was there were

639
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
Quarters in years where there was a

640
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Incredibles

641
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
It had to be a man

642
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
I was a nobody from Key Largo and here are

643
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
Named venture capitalist

644
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Assuming I don't want

645
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Calling out my name but think of

646
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
20

647
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,056
Venture capitalist you've heard their name

648
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
I'm sitting there and they're saying

649
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
No this is Dom no thank you

650
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
And you're like who am I to think that this named person at the

651
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Disney shop

652
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Is wrong

653
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Yeah

654
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Supercomp

655
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Located

656
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Expensive to

657
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
There's no Market data about it

658
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
And so

659
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
What did you what would you respond

660
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,448
That was a frustrating thing is that no Market data because

661
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
We created a category of

662
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,848
And I thought when the venture capitalist heard that they would say wow this is

663
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Does truvision

664
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
This is true disruption

665
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Absolutely let me in

666
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
And they were saying

667
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
No there's no research

668
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
Search there's no that they look

669
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
What's called pattern recognition

670
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
And it wasn't a pattern and what we were doing

671
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
And so

672
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
You know it was it was frustrating cuz I saw it clear as day

673
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Are are early members

674
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Customers

675
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
Thought they were saying oh my gosh

676
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
Who sings change my life

677
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
They're going

678
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Crazy for you

679
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
And still the investors weren't there

680
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
You had

681
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Two kids

682
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
Edward mid-40s OS you're not 21 or 22

683
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
2 year olds

684
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Ajisen Ramen

685
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Yep

686
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
The stakes are high

687
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
Take some very high and it's a one point I told my wife alright we're going to sell her 401K cuz we need we need the money

688
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,928
Doesn't sound very smart but your desk

689
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
Yeah and in the early days when we had engineers and we have very little money

690
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
And you have to pay Engineers a lot of money to get great engineers

691
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
And give them a lot of equity obviously

692
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
I cleaned the bathrooms and I vacuumed every day for 3 years in this little

693
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
What's the place we had and it will have to clean because

694
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
We could afford a cleaning office

695
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
I said I didn't want anyone else distracted with

696
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,248
Cleaning so you know I was that guy but then I turned into the the fundraiser

697
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,112
And we made it work obviously we're sitting here but it was very very dark days

698
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
When we come back

699
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,792
Capella time is actually made enough money for John to stop

700
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Cleaning the bathrooms

701
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
Add a company van went on to become a major Force

How I built this

706
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Support for this podcast come from American Express

707
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,784
Director of global sales strategy Chase Hyatt

Define the right

712
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Financial solution

Their business

714
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
It's a lot like solving a puzzle

715
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,536
Each customer's different each business is different

716
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
We really want understand what your goals are for the year

717

For three years

718
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
And what would extra financing do

719
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
To help you achieve

720
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,592
One of my customers is a long-standing family-run restaurant

721
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

766

Die Rise

767
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
Soca 2013

768
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Sean Foley

769
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Is out trying to raise money

770
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Peloton afloat

771
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,848
Meanwhile his co-founders of Designing a bike

772
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Who's the author of high-tech alternative

773
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
Typical home workout

774
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
But

775
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
When the first

776
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Prototype pariah

777
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
It was a big problem

778
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,208
So you know the spinal tap where I was 18 in 18 ft

779
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
But there was a little scale problem

780
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,072
Where the first the first prototype was about

781
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
40% too big

782
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
It was like we looked at it really that's a big

783
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
Indoor cycling bike

784
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
So

785
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
Funny we have a good friend of ours

786
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,408
Lawrence allamanda who is a tall

787
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
Beautiful woman

788
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,248
And we we needed some marketing

789
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
511 or something

790
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Harry said

791
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,184
Can you come model this bike so that the proportions look a little bit more normal

792
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,512
Trick photography

793
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,632
So that was the first intravasation we had to do with that with that one of those

794
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
One of the first

795
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,008
Predators in was the bike as great as you had hoped it to be I mean aside from the

796
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,848
Giant scale the next prototype that we got that we got

797
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Skil raised we were much closer to Launch

798
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
And we were much more anxious

799
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
What's with the next fight the game off

800
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
The crate from Taiwan

801
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
And we got on that we're excited to look greater threat scale

802
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,768
And I will put the tablet on and I think my wife got on it to ride it cuz she was off in our Muse

803
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Tube

804
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,584
To test things out and

805
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
The whole thing started wobbling

806
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
I will... Screen she couldn't

807
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:17,568
Watch the instructor cuz the screen was wobbling so much and we tightened everything downtown everything down still wobbles like crazy

808
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
We realized there was just fundamental design flaws with entire body

809
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
But you around that time

810
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,528
You have to do a kick-start like you guys decide to launch Kickstarter that's right

811
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
Kickstarter's require a video that's right

812
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,976
So you got a wobbly bike and a giant bike so so what are you video

813
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
Well we fake it till you make it

814
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,632
Or it fell. We say you got to rob a few gas stations on the way the perfect crime

815
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:47,264
And so what you do is you ask the model and the kickstarter video 2

816
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
Not really ride it

817
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,896
Mature enough to be very delicate so and we can

818
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Who doesn't shake

819
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,528
And we know that we got a little more time to work The Kinks out and drip trying

820
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,600
You know I'm problem solve the the Wobble

821
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
When you guys did the kickstarter was that actually

822
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
To raise

823
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Necessary money or was it

824
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,912
It was both but we were very excited about the raising money piece of it

825
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
And

826
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
It turns out it was a flop it was incredibly disappointing we thought here's a video is a 4 minute video tells you everything you need to know about

827
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Peloton

828
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
And

829
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
200 people

830
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
I guess we were stranded.

831
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
Some 200 people bought

832
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
And 100 of them were invest

833
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
So

834
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,136
It was you know

835
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
Rihanna back to the drawing board

836
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Do we have a business

837
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
How we going to sell this thing it was it was

838
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
It was a moment

839
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
At that point you are

840
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Building bikes

841
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,424
I think you the kickstarter you sold them for 1500

842
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
Were people

843
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Investors in and maybe others kept

844
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
Can I push it back in saying

845
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,616
Too expensive no one's going to buy that

846
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
One interesting thing

847
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
A couple months after the kickstarter thing we launched

848
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,064
A website and we started pricing it at $1,200

849
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Because

850
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
It was just over $1,200 was our costume I like let's price it at Cost because we have the subscription digital content business model

851
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
Comes afterwards so we don't need to make any money

852
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
And we were selling at 1200

853
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
And someone told me

854
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
That a $1,200

855
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
It seems

856
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Sheep sounds cheap

857
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
And so we said

858
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Increase the price and we increase the price

859
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
And

860
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
Impossible to truly tell

861
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,248
But it seems like the velocity of sales in

862
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
So you have

863
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
A piece of hardware

864
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
You're building a software

865
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Oh and by the way you have to be a TV production company

866
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
YouTube build a broadcast-quality studio

867
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
And by the way how big was your off

868
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
In terms of square footage

869
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
Probably

870
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
2000 square feet

871
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
And yet how many people are working in there

872
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
That point is probably 20

873
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
5 people

874
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
You guys know about

875
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
TV production

876
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
0

877
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
What would you do like what your first step

878
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,856
Wood

879
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
On Wikipedia research

880
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
Okay television production camera

881
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,792
And you'd see here's the real expensive one here's the

882
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,888
Media morning Mo a fun thing is we were our office was right by B&H Photo

883
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,032
So you go over to B&H Photo and you talked to somebody and say this is what we want to do

884
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,872
And they help you I mean this is the learning this is the fun stuff about nursing we love these

885
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,248
And what was that what did that first Production Studio actually look like was it a professional

886
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
I know Studio has no it was it was basically the back of our office we hung a curtain and put for stationary bikes

887
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
And put a camera

888
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
And static camera

889
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,608
Set a camera against the wall some lights and studio lights

890
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
I think we are

891
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,216
RCT oyouni as a fake instructor

892
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
You know it's kind of feet do the first class before because it's his way before we could convince any instructor to Joy

893
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,456
Moving hearts

894
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
Is the bike there's a software there's getting instructors DirecTV production so how do you get

895
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
Instructors mean

896
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
I have to assume most of the great instructors are already working at Firewheel SoulCycle or other places

897
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,632
Yeah sure so we are I put I put an ad on social

898
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,448
Cuz you can't afford relied so you just posting things on social

899
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
And it was not what I was looking for the 10 best instructors in the world

900
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
And just ridiculous bombastic I get it but it was we were

901
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Until it

902
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Cu cu bites

903
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
And so I remember when the first

904
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
At the first instructor that we hired was a woman at Jenn Sherman

905
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,136
Who was a big deal

906
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Got to love Jen

907
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,816
She said look no further I have the email she has the email with it with the moment and her personality was captured in it

908
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
And she's such a

909
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,144
Fun charismatic believes in herself

910
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,984
Cheeky everything about a personality came out this email and she's like

911
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
You found your person

912
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,080
And we did and then quickly Robin took a risk

913
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
That was awesome Hannah

914
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
Cody the not-too-distant

915
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
There was there was an energy

916
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
And we tell him what we're doing and

917
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
I think they they

918
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Enough of me saw it

919
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,160
And we didn't have a studio at that point we didn't have stores they didn't know how we're going

920
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
To sell these things

921
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,584
How to get the word out about this and what was your distribution model having to sell them

922
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
Yasso office in Manhattan streaming videos that's right

923
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,824
Time we had this product that we thought was awesome and

924
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
The website was up and no one was coming to the website

925
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Start doing some Facebook ads in

926
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,040
You know trickle of sales came in but not nearly fast enough to build a business

927
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
So we

928
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:52,416
We thought about having a pop up in Grand Central reach

929
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
Commuters

930
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,352
I'm couldn't get the right spot but I think it was either Tom Cortes of your ryannangle this young young guy on a team

931
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
At the idea of going out to Short Hills Mall

932
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
And finding out whether they had

933
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Stop application

934
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,592
Short Hills because it's the trendsetting capital of America

935
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
Well what you want cuz I don't really days

936
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,832
To your point if you have a $2,000 product you you do think that the lowest hanging fruit is going to be awful in neighborhood that's an athlete

937
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Incredibly awful and I've never been there never heard of it

938
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:27,488
I ended up not going because I was still in the in the deep dark days of fundraising

939
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,584
Somebody else watch the retail and I was a combination of a right angle and Thomas

940
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,424
But we did run the math and we said we need to sell one bike a day

941
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
In order to make

942
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
This work

943
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
And how did the do-over was Aaliyah

944
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,056
Curiosity

945
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,104
Three shopping malls are

946
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
Right on the decline were there

947
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,712
If you aren't fewer there's there's less most foot traffic in shopping malls

948
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
So that was kind of a rest

949
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
But what is

950
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
What happened to people

951
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:57,184
Check it out yeah it was it looking back it's it's it's amazing to me it's still a miracle V

952
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Did this happen

953
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:03,328
But you think about who's going to come in walk by a store in the mall they've never heard of

954
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Come in and check out a bike

955
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
And get

956
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,960
$2,000 in the credit card out and say I want one

957
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Once a day

958
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,056
Everyday somebody going to come in to buy Peloton bike

959
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Very quickly

960
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
We were selling 5x a day

961
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Well and it was just

962
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Mind-boggling that's just

963
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
People never heard of this and I will tell you the interesting guy

964
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
The main objection back then wasn't the price it was

965
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
What it what happens to this bike when you guys go bankrupt

966
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
Write write 95 percent of startups

967
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
Go bankrupt I have no idea but it said it took material

968
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Majority

969
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
And I had a good answer which was

970
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
If you're paying the subscription

971
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,360
We can keep an Amazon web services server going

972
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
And park the content up there

973
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,736
And stream to the bikes because that economics will be

974
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
I will still work for the business over in bankruptcy whoever gets this asset of the annuity of the

975
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
I had it I had a story at work

976
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Sometimes

977
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,792
And how much content I mean if you are an early adopter if you were buying

978
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
The Short Hills Mall

979
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
How much content was available at the time

980
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
10 glasses

981
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Time they weren't filmed in that back room

982
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
They were alive.

983
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
So it was

984
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,384
See I was five months before we had our studio in Chelsea open so

985
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,968
You were still selling a dream but I will tell U Visa vie

986
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
I mean even one Jenn Sherman class

987
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
In a Cheesy Unifour bike studio in the back of her office

988
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
Her personality came out

989
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,720
And you get on it and you put your headphones on you like

990
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,328
I can take this anytime I want and by the way then click over and gets take a robin class and

991
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
Enough was there that you like I get it

992
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,936
And you're going to add classes every week

993
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Sure reading class every week

994
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
And they got excited and if you like Fitness and you likes

995
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,848
Take me to risk taking it was it was fun

996
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,735
So at what point are you able to go back to some of those investors they look I have this model now

997
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
I can show you the you know where where this is heading

998
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
When when did you start to get

999
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
A better reception

1000
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,743
So the frustrating thing guy on that Vector is

1001
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,071
A lot of people would say I'm going to wait to see if there's bikes

1002
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
I'm going to wait to see if people want this property

1003
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,447
I go back to those same people and they're like

1004
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
So you're selling bikes

1005
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
But this is acid

1006
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Subscription digital content business model

1007
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
They might buy the bike and they might turn after a year

1008
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,271
Come back after you have more coworx data after a year or two on the churn of the Civ

1009
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Description

1010
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
As I go out come on

1011
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
I can't get two years down the road if I don't have more money were you surprised at how risk-averse a lot of these VC

1012
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Incredibly

1013
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
So yeah absolutely I was

1014
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,887
Jardins de more lies and you think venture capitalist

1015
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
History of War

1016
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
How to have a vision and end

1017
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
And take risks

1018
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,103
You have the right guy they minimize risk going to end you get it if they're shepherding your Capital they want minimal risk but

1019
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
It didn't didn't make sense to me at the time

1020
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Still have to

1021
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Secret pop-up shop

1022
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Presentable your online

1023
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,319
Where are 2014

1024
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
I mean February that

1025
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Pop-up shop

1026
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Closes

1027
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,695
So now are you selling the bike

1028
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,023
No we were able to renew the lease on short

1029
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
And we said wow this is working

1030
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Let's go get a couple more

1031
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Allocations

1032
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,239
Give me four locations in when we started selling bikes and then shopping malls

1033
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
Only child

1034
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
So is it was it something that

1035
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
You guys felt

1036
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
Customers or potential customers had to try

1037
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
But if they just saw it online it wasn't

1038
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
It wasn't really going to be enough cuz it's a big ask

1039
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
What you're asking people to

1040
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
Shell out

1041
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
A considerable amount of money

1042
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
And no matter how you make the argument look over

1043
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,487
Timer going to save money on gym membership

1044
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
It's still too

1045
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Big one time cost at that time

1046
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Did you feel like

1047
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,423
We got to get this in front of people people to sit on it and try it

1048
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
That that was exactly right. It was

1049
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
You and your wife would walk up and I

1050
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Profile

1051
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Cuz she's probably sold

1052
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Cyclist probably are

1053
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
Outdoor cyclist do whatever in

1054
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,943
There is there are some gender bias in in

1055
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
10 Fitness

1056
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
One of you would get on the bike

1057
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
Within two minutes of me talking to you and say going to try come on please

1058
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
And I'd be adjusting to seed and minimizing the friction so you get on

1059
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
How to get Yuan

1060
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,999
Pikachu on the paddles put then I was a hand over the headphones to you

1061
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,583
And I'd know what class to start with you what

1062
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
What instructor you might like what instructor she might like I'd know what

1063
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
What class and I'll be honest

1064
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
It was a fun game for me to try and get the hook in your mouth

1065
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,639
Right away as quickly as possible I get you peddling so the endorphins start moving body start to giving you reaction

1066
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
Headphones on loud music

1067
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,991
And you would look over your wife

1068
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
And you'd say

1069
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
This is amazing

1070
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,367
Right right screaming in the mall

1071
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,303
Because the tide make the music too loud and generally if I could get somebody on a bike on a stick

1072
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,167
God I got to a point where is 50-50 chance that you're going to buy the bike even though you've heard of it

1073
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Because it is something that once you experience it

1074
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
And get on it and see it and it

1075
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Clicks

1076
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
You want it

1077
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
Cheer raising money or going to shopping malls your

1078
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
Sales guy always sings

1079
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
Curious mean you still got children

1080
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,111
Presumably want to spend time with them I mean how did that

1081
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Impact your personal life

1082
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
He was it was tough again the fact that my wife believed in it meant a lot again either at work or

1083
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,679
Marriage wouldn't work if if she hadn't been you know a believer in that it was it was very dark days and it was

1084
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
I was

1085
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
You know a shell of a human being

1086
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
For several years

1087
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
To two years in particular

1088
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,663
She would say I'm feeling disconnected your not present you're not here

1089
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,247
And can we have a date night and I would say I will have a date night

1090
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
If we talk about

1091
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
What happens when we on white.

1092
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
If that's the conversation

1093
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
How we're going to move in with your parents what's going to walk me through

1094
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
Walk me through the unwinding of this

1095
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
So that I don't

1096
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
Yeah something bad doesn't happen

1097
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
So you act like

1098
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
The significant anxiety

1099
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
I was masquerading as

1100
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Running app

1101
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,127
Great company and we are trying to put on a happy face and

1102
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,223
You know sell to the team and sell to the investors

1103
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,015
And if the truth be told first

1104
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
Two or three years we were about to

1105
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
The collapse and we didn't have the money

1106
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
And if it was

1107
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,439
It was stressful I mean I mean a lot of fun

1108
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
I'm not the first alternative.

1109
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
But it was it was first time I've gone through it was very tough

1110
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
So when did you start to see

1111
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:34,495
To see like a light like what did you start to turn a corner was it when you started to open up those shopping mall

1112
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Locations and when did you start

1113
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Really see

1114
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,591
Sales kind of pickup

1115
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
I start seeing the light on Peloton about

1116
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
6 months

1117
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
Okay

1118
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
It was hard for a long long time

1119
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,879
But the traction

1120
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
Yeah we started opening more stores

1121
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:59,583
But then it's like you're selling 4000 bikes and you have this massive burn and you have great shoulder expectations you're still running

1122
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Money

1123
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,495
Hugo do pitting on 100 pitches you get a hundred knows ya even though your Sultan bikes and you have some happy customers

1124
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
You're still in the grind

1125
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
Meantime you have to like

1126
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
The company has to produce

1127
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,383
Tons of content

1128
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
Is there more bikes or selling the more

1129
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Demand there is

1130
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
So

1131
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,551
How did you how did you guys kind of

1132
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Do that

1133
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
So

1134
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,695
Tibet there was that we wanted to have a studio that was

1135
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
Content production

1136
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Facility basically television

1137
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,351
And in the early days it was I I say that it was a

1138
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Spin studio

1139
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
With a television

1140
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Bright

1141
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,495
Now it is a television production facility

1142
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Filming fit

1143
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Enes Kanter

1144
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
And we have I mean

1145
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,591
Some of the best

1146
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Production people

1147
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
And some of the best on air Talent I'll be sleeping in our celebrity

1148
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Instructors

1149
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,527
But we've become a pretty hardcore Media Company

1150
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
But in the early days it was

1151
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
How do you rig up a camera

1152
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,415
And get the lights on the instructor so that the

1153
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
Countenance captured

1154
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
So I know you said that is

1155
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
Yeah you just started to get

1156
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,863
Comfortable less less anxious six months ago but but I mean

1157
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
You guys

1158
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,727
For profitable relatively early and you have it wasn't you.

1159
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
But you were profitable by

1160
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
2015

1161
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
Yeah I would say we were we were probably cuz we could we could see profitability and in six months I would say we were effectively prop

1162
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Truly turned

1163
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
The prophet book

1164
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
We would

1165
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,415
Be Scrappy enough that the margin in the bike and the proceeds from the

1166
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Subscription wood

1167
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
Started we could see that it was going to pay or overhead

1168
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,815
But then we would quickly want to Triple down on

1169
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,679
A new product or a new market a new marketing and more higher growth or more stores

1170
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
And so

1171
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
We've always needed money

1172
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,847
Undergrowth when did the Industrial

1173
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
You've raised

1174
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Billion dollars

1175
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
When did that turn

1176
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,991
The series eat

1177
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
Date was 2 years ago effectively

1178
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,855
When investors started to really see it

1179
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
And we actually turned down at me for the first five races

1180
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
We took every dollar we could

1181
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
From anybody

1182
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
And that creates a cap table of 300 people

1183
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Yes to do Shenzhen individuals

1184
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
And you know some of them

1185
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,471
Are my best friends but I've seen 95%

1186
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
We are friends but five

1187
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Percent of them

1188
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
4 people you wouldn't want to take money from

1189
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
But when you don't have an option

1190
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
Me and are you going to go bankrupt you take money from literally anyone who will give it to you

1191
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
It's public knowledge

1192
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,783
Which store has been publicly discuss that

1193
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
There's talk of Peloton

1194
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
Doing an IPO maybe this year and Ikes

1195
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
Could value it as high as 8 billion maybe more

1196
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
What do you mean

1197
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,583
What what is the vision of where this

1198
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Company

1199
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
Is headed what are you imagine

1200
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
It'd be coming in 10 years from now

1201
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,591
So yeah we we were very excited about the category wheel of fitness

1202
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
We love

1203
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
Technology and we love media

1204
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,295
But there's a metaphor that Henry ellenbogen at T Rowe Price I put on my radar a couple years ago I thought

1205
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Well that's that's good

1206
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
I had thought of it

1207
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,927
But the metaphor was in the 80s you would go to the arcade

1208
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
And today arcades are gone

1209
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,303
Because you have better experiences in your home

1210
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
Interconnected with the world

1211
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
Especially now with things like fortnite

1212
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
We're your friends are in it

1213
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
So it's social

1214
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
It's sticky

1215
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,799
It's a better location and it's better value

1216
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,615
Cuz you're not paying $0.25 every time you die in Galaga

1217
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
Dating myself

1218
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
But

1219
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
So we see a world where few have better Hardware

1220
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
The best bike of the best treadmill

1221
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
In a

1222
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:39,487
The best location which is your home and you have great software and your the global community of supportive people

1223
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
And it's time shifted to a twin you want it

1224
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:47,679
In a why would you travel to an inferior experience with of inferior piece of fitness equipment with somebody else's

1225
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Sweat all over it

1226
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
So we see a world where

1227
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,055
Content will evolve

1228
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
And the programming will evolve

1229
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
And the software will evolved

1230
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
The hardware

1231
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
That you pedal is is a

1232
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
What

1233
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
I mean

1234
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
The company's got this

1235
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,855
Huge valuation

1236
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
It's just

1237
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,695
Charging forward has gotten a lot of attention

1238
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,839
Does anything keep you up at night anymore are you do you are you feeling like okay thumbs up you know mission accomplished

1239
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
Now we're not hot. At all

1240
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,567
No I honestly believe we're just getting started we we have massive Global ambitions

1241
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
I think if we do it well

1242
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
This will be one of the special companies of Our Generation

1243
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,759
Answer your question guy what keeps me up at night is

1244
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
How do we scale our culture

1245
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,159
How do you go from two thousand people to 50,000 people in the in the neck

1246
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Next five or six years

1247
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
And still have

1248
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
The fun.com energy

1249
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
The that the trough

1250
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
What's the transparency

1251
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
Having a fantastic culture where you're able to

1252
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Kroot and retain

1253
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
The best people in the world

1254
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Is what

1255
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,103
Keeps me up at night how many stores do you now have we have seventy globally

1256
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
And how many bikes have you sold

1257
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
Close to half-a-million

1258
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Familian pipe

1259
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
So you've got

1260
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
Hundred

1261
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Thousands of Subs

1262
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
Scribers around the world

1263
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
That's right

1264
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
You said that just a

1265
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:14,975
Few years ago you were like winding down your 401k or thinking about it and

1266
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
You know kind of freaking out a little bit about

1267
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Money cuz he had two kids and

1268
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,167
Right you know you're in your mid-forties at that time

1269
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,447
Do you feel

1270
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,519
More comfortable now you can you kind of feel like all right

1271
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,615
I'm going to be you know I'm going to be just fine me a rich guy

1272
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,223
I do I do feel more comfortable I'm not comfortable yet

1273
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:41,855
I will tell you my wife gets frustrated with me I spend money as fast as we get it and

1274
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,439
I bought my parents at a house they didn't have any money

1275
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,999
Thousand we just recently bought my in-laws house

1276
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
And so I am you know

1277
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,399
We don't we don't have much money in the bank account still because I'm

1278
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,215
Every time we get any any money we're trying to

1279
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,519
Impact the lives of people that have been there for us

1280
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,103
So I asked a question and I know that folks

1281
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Listen to show I have heard me ask

1282
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Gemini I love

1283
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,479
This question because I love the different answers

1284
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
Sandwiches

1285
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,087
When you think about all of the things that happen in all of the

1286
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
Ups and downs cuz it was a grind

1287
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,719
Right where you are today and where you might even be in in in fiber

1288
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
For 10 years from now

1289
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,607
How much of this do you think was because of your intelligence in your hard work and how much you think it was

1290
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Because it was

1291
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Good luck

1292
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
So yeah

1293
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,031
Floodplains of Life part in everybody's life I was lucky to have

1294
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Two parents

1295
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,383
That Built Me Up and gave me confidence and love me that that is

1296
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
You hit the lottery when you have

1297
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Credit cards

1298
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:50,975
But but I do think like most entrepreneurial Ventures you hear that 1% inspiration 99

1299
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
10% perspiration

1300
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
We check our egos at the door

1301
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
Everyone brings their best self to work

1302
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
And I think that's how we

1303
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Concord a lot of

1304
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
Okay one last question

1305
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
3 John 4

1306
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
If you were sitting in a society

1307
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
Watching you

1308
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
You know

1309
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
10 years ago

1310
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,735
What is it that you wish you knew then that you now know

1311
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
That would have helped

1312
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
So I was thinking

1313
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,927
You're probably looking up here saying I hope I'm not on her 48 years old

1314
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,095
My buddy Amar lalvani who's the CEO of standard as old saying

1315
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,423
Risk is the Tariff paid to leave the shores of predictable misery

1316
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
And

1317
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,567
One thing I did in the early days it was I just started telling everybody that I was starting this

1318
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
Everyone would listen I told him starting

1319
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
4 months

1320
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
Looking back

1321
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
I realize that

1322
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,855
I have been had to deliver because I would come to ego-driven I wouldn't

1323
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,439
You know I couldn't look you in the eye cuz he was like wait a second you said you're going to do that yeah

1324
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
So I think putting the energy out there

1325
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:00,351
And telling other people get to look gets the momentum going and ends hold you accountable

1326
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,959
And I thought that was a that was an important thing for me having the courage which is basically

1327
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
I just had I had to deliver on my promises

1328
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,639
John Foley co-founder Peloton

1329
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:17,503
I spoke with John on April 11th at the BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center

1330
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
York City

1331
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,111
And I realize there may be another reason why Peloton is

1332
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Caught on so well

1333
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927

1334
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951

00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
Explain why Peloton has
