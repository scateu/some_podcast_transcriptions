00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
How I built this

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
Stories behind the movement

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
They go

49
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,384
Online search for

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Bird houses

51
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736
LED two College roommates

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
That inspired Wayfarer

53
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
E-commerce company that sells almost five

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,672
Billion dollars worth of HomeGoods

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Soap

56
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Pretty much everyone we had on the show

57
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Had a passion for a product

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
That they needed to put out into the world

59
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
Lara merriken believe the world needed Larabars

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Jeni Britton Bauer was convinced that her ice cream

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
Going to change how people thought of

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
About ice cream

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Even Jimmy Wales founder of Wiki

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
Wikipedia thot

65
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Everyone should have

66
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Mastiff

67
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Free knowledge

68
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
But I'm here to tell you that

69
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
That is not always the case

70
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
In fact sometimes the product isn't

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Drive the starters

72
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
What really drives them

73
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Is the Challenger rather

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Solvang

75
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
The challenge

76
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
And that's basically the story behind Wayfair

77
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
Neither Steve conine nornir in shop

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Don't that strongly about home furnishings

79
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
But they did

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
Feel like people should have

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Choices

82
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
No matter where they lived

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Because there was a time when

84
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
If you lived in say Evansville Indiana

85
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
You couldn't easily get the same type of

86
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,560
Cool copy table or sofa that someone in San Francisco or New York

87
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Note today

88
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,960
Particular article or new but back in the early 2000s

89
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
It was a revolution

90
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
And today

91
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
Wayfair sales almost

92
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
Five billion dollars worth of his stuff

93
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Every year

94
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
I was actually the third Company Steve and neeraj started together

95
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,624
Teenagers at a summer camp for Math and Engineering nerds in the early 1990s

96
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
They quickly lost touch

97
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Almost a year later

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,792
As if fate herself was watching over these guys

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
They both ended up in

100
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
His first years

101
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Add Cornell

102
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Assigned to dorm rooms

103
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
On the same corridor

104
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
Did you know both of you in each other the other one was going to Cornell

105
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
No it really kept in touch

106
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
So I think it was

107
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
It was a surprise

108
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
How you been this past year

109
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
So were you friends like right away

110
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Yeah we were part of it you know I think when your freshman year you start to have a small group of

111
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Of friends that you

112
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Connect with

113
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
And spend a lot of

114
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Your time with it and we were

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
In that group together

116
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
And then Junior your near tonight start

117
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
Country a lot closer and live together that he

118
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Junior interior

119
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
With it with a few other

120
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Peapod

121
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Yeah

122
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
Did you guys hear tissue did you and Steve used to talk about

123
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Starting a business

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
When you are in college

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I don't know that we were talking about it per se but

126
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Last semester at Cornell

127
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
We took an entrepreneurship course

128
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
This is one of our electric

129
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
And in this entrepreneurship

130
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Of course one of the things yet to do is

131
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Credit business plan

132
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,631
And what really happened is through the process of doing the project which is creating a business plan we basically start our first

133
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,495
Yeah it was 95 and it was a very early isn't the internet the Netscape browser

134
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Can I come out

135
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,823
That year or idea was actually

136
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Developing internet Direct

137
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Tree services

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,015
And we can try to pitch company is something is five bucks I have a listing on in our internet directory

139
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
Of course we look at us like we're nuts a few would say Hey kid that's interesting but

140
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
A homepage like all the time

141
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Could you help me build a website

142
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,839
And you know baby was different and what would that cost me and so

143
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
The business turned into an internet Consulting business that film sites

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Four companies

145
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
And you can kind of knew how to do the basics because you were engineering students

146
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
Exactly so you go from Project to project and

147
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Cummings were trying to move very quickly

148
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,831
You know different people would ask other people then who could we hire so I'm so far who won the few shops that actually done thing

149
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
When you would meet when you guys are going to meet

150
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
The clients did you ever get that feeling from any of them

151
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
They look at you and think

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
What is like a 22 year old

153
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,799
Yo we did it we're both we're both pretty good sales guy.

154
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
I don't remember that being

155
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
Smacking me too hard

156
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
I think that either the prices were charging versus like what they would be looking at

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Consultancies I think a lot of these bigger shops

158
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Look at it just like

159
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
Play money where they're kind of like well whatever how bad can it go to the

160
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
A couple costume

161
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
NTR Donuts Forest

162
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
If it works out phenomenal it doesn't work out you know

163
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Whatever we have

164
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
I guess by that summer

165
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
You graduated from

166
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Poor now and then

167
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
You decide to move

168
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
To Boston to to launch the company

169
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
Yes sir we had

170
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
What happened very quickly as it started was clear while it's because not really the right place

171
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
To be

172
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,247
New York and Siri would be very logical place to be but we both had more of an affinity

173
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,343
Play for Boston and we thought from Boston we could easily work with your clients would have you so

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
We actually decided

175
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Removed

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
The Boston

177
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,303
At the beginning of that summer how are you guys managing I mean if you were getting

178
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Project

179
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Coming in

180
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,191
There's only one of the two of you to do the work how are you managing all

181
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
You're working pretty hard to get her working on her.

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
We're basically

183
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
We set up the living room we got an apartment

184
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
And that we put coins on who got the

185
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
The bigger bedroom

186
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,039
And then he want it and the living room was basically the office

187
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Sprite soda

188
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
Decks with a temperature and wework

189
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,975
How much was fine cuz they're working from like 7 a.m. to midnight and then you're sleeping for a few hours and doing it again

190
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Exciting

191
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
I feel like you guys were

192
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Building something really big

193
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
Yeah yeah it was for their first year out of college and it's over young full of energy it's very very good

194
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
The internet and get everyone serve got their eyes on it looking at how in the potential of Technology

195
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Envisioned

196
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Quickly

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Awesome to be in the middle of

198
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
What you guys called company

199
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Spinners fidget spin the web

200
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
World Wide Web at the time it really goes Spinners you know if you're a spider spinning web

201
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Spin the web like a

202
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Buy Terro that's clever

203
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
So how long did Spinners last

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
But for years

205
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,431
So we started it in the summer of 1995

206
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,295
I guess it's three years with fall of 1998 to maybe a little over 3 years

207
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
When we sold it

208
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
He's a little over 3 years

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
We're about 40 people when we sold it

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
And the Internet and heat it up a lot

211
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,839
And they were starting to be some much larger consultancies doing the type of work we were doing

212
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
And we didn't think we could scale is fast

213
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
These other ones so we opted in the end

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Celta 1

215
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
What would you guys self

216
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
We sold it for

217
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Competition CashNet

218
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
I think it was 5,000

219
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Castle

220
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
The cash is that sound right

221
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,295
I think I've been a little more than that I think we might have each gotten like her

222
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Half a million

223
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
And then

224
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
And some stock Equity that was worth a few million bucks

225
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
But then kind of a

226
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
The.com boom kind of went up tremendously and then

227
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Came all the way

228
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Like all the way

229
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Down to zero

230
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
That's where it is

231
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
So you guys didn't really walk away with

232
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
The whole lot of money

233
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
From from

234
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Enter

235
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
No no

236
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,175
Merrill statement that says I was worth 27 million when I was probably like

237
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,271
24 year old 6 months later

238
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
At one point you were worth

239
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
27 million dollars when when you're injured

240
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
What is an n

241
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,815
It was really some paper it was just on paper but boy what a good lesson to learn as a young fellow

242
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
So this is like the early 2000

243
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Mm

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
And

245
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
And the two of you against decide to

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
Start a new business

247
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
We did yeah we had a lot of

248
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Fun and success in the first one to Die the song

249
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Easy let's

250
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
The game 2001

251
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
And we're like thinking of different ideas and we're not sure what we want to do

252
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
Long story short we came across this idea Round mobile

253
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
2001 was still pretty early

254
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
For mobile phone

255
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:19,263
But we found a lot of companies were starting to have a lot of mobile phones but they weren't really managing well because

256
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,847
That effectively having a thousands of phones but they reach a different

257
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
Contracts and they were on the wrong ones paid too much

258
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
For some two little brothers so

259
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
Our idea was we would build a software platform

260
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
That would allow the companies to better manage all their phones and their contracts

261
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
And we thought overtime we could build that in

262
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
The basically being a virtual carrier focus on

263
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Enterprise's what's a virtual carrier

264
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
Virgin Mobile in the EU

265
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,935
UK where either use a virgin brand name and actually operate on top of

266
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Bridget

267
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Tom's Network

268
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
It's a different branding on top of

269
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,919
Got into the consumer feels like they're buying Virgin Mobile they don't provide British Telecom.

270
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
What was the company called simplify mode

271
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Simplified

272
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,111
Yes but you just call up companies that hey can I talk to the person who handles your mobile phones

273
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Yeah I'm Steve Supply Mobile I'm you know

274
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Carly great offering help me save money rule phones would you

275
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
If you're not love to talk to whoever is that for you

276
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Medication to get someone right yeah we did have one

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Keep flashing customer that we had lined up

278
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Who is very interested in doing what

279
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
What is Merrill Lynch

280
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Yeah

281
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Yeah they have big fun spot

282
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
And so

283
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,943
That was looking Wicked and then unfortunately what happened in 2001

284
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Was

285
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
New site September 11

286
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
It wasn't huge

287
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
Impact everybody in and particularly for financial service Commision

288
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,743
McKay's Merrill Lynch they lost use of their headquarters in the world financial center

289
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
And they are priorities obviously had

290
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Dramatically change

291
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
So

292
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,703
With that we lost or the flagship customer that weighed anchor to round

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Answer the combination of everything causes that

294
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Become much less bullish on

295
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
That the odds of it succeeding

296
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
She's interesting because

297
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
Many people that have been on the show

298
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,783
Have had similar experiences but they've said you know what time we just kept at it

299
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Shadowsocks

300
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,159
And then the second year was the last sake but we just kept at it and

301
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
It eventually took off like a rocket

302
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
But you guys

303
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Just because I came to the conclusion that was not going to work

304
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
Yeah I mean we were in a it was a business where you look around and we are the only one

305
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Doing it

306
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,103
Scary Spotify as well and I think he thought about the market potential in the odds

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,919
What we've learned in the intervening year

308
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
I mean we spent by the last

309
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Three months of that business

310
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Literally just pounding the yellow page

311
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
Just coming in and just like taking rejection all day long trying to see if we

312
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
We could try really hard to try to sell it

313
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,255
And I think we've been a big fan of saying like

314
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
You got to start with a sale if you can't sell anything you don't have an idea

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,935
And so being after validating that I guess we

316
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
It was that rejection

317
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Hartford

318
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
For you to handle with it

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Humiliating

320
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
You where you

321
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
After a while

322
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Not

323
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,807
Too bad of a lot of fun I remember might my dad gave me some advice he was he was a stockbroker

324
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Is it look when you're going to go in and call us in the Yellow Pages

325
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
This is like the thing of suzhou

326
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Is it your goal needs to be

327
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
When you get 30 rejection

328
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Is that what you look at it every rejection is a good thing

329
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Just get to closer

330
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
So keep you motivated working at it

331
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
You learn alot more from when things are going bad

332
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Also I think we saw

333
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
We both fight went out and started thinking about just

334
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
Job interview nephew

335
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
Places in serafino taking time maybe I should go to mortgage

336
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Did that Friday we both do

337
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
That's a little while and then

338
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
How do I slept being explored

339
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Mobile kind of like

340
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Fizzled out

341
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Did you guys both were started

342
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Approach your 30s

343
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Bright

344
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Pretty young

345
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
Did you have a sense of what you were going to do next

346
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Of course you can get in the furniture

347
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Information on the internet

348
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
It's all that

349
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
So what did you guys do

350
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
China's business down

351
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
You're still thinking what's

352
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Continue to work together

353
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,647
We went right back to the drawing board so we started looking at that point we got very removing my face but at this point

354
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
That's right side

355
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Senior downstairs bedroom

356
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,863
Yeah that was living there because we got a brainstorm stuff right and then my girlfriend at the time moved up

357
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
From New York

358
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
And tell my honey is a great deal we can just live here in the deal was he bought the groceries

359
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Nurseries in

360
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
That only lasts about 2 weeks ago before she decided that we really should get our own place

361
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
That was the end of the free rent

362
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
But what happened after simplify mobile what we do

363
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Decided

364
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
We spent basically

365
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
The first couple months of 2002

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
We ended up talking to a lot of dick

367
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Business owners and there's a steam that emerge

368
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Because if you lived if you read the New York Times

369
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Making Believe with a journalist said

370
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
You would have been left believing that e-commerce was

371
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
That was what all the Articles talked about

372
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
You know, he's a crash I think there was even at that time there was a lot of skepticism that

373
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Amazon

374
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
As you know there were a lot of people talking about Amazon's

375
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Imminent demise

376
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
And so

377
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
We got feeling about to go to work at we should start

378
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Looking at internet ideas we know we know internet went to internet software she looking at ideas and then she look at other ideas that we think are just good

379
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,047
Business ideas working operators until we start making lists of ideas

380
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
We started looking at businesses that were for sale

381
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,959
Thing that maybe there's something small that we could buy with really grow and

382
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
Through that we ended up

383
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
Tripping over these Ecommerce websites that were for sale

384
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,735
And we would talk to the owner operator and they would you tell us how they're growing 20 or 30% year-over-year

385
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,527
E-commerce what were they selling

386
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,159
I remember there's one lady who was selling bird houses you're storing them in the garage everyday shoes

387
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,815
Take all the orders and collecting all the items out of the garage and packing them up and take him to the post office and selling them

388
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
Yeah Albert houses.com we found was really simple consumers and

389
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
Realize they could go online and search for any product category they want it

390
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:18,431
There were a lot of product categories like bird houses that are just not really available locally we could stay at

391
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
You want to buy a birdhouse locally where you live today

392
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Where would you go if you want a decent selection

393
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
You go to

394
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,903
Like a local store can you find

395
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Like two or three

396
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Different bird houses in the nude

397
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
After

398
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Pick one of them

399
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Exactly

400
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
And yeah pretty basic Styles right cuz they're only going to have three or four

401
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
For rent in seoul

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,519
All the sudden people started realized why don't have to be stuck with that I can go online and find a hundred different

403
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
Exactly

404
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,871
I can order whatever I want I save the time of the trip the store

405
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
I'll show up in the mail

406
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Super easy

407
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
And so

408
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
About a month's worth of research

409
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
Kind of help us figure that out

410
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
And so what we ended up doing

411
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
Is we end up deciding that there was a big opportunity and buying these but

412
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
So the first website we ended up launching

413
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
We launched the cycle racks and stands. Com

414
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
The very end of August

415
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
About year which was

416
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
TV stand speaker

417
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
Entertainment furniture

418
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Did you have a particular passion for Auntie

419
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Mechanical engineering at Cornell

420
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,295
These things are sent those days Yahoo on Yahoo search

421
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,391
You could type in terms they would tell you how many searches a month there were four that I am

422
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,487
And on some of the product comparison site they would tell you their top hundred categories

423
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
And so both of those terms run the top hundred search product

424
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
So people were looking for

425
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
TV and speakers why would they just go to their local

426
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
Like

427
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
The same thing about your selection of only two or three

428
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Can't find a good song

429
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
What's the furniture stores want to focus on

430
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Living room bedroom dining furniture

431
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
So where would you go

432
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,271
Yeah so wait till you you're thinking all right

433
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807

Well in the beginning what you do is you go online and then you look

439
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,167
Four companies that made them here also look at what the other online retailers

Small amounts of

450
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
Speaker stands until we initially started off buying

451
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,231
Through them so we'd buy out of their inventory so we had no inventory risks I was all Dropship.

452
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Distributor

453
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
And somebody would

454
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
Go to Yahoo or Google and type in speaker stands and that was one of the things that would match

455
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Exactly

456
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727

Welcome back to how I built this from NPR

502
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Garage

503
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:58,239
It's 2002 and Steve are on their third business ID

504
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,311
They're selling TV stands on the internet

505
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
It's a site called rack

506
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
And stannes.com

507
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,479
And this is a time when a lot of people start eCommerce

508
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Was dead

509
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
But neeraj and Steve

510
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
They thought it was very much a lot so they started to advertise Google had just launched

511
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Switch is the keyword

512
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,608
Grandpa where you pay money for you better get to advertise

513
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
Underwrite your text ad and you'd basically pay per click

514
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
And we would track

515
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Every time we got an order which advertising

516
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Unit drove into weedeater bid those up

517
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Forbid them down

518
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
They were non-productive

519
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
And what kind of advertisement

520
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Were they with what they say

521
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
Libby text assistant you know largest selection available TV stand TV stands for less available

522
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Braxton stamps.com

523
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
So if you are a consumer you click on this

524
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,120
And if you are adventurous in 2002 you would put your credit card into the computer

525
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
And then it would go to you guys and then you guys can order from one of these companies and then have that company

526
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Need directly shipped to that

527
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,128
Customer exactly correct we launched at the very end of August so

528
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,200
September to Remember December the 4th month

529
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
December 2002

530
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
We did about $250,000 in sale out in the category

531
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Racks and stands

532
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
Racks and stands

533
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
And we grew to be

534
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,792
The one of the largest or the largest online seller in the category

535
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,680
And what happened is our supplier start telling us hey you know you've become my biggest online retailer of TV stands

536
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Center speaker stands we're having

537
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
But you know

538
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
My other online guys sell more of my beds

539
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
Or matter only guys some more of my desk

540
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
And so we started learning

541
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,968
That in fact these other Furniture categories

542
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Is that we hadn't Focus

543
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
That they were doing quite well online

544
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
End

545
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
I have to assume that

546
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,416
Just like getting us off the ground that expense

547
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
Sit right it didn't require a whole lot of capital

548
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,536
No didn't let me some computers wepay

549
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,352
I don't know $15 a month for hosting on a

550
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Shared hosting platform

551
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,520
And we are computers in her office but it was very expensive we didn't pay ourselves

552
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
A dime

553
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
For the first

554
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Year-and-a-half

555
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
To that was the big the biggest Leverage

556
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Was that we didn't need to pay ourselves

557
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,504
And that we knew had also build the software and do the

558
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
Do that do that work with him to hire anyone

559
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
And did you did you have a guess

560
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
The number on website

561
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,464
Customer service number of the people who call in

562
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,304
You know I don't complain or phone lines in my house

563
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Set that it would ring

564
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Right near my bed

565
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
And you were

566
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,704
Like one hand you were like programming the technology the other hand you were

567
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Hang up the phone yeah well this is the beauty of that set up those nearest nice little tiny table and we have 4 phone lines your kind of juggling for phones

568
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Can we take

569
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,408
Customer calls and

570
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,992
Let's hope we get off a call with a customer and we change what we're working on that

571
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
I dated like it I'd probably change what I was programming

572
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,392
I feel like we should be like you go on a few products

573
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
And we do I got customers asking for that she just figure out

574
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Restore additive

575
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Recite those two activities

576
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
Rapidly made this a lot better and it got to where we couldn't juggle

577
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
4 phone lines

578
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
So once you start selling racks and stands

579
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
I do pretty well what's the next

580
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Category

581
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,944
Mounts TV mounts we were surprised at what happened in that timeframe also that

582
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
2002

583
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Timer

584
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Is a two different things

585
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
TV mounts

586
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,696
That we're not widely available so we had a gym and you want to hang some TV mounts like you don't know where else to buy Amazon

587
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,304
The other thing that happened is flat screen TV started running popular

588
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
Yeah and some people want to hang those on the wall

589
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
And so our timing on that was quite good so we

590
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
Tell us huge sales sort of start

591
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
I'm kind of momentum so then we built the site just for that

592
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Have every type you know was it called

593
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Mounts and more

594
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:53,504
Gore.com really matter what you call it right because you would make her at the search engine

595
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
Brilliant branding and high traffic

596
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
Was primarily driven by Baidu search

597
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
If I did the advertising would do

598
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
Paid search than other forms of advertising that we would do so

599
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,632
The key to the name of the site wasn't so much that it was something someone with type in or know what member board

600
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
The picket over other items

601
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
There's more that it made sense as a place you would go for

602
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,568
This item for TV mounts and the and then have that too

603
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
That it's normally while we were the mount Kings of the internet

604
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
God

605
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
In N so then what will connect

606
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,552
Then we I think we started a new beach headed outdoor furniture

607
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
And so we started cycletique wicker and more

608
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Best outdoor furniture

609
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,024
I mean it's so interesting because you didn't have to build a brick and mortar store and you didn't have to

610
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Stata timer

611
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
With a sandwich board

612
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
Say come on 10% off today triarch example if you will just meet you

613
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Put this out on the internet

614
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
You figured out the search

615
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
A search work

616
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
And

617
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,200
People that was the sandwich board

618
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
Taken any outside investment

619
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Anil at that time because

620
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
The revenue from

621
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Each expanding

622
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Website was

623
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Peopling the business

624
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,768
It was this business is cool as fish from that day

625
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
Earlier. It runs a positive cash

626
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
How so you know

627
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
Cuss words with chaos right away and we don't have

628
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Cafe suppliers

629
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
For 30 to 45 days

630
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
And so you had this kind of natural cash cushion

631
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
So yes it was

632
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
It was weird self-funded

633
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Very well

634
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Do you remember

635
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
How much

636
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
But I knew you were doing unilateral bite like

637
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,344
Mm

638
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
Mm

639
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,440
2002 was our first year we did about 700,000

640
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
1 mm

641
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,024
3 was our second year I think we're about to

642
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
7 million

643
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,120
And then the following year 2004 I think we had 20

644
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
I mean you probably

645
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
I could just hire tons of people tons and tons of people fast

646
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah so we started hiring

647
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
As early as January 2003 we heard a couple people then

648
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,968
If I ended that year with you know

649
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
15 people or something like that in the end then

650
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
That became the model to grow is

651
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,672
So you know we wouldn't be reinvesting aggressively by hiring people

652
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
That we could

653
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Expanding the selection and expanding the categories

654
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
Which then give us more things to advertise

655
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,168
Which then would get us more customers you know and then I was a virtuous cycle and we would take

656
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,776
The money that resulted and we would invest that in the growing the team to keep driving it

657
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,896
Pictures of Jessie when people asked you like what are you up to what are you doing these days would you say

658
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,456
I'm selling I'm TV stands

659
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
How would you describe

660
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Never one time I was very

661
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,904
In describing what we're doing it and a lot of Indians in the United States

662
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
Doctors listen to the doctor

663
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
No no no

664
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
So I tok show no I'm not a doctor

665
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Furniture

666
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
Silences

667
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
The conversation

668
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
That's a good way to wrap up the conversation

669
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
So obviously when you were doing it

670
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Wayfair but at this point

671
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Used

672
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
You guys are killing it

673
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,392
CSN stores right

674
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,720
Country we adopted that great name CSN stores

675
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
Did you get a bunch of Consultants to help you figure out that name

676
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,216
We can get it for 12 bucks a year and there is no Trace

677
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
I think you're just came up with it was our initials kind of conglomerate 909 Steve

678
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
It was a generic

679
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,016
We could use across any category you know it helps with to keep

680
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
One is we need a company name

681
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
That you know sort of implied we had a lot of

682
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,768
Tell Brady I didn't want to just named it after one of the names right

683
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,608
The second is a lot of the suppliers very traditional compass

684
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,168
So when we will go to like the High Point Furniture

685
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
And approach

686
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
Suppliers you want to be able to get into a conversation with

687
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,592
And during this time frame 2002-2003 2004

688
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
They're still not very

689
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Keenan e-commerce

690
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,736
They're not they're not dead set against it but their experiences have been poor

691
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,904
And so what happens when your badge to CSN stores and where you're based over in Boston or in Boston over right in Back Bay

692
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,512
We have an office on Newbury Street oh great I'll wait with you guys cuz I know well

693
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,656
Really focus on entertainment Furniture Double D karaoke Carrie Brandt this brand that brand so the brand

694
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
You get into a conversation and

695
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,288
Until what it would it would be interested in what would really

696
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,384
Peter said in the selection we could go do well for these reasons that

697
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,248
And they say oh well you know how big is your store is at that point you'd you'd say you know you'd be honest

698
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
We actually we sell online

699
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,392
And if you had to discuss online too early in the conversation you get kicked out of

700
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
They didn't watch you they don't want to

701
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,560
E shop.com

702
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,936
But now they've got into a 20-minute conversation with you and you sound very rational and you're carrying a bunch of good brands

703
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Recwell

704
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
You know I don't really do much e-commerce business but maybe

705
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Maybe this doesn't make sense

706
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Let's have a little more.

707
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,248
To the generic name helps you get deep enough into a conversation for them to get really

708
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Consider and understand

709
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Which is really important.

710
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
To read some of the websites

711
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
You guys launched

712
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Think they're amazingly

713
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,120
Straightfromthea.com I'm assuming that sold hot

714
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
Yeah

715
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
I'm all barstools.com

716
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:39,360
So why you think that song

717
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Flights

718
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
Every grandfather clock

719
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
A very hot category online

720
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Painful the ship

721
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Who knew people searching for that

722
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,256
We did you can look online

723
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
That was a mean you would find categories and then you would

724
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Basically

725
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
And you

726
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
Started to build a huge business that way

727
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Yeah

728
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
You got. 250 these

729
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
How are you managing

730
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
250 different website

731
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,992
It would be a very good Tech platform that was built around a d if we have

732
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
Centralized product catalog

733
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
And then when calls came in our

734
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
Call system would tell you exactly where the calls coming into seeing you how to answer

735
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
The phone

736
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,488
Did you ever have a situation where somebody call the customer service number

737
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
For a

738
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Orexin

739
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Stannes.com and then said

740
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,144
And then throw thanks you I'm still looking around and then call the car

741
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Customer service number for email

742
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,520
Mouse.com and then gets got the same customer service rep

743
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,128
Oh yeah when I was just your hard work isn't it

744
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
T-Rexes dance.com

745
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
They usually didn't put it together

746
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
It was fun

747
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,344
They just they wouldn't put it together

748
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
By 2000

749
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
210

750
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Can you hit almost

751
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
400 million dollars in sale

752
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,072
You'd almost 5 million test

753
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
And and you like this this aggregation of

754
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
50 website

755
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,264
Like nobody would have known what CSN stores

756
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,848
Necessarily why is no one knew who you guys were I mean people just

757
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
New

00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
All barstools.com or my dinner plate

759
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736

00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
Yeah I crazy to you guys at that

761
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Who's coming in or will you just

762
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Too busy to even stopping

763
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,792
I mean it's like watching your kid grow up a little bit like it's just happening so incrementally and you just following the

764
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Play Buffy

765
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
They've got this working well

766
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
That

767
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,936
You know didn't I don't I mean when you step back from it

768
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Huge

769
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
You trying to do

770
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
To do that too much

771
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Cuz it gets scary

772
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
And how about your you're

773
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Need a relationship

774
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
With a tooth

775
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
The two of you I mean

776
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
It's just you guys are wired

777
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Nnss way where you just

778
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
Control that you get along and you don't

779
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Have any tension I mean it

780
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
It's good

781
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
Crazy that you're still

782
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
After all these years from Lake High School year

783
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Do you work in together

784
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
No we

785
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Cassius interesting

786
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
When we were when we first started working together

787
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Remember having

788
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Argument

789
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,264
He was usually right he was telling me something I needed to hear that

790
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
But I really didn't want to hear it

791
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
And of course my motion

792
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
I remember having to walk out of the room

793
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
I got to go walk around the block

794
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Cursing anime

795
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
My breath out of me

796
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
For half an hour

797
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
We got into this business you know we were a lot more

798
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
Sure as individuals and it been through a lot of that

799
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,464
Had both gained and lost a lot of money together and so I think

800
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,048
You know greed is one of the things I can create a lot of tendon in the heart

801
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Membership I think we gotten

802
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Passed a lot of that

803
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
And we'd also gotten to where we

804
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
Valued each other

805
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Advice edit got

806
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,264
And come to the point where like look I trust will you tell him

807
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
Because he cares in the actual

808
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,360
Is trying to make me better make us better

809
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
As a compass

810
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
Yeah nearest would what do you think

811
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
I I think the

812
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,064
Two key things I think I've always helped this one is that we gravitate to different areas

813
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
The business in the second is

814
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,720
We definitely have always found each other to be very hardworking and very committed to it I think those are

815
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
Not be taken for granted because I do think

816
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
They those traits may not be as common

817
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
As I

818
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
In 2011 I guess

819
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
It was when you

820
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Decided that you

821
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,616
You needed to scale this either

822
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
Bigger and this is the first time you

823
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
Actually took in outside investment

824
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
Why did you allow Venture capitalists get involved in

825
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
Andis company

826
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,416
We're definitely ones who would rather to

827
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,000
Responded ourselves self-funded business and have it funded self

828
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
The challenge became in 2011

829
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
We believe the big opportunity to

830
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,704
Continue the trajectory into really capture the big opportunity we needed to build a brand

831
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,776
And the amount of capital we thought

832
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,592
To go through that migration in to build a brand that it would

833
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Take was not an amount

834
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Cuz you did not have a

835
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,712
CSN was not

836
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Consumers didn't know that brand it wasn't

837
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,672
You want a brand that one you know you think hey I need to shop I want to redo my living room

838
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
You want someone to think I go to waste

839
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
If you wanted to be a top of Mind brand

840
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Category writing that is not

841
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
That's not easy to do

842
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
And even if

843
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
If you figure out how to do it it's not an expense

844
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
By any stretch

845
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
So

846
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
We wanted to be able to do that

847
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
The other

848
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Just my dynamic

849
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
Happiness investors

850
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
It started to change their pitch to being

851
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
Are purely from we want to invest in by part of your company to

852
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064

But will let you got to take some cash off a table

854

As well and you know it at that point in our lives

855
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
What we both got married

856
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Ikea

857
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Be able to take it

858
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
A bit of money

859
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
OpenTable

860
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Department

861
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,424
Those things kind of tied together

862
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
See you had

863
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
250 website

864
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Under

865
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,592
CSN stores

866
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
How did you come up with the idea for wife

867
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
But we knew

868
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,224
Knew we wanted a different name the CSN

869
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,808
Names using first name was difficult for people to remember recall

870
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,160
We've always been relaxing use Consultants but we'd we hired a branding agency

871
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
And they came up with the name Wayfair

872
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Skin a tomato word

873
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
The two word Wednesday are we like

874
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
The Domain name

875
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Available

876
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
It said you were going to go out and spend you know

877
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,520
Millions trying to buy domain names from people

878
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
You can just register it

879
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Be Off to the Races

880
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
So it took about a year for all these

881
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Consolidate

882
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
To the consumer Wayfair seems like a

883
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Rams new thing right

884
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
It did ya

885
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,672
Yeah it just kind of came out of nowhere and people are kind of like

886
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Place to shop for home

887
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
It and it's

888
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
The fact that you guys got into HomeGoods

889
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
It had to do with me with

890
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
What type of people were

891
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Searching for the

892
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
You could have

893
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Ends up being a company

894
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
It sold like personal grooming Prada

895
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
That's right

896
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
The one thing I would say

897
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
You know home the beauty of home

898
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Most categories

899
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
People Want it All by the same thing as you

900
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Write 17

901
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,392
Double a batteries by Duracell or Energizer the private label

902
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
There's only a couple categories were a huge selection

903
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Is really

904
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Puppies were Visual and

905
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,144
Anesthetic considerations are very Paramount where people want unique items

906
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
And the two are really fashion and home

907
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
And we

908
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
Basically by focusing on home

909
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
With the logistics are quite complicated in different

910
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Where there are no brands

911
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
Where the visual merchandising is critical where people have a very unique Style

912
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
There's a lot

913
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
Value can added

914
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Retailer

915
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
If you're in any of these other category

916
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
Certainly there's a big business there

917
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,488
But that's effectively the business that the Walmarts in the Amazons in the target

918
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Costco's

919
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
They're all in that business

920
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
Selling the same exact items

921
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
And

922
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
You can

923
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,496
Fight that out and try to find an advantage but typically the advantages either in price

924
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Speed is really no other way to do it

925
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
And the beauty and home

926
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Is that it's it's more multi

927
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
The faceted and it doesn't

928
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
What if someone

929
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
A winner in the other categories it doesn't automatically make you a winner at home

930
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:22,464
Your public company you are listed on the stock exchange right

931
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
And the company

932
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
I believe is today is valued

933
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
3

934
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
Billion

935
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
Billion dollars

936
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
But you guys

937
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
I I've read that you're still not

938
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Strand of weed

939
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,592
Profit does that Maxine matter

940
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
The time being

941
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,712
Well obviously a company needs to be able to generate cash

942
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Gdb run out of cash

943
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
She got a business

944
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
So that's really important

945
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,368
I think what folks confuse is

946
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,184
A company that's willing to reinvest in smart ways

947
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
With one who fundamentally has

948
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Business model problem

949
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
And it's not going to be a

950
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Successful

951
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
In our case the United States

952
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
It has been profitable

953
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
You know if you look read our financials we break out the adjusted ebitda International

954
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Yeah

955
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,872
The u.s. is 90% of our business and that's been profitable for the last 5 quarters

956
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
And if you look at that you'll then see while International losing money while International is much smaller we're certainly investing a lot of money

957
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
I need to build that up and rectangle be

958
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,368
Very big and successful

959
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
But we're very fortunate position

960
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,232
If you have we have 600 million dollars in the bank

961
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
We have the ability to invest in these very ambitious

962
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Things that help customers

963
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,656
I think in that case you're actually better off being an aggressive investor in

964
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,008
To the experience and making experience better and better cuz you learn more loyalty and more custom

965
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
Could you imagine obviously

966
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Pussycats

967
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
Pretty younger in the mid-forties

968
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:49,760
Is there other things you could do conceivably do for life

969
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Could you imagine an Amazon or Walmart

970
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
You know coming to you and saying hey

971
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
Guys who want to buy them

972
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
We're going to get you

973
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
X billion dollars

974
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Did you ever imagine

975
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Accepting that are green today

976
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
You need to be proven right so

977
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
You mean all those folks you've course

978
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,408
Have conversations with anyone who wants our conversation last year when we did 4.7 billion in sales

979
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
We grew 40%

980
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,832
Your private well so if you take a number like 4.7 billion dollars in sales to grow it at something

981
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Decent sized growth rate some high growth rate

982
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
Are the companies getting bigger at a fast rate

983
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
And if you believe you can do a lot for the customer that is more than anyone else can do will why wouldn't a container grow too fast

984
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:39,680
That's really super early days if in fact we can be the best

985
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,008
So it would be very premature to think about selling it

986
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,056
If we think we can win

987
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,616
How much of

988
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Success of

989
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Your partnership

990
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
End end

991
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
The businesses you built

992
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,808
Is because of your intelligence and your skills and how much should be

993
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Just locking serendipity

00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696

995

Look to the office daily

997
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,424
You know it's obviously a bit about I don't I don't know that there are dramatic

998
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,216
Intellectual skill differences

999
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Inhumans

1000
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,056
General Tso I think it tends to be you know your ability to

1001
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
Focus and keep doubling down on your own

1002
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,176
Believing in yourself and your work ethic and in

1003
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,992
16 to focus on an errand of set of things

1004
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
You can win

1005
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
And weave

1006
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
Been good at 10

1007

Dating

1008
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Focused on that

1009
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
And not listening to

1010
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Tell other people that try to go try and do other things

1011
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,120
Serendipity and luck but we play a little bit of a roll right so I think that definitely is a PC you think about it we

1012
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,680
Happened to be in college at the last Metro

1013
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,032
College rapping to be the beginning of the commercial internet commercial internet has created a huge amount of

1014
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,872
Well it was a different point in time where there been no opportunity no

1015
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
But that would be opportunity

1016
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,039
Would it be as big maybe maybe not would have been different possibly would have been as well suited to us I don't know you know

1017
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
Fighting is a mix in there

1018
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
And I think

1019
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,487
I do think a lot of it is is how hard you go after something and how pragmatic

1020
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
With all this

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1058
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Understory

1059
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,015
Starts in 2009 when carin luna ostaseski

1060
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
Was working in marketing

1061
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,671
New York City after work one day a friend asked me if I wanted to grab a glass of scotch

1062
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
And I said no I don't drink Scotch that's

1063
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
That's my grandfather

1064
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,095
But the friend took her to one of those places that

1065
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Specializes

1066
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
In Scotch and that night I tried four different brands and I instantly fell in love with a brand called Oban 14

1067
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
And I loved

1068
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,639
The beauty of the nuances and the complexities of the spirit

1069
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:39,039
Until almost instantly Karen became a scotch Drinker she started reading about it and then

1070
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,623
I'm collecting it and then eventually evangelizing about it

1071
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:48,511
I became that friend Tina that was always trying to convince everyone else so you should try Scott's and everyone always said the same thing

1072
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:55,167
You know it burns my nostrils it tastes like gasoline it's too expensive Joker in begin

1073
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,239
I already have all this amazing scotch in my

1074
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
Personal Collection

1075
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Maybe I could just

1076
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Blend my own

1077
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,407
One is designed specifically to change the way that you think about Scott

1078
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
Very smooth approachable

1079
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,295
I have a lot of vanilla and caramel and citrus and just a little bit of smoke

1080
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
So starting out

1081
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
In her kitchen I would take two brands that I thought would go well together and I'd take a measuring cup and 3 glass

1082
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
Isis and Eric put

1083
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
When that was measured 50/50 another 25 75 and the other 75 25 and then I have to renew blends

1084
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:33,055
And I did this quite a lot and I came up with some really bad not so great tasting Blends like even to summon know that just

1085
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Dump it before even tasting it

1086
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
But eventually after about six months of experimenting Korean came up with the blind you really liked

1087
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,391
At this point she was living in San Francisco and she started to call and emailed dozens of Master blenders
