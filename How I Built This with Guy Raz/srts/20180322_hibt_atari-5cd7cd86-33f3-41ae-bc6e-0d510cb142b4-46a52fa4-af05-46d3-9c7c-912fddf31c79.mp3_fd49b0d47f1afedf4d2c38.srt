Free Tuff story to squeeze into a single

It's really

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
Two stories to Amazing Stories

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
And we didn't want to cut anything out so

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Week

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,120
He didn't and we let it go a little longer than usual

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Which I think

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
You will enjoy

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
We started out essentially designing this loaf game 4

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
Working things out of wood and painted soda look like plastic that was really would

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:01:00,672
Our idea was to take it to the Toy Show in New York

22
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
Amazing world we sold 0

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Ramen

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
It's how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist stories behind them

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Gyros

26
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Hello in Bushnell took his love arcade game

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,256
Shape the childhood of millions of Americans

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
If you grew up in the US in the 1980s

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
Then you were probably playing a little bit of

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Best when your birthday rolled around

31
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Maybe you celebrated you know

32
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Like this

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,232
Very iconic sound Chuck E cheese the pizza joint with

34
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
The games that

35
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,792
You distracted for hours

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
And an Atari video game which could

37
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Frankly distract you for a lot longer

38
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
These bread

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
Incredible

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Is it both of these childhood experiences

41
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Who created by the same

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
Persaman scene guy by Nolan Bushnell

43
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
He found it at re Justice

44
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,040
Few years out of college and he started Chuck-E-Cheese just a few years after that

45
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Inferno 1

46
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Began when he was

47
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
The kid in Utah in the 1950s

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
A very simple lesson about business

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
The dinner one night Mom said boy we've got so many strawberries

50
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
We're not going to be able to eat them

51
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Maybe we will give them away

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
I didn't think that much about it the next day I happened to go to the

53
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Grocery store

54
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
And I saw that in the store in the grocery store

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
They were selling strawberries

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
50 Cent

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
The basket

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
I looked at

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
I said

60
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
That's what the market

61
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
So

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Went home

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Found all the

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
Xtrill basket

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Were around

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Went out picked a bunch

67
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
Strawberries and went up and down

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Selling

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
The strawberries

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
For Discount offer

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
What the

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Grocery store

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
And I sold

74
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
An hour I mean I don't even think I made it all the way to the end of the block

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
And all of a sudden I had more money

76
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
Then I would make an allowance

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
And mowing lawns 4-year nice

78
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Young entrepreneur

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
And I read that like later on when you were in college

80
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
You worked at

81
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
That's correct

82
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
I started out

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Actually on the Midway

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
Selling balls to knock down Milk Milk Bar

85
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Man guessing

86
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
People's ages weights

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Pandora

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
And jumping Kearney

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
Like like shouting at people like come on down

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
You got it then

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
And

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
I found out that I was kind of

93
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Kind of good at it

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
How do you get into arcade games at start

95
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
The carnival

96
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Yes

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
That was sort of

98
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
Where I

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Got it.

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Because you end up

101
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
What people don't realize how much

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Coin-operated

103
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
It's actually quite surprising

104
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
And so

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
When you look at

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
Each of the coin operated games

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
It's a little bit

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
Typically you go into the

109
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
Joe's Cafe and say can I put my machine in your location

110
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Then I'll split the income

111
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
These location

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
This would very often do 100 to 200.

113
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
Hours a week at that time

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
Pinball machines there were mechanical games

115
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
But yeah no video games

116
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,287
Then I was working

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
Summers at the amusement park Winters

118
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Pursuing an engineering degree

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
At the University

120
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
And wow

121
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
One day I saw

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Steve Russell spacewar

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
What's that

124
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
A guy named Steve Russell at

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Am I

126
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Program to this game called

127
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Space War

128
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
And

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
I was mesmerized

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
More context

131
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
My brother says I got to show you something that will knock

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Pieces

133
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,591
Meet me at 1 at the Merrill engineering

134
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
It's 1 in the afternoon on the snow

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,319
Show up during building

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
And there was space worm he handed me a box that had four buttons on the top

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:56,863
Rotate left rotate right fire and hyperspace

138
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Those were the controls

139
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
And we played

140
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Until literally

141
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
5 more

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
And I thought

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Wow

144
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
If I could put this game in my arcade

145
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
It would make money

146
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
But then you divide a $0.25

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Play into a

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Half a million-dollar

149
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
Computer in the math.

150
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
But I did think to myself maybe someday

151
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
The cost will come down

152
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
And this would be cool

153
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
So you graduate college I get some

154
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Like the late 60s

155
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
68-69

156
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,727
And and what did you do did you you're in Utah did you start a business or did you decide to

157
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
Where did you go

158
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
My wife's sister lived in Silicon Valley

159
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
And

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
I was a little bit of an anarchist

161
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
At that time

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Call Mia

163
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Lapsed Mormon or failed Mormon or whatever

164
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,439
And I kind of wanted to get out of Utah and see the world

165
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
And so California seems like

166
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Cool place to

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Go

168
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
So

169
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
That Thanksgiving we drove to California stayed with

170
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
My wife's sister

171
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
And I paper the street with Swiss my resume

172
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
And got a job at Ampex

173
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Nmx was a

174
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
Teeth whitening

175
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Electrical

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
They invented the video tape machine

177
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
And instant replay

178
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
I worked there for 2 years

179
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
But about

180
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
18 months in

181
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
I discovered

182
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Aiken

183
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Computer that looked like it was fast

184
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
To do a video

185
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
So you're thinking

186
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Let me start something

187
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,447
It started out a little bit as a research project and then I said yeah

188
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,311
I'm going to start something and in fact it was almost prescient that when I was

189
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
Driving down the Sierras towards Silicon Valley I told my wife I said you know in 2 years I'm going

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Start my own company

191
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
I just knew that was kind of on my trajectory I didn't know if that time

192
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
It's going to be a video game

193
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
I just thought I'd do it you know and in the back of my mind and I always kind of had this entrepreneurial

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
I think I've always had it since 8

195
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Hardest computer company dislike game company

196
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
My office mate was a guy named Ted Dabney this was an Ampex and I said I'm just started company

197
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
Formal partnership we had this computer and the computer was

198
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
Mind-numbingly slow and

199
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
In order to make the economics work the computer cost like 5,000 operator games at the time

200
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
I needed to be less than $1,500 so the way I was going to do it as I was going to die

201
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Timeshare

202
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,799
That one computer across three

203
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,383
Screams with three coin slots when I felt that I could get

204
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
$1,500 that way you were trying to design basically what would become an arcade machine like

205
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
A giant machine would be installed somewhere

206
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
People put in a quarter and they could play a game

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,095
Map of space war and where did you install this Arcadian where was it

208
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
We put it in a bar

209
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
Call the Dutch Goose it was in Menlo Park it was right next to Stanford University

210
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
The game was a Smash Hit at the Dutch Goose I license the game to a company

211
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Call nutty Associates

212
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
And

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Realize that it did really well on college campuses so

214
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
I mean it sold a couple of million dollars in

215
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Units

216
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Which was

217
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Tumi

218
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
A big hit

219
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
But to the industry was kind of a mediocre

220
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
QWOP

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
But

222
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,679
I had a 5% royalty and so that was a

223
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
You know

224
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
$100,000

225
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Massman

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Put this in context

227
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,151
I came to work at Ampex for $825 a month is

228
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Associate engineer

229
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
How did you fund

230
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
The company from the beginning what did you have to go to outside mess

231
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Asking for money

232
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
No

233
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
This was also

234
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
At the time when venture capital

235
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Was just getting started

236
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
And so

237
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
Ted put in $250 I put in $250

238
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
And that's all the money that went in

239
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Wow 500 bucks

240
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Start Atari

241
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
I'm in your first game was

242
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Was a flop so how did you guys

243
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
How'd you guys go on to

244
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
To do the next thing

245
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Well

246
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Then came

247
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Alicorn which was our

248
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
First

249
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Technical employee

250
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
Cuz we were growing and we needed

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Port Allen

252
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
And I gave him a

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Simplest game

254
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
I could think of

255
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Which was a ping pong table

256
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
When you think you're going to be in the video coin-operated video game

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
You write down every sport you can think of every constructs

258
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
In ping pong was one of them

259
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
And he went off

260
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
And he basically had

261
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
I think working at

262
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
More two weeks

263
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
It was

264
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Really

265
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Quick

266
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
And we are talking about what of course became pong

267
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
Which was just like two lines with a ball bouncing around a screen between those lives

268
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Correct

269
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
And

270
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
It turned out

271
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
I thought it was going to be a throwaway

272
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Yeah there was just a training

273
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
And it just

274
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Turned out to be

275
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Fun we were staying

276
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
After work.

277
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Play the damn game

278
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
And then I get the idea

279
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Maybe Valley wants this game

280
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
Ballyhoo who's also a big coin operated

281
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Player

282
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Out of Chicago

283
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,599
Getting the airplane fly to Chicago I have a little more cups that I can

284
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Affordable yet

285
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
And I show it to them

286
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
And they don't like it

287
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
It's a two player game

288
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
And coin-operated world

289
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Doesn't allow

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
For two player game if there's not a one player

291
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
At that time

292
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
That was sort of

293
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
Written in stone somewhere

294
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Worlds

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Kind of dejected

296
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,039
On my way to get on the airplane to come back California

297
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
I get a call from you

298
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Who is the engine

299
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
And they had a service call

300
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
Cuz they had put a basic pong game in a cabinet

301
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
And put it in a bar

302
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
And the game

303
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Became so popular that it filled up

304
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
The coin box lid couldn't take any more quarters

305
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
So I think myself

306
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Maybe I don't want Valley to have them

307
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
Because the math were so outstanding

308
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
Little Machines could literally pay for themselves

309
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
I mean the game was earning

310
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Almost $300 a week

311
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Wow

312
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
And the total cost

313
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
That we had

314
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Was about to

315
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,631
So you're thinking maybe we should just message me the machines and lens licensing Marcel

316
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Exact

317
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
So is that what you did

318
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
So that's exactly what

319
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Did I looked at all the cash we had

320
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
And we have enough cash to build

321
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Like 12 units

322
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
You know the minute I got off the airplane

323
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Submitted the

324
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,479
The order for the parts

325
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
And we were off to the race

326
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
I get on the phone

327
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
I have

328
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
Literally orders coming in

329
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
All over the nation

330
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,279
Of course I'm a week we think about pain today and it's 2

331
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Basic

332
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Yeah rudimentary

333
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,423
Revolutionary

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Absolutely

335
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Put it in context

336
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
People would come to me and say

337
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,383
How does the TV station know that I turn the knob

338
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Nn

339
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Clearly they're construct was it if there's something on the TV screen that came from Studio someone

340
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
And so that was kind of the

341
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Constructs

342
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
We were dealing with

343
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
But

344
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
There's actually some very

345
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Interesting psychology

346
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Get back on it

347
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,983
And one of the reasons that I think Pawn

348
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
With such a massive success

349
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Is the

350
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Fed into the narrative

351
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Of what was going on

352
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Time

353
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
You know just after the summer of love the hippie movement

354
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Women's Liberation was

355
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Restarting to rear its head

356
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
And

357
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
Pain by its structure

358
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Made it

359
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
Ladies choice

360
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Because it

361
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,119
Team very acceptable for a woman to

362
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Tampa guy

363
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Sitting at the bar

364
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
On the shoulder and say I want to play Pong would you like to play All by

365
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,407
Who knew Palms ruffle in the history of women's Liberation exactly

366
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,247
Nolan worth more companies just calling you or

367
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
Calling you said we wanted machine

368
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
That was

369
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
And so

370
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
Our big problem then is we have no Factory we had no systems we had no procedures we have no employees

371
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
I mean we had there were four of us

372
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
And you guys are all in your like mid-to-late twenties

373
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,335
And in fact I think was 23 he just he just graduated from Berkeley

374
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,455
And we had a thousand square foot roll up which we thought was huge for the six

375
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
This is in what town is it

376
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,135
This was in Santa Clara California then we found out that we had a real problem

377
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
We could build these games literally into days like literally my hand with lutein nada.

378
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
But we had neglected to buy shipping cartons

379
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,799
We couldn't ship them on cam carrier

380
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
And so to solve that problem we bought an old furniture truck and started making

381
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,271
Deliveries without cartons to Los Angeles

382
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
But usually driving down the 101 or something

383
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Yeah but

384
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
Slowly we were able to get procedures in place we were able to

385
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Get systems

386
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
And how we Finance

387
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
The company was we would sell for cash

388
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
The machine

389
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
We had 30 day terms

390
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
Most of our parts we had 68 terms so we can get the cash

391
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Literally 60 days before we had to pay for the parts

392
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
You how many of these

393
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Arcade

394
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Machines

395
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
450

396
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Mm

397
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Only if which

398
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Atari only did about 35000

399
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
We got

400
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Massively copy

401
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,839
But you couldn't you couldn't prevent these companies from basically stealing your idea and copying you

402
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
I didn't have patents yet it was on those days pants were just

403
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Swoboda

404
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
China

405
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
So there was no so basically you could do nothing

406
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Nothing

407
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
And copy

408
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
We knew we didn't have sufficient to manufacture

409
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
We knew we didn't have as much money

410
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
We knew we didn't have as good a relationship

411
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
With the distributor chain

412
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
That the competitors that have been dealing with them

413
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
For 20 years

414
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
And so

415
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
I felt

416
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
My only tool

417
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Was innovation

418
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
An understanding of the technology cuz

419
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Copying the technology Allen and creating the tick

420
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Different

421
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
So you were still not really proper

422
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Just kind of breaking even

423
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Cash was always our limitation

424
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
And I tried to get

425
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
No investors but everybody thought

426
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
What kind of flaky

427
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Who's going to pay for this thing

428
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
Exactly how did you

429
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Even come up with the idea that maybe

430
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
We should sell this.

431
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
People and they could do it at home

432
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
One day we figured out

433
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Is there was a new semiconductor

434
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Technology called in Channel MOS and

435
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,543
These chips once they were designed you could buy him for five bucks

436
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
It occurred to us that we could put pong on a sink

437
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Blue Chip

438
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
And hit a price point that would

439
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Sell to the consumer

440
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
And how did you even begin to think of

441
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
Ways to discuss what you're talking about

442
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Like

443
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Building a cabinet for a

444
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
A giant

445
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,815
Jade system like how do you shrink that down into something else

446
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Well once you had it on a single chip

447
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
Then it was just a matter of putting two knobs on a piece of

448
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Plastic

449
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,591
We started out essentially designing this loaf

450
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
Game looking thing

451
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Atwood

452
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,015
The painting it's a little look like plastic but it was really would

453
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,903
Our idea was to take it to the Toy Show in New York

454
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,791
Disappointed to a convention in like but 7475

455
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
And you show where people like this is amazing world

456
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
0

457
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
And it was a great demo and everything

458
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
But we didn't know

459
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
Is it the toy business at that point in time

460
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
Did not sell anything

461
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
That was more than 35.

462
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
And how much were you

463
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
You selling this

464
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Atari console

465
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
70

466
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Which in 1935

467
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
It was a lot

468
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
And so we thought

469
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Spent all this money to get

470
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Think developed

471
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Our neighbors wanted

472
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
And they were happy to

473
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
Spend 70

474
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Did you leave that Toy Show feeling

475
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Dejectedly

476
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,151
Who's abject failure must have been pretty

477
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
Depressed Sceptre Pinellas money this thing

478
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,015
You don't

479
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
I'm not easily depressed

480
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
But I'm very easily challenge

481
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
And I said you know

482
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
There's something not right here

483
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
We just haven't found the right guy

484
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
What do you mean you haven't found

485
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
The right distribution Channel

486
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,679
So basically you're thinking these guys are wrong I know this is going to work at exactly

487
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Exactly like I said these guys

488
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
Search for missing a wonderful opportunity

489
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
And so we were thinking

490
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
RadioShack of sinking

491
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
TV dealerships

492
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
I was thinking all kinds of stuff

493
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
And then

494
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
My head of sales

495
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Thought about

496
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Sears

497
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Sporting Goods

498
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
And

499
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
The previous year

500
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,791
Sears Sporting Goods really focuses on

501
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
The inclement weather family room

502
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
And they sell pool tables

503
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
And ping pong tables

504
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Things like that

505
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
The year before they had

506
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Made

507
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
The consumer

508
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Pinball machine

509
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
For $200

510
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
And they sold out

511
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
So

512
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
My sales guy said maybe these guy

513
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,367
Kaiser so he calls up the buyer at Sears for

514
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
It's a song that's kind of interesting

515
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
The next day

516
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
He was honored

517
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
And they were based in Chicago at the time

518
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
They were based in

519
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
Chicago Sears buyer comes to

520
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Find out

521
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
Comes and says I want to see what

522
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Your

523
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Exactly

524
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,591
And that we actually had to scramble cuz we didn't realize he was coming he didn't say am showing up

525
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
They just showed up

526
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,479
And so we were in the conference room after that he says okay I think we're going to

527
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
Do that how many can you build

528
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
We didn't have a

529
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
Because we were

530
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
We're building coin-operated games

531
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
Where a big run with 5000

532
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
We kind of do a little mice

533
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
And so we did a huddle outside

534
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
I had my

535
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
It's so not wanting to be sole source

536
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
I said we can do about 7

537
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:42,528
You go back to the Sears guy and say we could do 75000 after your own guy tells you

538
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
225

539
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:48,672
Okay yeah

540
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Okay

541
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
He give us an order 450

542
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
And

543
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
He want some delivery by Christmas fight you know october-november got basically 6 months to

544
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
How to build a factory

545
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
Train the personnel

546
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
To sort out the technology

547
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,968
None of which we done before so is anybody in Atari freaking out at this point

548
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Everybody has

549
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
Ellen Bushnell founder of Atari when we come back

550
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
After the Freak Out

551
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:28,608
The real work begins plus a side hustle that track together pizza games Penndel

552

Hey welcome back to how I built this from

572
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
NPR guy Raz

573
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:56,416
It's 1975 Nolan and his Partners have gotten a huge order from Sears to make a

574
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
Consumer version of Pawn

575
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,024
Incident need to figure out how to build a manufacturing chain

576
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Virtually

577
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Overnight

578
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
We sit down

579
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,936
And we say okay if we were to build a hundred fifty

580
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
How would we do it

581
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
And then

582
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
The big question

583
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,384
How much money are we going to make

584
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,712
After we spend all this money on Factory and we realize

585
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
It's how I call it

586
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,112
The series Bayern say I ate do this to you

587
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm going to

588
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,440
The price what was the price that he wanted

589
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
We were quoting

590
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,144
The retail price of 59 and we decided that we needed an extra twenty bucks per year

591
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
And he said

592
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
That's okay I can do that

593
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,800
Then I went through the math and there was no way

594
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
That I hadn't

595
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
Put in the conveyor belts to rent the ex

596
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Sorry

597
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
Buy the parts and I calling them play Skillet

598
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,368
I really appreciate the order but I said I can't find this this is so don't worry

599
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
Only reduce you to seers bank

600
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
And so Sears Bank set up a Bonded Warehouse at the end of the conveyor line

601
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
So as soon as

602
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,192
Babe consumer pong dropped off the assembly line they would Advance us

603
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,288
80% of the contract price with Siri

604
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,664
Maybe Atari console that your building only play pain

605
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,040
And did you get it to them in time under 50000 consoles by Christmas

606
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
We did

607
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:33,184
In fact I think that year we sold almost a hundred eighty thousand they took them all

608
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Wow

609
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
I mean at this point

610
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Youku

611
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
I guess you guys aren't Benfica home

612
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
Computer game

613
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Exactly

614
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
And then how did you go from

615
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Making one console to play one game to 8

616
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
AKA balika home video game system

617
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,944
Well we realized at that time

618
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
When we were doing the

619
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
One game $70

620
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
That this was an unsustainable

621
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Business

622
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
An end

623
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Then

624
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
Magical thing app

625
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,120
A Semiconductor Company in Silicon Valley

626
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
We came up with the

627
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Microprocessor

628
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
They were willing to sell a spray dollars and all of a sudden your eyes were opened

629
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
And we said

630
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
We can do

631
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
Vaughn women are

632
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:30,528
Picture program based put cartridges with ROMs in it

633
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
And we can have a program

634
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:38,208
That microchip allowed you guys to basic create a cartridge system that week

635
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
What's the steam turn out right exactly

636
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,328
You know it was just a magic

637
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
Time for technology

638
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Silicon Valley

639
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Time

640
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,336
You were as likely to learn about a new technology standing on the sidelines

641
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Of your kids little league team

642
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
As you were

643
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
At any other time

644
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
In several times

645
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,576
I'd be talking about a technical problem we were having with

646
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
One of the other parents

647
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Oh yeah

648
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
We had ship like that in

649
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
Development

650
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,304
Would you like a prototype it's not going to be really on the market for 6

651
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
6 months and I take

652
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah we we don't need production quantities for 6

653
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
You're not going to get that if you're

654
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
A technology

655
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
Company in in Oshkosh

656
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Where I mean were there many companies

657
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
In Silicon Valley the time that we're focusing on

658
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Entertainment

659
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
I can't think of another one

660
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
We kind of always felt like we were the sleazy

661
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Company who

662
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,672
Focusing on fun instead of all this

663
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
How many more

664
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,328
Megabytes on a hard drive and it would help the serious companies were they

665
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
The devil they look down on you

666
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
We like

667
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
AR

668
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
Rebel status

669
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
And we were Rebel in several ways first of all we were all young

670
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
I was the youngest CEO in

671
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
People didn't know

672
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,552
What to think about a CEO in their twenties then we that was just off the radar

673
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,440
And I actually feel like I paved the way for Gates and jobs and some of the

674
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,280
Idea that you can be young and still a serious businessman

675
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,840
We

676
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
Got known as a real party culture because instead of bonuses since all our employees

677
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Word in the early twenties

678
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
We'd have a beer bust on the back dock

679
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
And you get anal

680
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
$100 for the pizza into kegs and you had a party and that was totally under

681
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:44,416
And of course we have a game room we have ping pong tables stuff that Silicon Valley kind of thinks is

682
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:51,072
Do you record and necessary now yeah it was very very different and then

683
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
Have a dress code and we didn't have time clocks we had this attitude that everybody

684
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,544
What they needed to do and

685
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,944
They were adults they could wear what they want and they could come and go when they want and we weren't Big Brother

686
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,784
And so we try to make this meritocracy

687
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,320
In which outcome

688
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
Was the only thing we counted

689
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
Is a young CEO

690
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
I think you did a good job where you

691
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
You know where you

692
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,816
Are you a good manager of people at the time

693
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
So so

694
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,704
I think I was a good manager of people I think that

695
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,032
I always had a little bit of an inferiority

696
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Plex in that

697
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Because of my age

698
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
I felt a little bit like a

699
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Poser

700
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,784
Which was okay with me on some level because of my Carnival background

701
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
But at the same time

702
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
I always felt

703
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
That I didn't know what the hell I was doing

704
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:54,048
And what I didn't realize has the most big companies don't know what the hell do you mean

705
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,656
I wasn't mature enough to understand that all companies are somewhat screwed up

706
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
Unnu clearly he like had an eye for you clearly had an eye for hiring instant people mean

707
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
And I think anyone knows a little of the story

708
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak

709
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Work for you

710
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
Steve Jobs work for me and

711
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
He was a technician

712
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
In quality control

713
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
He was really good at

714
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
I can remember him coming insane

715
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,744
Only if you allow these kinds of solder joints you're going to have

716
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Failures in the field

717
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Did you already tell like that

718
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Yeah we think of him as a sort Mercurial kind of

719
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,520
Impetuous leader was he like that even as a

720
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
20-something kid

721
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
He was opinionated but he was never wrong

722
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
In his opinion

723
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,504
You didn't have to worry if you empowered Steve

724
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Do something

725
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
It happen

726
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
I mean Steve had one speed

727
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
It was

728
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Full on

729
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
And so

730
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,536
He got the the Apple going and he came to me and says I want to start this company

731
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
And I'm going to be leaving

732
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,424
Do you want to be my first investor and I'll give you a third as a company

733
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
For $50,000 and you said of course

734
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Yeah I did not say that

735
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,384
I've regretted it but you know anyway

736
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
It was fun times

737
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Exotic matter

738
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Definition of matter

739
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,064
It would have ruined my life would have made you

740
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Totally insufferable

741
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
Yeah and I was already insufferable

742
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,488
So thank goodness you did not take that deal

743
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,816
Exactly so all right so you're running Atari

744
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Doing really well

745
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
And then what do you decide to sell it like

746
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
I guess right

747
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,544
So I felt that we had to take the company public trays

748
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
15 million dollars

749
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
Racines pulp right now but that was all the money in the world to us

750
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Time

751
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
And

752
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,624
The market Hiccup and they said there's just no way we're going to do it and I love 70's right

753
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,952
This was the summer summer of 76

754
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,840
And all the sudden we had Christmas coming and I knew I didn't have enough money

755
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
Even with Sears to be able to get this

756
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
New

757
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Massive

758
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Wonderful

759
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
Product into

760
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
The marketplace

761
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
This is that the Atari console with the

762
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
What cartridges right

763
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Yes that's correct

764
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
So without

765
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Inability to

766
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
Do that I said maybe it's time to get a corporate partner and so I started.

767
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
Driving for dollars from corporate partner Warner Communications showed up and said will not

768
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
Finally put up the money but we'd like to buy you and will pay you money and will put money into the

769
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:45,056
Company and you will get this big royalty stream and we understand creatives

770
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:51,456
We're going to link arms March into the sunset how much are they offering you 28 million

771
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,856
Which is why I was born boy from Utah

772
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:04,256
Music by a Learjet in those days for a million dollars

773
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Took the money

774
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,448
And so what happened so so you continue to work for Atari at that point

775
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,800
That's a lie was not as rigorous

776
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
As I got

777
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,176
I started started taking care of my personal life

778
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Instead of my business life

779
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,576
And I found that the word a lot of decisions that were being made that were really

780
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
Really pretty toxic

781
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
Decisions about where to take the company

782
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Yeah and slowly we

783
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Brought in a president of consumer

784
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,400
Who had all the hierarchy

785
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
No Reserve

786
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Taxi places

787
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Executive dining rooms and all the things

788
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
That were anathema to me

789
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,712
Yeah you're going from keg parties on your loading dock to an executive dining room

790
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
Yeah and I just thought that was so

791
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
Wrong on so many levels

792
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,232
I don't think you need that arbitrarily create an us-versus-them mentality in your company

793
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
You know and one of the things that happens when your own by New York company

794
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
They think that you're laid back Style

795
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
Is that you're not working so hard and they think the people that come in at 10 should be fired

796
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
And so the bottom of a sudden there was this Clash of cultures that got to be really ugly and old

797
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,832
They they got tired of me and I got tired of them and

798
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Ike was fired wow how long does it take between time they bite you in the time that you were ousted how long was it

799
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
About 20 months

800
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Wow that must have been a tough. For you

801
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Actually not

802
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
I kind of you business

803
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
Little bit like the game of chess you play the game you play hard sometimes you win some

804
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
Can you set up the pieces and you blew it again and you don't have eggs oh my God

805
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,744
Watch the game of chess what am I going to do what was me and what that allows you to do

806
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Is to view a little bit of sand outside or from yourself things that happened to you

807
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,240
So when something doesn't work out that well you can say G that was

808
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
Horrible but it was an interesting experience

809
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Okay let me just stop you're beside because

810
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,480
This episode and here I would say okay that's Nolan Bushnell Visionary 5 of the tari

811
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
We are now

812
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,088
The second company you founded which is Chuck-E-Cheese

813
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,696
How did that happen how did how do you even come up with this concept

814
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Well the math

815
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
Is very simple

816
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Before I sold Warner

817
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
We were selling games these are coin-operated

818
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,936
We were selling them for about 1500.

819
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
During your life

820
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
I'm in coin drop

821
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Play turn 30

822
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
50000

823
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
So it didn't take rocket science

824
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
How to say I'm on the wrong side

825
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
I need to be

826
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
The operating

827
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
He seems to have been

828
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,600
But I didn't want to compete with the guys I was selling to

829
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,672
So I decided I had to create my own location

830
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
I thought to myself

831
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,792
When people going to come to this freestanding arcade

832
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
And I decided that

833
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Adding food would be

834
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
A benefit B

835
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Because in families could come

836
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
And that

837
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,032
Indicated pizza because there was wait time

838
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
And that would be good gameplay

839
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,408
When we was still mulling this whole concept

840
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Ground

841
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
I went to Disneyland and went to the tiki room

842
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Oh yeah and I said

843
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
Do this my guys can make these little

844
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
Creatures

845
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Then I

846
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
Realized that I really

847
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Wanted to have

848
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
The Branded mascot

849
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
And that I wanted it

850
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
B

851
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
The longer-form entertainment

852
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
I figured

853
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:03,104
Kids are going to be wanting to play the games parents are going to be bored the more I can entertain them unless they're getting you

854
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Buggy the kids to leave so I said let's do some animated skits

855
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,392
The whole idea was to roll this out make it seamless not have labor costs just make it happen

856
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
So anyway I went to a amusement tradeshow bought a costume

857
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:28,192
Look up costume that they live like a human. Your guys are just

858
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
Turn into an animated robot exactly the famous Chuck-E-Cheese

859
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:40,992
Was a rat's right what restaurant is going to pick a rat as their mascot and think that's going to work

860
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:47,392
Will understand when I bought the costume I thought I was buying a Coyote Ugly

861
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,792
The code the code name was coyote Pizza in my guys I said how's the coyote coming in

862
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
What kind of costume I sent you

863
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
Oh you mean the rap so all of a sudden we had a problem so I said okay

864
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,920
Will be coyote pizza anymore it's going to be you regrets Pizza Rick rats Pizza that was going to be

865
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
Who was going to eat pizza place called Rick rats pizza that's exactly what

866
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,720
They said there's no way for snow that's the stupidest idea

867
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:29,120
They said we couldn't even know they'd be on the garden we wouldn't get our help license

868
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
And I said okay you name it I don't care but it has to be a happy name right and so they came back also

869
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
The next week they said we've got the name it's a three smile name

870
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Chuck-E-Cheese

871
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,600
So hot so what happened you you opened up your first location in Silicon Valley

872
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,672
Yeah it was it was basically in San Jose

873
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
We took over

874
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
A old Dean Witter office and it was like

875
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
5000 squared

876
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
That was huge

877
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Compared to Pizza

878
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
We knew the day we open

879
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
That we made

880
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
Huge mistake

881
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,800
Wow many was that popular

882
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Massive

883
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
How many lines out the door

884
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
On a Monday when your customers little kids who who's coming

885
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,624
Everybody but then we sold the company and Warner didn't want to be in the restaurant business

886
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,024
You you sold at rue21 or Chuck-E-Cheese with was kind of hard because you

887
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
Who created why you're there so

888
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,400
For you to keep Chuck-E-Cheese you had to buy it back from them

889
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:42,336
Half a million dollars 500000 bucks to buy Chuck-E-Cheese

890
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,712
Open sports store was Cash 4 and 1/2 million dollars

891
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:53,344
They let me pay $100,000 for 5 years and that was maybe the deal of a lifetime

892
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,976
I had this business that was positive cash flow day 1

893
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
Well I was still chairman of Atari

894
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,936
And I I had a team of people that have been working on and I brought them on my payroll

895
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:13,312
And we immediately expanded to the second store this one was 25,000 worth

896
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,896
And I was having more fun

897
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Chuck-E-Cheese

898
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,248
Then I was having Charlie Charlie was getting political

899
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
So when

900
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
We decided to part ways

901
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Excited I could

902
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Focus on my time on

903
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Chuck-E-Cheese and I was going to happy about

904
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,840
Yeah I'm pretty liberating to work on this thing because you know you you were like synonym for excited about

905
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
You know sometimes

906
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
I feel that

907
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Inadvertence

908
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Shines on

909
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Because

910
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
I had thought about French

911
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
Dykema

912
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
I want a franchise

913
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Okay

914
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
And we started franchise

915
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,784
And so the franchise business was hugely

916
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,368
So how many Chuck-E-Cheese locations did you

917
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
Eventually

918
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Franchise

919
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,768
I sold the company when we were about 280 stores

920
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
And 1/2 Warframe

921
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
It's time so we build battle

922
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
And franchise

923
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
What what

924
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,800
Opposite of mistakes do you think you made

925
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
That you learn from

926
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
ATS trucking

927
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,176
I think that I didn't understand

928
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
The nature

929
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Entertain

930
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
Now that sounds funny

931
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Amusement park and all that

932
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
But entertainment is

933
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Fairy

934
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Fragile

935
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
It's driven on

936
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Novelty

937
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
And so

938
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,864
When we would first open

939
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
A unit

940
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
People would come

941
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,496
From all around because it was Mall

942
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,800
So there was sort of a half life

943
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Shein

944
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,199
In which you say G you know this is St Louis looks to me like I need

945
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Amor Chuck-E-Cheeses

946
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,111
When in fact what you were seeing is this novelty bonus

947
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
And that

948
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
People in normal life

949
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,023
Didn't really want to come to Chuck-E-Cheese

950
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
Three times a month

951
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
They wanted to come to Chuck-E-Cheese

952
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
Every other month

953
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
We got over bill because

954
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,263
We got another false positive

955
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
What was the first pasta

956
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
That you

957
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
Could pack the place

958
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
365 days a year

959
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
In a population

960
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Which couldn't

961
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
It's it's amazing because

962
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Did you

963
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
Built these two iconic companies

964
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
How many server many many people in America

965
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
Define The Contours of their childhood

966
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
And you can on 202 start

967
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
But at least a dozen other companies

968
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Some of what you can speak

969
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,103
Killer failures and spectacular successes you've had

970
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,199
You have this amazing range of experiences on on both ends

971
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
I guess

972
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,111
I just wonder what I mean I'm sure the successes were were incredibly satisfying

973
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Robbie's reasons but

974
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
In some ways you think the failures were

975
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,815
Or should have more interesting or

976
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Kill time for you learned more about

977
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
Lifan about you in about

978
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Business

979
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
There is no question

980
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
That

981
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
A good failure

982
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
Is good for your soul

983
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
There is nothing worse

984
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Then feeling like

985
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
You are

986
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,015
Invincible and Reed

987
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Cool

988
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Entitled

989
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Being entitled

990
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Probably

991
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Ugliest thing

992
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
A person can be

993
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
Because all of a sudden

994
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
It's not

995
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
What you do

996
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
It's who you are

997
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
And

998
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
People who rely on who they are

999
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Opposed to what they

1000
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
They do become

1001
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Very

1002
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Banal

1003
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
How long does it take you to

1004
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
2

1005
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,455
To become Who You Are

1006
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
To realize that

1007
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
I hope that I'm not there yet

1008
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
I want

1009
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
To stay on the steep

1010
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Part of the learning curve

1011
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
In fact I've even

1012
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Docker methodology

1013
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
IAAI

1014
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Force myself

1015
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
Do something totally outside my comfort zone if

1016
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Here

1017
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
And I write down

1018
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,823
11 things that I think I could accomplish in a year

1019
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
That are

1020
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Outside my comfort zone

1021
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
And then I

1022
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Myxoma put a number on them

1023
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,295
Through paradise and I have to in that year

1024
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Do

1025
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
What the dice tell me

1026
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
And I discovered

1027
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Funny thing

1028
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
Maybe it's just me but I think it's a generalized principal

1029
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
But when you do different

1030
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Things you're happier

1031
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
That this process of

1032
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
Of expiration

1033
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
And

1034
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Discovery

1035
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
And of

1036
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
Winnie wing

1037
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Out

1038
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
The game and the medical

1039
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Is very satisfied

1040
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,223
If you were

1041
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
Able to go back to like I mean now you are a

1042
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,647
Elder Statesman of the tech world you're in your seventies and

1043
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
If you could go back to

1044
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
To Nolan Bushnell in the Olay

1045
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
70 years earlier

1046
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Ladies and say

1047
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
Hey you know I want to give you some advice

1048
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
What would you tell yourself

1049
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
Well that's a real hard-on

1050
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Cuz

1051
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Some of the bad decisions I've made

1052
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
I'm not sure that I would like my wife

1053
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
To not have had

1054
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
And I'm not sure

1055
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
That

1056
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
If

1057
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
I were to give myself advice

1058
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
And change that trajectory

1059
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
I would end up

1060
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
I am right

1061
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
And I like

1062
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
Tell me about what you're working on now

1063
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
Well then I'll have to kill you

Built

1079
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,743
Hey thanks so much for sticking around

1080
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,399
I know for how you built that and say we're up to the story that we ran about a year ago this one is from

1081
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Paul Tucker who's worked in the beverage business in Southern California for over 20 years

1082
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:14,175
And that entire time he's been making craft beer in his kitchen

1083
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
5-minute homebrewer for

1084
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:22,367
20 years and pretty quickly realized that the magic ingredient in craft beer is the Hops

1085
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Start a brew with hops in one day I had some left over and it just hit me that option

1086
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
To be enjoyed on more occasions and how come it's only in craft beer

1087
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Bacon Maybe

1088
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
But hops

1089
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
Who knew it's a very subtle flavor wheezing and really pairs well with food and you know

1090
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
The more I looked at it the more I said wow

1091
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
This could be a whole new category but instead of coming up with another artisanal chocolate bar

1092
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
Hops infused cheese

1093
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Pyside

1094
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
What about a new drink

1095
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,279
Maybe even a drink with no alcohol

1096
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,863
As much as I love craft beer you can't drink it on all occasions

1097
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,239
So yeah I started experimenting and probably about a year of research and

1098
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:15,615
Many failures and trying different varieties came up with something that I thought was just

1099
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
Phenomenal with Paul came up with has no barley no-yeast no fermentation of alcohol

1100
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
And best of all

1101
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
No calories

1102
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
Paul basically made up Pops flavors

1103
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Sparkling water

1104
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,975
And I think when people think of hops

1105
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
They think of

1106
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,839
Better but you know there are over a hundred varieties of hops

1107
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,655
And lobster we use these Aroma hot

1108
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Add

1109
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,775
Citrus scent Pine flavor is grapefruit it's really complex

1110
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
And what I consider the

1111
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,871
The spice for the magic ingredient

1112
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,991
So Paul took his creation to a beer festival in San Francisco and

1113
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,551
The first he was a little nervous about what

1114
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Beer drinkers would think

1115
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,647
But when people came up and tasted it

1116
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
People are like wow

1117
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Yeah this is

1118
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,815
Legit the flavor is really interesting and refreshing and

1119
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
That's what I knew that

1120
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
It's not just me

1121
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
Don't think about this for a moment

1122
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Sparkling water is super hot right now

1123
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Just ask the company that makes Lacroix and

1124
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
It's no secret that craft beers huge

1125
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
How to figure putting together

1126
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,711
And he's managed to get his drink

1127
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
Into a few small retailers in restaurants

1128
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
That he's not making a profit yet but this year

1129
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
He's expecting sales

1130
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,951
And if I can get it to the point where

1131
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:39,583
A big company would like to pick this up and distributed worldwide then you know I would feel

1132
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Fantastic about that

1133
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
When we last spoke to Paul

1134
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,567
He'd sold less than $100,000 worth of hot water but he says within the past year his sales

1135
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,967
Went up 6 times and the company is still not profitable Paul is hiring his first employ

1136
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:02,367
