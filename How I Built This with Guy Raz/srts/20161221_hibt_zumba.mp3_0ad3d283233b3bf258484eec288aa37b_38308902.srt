Kept talking about Beto's clocks in at that point fair to hear Miami he called his classroom besides

179
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583

Like I said I really my thing

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
What the thing that pops into my brain at that time was

192
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Could this be an infomercial

193
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Could this be

194
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Something that we could

195
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
Basically sell some videotapes of this

196
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
Splicing

197
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Do something with it but I wasn't sure

198
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
I wasn't sure

199
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
So the next day

200
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
I was meeting with Beto at a Starbucks

201
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
This isn't like what

202
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
2000-2001

203
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
2001

204
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
And she told me his life story

205
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Which is on believe

206
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
The Columbia also so I knew

207
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
What was happening in the country

208
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
But he was in Cali

209
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
And Kylie was

210
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
The epicenter of violence

211
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
And

212
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Xerosis

213
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
15 year old kid

214
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,471
Dancing on the streets and that's in clubs and dancing in James and

215
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,567
And so it was like juxtaposition right with all the violence happening

216
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
This kid make

217
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Everybody happy and

218
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
It's downright

219
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
That's what he told his life story

220
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
Class cuz a Zumba class into something what a Zumba class is that

221
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Destructor

222
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Is always telling

223
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Story

224
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
The music selection

225
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
How they teach the class

226
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
So I went to see the class

227
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
And the one thing

228
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
That I noticed

229
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
Was that every single person

230
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Class was smiling

231
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
And I had

232
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Ben

233
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
A gym member

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,847
Before and I knew that normally a smile is not the

235
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Typical face

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
People are doing

237
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
When they're exercising really heavily in the gym right is

238
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
People are suffering

239
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Forcing themselves

240
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
It's it's kind of like

241
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
The drill sergeant mentality

242
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
But then there was this

243
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Plus

244
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
Which is like an oasis inside the gym where every single person

245
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
Was smiling but they were drenched in sweat at the same time

246
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
And I'm like this

247
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Sky

248
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Doesn't know it but he has

249
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Discovered

250
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,567
Like a magic pill he has discovered the exercise that people want to do in

251
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Instead of the exercise that people have to do

252
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
So you said to him would you say to him do you say hey let's start a business

253
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,783
Yeah you told me about the what do you want to do

254
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Nana said I Know a Man

255
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Let's do it

256
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Conquer the world

257
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,439
And the funny way you know

258
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
Did you take him seriously

259
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
And I know he say okay let's do it

260
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
You want to be my business partners yes

261
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,239
Perfect that was it

262
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Create some videos of your class

263
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
And

264
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Basically

265
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Create a collection

266
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
DVD said it was VHS of it.

267
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
I'm actually a VHS set

268
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
And sell it

269
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
On TV

270
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,903
So we can explain where it comes from and why and what the results are in

271
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
And so that was the

272
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Original idea

273
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
The idea was

274
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Go to like

275
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
He was just a boy cat video like Jazzercise

276
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Just going to sell

277
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
An infomercial on that was hopefully going to be your business

278
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
Yeah like are are the most fresh in our memories of that time was typo

279
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
Remember taobao martial arts

280
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
So we was like that was the theory cuz Beto told me

281
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
When people come to my class

282
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
They don't

283
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Leave

284
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
And it's because

285
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,415
The class is fun we say fun equals lasting behavioral change

286
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,279
I get I get that but I'm trying to scare what was the thing that made Roomba size

287
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Different from other Fitness class

288
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
More fun

289
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
I think we

290
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,239
We do the same thing that Jane Fonda do in the beginning

291
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Everything

292
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
It's easy

293
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Second the music music only I do weighted different kind of music

294
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
Indian Bhangra Panther

295
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,879
Anybody can do it always I will always thinking they my mom

296
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Do my class and

297
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:46,303
It went to things that Beto did that was very smart of the beginning is he said I want a microphone

298
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Because if I have a microphone

299
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
I will interrupt

300
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,471
The music and people need to be able to hear the music

301
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
And so he doesn't scream at people in the class or

302
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
If there's no

303
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
Talking it's only visual cueing soap

304
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
With hand signals would we tell people what to do

305
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
And

306
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
The magic is letting

307
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
The music

308
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,879
Lead the choreography lead the class

309
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
And there's a moment

310
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
In the class

311
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
That we call fetch

312
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Ffej

313
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Bring electrifying Joy

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
I said that moment

315
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Is 20 minutes into the class

316
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
And a person suddenly feels completely liberated

317
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,615
They're having fun they're not thinking about what you need to cook that night or their job

318
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Or their kids or

319
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Everything that is in their life they're completely disappears and it's a stem and the music

320
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
Did you have to go out and raise money to

321
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
So we was July of 2001

322
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,447
And we went to some of our investors that had invested in spiderlabs

323
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Which was that the incubator

324
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,847
And we told him about this and they said we loved it we're and we had raised about half-a-million dollars

325
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
But we haven't gotten the wire transfers yet

326
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
And then September 11th happen

327
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
And everybody backed out

328
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Everyone

329
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
We don't know what we're

330
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
We're going to do when we didn't know when I mean

331
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
For the next two months were all come

332
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Confused what's going to happen with

333
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
What's the world and you remember that

334
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
It was very tough

335
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
And

336
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
Then around November of that year

337
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
Beto told me

338
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
My boss at

339
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215

340
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031

And he said I can't advise because

354
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631

00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
And they might be able to not only invest but also help you

360
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
So the next day I'm on a plane to Ohio

361
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479

I'm in a warehouse for a total gyms

It is looking at a tape that we created of his Cloud we just filled this class with a Handycam

368
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375

She said this is what I want to call my boss

370
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
And

371
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Finally the CEO comes down

376
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
So I called him up

377
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
And I'm like paper they're asking

378
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
If you

379
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303

380
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583

Tell them yes

382
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191

That was last week discuss changing the name

386
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
What was wrong with Roomba size

387
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
The word Roomba

388
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
In Spanish

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Means to party

390
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
But it's also means

391
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
The type of dance there's a ballroom dance called Rumba

392
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
So it was a very difficult word to

393
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Trademark

394
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
So we sat

395
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
In a restaurant

396
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
And we basically went through the alphabet

397
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Anything that rhymes with Roomba so boom boom boom

398
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Goomba sounded like

399
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775

407
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:06,143
Moment how Beto and Alberto hustle their way to a contract and eventually set their sights on something

Or iTunes or on the NPR one app

438
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
It's how I built this from NPR

439
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
Garage so it's early two thousands Alberto and Beto have a business model for Zumba which is basic

440
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
Mickey's Dance videos for people to play at home

441
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
First they need an infomercial in before they can make that they have to make sure that Beto who is the dance

442
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
Teacher can speak English which he can't and also at this point a new business partner

443
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
Enters the picture whose name and I'm not making this up

444
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
He's also helped her to Alberto Aggie on and in case you lost count Zumba is having run by

445
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
3 Alberto's and so

446
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
My flight back to Miami and Alberto

447
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
Artyon and I are teaching better English for the next two months because the people who were going to be in summer

448
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575

449
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
They won't make it unless better speaks English coming down to Miami to meet

450
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
In 2 months

451
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,887
When they coming to Miami before I say to a better better don't worry because my daughter was worried

452
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,983

50 because we were 60 days trying

459
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
It is like this is not going to work now

460
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
When there's people coming

461
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
Coming in the end of the class I wanted to lose you on

You know we need to put in a show

468
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,943
And I went to my car waiting in the parking garage with my Pontiac 85 North Edition

469
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
The conversation continued order to come in again

470
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Hey where are you I'm here in the parking lot

471
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855

00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
The whole infomercial

474
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
A script

475
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
In Spanish phonetics

476
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143

00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,471
Launch that and we talked well

478
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
This is it

479
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
It's like having a party who are you working out

480
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
Wheely Zumba now we're going to get a royalty ass and maybe we should find some other products

481
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,551
Salvia television we don't know we don't know what we're going to do until the deal was that you would get a royalty

482
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
But they owned the

483
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Rights to a weed license

484
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Will I see like that

485
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,999
Because we don't have money to do it ourselves right and we don't know how to do it frankly Maddie know how to do it yeah

486
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,815
When you guys want you to commercial were you making money

487
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
A little bit

488
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
It was good it was good at me they sold

489
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
I remember what the number was

490
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
It was enough to

491
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,495
Keep the lights on in

492
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
And keep going but it wasn't enough to till like

493
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,687
Ghetto fund your life and light pay your rent and everything or to just another job really not really been through

494
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Stoat still taught his classes

495
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Do you have other jobs I had a morning job

496
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
What was it

497
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
I was selling food to Latin America

498
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
I was hoping

499
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
American brands sell food

500
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
2

501
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Latin

502
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Wow so you guys are all basically

503
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
This is you your this is really what you want to do but this

504
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
This is kind of like your side project

505
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
Cuz you really had other real job to pay the bills

506
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes that was tough it was tough times it was very long hours

507
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,848
We I mean I worked in the mornings and then

508
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
And the afternoon I went over to

509
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
Alberto Young's house and

510
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Stay there till midnight

511
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,344
Packing DVDs or whatever we were doing like we're doing every single thing

512
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
We're doing all the jobs which is great because

513
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
When you do every single job

514
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Then

515
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
As a company grows you know

516
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048

517
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
Was the business healthy and they were you guys

518
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936

00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Drive or did you ever get to a point where you almost no

We're almost collapse

521
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080

This is not going to work you know it's great while working hard but

525
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
We can sustain that we can't pay the bills

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
And we we have one employee

527
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,464
And we're all doing everything else and

528
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
And it's hard it was just hard to

529
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024

Stupid

555
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,584
You know Tony do step by step side to side

556
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,728
They hired somebody else to like Tony the Tiger but you were not happy with how he was dancing so you put on the costume

557
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,800
Did it instead yes

558
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
Barracuda Tony Tiger Rising I was

559
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
We were so lucky because In This Moment

560
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
The CEO of Kellogg's

561
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Come to the set

562
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
We didn't know

563
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
And I was inside the custom dancing like

564
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Crazy

565
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Sweating inside

566
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
It's like

567
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:03,840
You don't think who is this oxygen in between songs

568
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
It was

569
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:10,496
Crazy and this moment like a couple years

570
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
I got 50

571
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
$1000 for

572
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Guy that helped

573
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
That help but it was not enough

574
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
What would it what did you guys do that

575
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
So

576
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Then people started calling

577
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
Their call center

578
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Because I'm a Kellogg

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Saying

580
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
Hey we want to take

581
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Zumba classes

582
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,352
Is in our area or some people started calling saying we want to become Zumba instructors how can we become Zumba instructor

583
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,680
And they were like well will give you the corporate number

584
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
The corporate number

585
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
Was a MetroPCS cell phone

586
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
Next to Alberto Jones bed

587
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
And

588
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
At 2 a.m. it would ring when The infomercials were airing

589
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
And people would say I want to become an instructor the first three times he hung up

590
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
Unsync the fourth time he's like

591
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
Something Happening Here

592
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
And he called me Anna and Beto and told us

593
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
You know we been getting all these calls from a struct

594
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
That they want music

595
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
They want

596
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
A choreography

597
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
They want

598
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
A newsletters they want

599
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
Community that they want event they want all these things

600
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
Maybe we can

601
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
We can put it all together and

602
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Create

603
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Something service for them

604
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
To give them everything that they need

605
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Like a subscription service

606
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Yes

607
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
And so

608
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Wait we caught up in Deland

609
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
We started brainstorm

610
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
And we said well what do we need to do

611
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,072
Said the first thing is we have to make sure that we deliver

612
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
10 *

613
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
More value then what

614
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
It costs

615
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Suicide what do they need

616
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Madewell Laney Korea

617
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:52,128
They need music many students how do we get them students are we get the more participants in their class

618
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,272
Show marketing support let's create their career in a box basic

619
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
So we came up with a name

620
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,624
We called it the Zumba instructor Network

621
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,536
And we launched it in 2006 in January of 2006 and we spent the whole 14

622
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
0 in the bank

623
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,376
We created is beautiful email

624
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
It went out

625
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,752
And Alberto xi'an told me okay if 200 of them join

626
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
We will continue with this business

627
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,384
Press send and we're praying please please

628
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
And suddenly

629
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Instead of getting

630
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
Email responses we got phone call

631
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,552
And these structures were saying

632
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:36,416
Were you loving that your launch this and we know you guys are trying to make this work

633
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Can we pay the year in advance

634
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,584
Everybody says how much and wish I was $35 a month at that point was 30

635
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
And they said that's it

636
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,240
That's it for my entire career that's all I have to pay and we said yes we have to pay in date

637
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
They said we love it

638
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
And 450

639
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Instructors joint

640
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
And so that's when we said this is this is going to be our life

641
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
And let's make it work

642
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,088
At this point you guys are still entirely self-funded

643
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Yeah

644
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
It was just from

645
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
That that royalties we got and then

646
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Kellogg's and then.

647
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
The fees from

648
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
The trainings and that it was all like

649
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Inch by inch very slow growth

650
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
And

651
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,288
Thank God we were always able to meet payroll of art to employees

652
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,104
Sometimes we do things to like pay the bills so

653
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,920
What's a beta why don't we do a special Master Class

654
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
A because we were running

655
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
$1,000 shorts

656
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
And so we would

657
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
Email everybody we knew is a special master

658
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Classen

659
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
So we would all chip in and all help each other and

660
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
And find ways to do it

661
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
Since you guys are training all these instructors teach

662
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,376
I need a place to teach the classes so

663
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
So where the gym is interested in this

664
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
No they would laugh at us

665
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,080
So I remember that 24 Hour Fitness had a class called Salsa moves at that time

666
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
And

667
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
LA Fitness add a class called

668
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Latin impact

669
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,760
And they will tell us like why we have our own brand why do we need your breath

670
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
But then you when you went to one of those classes they had

671
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,160
Five people four people three people those glasses were empty

672
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
And we said no we have a formula

673
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
We have a formula that works our class

674
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Attracts

675
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
People and people love it

676
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Different

677
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
And they would understand of the beginning

678
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
And finally

679
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Hey there first

680
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Really big chain to bring it in was

681
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
24-Hour Fitness

682
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
2007

683
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
And it exploded

684
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
And they had to hire multiple instructors

685
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Per location

686
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Then all the big

687
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
Gym chains followed Equinox and crunch

688
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
A crush always had it because of our initial relationship with them so they were really the first one

689
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
You guys were doing all this

690
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
How are you getting the word out about Zumba music

691
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Word of mouth or where you advertise

692
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,936
So one of things we were able to do in 2007/2008

693
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
We had bought the rights back to

694
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
Do the infomercial

695
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,568
Fitness questions

696
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
Ford 2500 stop airing

697
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
As we did our own

698
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
Infomercial

699
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
And we started airing.

700
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,624
And that was helping at the word out and there was word-of-mouth and there were more people coming to class

701
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
And

702
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
When something is good

703
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
People Finder

704
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,280
And two other people were saying well

705
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
This

706
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,144
Structure must be doing pretty well maybe I should become an instructor to

707
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,240
So what was like the Tipping Point when did this model really start

708
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
So in 2008

709
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
The network was growing

710
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
But

711
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,688
We started seeing what was happening in the economy

712
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,224
And we got very nervous

713
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
And I remember that we sat

714
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,576
In our conference room and we said

715
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
This is going to be a very tough year

716
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
And look at everybody's

717
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
Losing their jobs

718
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
People cannot pay their mortgage

719
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
But for the next few months

720
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
We started seeing

721
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
That are

722
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Instructor trainings

723
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
We're getting

724
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Pact

725
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
And that there were more and more people who wanted to become instructor

726
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,592
And we also saw that the instructors were reporting to us

727
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
That's our classes were packed

728
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Calling us telling us

729
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
We don't know what's happening but we've doubled from

730
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,808
25 people now that I have 50 people in my class what's happening

731
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
So we started asking people

732
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,416
And there were two things that were driving it one

733
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Was

734
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Some people were out of a job people were sad

735
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
They turn to Zumba

736
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
And they said

737
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
For 1 hour and when I forget everything that is happening

738
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
And I'm just going to be happy

739

That zumba was a way of promoting music

790
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112

The end of the show

900
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,552
And it's time to hear how you built that

901
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
My name is Nicholas Gilson and I am one of the original founders of Gilson snowboards

902
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:24,352
Nick and his business partners fell into the snowboard business they were Middle School teachers in Nashville in

903
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,752
Project with a challenge their students to build a better snowboard I brought in the original prototype

904
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:36,128
For an idea I had when I was my students age when I was in Middle School

905
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,736
Was basically to design a board which instead of being flat at the bottom

906
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:47,392
Was curved and they hope that it would make for a faster ride and even though their first design total

907
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Early failed

908
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
Betadine chili came up with one they love

909
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,048
With this board you can actually ride close to flat

910
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
And engages really surfy drifty Maneuvers that allow you to get through the trees way easier with way more

911
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,264
Morcerf emotion until with barely any money

912
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
Nick and his partner quit their teaching jobs and set up a snowboard shop inside a stable in Pennsylvania

913
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
Who's inactive stable it was an active do they were donkeys and horses next time machine

914
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
Mike says they were able to make their boards even better then started to travel the country starting to come

915
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
I'm pretty much the way our grandparents would have we need to tangibly and physically share something with people and so we were

916
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,960
When on The Marcels in the community travel 17000 miles from coast to coast

917
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,360
And I started getting these people on the boards since they started the company three years ago it's been growing

918
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:45,760
Pretty fast they've sold thousands of board they don't have 16 employees and they have a small Factory

919
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
In Pennsylvania

920
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
Just down the road from the donkey stable

921
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,488
There is a week-long. And November where we put in more orders than we did in our first several years,
