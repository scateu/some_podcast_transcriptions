00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:22,528
I said you know we should really call Diane Von Furstenberg the famous fashion designer

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,184
Fast forward a few weeks and we're driving to the second meeting and her system calls and says Dad no longer wants to see you

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,536
She's not interested in this idea and I said

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,120
We're just around the corner like what will just drop by for a second

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
And again her assistant very firmly

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,544
Said she doesn't want to see you what do you not understand

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
And I said we're cutting off or cutting off and I hung up and then I said down the West Side Highway

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Highway and we were

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
At her office and we just showed up

15
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,744
NPR how I built this

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,816
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

17
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Stories behind the movement

18
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
They built

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,496
I'm guy Raz.

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,592
How to women who wanted High fashion but couldn't afford the price tag

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
Decided to make it possible

22
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
The Rent the Runway

23
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
So Rent the Runway is

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Now we're the hottest fashion companies

25
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Days in the US

26
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Growing like

27
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Crazy

28
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
Doing more than a hundred million dollars a year in Revenue

29
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
It hasn't like

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
1200 employees

31
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
Core product is designer dresses

32
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
Surprise to discover as I was

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
But just

34
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,128
10 of its employees work in the fashion Department

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Most of the rest

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Well

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
They work for a technology company

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
Because that's actually what Rent the Runway is

39
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
It works is

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
You go online or you go to the app

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,744
And well dressed

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Thousands of dollars to buy

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,936
Except you only pay a small fraction of that and you get to look fabulous for one night

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
And then in the morning after you've recovered

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
You mail it back

46
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Zipcar me Netflix

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
Zappos

48
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,480
Who are the co-founders Jenn Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
Came up with the idea when they met in Business School

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
As you will hear

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
The path of building their company was fraught with all kinds of challenges

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Among them

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Rampant sexism

54
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
And even harassment

55
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
Jenn Hyman is only recently been opening up

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
About that

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Their Story begins just after she graduates College

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
And job working as a junior analyst

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
For the hotel company

60
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Starwood

61
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,944
About a year into my time at Starwood when I was

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
22

63
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
I had this pieces

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
That we had entered

65
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
The Experience economy

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
And people were getting married later and starting to value

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
Experiences like travel

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Over owning things

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
And so I had an idea at the time

70
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
To Launch

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
The first honeymoon registry in the world

72
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Where couples could register for

73
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Their honeymoons and their friends and family could contribute by

74
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,968
You know paying for scuba diving or paying for a massage or hotel night as opposed to buying them pots

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Pants

76
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
So

77
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
As a 22 year old I

78
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
Was really passionate about this idea

79
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
I emailed the president of Starwood

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
And

81
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
I pitched him on this idea to start

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
A wedding list

83
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Starwood where the Cornerstone of it would be with a

84
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
The first honeymoon registry

85
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
Just eversec

86
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Bristle your 22

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,336
That's that's incredibly precocious but was there anybody around you who is like

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
Hey stay in your lane or you know was there anybody was trying to

89
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
Tell you to keep your plan keep quiet

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Oh yeah

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Several boxes of mine were telling me to keep

92
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Keep quiet in

93
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,440
One of the experiences that really impacted me

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Was

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
I

96
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Had a female boss

97
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
And at the time I think she was like

98
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
35 or 36 so

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Kind of about my age right now

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
And I would often

101
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,103
Raise my hand in meetings and speak and make points

102
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
And

103
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
I remember her

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Grabbing me after a meeting one day and

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
She said you know Jen I really want to give you some feedback

106
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
It's really important for your career

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,719
And I said oh you know I'd love to hear what's your feedback

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
And she said

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,327
You really need to shut up wow

110
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
You're a girl

111
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
And

112
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
It would be much more becoming

113
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
If you acted sweet

114
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
In

115
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Conversations

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,943
Because you know you're you're too confident you're too bold

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
And it's coming across the wrong way

118
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
And of course

119
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,207
I didn't really know how to take this I mean I don't even know how I would take this today let alone is a 22 year olds

120
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,815
I started hysterically crying I was in the middle of like an open floor plan

121
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
And a more senior man

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Sami

123
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
I literally credit

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
The sky for my entire career

125
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
He took me aside

126
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
And because I

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,247
Didn't even understand office politics at the time and like what I should and shouldn't say I kind of just blurted out

128
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,367
Oh my God like this woman just told me X Y and Z and I repeated the entire conversation to him

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
And he said you know Jen

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,975
You keep doing what you're doing

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Because that one is going to be working for you one day

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Wow

133
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
End

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
She innocence gave me permission

135
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
To just act like myself

136
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
And

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
Who I was as a 22 year old

138
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
The same person is who I am today it's the person who

139
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
How to creative idea about

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
The Experience economy and I wanted to share it

141
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
So what did you end up doing with it with the idea you pitch this to the to the president of Star Wars

142
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Yeah

143
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
I think he thought I was so

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,887
What are the crazy for going in and pitching to him that his response was like yeah sure whatever

145
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
And I took that as a yes

146
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Wait he said

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
He didn't say yes he just said yeah that's interesting in you

148
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Went back to your your desk and you started to

149
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Map out how this could happen

150
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,247
I started to work on it I spent the next three years working on it

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
And

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343
You know Starwood still participates in

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
The honeymoon red

154
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
History to this day

155
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Has

156
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
Taking it to a whole other level since I left

157
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
But it was such a fun experience for me to a work on something that I loved and was passionate about

158
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Indeed be part of the process of

159
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Creation

160
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
So you are obviously on the fast track to like if you were still Starwood today you might be running the place and you were

161
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Doing this at such a young age

162
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
Why did you decide to leave after after a couple years

163
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,527
I always thought

164
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
But I would go to visit

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
The school both my parents have gone to Business School

166
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
And so

167
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,023
I thought that the track was you work for 4 years between college and then you go to Business School

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Also went

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
I was at Starwood for

170
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,935
3 + years I applied to business school and I got into Harvard Business School

171
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
So here's a question for you about cuz we're going to get I want to ask you about

172
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
What happened business coaches

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Being critical to

174
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Rent the Runway but

175
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
The vast majority of the of the entrepreneurs of it have been on the show

176
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Did not go to Business School

177
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,647
You had all this incredible experience and you were really ambitious and you were

178
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
Entrepreneurial already

179
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Why did you think you needed to

180
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
To go to Business School

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Well first

182
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
I

183
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Have always had big

184
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Dreams for my career but I

185
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Didn't exactly know what those dreams were

186
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
You know

187
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Sara Blakely was

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
A guest on your program and

189
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
She's someone who

190
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,223
Has always been an inspiration to me I remember being a

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Younger girl

192
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
And

193
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Seeing her on Oprah

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
And she had this amazing business but she also like

195
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Seem like a real person

196
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
Who cared about getting married and having kids and

197
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Having friends and having a social life in

198
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
That was really important to me

199
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
I was still fearful

200
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
That you had to make a choice

201
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Between having

202
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
An incredible career as a woman or having a family

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
And I've always wanted both

204
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
So

205
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
And since going to business school with a Chance.

206
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
Think those things through to think of through to get that kind of x

207
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Straw

208
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
Potentially stamp of approval that I thought that I needed

209
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
I had lots of opportunities that I could go into

210
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
Different kinds of companies in different

211
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Fields

212
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
But I really wanted the time to think about like

213
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
Where do I want to spend my time

214
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Like what am I most passionate about

215
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
You are why you were at at Harvard Business School gmat

216
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
The person who become

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
The co-founder of Rent the Runway

218
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Jennifer Fleiss

219
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Yes how did you

220
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
So it's a really funny story my sister Becky

221
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,791
Prior to me going to business school put a Post-It note on my pillow one night

222
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
With

223
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
Jenny Fleiss has maiden name on it

224
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Which was Teddy Carter

225
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
And

226
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
She said that you have to meet the

227
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
Scroll when you go to Business School

228
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
Because a friend of a friend of hers new Jenny Carter

229
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
And my response

230
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Tobaccy

231
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
At the time was he know I'll meet her if I meet her

232
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Needless to say

233
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
Jenny was one of the first people I met at Harvard biz

234
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
The school because we were placed in the same section

235
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
Because her name had been on a Post-It note

236
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
For me I was like oh my God you'll never believe this like my sister told me we need to be friends and we be

237
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
He came really fast friends and

238
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
You know the rest is history and at what point did you say

239
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
What's your business together when we leave

240
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
So we were friends

241
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
We actually through our birthdays

242
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Together

243
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I'm in

244
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
September of

245
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
That second year of Business School

246
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,903
And in November of the second-year business school I went home for Thanksgiving

247
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
And I was in Becky's apartment

248
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
And Becky had just gone to a store and bought a dress

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
That was higher cost than her rent

250
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
And

251
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Azhar

252
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Responsible older sister I was

253
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Embarking how

254
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
She should probably wear

255
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,175
One of the dresses in her closet again as opposed to being in credit card debt

256
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
And her response to me was

257
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
You know everything in my closet is dead to me

258
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
I've been photographed in it

259
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
The photographs are up on Facebook and I need something new

260
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
You know Becky was a 25 year old

261
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
Like normal girl who lived in New York she wasn't a celebrity

262
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,727
But she was talking about being photographed and not being able to wear something again

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
And I like it was a lightbulb

264
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Look for me

265
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Cuz I realize

266
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
I was having a conversation with my sister about the

267
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Experience

268
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Of wearing

269
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,319
An amazing dress of walking into a party feeling self-confident

270
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
I'm feeling beautiful and that's what

271
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
She cared about

272
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
And she didn't

273
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Care about

274
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
The actual ownership of the items in her closet

275
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
The other thing she cared about was

276
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Photograph

277
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
That would exist after the party

278
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
That she could post on Facebook

279
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
I'm kind of share with everyone she knew

280
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
How awesome she felt and how confident

281
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
She felt it that way

282
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
Sweating with this idea happened on a Saturday night

283
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
I go back

284
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
To school on Monday

285
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
I happen to have lunch that day with Jenny

286
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
We were talking about our weekends I was like oh I had this idea like

287
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
What if we rented dresses

288
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
She responded all this sounds fun

289
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
You know that's like

290
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Work on this idea together

291
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Who do you think we should call

292
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
To figure out if it's a good idea

293
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
And

294
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
I said you know we should really call Diane Von Furstenberg

295
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
Chauncey like the famous fashion designer

296
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Jennifer

297
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Do you know Diane Von Furstenberg

298
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
And I said

299
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,991
Obviously I don't know Diane Von Furstenberg but we could probably figure out her email address

300
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Eucalyptus

301
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
Point figure out anyone's email address in the entire world

302
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
So

303
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Jenny and I

304
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Roden email. Afternoon

305
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
Too many different versions of Diane Von Furstenberg email address

306
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,447
And we basically said Hayward were two women at Harvard Business School we have an idea

307
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
We'd love to come in and talk to you about it

308
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
And this is where luck

309
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Please into the situation

310
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Because

311
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
She or someone from her office

312
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Open that email

313
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,087
She responded I'll see you tomorrow at 5 p.m. tomorrow at 5 p.m. and we

314
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Drove down

315
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
To New York

316
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
That next day

317
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
Put on our dvf dresses

318
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,863
And walked into her office and introduced ourselves as the co-founders of Rent the Runway

319
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
You had the name at that point you came up with a name

320
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Yeah we do

321
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
We did everything very quickly

322
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Now we didn't really have a structured idea

323
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
So

324
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
You know we were kind of iterating the idea

325
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
By pitching

326
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
And

327
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Initial idea actually a witch

328
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
You know we've never really told the initial idea was what if we could rent

329
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
The dresses

330
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,511
That she is selling on her website so what if we powered rental for

331
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,815
Her on dvf.com

332
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
And

333
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
You know when we

334
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Went to chat with her

335
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
She

336
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Was not too thrilled about

337
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
The idea of

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Renting clothes in general

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
And thought that it would

340
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Cannibalize

341
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Her

342
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,991
Her retail sales and it would dilute her brand

343
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
And

344
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
She was ready to end the meeting with us after a few minutes

345
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
And

346
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
I started asking her questions about what she disliked about the idea what was

347
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
She scared about end

348
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
By the end of what was

349
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,911
Almost a you know a hour-and-a-half conversation we learned

350
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
That

351
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,519
A lot of her customers were in their 50s and 60

352
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
And not

353
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
If we were to build a business that could

354
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Make her relevant

355
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
To put her products

356
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
Into the hands of women

357
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
In their teens twenties thirties and forties

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,183
But that might be interesting to her and she might want to work with us

359
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,743
So what are you guys

360
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Nervous I mean

361
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
You're stabbing yourself business school students mean

362
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
I can imagine like what

363
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
That would be like to walk into that room and

364
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,031
I can't keep her attention and get her excited

365
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
What's a funny story so

366
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,687
At that first meeting I've always learned you know when you're in the first meeting scheduled second meeting

367
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,551
So when we were in the first meeting we scheduled the conversation for a few weeks later with her

368
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,623
Fast forward a few weeks and we're driving to the meeting

369
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
And

370
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
We got a call while we're in the car

371
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
From hearth

372
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Assistant

373
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
And we're on the West Side Highway where about

374
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
40 blocks

375
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
From her off

376
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
And her system calls and says Dad no longer wants to see you

377
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
I said oh you know well

378
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
We're on our way

379
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
We'll just come in and say hi

380
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
And persistence like

381
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
No

382
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
She really doesn't want to see you

383
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
She's not interested in this idea

384
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Can I set

385
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,463
We're just around the corner like what will just drop by for a second

386
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
And add her assistant very firmly

387
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Said she doesn't

388
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
Want to see you what do you not understand

389
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
And I said we're cutting off or cutting off and I hung up

390
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
And then I

391
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Bed down the West Side Highway and we were

392
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,711
At her office and we just showed up most people in that situation would have just been like

393
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
Crushed would have felt so dejected

394
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Like I don't know I would

395
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
What did you said well forget it forget Diane will just move on

396
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
How did you not

397
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Feel that how did you how are you able to just say

398
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
We're just going to do that for no walk in there

399
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Well Jenny initially was

400
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:43,007
Actually started to cry and was a little bit upset about the situation which I think is some people would

401
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
Yeah which I think is the much more natural reaction and

402
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
I was like we're just going to do this what do we have to lose like

403
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,783
What's the worst thing in the world we show up and she doesn't meet us what if you walked in there and they were like

404
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
Security please escort these women out

405
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Great

406
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,695
Then we have a story that we could tell all of our friends

407
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
Let me come back

408
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,375
What actually happened when Jen and Jenny finally showed up at the Hands-On furstenberg's office

409
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191

Stream NPR

428
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,647
Before the break Jen was talking about how she and her co-founder Jenny

429
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Basically

430
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,023
Busted in the Diane Von Furstenberg Sophos to have a second meeting

431
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
An amazingly

432
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
Diane agreed to meet with them

433
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
She was giving them some

434
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Pretty good advice

435
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,263
Actually that was the meeting where she told us you know I don't want you to do

436
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
Do this on my website

437
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
You are going to have

438
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
You sell this idea

439
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
The other day

440
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,503
Designers and get lots of people on board if I'm going to do this to

441
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,575
So in a sense in that meeting she gave us permission

442
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
To make a cat a consumer-facing business and to approach

443
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
The rest of the industry

444
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
Reroute your business plan right right there

445
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,423
Yeah so did you walk out of her office would like names or contacts or did you just walk out of it hurt her office

446
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,751
Alright cool this is this is clarified we now know

447
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
We're heading

448
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
Well we did ask her

449
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Or

450
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,223
Some introductions and I think that she introduced us to one or two people in the industry

451
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
We then would meet with those people and we'd ask them for introductions and so on and so forth

452
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
But we continue to just cold coffee

453
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
So one of the next people that I cold called was

454
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
The

455
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
President of Neiman Marcus

456
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Because

457
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
He was Botha HBS alarm so I had access to his email address

458
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
And I thought that you know if this whole

459
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Rent the Runway thing

460
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Falls through like

461
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
Maybe I could work for Jim gold Neiman Marcus

462
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
What he say

463
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
He said yeah

464
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,807
This is a really good idea women have been renting the runway from my stores for decades

465
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,415
It's called buying something keeping the tags on and then returning it to the store

466
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
Which probably cost them

467
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Millions of dollars

468
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Yeah it's

469
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
Kind of the dirty secret of retail

470
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
The return rate especially addresses

471
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
And special occasion

472
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
A tire is

473
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Extremely high

474
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
Cashpot forsaken a-10s this question which is

475
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,151
I'm wearing the outfit I'm wearing today like I've worn this in the last few days

476
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,991
I have no shame about it and obviously there's a difference

477
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
Society has different standards for men and women

478
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,135
What is this about what does thing where where

479
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Women

480
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Do you like they can't wear the same dress

481
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
Can two different functions

482
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
I really think that

483
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
There's a value that women place on

484
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Self-expression

485
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
And that clothes make

486
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
You feel a certain way about yourself you

487
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
You put on an amazing outfit in the morning and

488
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,407
It makes you feel powerful or beautiful or sexy or relaxed or however you want to feel that day

489
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
There's just a general value in

490
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,319
Our society right now around individuality and self-expression

491
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
And so the way that you're going to achieve that

492
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
With fashion is via variety

493
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
So I had

494
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Scene

495
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
At the time and it's even more true today

496
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,448
Set the way that women were accessing variety and individuality was through

497
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Fast fashion

498
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
An off-price

499
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Because the only place

500
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
So you could buy a quantity of items

501
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,200
Was at a place that was selling them for a very cheap price Forever 21 or a

502
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Exactly

503
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
So I think sit when you don't have to buy something

504
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
It allows you

505
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
2

506
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
Try

507
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,744
New things to constantly be playful to Experiment 2

508
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
Try things that are in colors or in

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,888
Trends were you know different kinds of styles that you never would purr

510
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Because they're irrational

511
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,520
So with renttherunway it's like a Willy Wonka land of fashion

512
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
Can you can have whatever you want whenever you want

513
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Let's say you have a job

514
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Curfew you have a

515
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
A party you have a wedding you're going to

516
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
You're saying I wanted to arrive at my home on

517
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
September 15th and I'm going to wear it and use it for a few days and then I'm going to run

518
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
And

519
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
It's about 10% of the retail price

520
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
So how did you know for sure that

521
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Are the women will be interested

522
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
In like

523
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
Doing this mean did you get you guys doing research

524
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
No we never did research in an academic sense we did real life research

525
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Which which was

526
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
We went

527
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
To Bloomingdale's

528
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
We bought about a hundred dresses

529
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
All in our own sizes

530
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,504
So that if this whole experiment didn't work out we would have an awesome new wardrobe

531
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
We spent a lot of our savings on this

532
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
And

533
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
We

534
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Hosted a pop-up

535
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
At Harvard undergrad

536
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,536
And we invited different groups of Harvard undergrad to the pop-up and

537
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
Idea behind this was to learn a

538
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Will women rent dresses

539
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,984
B what do they rent how much will they pay

540
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
What brands do they want

541
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
And most importantly

542
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
If they do run

543
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
What happens

544
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
To these

545
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Garments

546
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Destroyed

547
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
Can you send them through the mail

548
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
How do you dry clean these items

549
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
And so on and so forth

550
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
This is like

551
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Still like

552
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Travis seems like

553
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
No brainer but

554
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
Is what 2008/2009

555
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:36,192
This our first pop-up was in April 2009 at that time Netflix mailing

556
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
DVDs in the mail so that was going on

557
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Zappos

558
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
You could get shoes you can mail the bathroom still

559
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
It wasn't like when it is now then it was still new

560
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
It was and

561
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
It feels

562
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,576
Both so long ago and also yesterday

563
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,904
So you got the The Descent right away that

564
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
This that this could work because these these undergraduates

565
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
These women were like yeah I want to read this

566
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,144
I got the sense that it would work because I saw the emotional effect

567
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,216
So in this pop-up I saw girls

568
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
You know

569
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
Stripping down

570
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
Trying on

571
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
These amazing dresses and

572
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Feeling

573
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Beautiful

574
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
And you saw it

575
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Their facial expressions

576
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Change it

577
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,856
They threw their shoulders back and they tousle their hair and they walked with a new sense of confidence

578
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Tencent

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
You know

580
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
I really thought wow

581
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,816
This could be a business that isn't just about offering her irrational or smart choice

582
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
But it also can be a business that is

583
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,264
Delivering something emotional to her making her feel

584
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Beautiful every single day

585
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,432
A lot of founders

586
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
Choose to do it on their own

587
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,320
Like in like Gary Erickson Clif bar or even Sara Blakely

588
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
Thanks and she has a hundred percent of her company

589
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
But

590
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
You guys went for venture capital

591
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
Pretty quickly pretty early on why

592
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
We had to

593
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,472
Raise money because we needed to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory

594
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
2 even

595
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,824
Launch a business or twists whether it was

596
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
A viable

597
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Idea

598
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
And

599
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,760
I don't come from a family that has hundreds of thousands of dollars of

600
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Savings

601
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Especially

602
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392
King of savings that they're going to invest in their daughters

603
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Crazy idea

604
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,304
Until when you were pitching venture capitalist how much money were you looking to raise it in the first round

605
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
We raised 1.75 million dollars

606
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
I mean with that money

607
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
What could you do I just build a website right

608
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
You could buy initial inventory in

609
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Various-sized runs with some depth

610
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:57,760
Because we knew we needed many different designers we needed a selection right you weren't going to come and start renting

611
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
If there were only

612
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
5 units of inventory on the site

613
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
We could hire some people

614
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
We could launch a website

615
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,768
That was about it and take photos of the dresses and put them on the web

616
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
Tell us another funny story until 2 weeks

617
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,680
Before the website launched we didn't realize that we would have to take photos at the inventory

618
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,240
We thought of course in this industry

619
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
There's some centralized plant that takes photos of this how ridiculous is it that every retailer would have to photograph

620
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
This inventory over and over again needless to

621
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
To say

622
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
We figure out like right before the websites

623
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Meant to launch that we have no photos

624
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
And we

625
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,976
Put together a impromptu photo shoot where we

626
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
Found a photographer on Craigslist

627
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,864
Who ended up working with Rent the Runway for 6

628
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Gyro

629
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
And

630
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,008
We bring our own shoes and our own accessories to the

631
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
This photoshoot and

632
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Are you know initials

633
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Team

634
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Of

635
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,456
5 employees in many interns at the time kind of

636
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Figure out how to do it

637
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
So once you

638
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,624
Watch how do you get the word out how do you how do you get people to even know what this says

639
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Hustling

640
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
So was I so

641
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,048
The hustle was we wanted to build

642
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
A list

643
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120
Of as many women as

644
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Possible

645
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
You know the Sex in the City movie had come out that summer

646
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
And we would

647
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:28,384
Go to movie theaters with women who were attending that movie and we would get their email addresses we would

648
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Convince friend

649
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:35,552
Just send us email addresses of other friends if they're so like we were really doing anything and everything

650
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,368
So what are the names that was on this list

651
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
That we had built it Rent the Runway had

652
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,256
A at newyorktimes.com

653
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
And

654
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
I would like my old like there's someone who works at the New York

655
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:53,216
Email address and I looked her up and I saw that she was a twenty-two-year-old technology

656
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Reporter

657
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
Invite her in

658
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Maybe she can write about Rent the Runway

659
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,432
So we met with her and we decided we were going to give her a story

660
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
And

661
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
I

662
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Thought

663
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
That

664
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
If Jenny and I were photographed

665
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
For this article

666
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,392
Potentially we could be on the front page of the

667
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
Business hours of photo the

668
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
Two of you

669
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes

670
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Because

671
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
It was a technology reporter

672
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,608
And no women are ever covered in the Technologies

673
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
So I

674
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,776
Say to this reporter oh maybe you know you should take maybe you could take a photograph of us

675
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
At the kuantan port warehouse

676
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Does the dry cleaner

677
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,920
So we put on like these crazy dresses

678
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
And

679
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
We showed up when the photographer

680
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,040
I showed up to the dry cleaner

681
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
And we stood on ladders

682
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,184
And we told the photographer to take a photo of us on ladders

683
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
In front of

684
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Kind of the

685
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Array of

686
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
Addresses that were on the kind of dry cleaner

687
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Machine

688
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
And

689
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Because the photo was so

690
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Utterly absurd

691
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
It ended up on the front page of the business section and

692
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,640
The headline A1 photo on nytimes.com

693
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:10,528
So we had a hundred thousand people sign up for Rent the Runway off of that story wow

694
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,904
Making orders yes

695
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,488
Did you have the inventory to handle all the orders no

696
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
So what you do

697
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,864
We raised more money so because of of

698
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
Hustling

699
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,008
To get this story in the luck of ending up on the front page of the New York Times

700
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
We met our first year sales projections in 3 weeks

701
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
And we had a clamoring of

702
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
Venture Capital investors

703
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,296
Who were kind of coming into our office pitching us on

704
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,112
Series I so we got we have gone from

705
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,952
You know a very undesirable investment to

706
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
Like people

707
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
Showing up at the elevator

708
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
In our building

709
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
To meet with us unannounced wow

710
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
Because they wanted to pounce on the deal I mean

711
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
But both you and Jenny

712
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Unfortunately

713
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,712
Still rare in in the start of World War II women

714
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,552
Bleeding a huge company and end

715
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
The time when you were raising money

716
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,952
Did you ever get the sense from venture capitalist who presumably most

717
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
But mostly men

718
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
That I don't know they were like

719
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
A little bit dismissive or

720
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Condescending or

721
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
You know

722
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
I know treat you differently

723
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
So we had

724
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,056
Several different very condescending conversations one

725
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
In which a partner at a very

726
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
Prestigious firm took my hand into his and he said you know this

727
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
So adorable

728
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:51,648
You're going to get to wear such pretty dresses this must be so fun for you

729
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
We both froze a little bit

730
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
We were very polite

731
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
And we walked out and we said you know thanks for

732
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
The feedback no of course we never

733
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Interacted with

734
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:11,872
This former this investor again we never pitched them on any subsequent round we were like kind of good riddance to these people

735
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
So there's an element of

736
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
You know we

737
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Hydac

738
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
The capital

739
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
We had choices

740
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Because the business was growing

741
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
That's a privilege

742
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
I read an article that you that one investor says feel like

743
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
Let me talk to my wife about about this idea

744
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,448
Well that's something that we heard all the time

745
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,752
That wasn't one investor that was most

746
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Let me talk to my wife

747
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
My daughter or my admin

748
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
Those were the three

749
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
You know

750
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Target customers that we would hear and

751
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
Let me tell you why each is problematic

752
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
Number one the wife of a venture capitalist

753
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Did the billionaire

754
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
So the wife of a venture capitalist

755
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
Is not Mike Target

756
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
Write the daughter of a venture capitalist in most cases

757
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
This is about 12

758
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Because most Venture capitalists are

759
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
When they're in the prime of their careers their kind of

760
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
45

761
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
50

762
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
So

763
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
You know their daughter is not a great Target

764
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Either

765
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,736
And their admin admins who work in the Venture Capital industry cuz it's such a purse

766
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Prestigious job

767
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
Are often women who are in their 50s and

768
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Again

769
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Not women

770
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
Who were in my target demo so

771
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
We would

772
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Preempt

773
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
.

774
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
By showing videos

775
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
Inviting these investors

776
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
Just some of our pop up show them who the customer was

777
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
So that they really got a son

778
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
For who we were catering to

779
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
That there's been a lot of

780
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
A lot of attention recently to

781
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Chilling

782
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
Roguish culture of

783
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
Venture capital in Silicon Valley and

784
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,392
And how women are are finally in a public leaving

785
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Come out and talk more about

786
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
Their experiences

787
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
Did you experience some of that

788
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
Culture in espresso

789
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
I

790
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
Through the process of building

791
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
Renttherunway was sexually harassed

792
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
I'm by one individual

793
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
And I'm happy to

794
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Share that experience

795
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,152
However I will say that

796
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,456
I've had interactions with

797
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
Dozens and dozens event

798
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Capitalist

799
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
Doesn't the firm's and

800
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
This was to

801
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
Just one individual

802
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
So

803
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
The

804
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Far far far majority of my interaction

805
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Have been

806
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
Incredibly positive but I

807
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
It was in a situation once where I was kind of

808
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,288
Proposition sent sexual text messages

809
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Trying to raise my Rent the Runway

810
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,248
While I was building the company yes from someone in the investor Community sending you text messages like

811
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
Let's go on a date or whatever it was

812
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,648
God and things that are more explicit than that

813
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Toot Toot Tootsie together

814
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
I was

815
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
I thought that it was

816
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,192
Inappropriate and enter fairly bizarre given that it was happening over text message so there was

817
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Evidence created

818
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Now there was also

819
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,568
You know conversations that were happening

820
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
In person

821
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
That

822
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
We're also threatening and

823
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Very bizarre

824
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Did you just

825
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
Ignore it was there anything you could have

826
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Did you feel like you could really do anything about it except just ignore

827
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
So I initially

828
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
Ignored it

829
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
And

830
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
That was the plan

831
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
I was planning on ignoring it in

832
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
You know

833
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Decided you know I was going to keep it silent

834
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
And then

835
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
This person

836
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,472
Decided to

837
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
You call one of my board members of on the phone

838
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
And so you know

839
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
Jen never

840
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Response to me

841
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,480
And I think that this is a real problem and

842
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:06,880
She's a really unresponsive CEO and she's probably she's doing this to me she's probably doing this to other people and

843
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,672
He really challenged my

844
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
Behaviorist a CEO

845
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Actually that board member

846
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Came into my office to give me

847
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Feedback

848
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
And say I need to be more responsive

849
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Which

850
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Was

851
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
My instantaneous reaction was

852
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Oh my God I can't believe

853
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,432
Set this person after being rejected by making me sexual advances is now trying to ruin my career

854
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
And just a minute

855
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
How Jen handled that

856
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Very tricky situation

857
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672

00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,712
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

874
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Gyros

875
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,552
So in those early days if Rent the Runway

876
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Jenn Hyman face

877
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
The situation where

878
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
One of our investors was

879
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Harassing her

880
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
When she ignored his advances

881
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Took it out on her

882
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,840
He actually complained about her to a member of her board

883
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
Board member ask Jen about it

884
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,752
She decided to be totally transparent about what was going on

885
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
I

886
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,848
I showed this board member the text messages

887
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
At that time

888
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Basically

889
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
You know ask my board member

890
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
How how they like me to respond

891
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
What do board member say

892
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
I mean the board member was shocked

893
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
I bet

894
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
I proceeded to tell everyone else in my board

895
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
As well as some

896
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Key executives

897
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
2

898
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
We're working with me at Rent the Runway at the time

899
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
The board was unbelievably

900
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Supportive

901
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
And we decided that we were

902
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,616
Not going to do business anymore with this individual or his firm

903
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
So there's that form of sexual harassment and I think that that's a lot of what's been getting recent media coverage

904
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
But yeah

905
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
End

906
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,952
Hopefully by nature of a lot of very brave women

907
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Speaking out right now

908
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,072
That sort of sexual harassment will be

909
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Be stamped out of

910
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,168
The industry in one way that I think over time

911
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,984
That it needs to be stamped out as bi

912
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Diversifying

913
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
The sources of capital making sure that 50

914
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
80% of investors

915
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,920
Are women but let's put that aside just

916
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
4 second

917
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,480
The second form of

918
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Sexual

919
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Harassment

920
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Flask

921
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Gender discrimination is

922
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Way more subtle

923
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
And it's way more difficult

924
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
But for instance

925
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Overall

926
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,120
I have seen mail founders

927
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Receive

928
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
You know sometimes

929
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
More mentorship

930
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Or

931
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
More

932
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Chances to be

933
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
Successful they get more

934
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,688
Strikes against them before their investors kind of pull the plug

935
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
In a lot of cases

936
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Women are only given

937
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
You know it's a one Striker you're out

938
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
The CEO and founder

939
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
There are situations where

940
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,512
I've now come to understand that a lot of how deals get done

941
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
And how companies let they get acquired is

942
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
Someone is saying so

943
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,216
Something like oh you should really meet this guy he's a Visionary he's incredible yet

944
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Get to know him

945
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,824
And I think across-the-board more of those

946
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,176
Comments are being made about male entrepreneurs than they are about phenological

947
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
Zwiazek

948
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Society

949
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Feel uncomfortable

950
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,344
Using the words Visionary or brilliant

951
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
To describe women

952
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,464
That's not always intentional I think it's

953
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Ingrained in people

954
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,352
I would say nin in a lot of different instances

955
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,960
People have actually genuinely been trying to be helpful

956
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
Timmy like

957
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
There was a time early in my career where

958
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
And invest

959
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Firm

960
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,872
Beto sesame

961
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
OG and you know you should really meet these other

962
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Entrepreneurs are around

963
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,808
Your own age their brilliant you could learn alot from them

964
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,416
They're building incredible companies they're going to change the world now all of those

965
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,000
Entrepreneurs were men and they were kind of prefaced

966
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Is brilliant etcetera

967
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
And

968
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
The same firm never introduced me in that same way to the same entrepreneurs even though we were at similar tenure

969
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Your aunt

970
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Similar stages in our company

971
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
The irony is a lot of those guys

972
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Are businesses

973
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
You know aren't around any

974
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
And

975
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
You know I'm the one who still chugging

976
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
No I don't think that they were

977
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
Trying to be intentionally sexy

978
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
It's just that

979
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,000
There's a shade to which we all operate

980
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
That puts women at a bit of a disk

981
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
It's really amazing menu

982
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
It it it speaks to the

983
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
This like perception of

984
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Apparent

985
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
Set that's so prevalent

986
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
In the in the pantry

987
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
I think that those power dynamics

988
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
Exist in so many different into

989
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
Mystery up and

990
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
I don't think that it's just

991
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Silicon Valley or technology

992
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Problem

993
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Enough

994
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Why

995
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
I think that the more

996
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Egregious

997
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
Sending you a text message in the middle of the night

998
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Asking to

999
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
To sleep with you sort of

1000
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
Sexual harassment

1001
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
Hopefully

1002
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Can

1003
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Beast

1004
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
Stamped Out via just

1005
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,240
Being more vocal about it

1006
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
I think so that the more subtle form of

1007
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
Harassment /

1008
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
Discrimination or just lack of Opera

1009
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Trinity

1010
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
Is actually the harder problems

1011
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,528
Solve this problem is

1012
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
It's the reason why

1013
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,160
Only 4% of venture capital dollars are going towards women and

1014
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
You know very very

1015
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
Few investors are women

1016
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
So you know we need to fundamentally

1017
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Diversify

1018
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,656
Who has access to power who has access to Capital

1019
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,984
In order to get a diversity of ideas and entrepreneurs out there

1020
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Yeah yeah

1021
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,104
Obviously you have had incredible success despite

1022
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
The challenges

1023
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
That you faced and women in in in Texas

1024
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
As you sort of

1025
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
Begin to develop as a leader as a CEO

1026
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
How did you

1027
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,439
How did you make that transition how did you figure out how to manage lots of

1028
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
I think that

1029
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
It is a continuous work in progress

1030
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:15,679
I had never manage people across the diversity of functions that we have it Rent the Runway

1031
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,519
Rent the Runway is primarily a technology and Logistics

1032
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,127
If 1200 employees 10 employees are in my fashion Department

1033
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
And

1034
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
You know

1035
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,783
Hundreds are in my Logistics Department hundreds are in my engineering department

1036
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
And these are areas

1037
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
In which I had no experience

1038
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
End

1039
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,487
You know one thing that I've learned is that

1040
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Leadership

1041
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:46,143
Evolved over time for small being a leader of a 1200 person company is different

1042
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
Then being a leader of 100% company

1043
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,311
And so I have to really evolve even though I've had the same title

1044
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
4/8 + years like

1045
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
There's so many things.

1046
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
You know I've done wrong along the way

1047
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
And I think that the thing that has

1048
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
Made me grow and develop is

1049
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
The recognition of

1050
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Failure

1051
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
End

1052
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
Desire to

1053
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Improve in the

1054
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
The desire to get better

1055
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
I don't want

1056
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,191
People to have the impression that this was all

1057
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
You know you

1058
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Freda From Success to success.

1059
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Easy never know

1060
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Low points

1061
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,359
Because it would have been like with any comfort

1062
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
And in 2015

1063
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
You got some

1064
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
Tough press

1065
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
About

1066
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
Some people who left

1067
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Company

1068
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
They were quotes newspapers calling it a Amin culture and

1069
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
And

1070
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
And things like that from

1071
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
From some of these employees

1072
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
After that

1073
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
Which would hurt by reading that stuff with some people were

1074
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
Criticizing you and and your and your manager

1075
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Style

1076
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
It was

1077
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:58,079
The most difficult experience of my life actually

1078
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
It was such a difficult time

1079
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Cuz

1080
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
As a woman

1081
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
There's two things they could really call you as a woman

1082
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
They could call you the B word

1083
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
Or they could say you're an idiot

1084
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
And I've never really had a

1085
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,767
Had a fear of someone calling me an idiot

1086
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
But I do value myself

1087
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
For how I try

1088
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
Treat others

1089
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
So to be called mean

1090
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
N2

1091
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
You know

1092
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,103
Be quoted as having a Mean Girls culture at the company

1093
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
Was so

1094
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
Unsettling and

1095
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Sad and

1096
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Arbol de me

1097
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,063
Cuz it's the thing that's the most important to me

1098
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Pino

1099
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,415
What had been happening at the time was

1100
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
The company was going through

1101
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Quite

1102
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
Painful and difficult transition

1103
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
From being a

1104
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
You know

1105
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,007
One phase of a startup to trying to develop some sense

1106
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,359
Entering our teen years are adolescent years and I started

1107
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
To realize

1108
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:08,479
That I needed to make the tough calls and

1109
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
Fire some people

1110
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
That

1111
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,087
Was very unsettling to

1112
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,623
Because

1113
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
We give men permission

1114
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:22,559
As leaders and a CEOs to make the tough choices you know with women

1115
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
We don't give them as much permission

1116
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
To make those tough decision

1117
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,263
And we often when when we do make those decisions are often labeled as

1118
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
The b word or no

1119
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Etc

1120
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
So

1121
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
It certainly was a low point but

1122
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,503
It led to the biggest outpourings

1123
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,623
Of the port of ever had it led to more courage around

1124
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
My own decision making

1125
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
Because

1126
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
I led the company into the best place it's ever been

1127
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,119
And in a sense it makes

1128
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,519
The future less scary because that article or a version of it it will come out again

1129
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,591
And the next time it comes out

1130
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,151
It's just not going to have the same impact

1131
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
On me

1132
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
You mentioned earlier in the interview how

1133
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
You always wanted to

1134
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Run a successful company

1135
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,719
Start a successful company but also have a family in and a kid and you did that Yoo-hoo

1136
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,023
You have a child and a partner and

1137
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
How have you

1138
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Figured out how to

1139
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
To do in the way you wanted to do

1140
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:37,311
First of all let's backtrack to being 28 and having the idea for run the runway and I just want to tell the real story

1141
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Gray hair

1142
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
Because I think that a lot of women to go through this and end

1143
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
They don't talk about it

1144
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,295
One of the major considerations that I had

1145
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
In starting Rent the Runway

1146
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Was

1147
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
Is this a smart idea for me

1148
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,511
Has if Rent the Runway is successful

1149
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
Will I ever be able to get married

1150
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
I was always confident that I would

1151
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
Turn Rent the Runway into a

1152
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,799
Consumer behavior that millions of people did and that I would be able to

1153
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,383
You know I still believe we're going to build a multi-billion-dollar company

1154
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
But

1155
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
At the very very beginning when renttherunway launched

1156
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:20,063
I had been dating someone from Harvard Business

1157
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,855
The school who I was very much in love with

1158
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
And

1159
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
The day that

1160
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,511
Renttherunway came out and we were on the front page of the New York Times

1161
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
Broke up with me shortly thereafter

1162
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
And he told me

1163
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
That

1164
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,215
Realized

1165
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
That he didn't want to be with his equal

1166
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
So that was really

1167
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,455
Sad and disheartening cuz I was very in love with this person

1168
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
And that's what led into this

1169
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Fear

1170
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
No it ended up that the sphere was

1171
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
Wheatley

1172
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,183
Unfounded and I had no issues

1173
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
You know Falling in Love

1174
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
While building Rent the Runway I just think that

1175
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
It

1176
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
It paralyzed me

1177
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,679
What was the number one priority in my life has

1178
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,727
Always been having a family and having kids

1179
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
So

1180
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,823
The amount of happiness that I have now

1181
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
Having a daughter I just got back from maternity leave last week

1182
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
I'm

1183
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,783
Engaged to the love of my life I can't even describe to you

1184
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
The

1185
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,415
Level of joy that it brings into my life on a daily basis

1186
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
To truly

1187
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Have all of my dreams have come true

1188
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
Plaster you guys

1189
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Pad Thai

1190
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
You became profitable which

1191
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
I should point out

1192
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
Exceedingly rare so quick

1193
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
And I mean your

1194
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
Revenues

1195
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,615
Over a hundred million dollars

1196
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
La Quinta

1197
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Public reports

1198
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Devaluation of cumpys I don't even know what it is do you know what it is

1199
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
I do know what it is

1200
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
Yeah but it's

1201
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,879
It's probably higher than you ever met

1202
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Even though it it it made

1203
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Still be on paper

1204
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
This thing that you belts

1205
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
Unnn Jenny built

1206
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,375
Have made both of you rich

1207
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Show me you are even though babe

1208
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,215
Paper you are rich your rich person

1209
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Did not grow up

1210
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:20,383
Well being rich on paper is very different than being rich and reality so let's talk in a few years

1211
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Because

1212
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
I didn't grow up sing I want to found a company

1213
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:30,367
I had this idea for Rent the Runway I saw that it was mission-driven I saw that it was driving self confidence and making women

1214
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,183
Feel incredible about themselves and I knew

1215
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,231
But I had to commit my life to that

1216
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
And I'm really proud

1217
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
That

1218
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
We have had

1219
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Many

1220
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,519
Different women leave Rent the Runway and then raise their own venture capital and start their own companies and go out

1221
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
After their own dreams

1222
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
And

1223
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,359
Jenny and I

1224
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
2 years ago

1225
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Decided

1226
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Start a foundation

1227
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Where we've raised

1228
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Millions of dollars

1229
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
To support

1230
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
Other female entrepreneur

1231
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,135
Scaling their companies and we've now helped

1232
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,463
Thousands of women throughout the United States

1233
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
In scaling their organizations

1234
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
So

1235
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
This mission

1236
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:17,983
Empowering women and making women feel confident is the actual thing that I care about

1237
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Now

1238
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
If it happens to be

1239
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,591
That Rent the Runway

1240
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
Brings me

1241
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,735
The ability to provide for my family and thank my parents

1242
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,831
That would be wonderful but honestly if it amounts to nothing

1243
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:38,719
It is the absolute best experience of my life and I would do it over a million times

1244
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:46,655
Jenn Hyman founder of Rent the Runway by the way her co-founder Jennifer Fleiss recently left the company

1245
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
It was amicable

1246
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,007
Both Jen and Jennifer each own 13%

1247
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Of the company

1248
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,127
Put them on the Forbes list of the richest self-made women to watch

1249
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
Renttherunway isn't just profitable

1250
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,015
It's also become America's single largest dry cleaner

1251

Dresses from 500 different designers

1252
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903

1253
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439

1265
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

1266
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,399
Time now for how you built that my name is Dustin Haugen

1267
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
We live here in Seabrook Texas

1268
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,591
Southeast Houston Texas up on a ranch and so he spent a lot of time Outdoors

1269
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,455
Age of 10 or 11 his parents started to let him hike in the woods

1270
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
I am self

1271
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,063
And since I was a little kid I was obsessed with survival kits

1272
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,463
But I would go to any store anywhere I would always go immediately to the survival kit section

1273
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,047
He started to design some of his own survival gear and eventually

1274
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
He got a job with the Texas state guard in the story that you hear all the time when you do this case studies of people

1275
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,055
Who are in survival or emergency accidents as if they were never expecting to get into it

1276
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,687
So you need some tools on you it just in case something happens will there be a natural disaster

1277
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,271
Or an emergency that happens while you're out doing outdoor activity

1278
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
You need to have those things on you at all times

1279
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
But most people just

1280
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:47,487
Don't have those things on them at all times I mean most people do not want to carry

1281
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
Bulky survival kit around on a daily basis

1282
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
They don't in the morning Coco

1283
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,679
When they going to work put on their survival kit it's awkward it's weird

1284
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
And people don't like to think about that

1285
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,871
So two years ago Justin started to design a survival belt that you could wear everyday weather

1286
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,431
Where you were heading into the woods or you know just

1287
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,967
Going out to walk the dog

1288
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:13,087
So when you think about a belt you think it has to be comfortable and it has will still be fashionably appealing

1289
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:17,439
So the number one goal is to make sure that everything fits comfortably

1290
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,047
And does not weigh too much or doesn't look weird so setsuna started to research

1291
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
How to make this belt

1292
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
He found out that

1293
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Someone else was working on virtually this same thing and that person lived about 15 minutes away

1294
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,335
So Dustin contacted and he said hey if you know let's work together

1295
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,431
It turns out that other guy was a former engineer at NASA

1296
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
So they decided to partner up

1297
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:45,599
They called a bunch of meals they found a military grade webbing for the belt

1298
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
And I may have to figure out how to make

1299
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
Survival tools small enough

1300
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
To fit into it we had some

1301
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,559
Invent every single small part of most

1302
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,399
So the foil is a custom foil the duct tape as a custom duct tape

1303
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,495
The water container is a custom water container all of the the parts and pieces

1304
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
Required us to go out and test the heck out of it Justin and his partner worked with almost 30 manufacturers to

1305
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:14,783
Custom Design every miniature Gadget that goes into the belt

1306
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,599
High quality button compass

1307
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,695
Purification tablets

1308
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:28,351
It doesn't weigh a ton it's really hard to believe but if you put it on you wouldn't know you're wearing a bunch of survival stuff

1309
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:33,983
Last year Dustin and his partner Nick decided to launch a Kickstarter to get the whole business going

1310
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
They were hoping to raise $15,000

1311
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,919
But they raised a quarter of a million dollars so right now they are

1312
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,319
Extremely busy fulfilling pre-orders and getting them shipped out but they're still experimenting with the belt and test

1313
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,159
Testing it out and Dustin says he wears it every single day

1314
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,559
We were never dating only days I don't wear it is on laundry day when I don't have belt loops because I'm wearing shorts

1315
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,119
Pajamas or something but otherwise

1316
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,935
We are we are our biggest testers

1317
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
It's Dustin Hoggard of Seabrook

1318
