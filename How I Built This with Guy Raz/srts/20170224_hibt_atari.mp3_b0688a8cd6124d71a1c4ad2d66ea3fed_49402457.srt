1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Thanks

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,840
Who are 2019 lead sponsor of how I built

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Campaign monitor

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,400
An email marketing

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Platform used by more than 250 thousand cost

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
With mobile-friendly email Tim

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
A drag-and-drop email Builder

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
And customer support

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
7 days away

10
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Campaign monitor.

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
We started out essentially designing this little game we

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Working things out of wood and painting it so it looks like plastic but it was really would

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
Our idea was to take it to the Toy Show in New York

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
People like this is amazing world we sold 0

15
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
From NPR it's how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Behind the movement

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Bushnell took his love arcade game

18
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,496
Facts that shape the childhoods of millions of Americans

19
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
If you grew up in the US in the 1980s

20
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Then you were probably playing a little bit of

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Best then when your birthday rolled around

22
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
Maybe you celebrated you know

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Like this

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,448
Very iconic sounds Chuck-E-Cheese

25
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,288
The pizza joint with the games that gets you distracted for hours

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
And an Atari video game which could

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
Frankly distract you for a lot longer

28
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Dave brat

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Incredible

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Is it both of these childhood experiences

31
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Who created by the same

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Persimmon seed

33
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
He found it at re just a

34
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,536
Few years out of college and he started Chuck-E-Cheese just a few years after that

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Inferno one

36
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
The kid in Utah in the 1950s

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
Start a very simple lesson about business

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
The dinner one night Mom said boy we've got so many strawberries

39
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
We're not going to be able to eat them all

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Baby wasp will give them away

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,248
I didn't think that much about it the next day I happened to go to the

42
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Grocery store weather

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
And I saw that in the store in the grocery store

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
They were selling strawberries

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
First 50 Cent

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
The basket

47
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
I looked at that

48
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
I said

49
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
That's what the market is

50
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
So

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Went home

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Found all the

53
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Extra little baskets

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Were around the house

55
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
Went out picked a bunch

56
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Strawberries

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
And went up and down this

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Selling

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
The strawberries

60
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
For a discount offer

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Grocery store with c

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
And I sold out

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
An hour

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,088
I mean I don't even think I made it all the way to the end of the block

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
And all of a sudden I had more money

66
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
Then I would make an allowance

67
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
And mowing lawns per year nice

68
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
It's a young entrepreneur

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Yeah

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
And I read that like later on when you were in college

71
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
You worked at

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
Carnivals

73
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
That's correct

74
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
I started out

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Actually on the Midway

76
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,896
Selling balls to knock down Milk Milk Bar

77
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Man guessing

78
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
People's ages weights

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
And occupy

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
And jumping Kearney

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,648
Cyclic shouting at people like come on down

82
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
You got it

83
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Band

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
And

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
I found out that I was kind of

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Kind of good at it

87
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
How do you get into arcade games that start

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
At the carnival

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Yes

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
That was sort of

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Where I

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
God indoctrinate

93
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Because you end up

94
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
What people don't realize how much

95
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Coin-operated

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Games

97
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
It's actually quite surprising

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
And so

99
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
When you look at

100
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,112
Each of the coin-operated games as a little busy

101
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Typically you go into the

102
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,024
Joe's Cafe and say can I put my machine in your location

103
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Then I'll split the income

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
These locations

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,007
This would very often do 100 to $200 a week at that time

106
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
Pinball machines there were mechanical games

107
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
But yeah no video games

108
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Then I was working

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
Summers at the amusement park Winters

110
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Pursuing an engineering degree at the University of

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
And wow

112
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
One day I saw

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Steve Russell spacewar

114
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
What's that

115
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
A guy named Steve Russell at

116
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
MIT

117
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Programmed this game called

118
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Space War

119
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
And

120
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
I was mesmerized

121
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Rice pot

122
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
More context

123
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
My brother says I got to show you something that will knock your socks

124
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Pieces

125
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
Meet me at 1 at the Merrill engineering

126
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
I say 1 in the afternoon on Houston open all night

127
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
And so show up at the Merrill Engineering Building

128
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
And there was space worm he handed me a box that had four buttons on the top

129
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
Rotate left rotate right buyer

130
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
And hyperspace

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
Those were the controls

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
And we played

133
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Until

134
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Literally 5 in the

135
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
And I thought

136
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Wow

137
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
If I could put this game in my arcade

138
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
It would make money

139
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,463
But then you divide a $0.25

140
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Play into a

141
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Half a million dollars

142
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Computer in the math 2

143
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
But I did think to myself maybe someday

144
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
The cost will come down

145
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
And this would be cool

146
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
So you graduate college I guess I'm like the lights

147
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
6668

148
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
69

149
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,223
And and what did you do did you you're in Utah did you start a business or did you decide to

150
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Where did you go

151
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,623
My wife's sister lived in Silicon Valley

152
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
And

153
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
I was a little bit of an anarchist

154
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
At that time

155
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
Call me a lapsed Mormon or failed Mormon or whatever

156
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
And I kind of wanted to get out of Utah and see the world

157
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
And so California seems like

158
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Cool place to go

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
So

160
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
That Thanksgiving we drove to

161
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
California stayed with

162
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
My wife's sister

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
And I paper the street with two of my resume

164
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
And got a job at Ampex

165
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
An Empire

166
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Expose

167
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Electrical

168
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
Who invented the videotape machine

169
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
And instant replay

170
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,559
I worked there for 2 years

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
But about

172
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
18 months in

173
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
I discovered

174
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Egg

175
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Computer that looked like it was fast and

176
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
To do a video

177
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
So you're thinking

178
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Start something

179
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
It started out a little bit as a research project and then I said yeah I'm going to start something you didn't

180
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,807
When I was

181
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
Driving down the Sierras towards Silicon Valley I told my wife I said you know in 2 years I mean

182
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Start my own company

183
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
I just knew that was kind of on my trajectory I didn't know if that time

184
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:40,031
Who's going to be a video game company I just thought I'd do it you know and in the back of my mind and I always kind of had the

185
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
I think I've always had it since 8

186
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
Why didn't you start this computer company dislike game company

187
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
My office mate was a guy named Ted that me this was a damn pics and I said I'm just started company

188
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
Former partnership we had this computer and the computer was

189
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
Mind-numbingly slow and

190
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
In order to make the economics work the computer cost like $5,000 free games at the time

191
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
I needed to be less than $1,500 so the way I was going to do it as I was going to die

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,295
Timeshare that one computer across three

193
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Screens with three coin slots on a belt that I could get

194
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
$1,500 that way you were trying to design basically what would become an arcade machine like

195
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Moschino be installed somewhere

196
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
People put in a quarter and they could play a game

197
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,591
Where did you install this Arcadian where was it

198
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
We put it in a bar

199
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
Call the Dutch Goose it was in Menlo Park it was right next to Stanford University

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
The game was

201
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,463
Smash Hit at the Dutch Goose I license the game to a company called money Associates

202
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
And

203
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
Realize that it did really well on college campuses so

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
I mean it sold a couple million dollars in

205
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Units

206
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Which was

207
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Tumi

208
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
A big hit

209
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
But to the industry was kind of a mediocre

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
QWOP

211
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
I had a 5% royalty and so that was a

212
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
You know

213
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
$100,000

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Masamune smite

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Put this in context

216
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,647
I came to work at Ampex for $825 a month is

217
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Associate engineer

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
How did you fund

219
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
The company from the beginning what did you have to go to outside investors and ask them for money

220
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
No

221
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
This was also

222
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
It's a time when venture capital

223
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Was just getting started

224
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
And so

225
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,383
Ted put in $250 I put in $250 and that's all the money that went in

226
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Atari 500 bucks

227
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
Atari

228
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
I'm in your first game was

229
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
Was a flop so how did you guys

230
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Patrick is going to do the neck

231
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Well

232
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Then came

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Bow Wow corn which was our first

234
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Technical employee

235
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Cuz we were growing and we needed to get some more.

236
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
And I gave him a

237
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Simplest game

238
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Like it's think of

239
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Which was a ping pong table

240
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,823
When you think you're going to be in the video coin-operated video game

241
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
You write down every sport

242
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
You can think of every constructs

243
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
And ping pong was one of them

244
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
And you went off

245
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
And

246
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
He basically had

247
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Twerking

248
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Where to eat

249
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
It was

250
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Really

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Quick

252
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
And we are talking about what of course became

253
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Tongue

254
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,375
Which was just like two lines with a ball bouncing around a screen between those lines

255
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Correct

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
And

257
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
It turned out

258
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
I thought it was going to be a throwaway

259
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
Yeah there was just a training

260
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
And it just

261
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Turned out to be fun we were staying

262
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
After work.

263
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Play the damn game

264
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
And then I get the idea

265
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
Maybe Valley wants this game

266
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
Ballyhoos also a big coin operated game

267
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Player

268
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Out of Chicago

269
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:17,119
Getting the airplane fly to Chicago I have a little mock-ups that I can a portable unit

270
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
And I showed to them

271
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
And they don't like it

272
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
It's a two player game

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
And the coin operated world doesn't allow

274
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
For two player game if there's not a one player

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
At that time

276
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
That was sort of

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
Written in stone somewhere

278
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Annals of quintus

279
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
World

280
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Kind of dejected

281
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
On the way to get on the airplane to come back to California

282
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
I get a call from you

283
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Who was the engine

284
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
And they had a service call

285
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Cuz they

286
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Put a basic pong game in a cabinet

287
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
And

288
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
Put it in a bar and the game

289
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
Became so popular that it filled up

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
The coin box lid couldn't take any more quarters

291
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
So I think to myself

292
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
Maybe I don't want Valley to happen

293
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
Because the math were so outstanding

294
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
Little Machines could literally pay for themselves

295
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
I mean the game was earning

296
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Almost $300

297
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Weak wow

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
And the total cost

299
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
That we had

300
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Was about to

301
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,847
So you're thinking maybe we should just message me the machines and

302
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Lens license

303
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Exact

304
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
So is that what you did

305
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
So that's exactly what we did I looked at all the cash we had

306
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
And we have enough cash.

307
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Build

308
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Like 12 units

309
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
You know the minute I got off the airplane

310
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Disability

311
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
The order for the parts

312
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
And we were Off to the Races

313
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Get on the phone

314
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
I have

315
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Literally orders coming in from all over the nation

316
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
What about pain today in its 2

317
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Basic

318
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah rudimentary

319
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Damn it in the context of the early 70s revolutionary

320
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Absolutely

321
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Put it in context

322
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
People would come to me and say

323
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
How does the

324
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
The TV station know that I turned it off

325
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
Nn

326
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,559
Clearly they're construct was it if there's something on a TV screen

327
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Game from studio somewhere

328
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
And so that was kind of the

329
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Constructs

330
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
That we were dealing with

331
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
But

332
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
You know there's there's actually some.

333
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Interesting psychology

334
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Looking back on it

335
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
And one of the reasons that I think Pawn

336
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
With such a massive success

337
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Is that it

338
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Fed into the narrative

339
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Of what was going on at the

340
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Time

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
You know just after the Summer of Love

342
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
The hippie movement

343
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,839
Women's Liberation was was starting to rear its head

344
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
And

345
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Pain by its structure

346
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Made it

347
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Ladies choice

348
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Because

349
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,615
Kim very acceptable for a woman to

350
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Tampa guy

351
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Sitting at the bar

352
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Unshorn say

353
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
I want to play Pong would you like to play All by

354
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,903
Who knew pong's ruffle in the history of women's Liberation exactly

355
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Nolan Workwear companies

356
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
Just calling you or establishments

357
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
Just calling you

358
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
That was

359
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
And so

360
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Orbitz

361
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Bibleman is we had no Factory we had no systems we had no procedures we have no employees I mean we have

362
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
There were four of us

363
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
And you guys are all in your like

364
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Mid-to-late twenties

365
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,831
And in fact I think was 23 he just he just graduated from Berkeley

366
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,951
And we had a thousand square foot roll up which we thought was huge with six

367
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
What time is it

368
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:01,631
This was in Santa Clara California then we found out that we had a real problem

369
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
We could build these games literally into days like literally my hand with Wooten nada.

370
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
But we had neglected to buy shipping cartons

371
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
We couldn't ship them on common carrier

372
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
And so to solve that problem

373
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:28,511
We bought an old furniture truck and started making deliveries without cartons to Los Angeles

374
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
But usually driving down the 101 or something

375
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Yeah but

376
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
Slowly we were able to get procedures in place we were able to

377
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Get systems

378
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
And how we Finance

379
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
The company was we would sell for cash

380
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
The machine

381
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
We have 30 day terms

382
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
Most of our parts we had 68 terms so we can get the cash

383
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Literally 60 days before we had to pay for the parts

384
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
Meditite

385
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
How many of these

386
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Arcade pong machine

387
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Out there and

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
450

389
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Mm

390
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Only if which

391
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Atari only did about 35000

392
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
We got massively coffee

393
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,335
But you couldn't you couldn't prevent these companies from basically stealing your idea and copying you

394
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
I didn't have patents yet there was on those days patents were just

395
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Swoboda

396
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
China

397
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
So there was no so basically you could do nothing

398
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Nothing

399
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
And when we were copied

400
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
We knew we didn't

401
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Havasu fishing to manufacture

402
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
We knew we didn't have as much money

403
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
We knew we didn't have as good a relationship

404
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
With the distributor chain

405
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,447
That the competitors that have been dealing with them

406
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
After 20 years

407
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Dad

408
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
And so

409
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
I felt

410
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
My only tool

411
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Was innovation

412
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
An understanding of the technology cuz

413
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
Copying the technology news and creating the technology

414
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Different

415
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
So you were still not really proper

416
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
You were just kind of breaking even

417
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Cash was always our limitation

418
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
And I tried to get

419
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Neo investors

420
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Everybody thought

421
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
What kind of flake

422
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
They thought who's going to pay for this thing

423
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
Exactly how did you

424
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Even come up with the idea that maybe

425
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
We should sell this to

426
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
People and they could do it at home

427
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
One day we

428
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Figured out

429
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Is there was a new semiconductor

430
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
Technology called in Channel MOS and

431
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
These chips once they were designed you could buy him for five bucks

432
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,391
It occurred to us that we could put pong on a sink

433
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Google trip

434
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
And hit a price point that would

435
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Sell to the consumer

436
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
And how did you even begin to think of

437
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
Ways to do this cuz you gave me your you're talking about

438
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Like

439
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Building a cabinet for a

440
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
A giant

441
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,311
He just didn't like how do you shrink that down a house

442
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Well

443
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
Once you had it on a single chip

444
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
Then it was just a matter of putting two knobs on a piece of

445
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Plastic

446
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,087
We started out essentially designing this loaf

447
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
Game looking thing

448
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Atwood

449
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,511
The painting it's a little look like plastic but it was really would

450
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Ideal

451
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,399
Was to take it to the Toy Show in New York

452
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,287
Disa toys at toy convention like like 7475

453
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
And you should look like this is amazing world

454
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
0

455
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
And it was a great demo on everything

456
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
But we didn't know

457
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Is it

458
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
The toy business at that point in time

459
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Did not sell anything

460
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
That was more than 35.

461
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
And how much were you

462
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
You selling this

463
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Atari console

464
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
70

465
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
Which in 1935

466
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
It was a lot

467
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
And so we thought

468
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Spent all this money to get this

469
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Think developed

470
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Our neighbors wanted

471
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
And they were happy to

472
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Spend 70

473
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
Did you leave that Toy Show feeling

474
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Dejectedly

475
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,647
Who's abject failure must have been pretty

476
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Depressed sfter Pinellas money of this thing

477
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
I don't

478
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
I'm not easily depressed

479
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
But I'm very easily challenge

480
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
And I said you know

481
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
There's something not right here

482
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
We just haven't found the right guy

483
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
What do you mean you haven't found the right guy

484
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
The right distribution Channel

485
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,175
To be so you're thinking these guys are wrong I know this is going to work at exactly

486
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Exactly I said these guys

487
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
You're missing a wonderful Opera

488
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
And so we were thinking

489
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
RadioShack of sinking

490
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
TV dealerships

491
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
I was thinking all kinds of stuff

492
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
And then

493
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
My head of sales

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Thought about

495
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Sears

496
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Sporting Goods

497
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
And

498
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
The previous year

499
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
Sears Sporting Goods really focuses on

500
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
The inclement weather family room

501
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
And they sell pool tables

502
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
And ping pong tables

503
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Things like that

504
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
The year before they had

505
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Made

506
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
The consumer

507
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Pinball machine

508
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
For $200

509
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
And they sold out

510
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
So

511
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
My sales guy said maybe these guy

512
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
Tyson so he calls up the buyer at Sears 40

513
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
It's a song that's kind of interesting

514
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
The next day

515
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
He was honored

516
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
And they were based in Chicago at the time

517
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
They were based in

518
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Chicago fire comes to

519
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Find out

520
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
Comes and says I want to see what

521
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Your

522
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Exactly

523
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,087
And that we actually had to scramble cuz we didn't realize he was coming he didn't say am showing up

524
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
He just showed up

525
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
And so we were in the car for

526
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,975
Resume if that is okay

527
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,767
Do that how many can you build

528
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
We didn't have

529
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,167
Because we were rebuilding coin-operated games you know

530
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Where a big run with 5000

531
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
We kind of do it

532
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Automax put check on

533
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
And so we did a huddle outside

534
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
I had my

535
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,087
It's so not wanting to be sole source

536
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
I said we can do about 7

537
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:21,024
You go back to the Sears guy and say we could do 75000 after your own guy tells you

538
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
225

539
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Yeah okay

540
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,192
Yeah I kind of corny

541
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
He give us an order 450

542
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
And

543
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
He want some delivery by Christmas by you know october-november basically

544
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
6 months

545
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
To to build a factory

546
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
The Train the personnel

547
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
To sort out the technology

548
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,464
Naruto has anybody in Atari freaking out at this point

549
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Everybody is

550

552

Who sang all this month we are asking our listeners

573
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
To tell other people about podcast

574
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
Especially podcast that you love or podcast you think

575
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
They might live

576
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,472
So if you know somebody who doesn't listen to podcast

577
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,800
Listen to podcast but doesn't listen to the one you like

578
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Tell them about it

579
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Even better show them how to download a podcast

580
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
And then tell us what you've been recommending

581
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Use the hashtag

582
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
Tripod that's try

583
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Pod

584
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
And thanks

585
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm guy Raz

586
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
It's 1975 Nolan and his Partners have gotten a huge order from Sears to make a

587
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Consumer version of pain

588
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,288
Insulin need to figure out how to build a manufacturing chain

589
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Virtually

590
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Overnight

591
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
We sit down

592
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,432
And we say okay if we were to build

593
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
150

594
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
How would we do it

595
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
But then

596
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
The big question

597
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
How much money are we going to make

598
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,976
After we spend all this money on the factory and we rely

599
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
We didn't learn

600
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
So I call it

601
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
The serious buyer and say I ate do this to you

602
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
I'm going to have to up the price what was the price that he wanted to

603
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
We were

604
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:48,640
Quoting a retail price of 59 and we decided that we needed an extra twenty bucks

605
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
Per unit and he said

606
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
That's okay

607
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Like I can do

608
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
Then I went through the math and there was no way

609
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,416
That I had enough Capital to put in the conveyor belts to rent the extra

610
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Sorry

611
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,768
To buy the parts and I calling up in a skillet

612
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,096
I really appreciate the word but I said I can't find this

613
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,424
Don't worry I'll introduce you to seers bank

614
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
And so

615
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Sears Bank set up a

616
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Bonded Warehouse

617
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
The end of the conveyor line in so as soon as

618
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,456
Babe consumer pong dropped off the assembly line they would Advance us

619
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
80%

620
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,808
Of the contract price with Sears

621
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Donaldson

622
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,184
The Atari console that you were building only play Pong

623
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,304
And did you get it to them in time under 50000 consoles by Christmas

624
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
We did

625
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,704
In fact I think that year we sold almost a hundred eighty thousand they took them all

626
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Wow

627
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
I mean at this point

628
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
You cry guess

629
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
See you guys in Benfica

630
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Home

631
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Computer game

632
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Exactly

633
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,552
And then how did you go from making one console to play one game 2

634
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,880
AKA home video game system that played a bunch of games

635
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Well we realized

636
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
At that time

637
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
When we were doing the

638
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
One game $70

639
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
That this was an interesting

640
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Business

641
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
An end

642
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Then

643
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
Magical thinking

644
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
A

645
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,664
Semiconductor Company in Silicon Valley came up with the

646
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Microprocessor

647
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,064
That they were willing to sell us for $8 and all of a sudden

648
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,880
Their eyes were opened and we said

649
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
We can do

650
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:41,792
Von Neumann architecture program based put cartridges with ROMs in it

651
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,096
And we can have a program book

652
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,936
That microchip allowed you guys to be sleep create a

653
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Cartridge system that week

654
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
What's the steam turn out right

655
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Exactly

656
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,360
You know it was just a magic time

657
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
For technology

658
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Silicon Valley

659
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Time

660
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
You were as likely

661
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,600
To learn about a new technology standing on the sidelines

662
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Of your kids Little League

663
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,184
As you were

664
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Any other time

665
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
In several times

666
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
I'd be talking about Echo

667
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840
Problem we were having with

668
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
With the

669
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
One of the other parents

670
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Oh yeah

671
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
We had chip like that in

672
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Development

673
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Would you like a prototype

674
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,312
It's not going to be really on the market

675
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
For 6 months and I take

676
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Yeah we we don't need production quantities for 6-month

677
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
You're not going to get that if you're

678
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
A technology company in in Oshkosh

679
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
Where I mean were there many companies

680
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Insulting Valley the time that we're

681
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
I can't think of another one

682
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,096
We kind of always felt like we were the sleazy

683
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
Company who

684
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
Focusing on fun instead of all this

685
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
How many more

686
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,592
Megabytes can you get on a hard drive with the Sirius company is where they

687
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Grateful Dead

688
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
We liked our

689
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Rebel status

690
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,344
And we were Rebel in it several ways first of all we were all young

691
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,184
I was the youngest CEO and people didn't know

692
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,816
But think about a CEO in their twenties then we that was just off the radar

693
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,704
And I actually feel like I paved the way for Gates and jobs and some of the

694
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,800
Idea that you can be young and still a serious businessman

695
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,432
But more than that we got known as a real party culture because

696
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,040
Instead of bonuses since all our employees were in their early twenties

697
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
We have a beer bust on the back dock

698
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
And you get in

699
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
$100 for the pizza into kegs

700
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
And you had a party but that was totally unheard of and course we had a game room and we have ping pong tables

701
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Stuff that

702
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Silicon Valley kind of thinks is

703
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,752
Deer ignoring unnecessary now

704
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,056
Yeah it was very very different

705
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,384
And then we didn't have a dress code we didn't have

706
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
Turn clocks we had this attitude that

707
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
Everybody knew what they needed to do and

708
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,672
They were adults and they could wear what they want and they could come and go when they want and

709
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
We weren't Big Brother

710
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,792
Iran so we try to make this meritocracy

711
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
In which outcome

712
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Was the only thing we counted

713
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Is a young CEO

714
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
I think you did a good job where you

715
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
You know where you

716
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Are you a good manager of people

717
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
The time

718
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
So so

719
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
I think I was a good manager of people I think that

720
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
I always had a little bit of an inferiority,

721
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Amplex internet

722
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Because my age

723
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
I felt a little bit like a poser

724
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,048
Which was okay with me on some level because of my Carnival background

725
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
But at the same time

726
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
I always felt

727
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
That I didn't know what the hell I was doing

728
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:05,312
And what I didn't realize has the most big companies don't know what the hell you doing

729
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,872
I wasn't mature enough to understand that

730
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
All companies are somewhat screwed up

731
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,504
Did unnu clearly you like head and I-4

732
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,136
You could have I for hiring interesting people I mean I think anyone knows a little of the story

733
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak

734
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Work for you

735
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Steve Jobs work for me

736
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
And he was a technician

737
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
In quality control use

738
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Really good at it

739
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
I can remember him coming insane

740
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,008
Knowing if you allow these kinds of solder joints you're going to have

741
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Failures in the field

742
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Did you already tell like that

743
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,944
Yeah we think of him as a server Mercurial kind of

744
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,784
Impetuous leader was he like that even as a

745
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
20-something kid

746
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
He was opinionated but he was never wrong

747
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
In his opinion

748
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,536
You didn't have to worry if you empowered Steve to do something

749
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
It happened

750
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
I mean Steve had one speed

751
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
It was full on

752
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
And so

753
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
He got the

754
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
The Apple going and he came to me and says I want to start this

755
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
And I'm going to be leaving do you want to be

756
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,248
My first investor and I'll give you a third as a company for $50,000 and you said of course

757
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
Yeah I did not say that

758
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,648
I've regretted it but you know anyway

759
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
It was fun times

760
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
Exactly

761
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,328
Doesn't matter it would have ruined my life would have made you

762
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,912
Totally insufferable and I was already in Suffern

763
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
Goodness you did not

764
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
Take that deal

765
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,824
Exactly so all right so you're running Atari

766
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Doing really well

767
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
And then what you decide to sell it

768
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,296
So I felt that we had to take the company public

769
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Drai's

770
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
15 million dollars

771
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
It seems pulp right now but that

772
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Was all the money

773
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
In the world to us

774
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Time

775
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
And

776
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,632
The market Hiccup and they said because there's just no way we're going to do it and a little 70

777
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
This was the summer

778
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Summer of 76

779
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,104
And all the sudden we had Christmas coming and I knew I didn't have enough money

780
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Even with Sears

781
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
To be able to

782
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Get this

783
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
New

784
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Massive

785
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
We wonderful product into the market

786
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Replace this is that the Atari console with the

787
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
What cartridges

788
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Yes that's correct

789
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
So

790
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Without an ability to

791
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:34,560
Do that I said maybe it's time to get a corporate partner

792
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
And so I started Dialing for Dollars from corporate partner Warner communication

793
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
Showed up and said will not only put up the money but we'd like to buy you and will

794
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
Pay you money and will put money into the company and you will get this big royalty stream

795
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
And we understand producen we're going to link arms and March into the sunset

796
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
And what was the 28 million bucks

797
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
I mean you know I was born boy from Utah I mean you could buy a Learjet in those days for milk

798
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
So you took the money

799
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Took the money

800
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,712
And so what happened to oh so you continue to work for a Target that point

801
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
That's a lie was not as rigorous

802
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Is I had been

803
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,976
I started started taking care of my personal life instead of my business life

804
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,096
And I found that there were a lot of decisions that were being made that will really

805
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
Really pretty toxic

806
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Decisions about

807
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
Where to take the company

808
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Yeah and slowly we

809
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
Brought in a president of

810
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Consumer

811
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Who had

812
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
All the hierarchy

813
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
No Reserve

814
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Turkey places

815
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Executive dining room

816
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
And all the things

817
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
That were enactment

818
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,976
Yeah you're going from keg parties on your loading dock to an executive dining room

819
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Yeah and I just thought that was so

820
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,096
Wrong on so many levels because

821
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
I don't think you need to

822
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
Arbitrarily create an us-versus-them mentality in your company you know and

823
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,640
One of the things that happens when your own by New York company

824
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
They think that you're laid back Style

825
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
Is that you're not working so hard and they think the people that come in at 10 should be fired

826
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,440
And so the bottom of a sudden there was this Clash of cultures

827
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
That got to be really ugly and ultimately they they got tired of me and I got tired of them and

828
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,984
I was fired how long so so between time they bite you in the time that you were ousted

829
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
How long was it

830
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
20 months

831
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
Wow that must have been tough. For you

832
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Actually not

833
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:03,808
I kind of you business

834
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Like the game of chess you play the game you play hard sometimes you win some

835
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,608
When you set up the pieces Newport or again and you don't have eggs oh my God

836
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008
Watch the game of chess what am I going to do what was me and what that allows you to do

837
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:29,408
Do is to view a little bit of sand outside or from yourself things that happened to you

838
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,504
So when something doesn't work out that well you can say G that was

839
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Horrible but it was an interesting experience

840
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
Okay LNG stock oversight because

841
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
This episode

842
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
And here I would say okay that's Nolan Bushnell Visionary who founded Atari

843
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,352
We are not going to talk about the second company you founded which is Chuck-E-Cheese

844
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,960
Yeah how did that happen how did how do you even come up with this concept

845
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Well

846
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Math

847
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Is very simple

848
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,616
Before I sold Warner we were selling games these are coin-operated

849
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,712
We were selling them for about $1,500

850
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
During their lifetime in coin drop

851
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
They turn 30 to 50000

852
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
So it didn't take rocket science

853
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Meant to say I'm on the wrong side of the

854
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Equation

855
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
I need

856
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
To be operating

857
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
These things 2 app

858
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Stent

859
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,328
But I didn't want to compete with

860
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
The guys I was selling to

861
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
So I decided I had to

862
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,936
Create my own location

863
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
I thought to myself

864
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
What are people going to

865
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
Come to this freestanding arcade

866
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
And I decided that

867
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
Adding food would be

868
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
A benefit

869
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
Because in families could come

870
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
And that

871
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Indicated

872
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
Pizza because there was weight

873
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
And that would be good game playing time

874
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,672
When we was still mulling this whole concept

875
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Around

876
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
I went to Disneyland and went to the teacher

877
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Oh yeah and I said

878
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Can do this my guys can make these

879
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
Creatures can animate things

880
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Then

881
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,568
I realized that I really wanted to have

882
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Branded mask

883
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
And that I wanted it

884
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
The longer

885
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Perform entertainment

886
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
I figured

887
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,320
Kids are going to be wanting to play the games parents are going to be bored

888
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,880
The more I can entertain them unless they're getting anybody there

889
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
Believe so I said

890
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,840
Let's do some animated Skits the whole idea was to make it seamless

891
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
Not have labor costs just make it happen

892
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
So anyway I went to a amusement tradeshow bought a costume

893
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,712
Look up costume that they live like a human. Your guys are just

894
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:46,112
Turn into an animated robot Chuck-E-Cheese which was

895
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,512
A rat's right what restaurant is going to pick a rat as their mascot and think that's going to work

896
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:58,912
Well understand when I bought the costume I thought I was buying a Coyote Ugly

897
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:05,312
The code the code name was coyote Pizza in my guys I said how's the coyote coming is a

898
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,384
What kind of acid will the costume I sent you

899
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Oh you mean the rat so all of a sudden we had a problem so I said okay

900
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,184
Will be coyote pizza anymore it's going to be regrets pizza and Rick rats Pizza that was going to be the name of

901
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,536
Who was Danny pizza place called Rick rats Pizza

902
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
That's exactly what my marketing department said and they said they said

903
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:38,336
No wipers no that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard they said we couldn't even know they'd be on the garden

904
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
You wouldn't get our help license plate

905
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
And I said okay you name it I don't care but it has to be a happy name right and so they came back all smiles

906
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
The next week

907
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,952
We've got the name it's a three smile name

908
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,744
Chuck-E-Cheese

909
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,864
So hot so what happened you you opened up your first location in Silicon Valley

910
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,936
Yeah it was it was basically in San Jose

911
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Who took over

912
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
8 Old Dean Witter office and it was like five thousand square

913
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
What's huge

914
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
Compared to the pizza parlor

915
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
We knew the day we open

916
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
That we made a huge mistake

917
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,064
Wow you mean it was that popular

918
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Massive

919
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
I mean Lions out

920
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
The door on a Monday

921
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976
With your customers little kids who who's coming

922
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:33,632
Everybody but then we sold the company and Warner didn't want to be in the restaurant business

923
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,216
You you sold a tie to Warner

924
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:42,592
Chuck-E-Cheese with was kind of hard because you created while you're there so

925
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,664
For you to keep Chuck-E-Cheese you had to buy it back from them

926
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Half a million dollars

927
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:55,392
500000 bucks by Chuck-E-Cheese and one open store

928
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,976
Door was Cash 4 and 1/2 million dollars a year and

929
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,536
They let me pay $100,000 for 5

930
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
And that was maybe the deal of a lifetime

931
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:11,520
I had this business that was positive cash flow day one well I was

932
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
Still chairman of Atari

933
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,200
And I I had a team of people that have been working on it I brought them on my payroll

934
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,832
And we immediately expanded to the second store this one was 25,000 square feet

935
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,160
And I was having more fun

936
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,512
Chuck-E-Cheese when I was having Charlie Charlie was getting political

937
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
So when we decided to

938
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,840
Part ways

939
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,960
Focus all my time on on Chuck-E-Cheese and I was going to happy about

940
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,104
Been pretty liberating to work on this thing that you know you were likes

941
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
You know sometimes

942
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
I feel that inadvertence

943
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Shines on

944
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Because

945
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
I hadn't even thought about franchise

946
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
I got came in

947
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
And said

948
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
I want to franchise

949
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,304
And we started franchising and so the franchise business was hugely

950
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
So how many Chuck-E-Cheese locations did you

951
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Eventually

952
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Franchise

953
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,032
I sold the company when we were about 280 stores

954
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
And half were franchises.

955
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
So we build by 220

956
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
And Francis

957
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
What what

958
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
Opposite of mistakes do you think you made

959
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
That you learn from

960
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
At Chucky

961
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,440
I think that I didn't understand

962
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
The nature of

963
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Entertainment

964
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
Now that sounds funny coming from the amusement park and all that

965
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
But entertainment is very

966
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
Fragile

967
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,752
It's driven on

968
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Novel

969
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
And so

970
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
When we were first open

971
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
A unit

972
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
People would come

973
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
From all around because it was off

974
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:02,111
So that was sort of the half-life of a shine

975
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,463
In which you say G you know this St Louis looks to me like I need

976
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
Ward Chuck E Cheese's

977
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,887
When in fact what you were seeing is this novelty bonus

978
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
And that

979
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
People in normal life

980
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Didn't really want to come to Chuck-E-Cheese

981
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Three times a month

982
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,895
They wanted to come to Chuck-E-Cheese

983
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Every other month

984
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
We got over bill because

985
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,527
We got another false positive

986
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
Who's of pasta

987
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
That you could

988
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
Pack the place

989
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
365 days a year

990
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,303
In a population of 1000000 people

991
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Which couldn't

992
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
It's it's amazing because

993
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Did you

994
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
Build these two iconic

995
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Companies

996
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
I mean

997
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,567
How many server many many people in America

998
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Like to find the Contours of their childhood

999
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
And you've gone to

1000
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
How to start

1001
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
At least a dozen other companies

1002
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Some of what you've been spit

1003
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,367
Killer failures and spectacular successes you've had

1004
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,463
You have this amazing range of experiences on on both ends

1005
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
I guess

1006
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,095
I'm sure the successes were

1007
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
More incredibly satisfying for

1008
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
Provost reasons but

1009
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Do you think the failures were

1010
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,567
Or should have more interesting or

1011
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Appeal time for you learned more about

1012
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
Lifan about you in about

1013
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Business

1014
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
There is no question

1015
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
That

1016
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
A good failure

1017
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
Is good for your soul

1018
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,415
There is nothing worse

1019
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Then feeling like

1020
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,511
You are invincible

1021
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
And really cool

1022
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
And

1023
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Intitle

1024
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Being entitled

1025
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Probably

1026
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
The ugliest

1027
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
That a person can be

1028
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,055
Because all of a sudden

1029
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
It's not

1030
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
What you do

1031
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
It's who you are

1032
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
And

1033
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
People who rely on who they are

1034
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
As opposed to what they

1035
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Baidu

1036
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
Become

1037
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Very

1038
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Banal

1039
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
How long does it take you to

1040
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
To become Who You Are

1041
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
To realize that that's

1042
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
Well I hope that I'm not there yet

1043
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,983
I want to stay on the Steep part of the learning curve

1044
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
In fact I've even

1045
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Dunham methodology on it

1046
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
II

1047
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Force myself

1048
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
Do something

1049
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,455
Totally outside my comfort zone every year

1050
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
And I write down

1051
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,087
11 things that I think I can accomplish in a year

1052
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
That are

1053
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
Outside my comfort zone

1054
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
And then I mix them up

1055
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,559
Put a number on them throw a pair of dice and I have to in that year

1056
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
Do

1057
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
What did Ice tell me to do

1058
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
And I discovered

1059
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Funniest thing

1060
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:00,287
Maybe it's just me but I think it's a generalized principal

1061
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
But when you do different

1062
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Things you're happy

1063
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
That this process of

1064
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
Of expiration and up

1065
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Discovery

1066
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
And a

1067
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Willie Wings

1068
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Out

1069
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,903
The game and the metagame

1070
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
Is very satisfied

1071
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
If you were

1072
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,559
Able to go back to like I mean now you are a

1073
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,911
Elder Statesman of the tech world you're in your seventies and

1074
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
If you could go back to

1075
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
To Nolan Bushnell in the Olay

1076
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,055
70s early 80s and say

1077
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Hey you know I want to give you some advice

1078
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
What would you tell yourself

1079
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Boy that's a real hard

1080
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
Cause

1081
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Some of the bad decisions I've

1082
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,159
Made I'm not sure that I would like my wife

1083
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Tenotomy

1084
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Anthem

1085
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
And I'm not sure

1086
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
That if

1087
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,863
I were to give myself advice

1088
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
And change that projector

1089
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Free I would end up

1090
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Where I am right

1091
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
And I like

1092

Tell me about what you're working on now

1094
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
Well then I'll have to kill you

1095

Go back in the story comes to us from Denise Zimmer about

1111
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:18,527
3 years ago she was planning her wedding near her hometown of Fair Lawn New Jersey 240

1112
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:23,135
We guests 20 tables and $7,000

1113
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Just for the flowers

1114
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,023
Just for the flower $7,000 and it was that frustrating feeling of

1115
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,327
I'm spending all this money on something that

1116
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,727
You know why I want to have but I don't want to be spending this kind of money on quite frankly anything that you know is going to be

1117
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
He was trying to figure out how to cut down on the

1118
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:45,919
Cost she thought about a friend who is getting married the very next day

1119
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,503
So what I did was when I was talking to the forest I was asking them you know

1120
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,903
Is it possible to you know maybe have her Reeves the flowers maybe we can do some sort of sharing and that was kind of that

1121
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
Light bulb moment when I was like okay well the floor is it telling me that this can work and I know that I'll do it and I know that she'll do it

1122
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,423
Okay so ultimately they need and her friend could not make it work it was too complicated

1123
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
But she couldn't let go of this idea

1124
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
So then what am I

1125
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,103
And she start to search through wedding chat rooms

1126
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
You have

1127
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:22,271
Everyone just getting advice from each other and asking its who's in the same area can we share this can we do that and so

1128
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
So I think that was

1129
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,927
Another big moment of opening of customers you want to do this I'm not the only one who's wanted to share my flowers

1130
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,279
A few months later Denise leaves her job at another startup

1131
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
To start bloomerent

1132
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,959
And that Brides In the same city could log on to a website and then share flower arrangements with

1133
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
With other couples getting married on the very same weekend

1134
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:50,431
Bay Beach get a discount on their flowers bloom Red where to get it cut of the florist fee and a florist wood

1135
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
Make it really well to exactly so if you know for them they got to create those centerpieces once and sell them twice

1136
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231
But as neat started to put her website together and then reach out to florist in the New York metro area she was surprised

1137
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
A lot of them said no literally every single person that you know this is a really good idea

1138
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:16,031
Yeah and I love that you're reducing waste but I just don't want to do something new and that is both the most frustrating

1139
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
In the world but it's also

1140
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:24,479
Ian really motivating and so did he just kept at it her first paying client was a friend getting

1141
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
Married in New Jersey

1142
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:32,415
And then things just kind of Grew From there until one person who uses it and another person uses and they tell their friend who tells their

1143
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,487
Our friend and since you started the company three years ago

1144
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
Denise and her business partner have expanded Bloom rn214 cities

And two other events besides weddings

1146
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:47,775
Right now all of their money is being plowed back into the business they're not paying themselves yet

1147
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,567
But this year did he says

1148
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,967
Bill open up the outside investors and those florist that couldn't get behind Bloom rent at the beginning

1149
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:02,367
You know what's funny I do actually have that list I do have a small list of people that I am definitely planning on calling in

1150
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,207
