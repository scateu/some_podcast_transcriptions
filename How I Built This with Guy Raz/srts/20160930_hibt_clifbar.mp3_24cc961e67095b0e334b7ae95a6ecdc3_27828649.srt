00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,600
I left that morning for the office knowing that's the day and I was

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Sitting in the office waiting and my partner was on the phone talking to the lawyers you know. Ended on the eyes

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Is the cross the t's on the contract is that day you're you're you're about to go and sign your name on the car

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Contract that very day

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,032
It was indeed like within an hour We're we were ready to get in the car and go over

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
And I

11
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,408
Should I got to take a walk around the block and so I did

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,272
Went out to the parking lot and I just started weeping

13
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,600
You couldn't even want to do it

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
Do you want to do it

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
From NPR how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealists

16
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Stories behind the movements they built

17
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
I got on the show today

18
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,624
That's first name to create Clif Bar what are the most popular energy bars in the country

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Back in the 1980s energy bar was shut down your throat before

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
Running a marathon or going skiing and that was a whole aisle of Lara and Luna and chia bar

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Bars in the supermarket

22
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,944
And they weren't in the bottom of our backpacks are in the glove compartment of our cars

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
In the late 1980s

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Gary Erickson was living in the Bay Area he was one of those guys who would inhale energy bars right before

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Signing or racing his bike

26
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,840
And also that he was working at a bicycle seat back during which was going to was fine

27
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
For a little while I think all along I even through high school I think I always wanted to have my own business

28
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
And even though managing

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
A manufacturing facility making bicycle seats

30
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,664
Felt close to have my own business it wasn't my own business

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
And then

32
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
Crazy thing happen

33
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
I was saying my mom's

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Kitchen table and she was serving me this

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
My mom is Greek and my grandmother's Cregan

36
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
They taught me how to bake a young age in my my

37
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
Mom is serving me something was like a calzone and we called a Greek calzone

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
And I looked at that and I said

39
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
You know I bet I could sell these

40
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
And so here I am of God

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm working for the bicycle company and racing bicycles now I'm going to start a business

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
So we made a few in her kitchen I went out to some delis around Berkeley and San Francisco and are they

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
They were hit people pick them up but what's inside of them

44
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,648
I'm so we had different feelings the typical Greek filling the spanakopita which is a spinach and feta cheese

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
They were really delicious

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
This wonderful brioche

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Kind of dough

48
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
But

49
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
When I started this business I needed to

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
To keep working so

51
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Cuz I

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
Didn't have enough money size funding the business

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
With the bicycle company

54
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
2 fun

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
The small bakery that

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
I started called

57
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Cali Sweets and savouries witch

58
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
I was named after my grandmother

59
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
So at night you would like

60
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,760
The baking like all through the night and then get up in the morning and then like go work in the factory likes

61
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Exactly exactly

62
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
And then one day

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
In 1990

64
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
I was out on a

65
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
A ride with

66
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
A really good friend and we did this one long day trip in the Bay Area

67
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
Is 175 mile one day ride we thought it was going to a hundred

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
25 miles

69
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
And we took along with us

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
6 energy bars are on the market at the time the only energy bar really

71
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
That was on the market at that time that

72
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
So many cycles for eating does power bar

73
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
And they were also from

74
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Coincidentally

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
And so

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,088
We're each packed six of them probably put a banana in there too and we

77
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
Did this ride where there was very few stores and

78
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
When were at the top of

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Mount Hamilton I didn't five of those

80
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
Bars NEARBY

81
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
And I looked at the six month I just said no way I can

82
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
I can't do one more

83
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
I would rather starve than eat another 1

84
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Why

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Latest dare

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Hard

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
They were they never really did taste good but we always as bike racers we always thought of them as the bitter pill that they do the

88
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Job but it's not about taste

89
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
And here I have a bakery and everything we do.

90
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Taste great

91
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,135
We're riding down the hill were coasting down into San Jose to get to a 7-Eleven

92
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
And I turned my friend Janice said you know what I can make a better energy

93
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
That was it

94
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
That wasn't

95
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
Literally the next day

96
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
I called my mom

97
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
And she had help me with all these rest

98
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
Mom I'm coming over and we're going to make

99
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
An energy bar

100
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
She's like what's an energy bar

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,663
Try to explain it to her and I said it's kind of like that great

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,783
Oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookie that you make but we can't use butter we can't use sugar and we can't use oil

103
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Chisel that's impossible

104
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
I said let's just try so for the next 6 months

105
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
I brought over

106
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Bags of

107
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Ingredients that I have been researching on

108
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
And we're not talking about

109
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Exotic ingredients were talking about hole in Greek

110
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Scuzz PowerBar was

111
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Made with

112
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Stuff that

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,799
Was more kind of Highly produced and highly refined

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
And I wanted to be more like my mom's cookie

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
What kind of ingredients are you using

116
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
We were using whole oats

117
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
I'm real fruit

118
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
And a sweetener we didn't use oil

119
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
Or better but we use a sweetener that was made from rice

120
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,047
In a rectangular so they were like a bar and wasn't going to be a cookie and had to be like a bar

121
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
And

122
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
We had many failures

123
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,007
And at times you tried to talk ourselves into that this is great and it then I would bring it out to my friends in

124
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,615
Plastic bags that I was racing with and training with night to hear try this but keep it a secret

125
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
And they be like we'll just

126
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Terrible

127
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
Okay go back to the kitchen

128
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
At what point did you

129
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
Do you say okay I've got this thing we got it

130
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
So it was after about six months

131
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
I was

132
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Trampoline

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
Continue to sound like but we just knew my mom and I just knew like

134
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Okay this is what we were looking for

135
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
And then you take a risk

136
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
You're not sure

137
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
And then you put a package around it

138
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
And that stories

139
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Let you know what another real good friend that I was working with name Doug Gilmour you know I helped him out with some of the advertising

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
For the bicycle company and I knew that he was very very creative

141
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Person

142
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,967
I said you need to design the pack

143
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
And

144
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
He came up with the climbing image

145
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Which is now

146
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
University icon

147
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
And has a very deep meaning of

148
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
You know what the introspection of climbing and

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Especially on an overhang the way it is yeah

150
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
And we needed a name for

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
And they're all kinds of names were

152
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Where

153
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
We are considering

154
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
He wanted it to be Gary bar I didn't

155
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
And one day I was

156
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,591
Crossing the Bay Bridge coming over to work on it with him and

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
My dad's name popped into my head

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
I'm taking

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,223
That makes sense I name the bakery after my grandmother

160
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,807
I can name this after my dad he's the one that influenced me

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,951
With the Great Outdoors this is about the outdoors this is about this is a connection with Adventure it's

162
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
You know taking it on the go

163
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,327
When you are Outdoors you and your adventures

164
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Any perfect sense

165
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
And so we need to Clif Bar after my dad my dad's name is Clifford Erickson

166
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Once you have the bar down the recipe down

167
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
How do you even have the money the resources to

168
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,527
Turn this into a business in a product that you were going to like put your whole life behind

169
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
I never ever would have thought it's

170
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Turn into a house but all I was thinking was

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
I've got this Bakery

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
I can figure out how to make this if I can just take a small market share from power bar then I can continue my life

173
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,191
My style and have the freedom of my own business

174
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,823
And do something that I love to do which is both run a business and make a great product

175
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
And that's that was easier said than done

176
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Why is that

177
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
So

178
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
We

179
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Try to make it in our Bakery we just didn't have the equipment

180
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
To do it

181
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
So I found a bakery down the street

182
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Dad agreed to help me

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
Produce it like a like a mom

184
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Like a cookie Baker

185
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
And we

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Leverage

187
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
The packaging companies and said

188
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Will pay you

189
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
Will make a small run will give you what we can and

190
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
When we sell the first

191
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Amount will pay you

192
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
I mean back then I didn't really even know what I was doing I wasn't

193
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,783
I didn't learn this in college and maybe it's a good thing I didn't learn this in college cuz I would have done it this way but

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
I just started thinking out loud like how am I going to do this I have no money

195
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
So basically

196
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
You went to these

197
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,255
To the bakery you said I'm not going to be able to pay you right away but then you would turn Rancid

198
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Distributors you would say look

199
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Can you pay me on delivery

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
And then use that money to pay the

201
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
How did you once you start to manufacture

202
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,495
Clif bars like how did you even get

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,103
Anyone interested in the mood while what did you do did you like walk around I just shops

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Some stores and not say I did a couple things one is I

205
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
We go to bike races

206
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Or

207
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
I went to running events

208
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
I just started passing out the bar

209
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
We did one ad

210
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
One advertisement

211
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,791
In bicycle magazine and a few other magazines that was pretty hard-hitting

212
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
I guess power bar

213
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,655
I was like okay there's a new kid on the Block kind of thing

214
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
The title or the headline was it's your body you decide

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
So did you want you want refined ingredients or do you want holinger

216
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Pictures of both ingredients

217
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,199
That cause us to be sued immediately

218
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Oh wow

219
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
Are Insurance picked up the

220
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
The tap and we ended up settling with tar bar

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,719
But it created this buzz in the bicycle industry where people said have you heard of Clif Bar

222
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
I don't think I don't know if you could pull that off now

223
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
And we were the

224
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
You know now there's

225
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Hundreds of bars out there

226
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
TurboTax

227
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Us and Them

228
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Did you have to

229
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,079
Like to go out and raise money that you have to ask people to invest in the company or were you able to

230
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Tentative

231
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Somehow do it with very little money

232
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
You know I never thought

233
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Of

234
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783
Either looking for outside money or wanting outside money

235
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
And maybe that was

236
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
A good thing of my knee naivete because

237
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
What you do that you know you lose control of your destiny

238
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
I tried to get a bank on my

239
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
I did get a $20,000

240
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
My father gave me

241
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Office credit card $20,000

242
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
But most of it

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Man I look back and I kind of think how did I pull this off

244
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Because

245
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
And it wasn't big

246
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Yeah this was just

247
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
A few bike shops in a few notches

248
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Food stores

249
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
And

250
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,575
Yeah I remember being at a show like the marathon the LA Marathon setting up a little table

251
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
And

252
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Standing out there in the Isle

253
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
With a tray of cut up bars and and if people like by say try to try this new energy bar and they were like

254
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Energy bar

255
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Alkmaar

256
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
And they try and then they would

257
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Walk along and he wouldn't want to look back and

258
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Mike Cleary. You know

259
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Did my embarrassment and then

260
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
32in and turn around and come right back door what is that

261
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
And I knew you knew you had it then when

262
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
You saw that kind of response

263
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
And so the

264
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
It was Word of Mouth

265
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,671
And the word spread throughout the country so what happened in that first year after you

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Like like

267
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
I mean when you were still

268
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Working at the bicycle company

269
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
Yeah I was working the bus company for 2 more years still in it and I was using that money to as living hand-to-mouth in

270
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
I was sleeping in the garage and

271
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
I was just using that money

272
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
To also fun

273
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
You know some of the extra bills

274
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
And then there was a Tipping Point

275
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
By the end of 1992

276
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
We sold $700,000

277
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
Wow so you were making money within a year

278
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Bobby year-and-a-half

279
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
2 we really started

280
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
We started making

281
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
And

282
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
From there on it was

283
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,607
It was like a wild tools like a getting on a wild horse and hanging on Wii

284
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Almost doubled sales for the next 8 years in a row

285
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
You basically were the artist company right like did you

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
Did you make any mistakes by that point arida sailing on was it like Smooth Sailing

287
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
No

288
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
One of the larger mistakes was

289
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
You know I caught a handshake deal with the time I

290
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Didn't

291
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Use corporate counsel very

292
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Effectively

293
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Fact that you know

294
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Where's were too expensive

295
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Sidon

296
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
I normally use a lawyer so I did a handshake deal with a distributor

297
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
In the early 90s

298
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Where it ended up biting me

299
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Because

300
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
They weren't performing and so I

301
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Cancelled

302
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Quote contract

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
And they came back and sue me for ownership

304
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
Too long of a story but it but it ended up we went to court we settled

305
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
And it cost

306
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
A lot of money

307
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,623
The salad I made a big mistake I never should have done a handshake deal on a distribution International distribution deal like that

308
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
Cheats you almost lost the company

309
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
It yashow it was

310
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
It was a knockout dragout

311
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Fight and

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
I

313
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
That was the most sick to the stomach

314
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
I had felt up to that point

315
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
About business

316
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
One day when I we went to we went to mediation and I fell

317
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
At the end of mediation outside

318
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Oh my God I could lose this whole thing

319
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
So we fight we fight we negotiated it ended up being just

320
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Pam off

321
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
Cost a lot had to go get a bank loan

322
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,807
I went and visited like five or six Banks finally found one at a party

323
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
This guy talk to me and said

324
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
I'm uninterested when we went to visit with him and

325
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
They gave us the loan

326
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
And we paid it off in a few years

327
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
And then we're free

328
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,655
Added you like Copa that emotionally mentally like you had to run your company and you are fighting off

329
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
This other company that was trying to take you over

330
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
I

331
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
I think I've learned a ton

332
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
With other things I've chosen to do in my life like rock climbing

333
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
My friend uses the term sharp end of the row

334
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
Which means when your rock climbing

335
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
You're either leading or following

336
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
And when you're leading

337
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
You're on the sharp end of the Rope

338
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,463
You could take a pretty big thought I had done a lot of leading in my life on

339
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
In rock climbing

340
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
And I wouldn't you I was used to being enough

341
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Position of

342
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
Facing danger but being able to stay composed

343
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
The weird thing is actually clean better when I'm on leave then I'm falling

344
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
And I still try to figure out that

345
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
How that metaphor works but it

346
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
Cuz you are you're in more danger if you're leading but I think I'm more Focus

347
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
When I'm leaving

348
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
And so

349
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
I was on this big lead now I've got this

350
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Lawsuit

351
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,367
I got the company growing about all the manufacturing issues and

352
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Collections Bubba

353
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
But I think

354
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Because that

355
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
I was so focused

356
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Nothing was going to stop me except something did Olmos

357
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Stop and offer Gary Erickson and almost couldn't refuse it with this guy Roz

358
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
Listening to how I built this from NPR

359
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,951
Thanks to two of our sponsors who helped make this podcast possible first to Hyatt

360
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
I believe the modern business traveler is changing the face of business

361

00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
And because they changed

364
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Business travel is changing to

365
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
And that's why there's a place and a house were good enough

366
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479

Slash built

382
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
It's how I built this from NPR

383
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Garage

384
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Okay let's fast forward a bit

385
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
This is now

386
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
Year 2000

387
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
What about 8 years after a Clif Bar has lunch then

388
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
It's doing it

389
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Credibly well it's got a growing

390
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Staff almost

391
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
40 million dollars

392
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
In sales

393
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
And I should mention Gary Erickson has a partner in this venture

394
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,247
Bleach have 50% ownership in the company

395
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
And something else is going on at the same time

396
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
Big food corporations start to get into the game

397
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
And they start buying up.

398
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Competitors

399
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,791
Empire Barbers already already sold and balance are sold so it's just

400
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
It was kind of

401
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
1/3 as a third

402
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
So we got approached

403
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Bye

404
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Travel Company

405
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
And

406
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
In a very uncharacteristic I got a untied from the Rope of being on lead

407
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Eden said

408
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
All right

409
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
I guess this is what you do

410
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
I'll put it in what happened

411
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
We

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,183
Tired and investment banker I mean long story short but hard investment banker to put the company up for sale

413
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
Instead of us talking to companies which hire somebody to talk

414
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Companies in

415
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
It was an odd moment I can remember the exact moment that I

416
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
Got a call if my partner said

417
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
She said I want to sell the company

418
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
All right

419
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
So

420
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
There we were we

421
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
But the company up for sale

422
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
And started traveling all over the

423
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
All over the country

424
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
Visiting these large companies that wanted

425
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Us to be part of their portfolio

426
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,879
And we got an amazing deals from one of the large companies are we got to do we got an offer for a

427
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
$129 on $49

428
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Quaker Oats

429
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Oh I guess you heard

430
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
So you guys are sitting at the

431
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
The table

432
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Quaker Oats

433
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
120 million box

434
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Listen 2000

435
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
If that meant you would have gotten 60 million your partner gotten 60 million

436
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
And you could walk away

437
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
And like

438
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
Did you seriously I mean you were seriously thinking about doing this

439
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
More than serious

440
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
We

441
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Had

442
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
The deal

443
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Essentially done

444
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
On April

445
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
I know the date April 17th 2000

446
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,023
We were going to meet our investment banker

447
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
The people from

448
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Quaker and as well as all the lawyers

449
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
To sign the deal

450
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
And I would have been up

451
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,055
And we have told the company what we were doing till all the employees and they trusted us

452
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
It was a naive

453
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Nice thing to say the things wouldn't change

454
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
But I still set it

455
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
And it was not true and I knew it wasn't true that

456
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Of course

457
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Just going to change

458
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
It could be better could be worse but

459
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
You can't say it's not

460
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Change

461
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Yeah

462
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,279
And so I left that morning for the office knowing that's the day and I was

463
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Sitting in the office

464
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Waiting

465
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
My partner was on the phone talking to lawyers yunnan

466
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Don the I's and cross the t's

467
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Summit Contracting

468
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,031
She was she was ready to sell

469
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,359
Oh absolutely was it was done deal and her in her eyes

470
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
And you couldn't wait because she was

471
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
Very fearful of the future

472
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
And understand that to some degree but

473
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
Why would people walk away from buying our product

474
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
If we didn't

475
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
Sell the company

476
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,255
I never said I was for the three months that we were selling the company I was just living in the dark

477
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
I was not sleeping well I was not riding my bike I was

478
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Probably not very fun to be around

479
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
And I said I just

480
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
I was fighting it

481
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
You're internally but not really

482
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
Pictures of a counselor and talked about it

483
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
Probably would have gotten to that point

484
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
But there was and I started

485
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
I started to

486
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
Have that amazing moment of just shaking I'm shaking right now is thinking of it

487
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
Were you in that day you're you're you're about to go and sign your name on the contract

488
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,911
That's very good we were ready to get in the car and go over

489
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
And

490
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,263
I said I got to take a walk around the block and so I did

491
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
I went out to the parking lot and

492
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
I just started weeping

493
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
You couldn't even want to do it

494
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
They want to do it

495
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
I guess it's like

496
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Noah

497
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Walking off the field

498
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
I mean this was everything that you built right

499
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Yeah this was

500
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
This was I put everything that this is my this is my life and this our employees and this is my family is named after my dad

501
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
So what did you

502
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
What did you do what did you tell your partner

503
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,383
So halfway around the block I decide not to self company and then I felt completely free

504
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
It was like oh my God I'm free again

505
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
Now I have to go back around the rest of the block and forgot what I was

506
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
My partner

507
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
And I told her

508
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
Need to put phone down

509
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Tuna sandwich

510
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Wow

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
And she knew immediately when I said that

512
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
That I was

513
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,936
And so she was on the phone with the lawyer she said

514
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
We're not selling

515
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
So I can imagine she's in the room with all these

516
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
People

517
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
30th floor of the Comerica building.

518
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Deals off

519
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
So

520
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Now I'm in a new situation where

521
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,928
I got it now go back and convince our people that we're not selling the company and that it's going to be okay

522
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
We told him he couldn't do without

523
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
Sewing and now we're going to know I'm saying we can

524
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Secondly

525
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,120
My partner wanted out so I had to negotiate a deal

526
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
And so that was 7 months of negotiation and

527
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
And third was I had to go out

528
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Our attorney says Dialing for Dollars

529
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
I had to go find $69

530
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
You have to find 60 million dollars

531
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
2

532
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Basically by your partner

533
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,832
Because that's what you were offered to her argument was look that's what it's worth

534
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Eggs

535
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
So

536
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,232
I mean just think that you don't want to have to deal with as you're growing your business cuz

537
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
We were growing like crazy yeah

538
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Sonoco share this deal

539
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
And

540
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Decided that I would

541
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
Try to meet with the entire company every week

542
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
And hold a meeting

543
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
Two so that I could be in front of them

544
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
So they could see me every week saying

545
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,248
We are not selling the company cuz they were convinced this is going to be a short-term deal and then I would go back

546
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,552
Yeah and sell the company and

547
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
I got calls from like

548
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
Private Equity groups that they heard what happened there like you are out of your mind you're never going to make it

549
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,144
Never going to make it if you didn't have the debt and I have $69 a day and did you send.

550
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,984
Take me to write maybe I'm not going to make it maybe I'm crazy like what am I doing

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,568
I must have been serving some good Kool-Aid at the at the office could people

552
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
Started believing that we have to do it

553
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
And it took us nine years to pay off that thing and we did it

554
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
Play me a time Gary light

555
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,792
You could have taken the money and then like how this Charmed Life

556
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Fan bike

557
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
10 fish stand

558
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Start a foundation in NJ

559
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,728
It's kind of like to go to conferences and just given toxin

560
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
But there was something like what

561
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,640
What was the thing that prevented you from doing that from because that would that would have been an easier

562
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
Route you would have done the quality of your life

563
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,064
Like the things you can buy and own in the way you could live would not have been substantially differ

564
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
What the way you live today

565
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
True true it would probably the same

566
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,744
Well obviously wasn't about money

567
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
There is

568
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
There is something deep about

569
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
You know wanting to

570
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
Grow this business

571
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
And I mean I think my wife has it

572
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Very well you know what

573
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,872
It's the power of yeah the power of a lot of money could be good you could

574
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Don't need a lot of money to start a foundation

575
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
But the power of

576
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
A business

577
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Done the right way

578
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Is way more powerful than

579
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
To rich people

580
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't want over say that because

581
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
You know

582
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,488
Rich people that are doing some great things but yeah

583
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
As the company has grown pekin

584
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,888

586
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Company

587
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848

For 1

598
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,424
He was able to

599
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Experience

600
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Both

601
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
That bar

602
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
Named after him and and the growth of the company

603
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
Yeah I'm just so happy that he did get to experience it

604
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:27,296
For a very long time he was from Door County Wisconsin he would go to Wisconsin on vacations and bring Clif bars

605
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
He walking the bike shops

606
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Hey Daddy what you think it was caused by

607
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
We love quiz

610
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Your cliff

611
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
Oh my God

612
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
Making noises celebrity

613
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Either

614
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,568
This narrative or I wouldn't say I'm ethology about entrepreneurs that they are

615
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
Successful entrepreneurs are like single-mindedly Focus

616
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
On the go

617
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Akane no an invalid in themselves

618
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
And have very little or no self

619
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
Is that does that characterize you did you ever have

620
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,048
Any self-doubt did you ever did you ever have sleepless nights about what you were saying what am I doing I doing the right thing

621
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,864
Or would you just like totally focused and and just

622
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Confident in what you were doing

623
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Orange.

624
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
The ladder

625
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,312
I can't remember a day where I didn't believe

626
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
And we would get through anything

627
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
I don't know where that all come

628
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Comes from

629
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
I don't

630
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
No that's

631
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
That unique but

632
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
And I do think

633
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Back to Summer

634
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
The

635
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Adventures that I

636
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
Chosen to do

637
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
You know I'm not I'm not a super high risk

638
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Person I don't

639
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Leaving I believe in climbing with a rope

640
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
But I do think it teaches you a lot

641
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Because I remember

642
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,216
Years ago I climb the face of Half Dome and

643
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
I never once thought I was going to make it

644
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
App that face

645
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
It was just

646
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
I was tapping her I called happy nervous

647
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
I was nervous and I was happy

648
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
At the same time

649
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
There was no doubt we're going to

650
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Make it enough for a second did I say

651
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,576
That anything would stop us from doing that message

652
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
One of many
