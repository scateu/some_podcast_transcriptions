Almost any point and hear different

38
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,752
Incredible story about how Gary hirshberg almost

39
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
Lost his company almost failed

40
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
It is venture

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Listen to the whole thing start to finish

42
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
I guarantee it is

43
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Totally worth it

44
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
This episode first ran back

45
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
October of 2017 is

46
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576

Hope you enjoy it

48
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,488
On many occasions I would tip toe over

49
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
To the office to

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
To call my mother-in-law to have a chat to see if I could borrow another 3520 500 to make ends meet

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
And one night I heard the Click Click of call waiting on my mother-in-law's phone and Meg was calling from the house to say

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Mom don't do this but your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
It sounds like she will she had no reason

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
NPR

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movements they go

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
Farmers & Accounting lillybelle

57
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
Barn

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
And threw it into Stonyfield

59
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
One of the biggest yogurt brands

60
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
In America

61
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,488
All the stories that we told on the show so far

62
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,120
I think it's fairly safe to say that Stonyfield yogurt has had more ups and downs

63
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
Really more down

64
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
Then just about any other

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
And it's a pretty unlikely tale to begin with

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
2ego hippie farmers

67
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
With no real desire to build a cup

68
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Wind up

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Building a company

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
They start small

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
Milking their own cows making their own yogurt selling locally

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
The nun

73
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
And then eventually

74
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Spreading themselves

75
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Wait

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Too thin

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
And sliding into

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Deep.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
A whole slew of near-death experiences

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Ever

81
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
White died in the second group

82
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Hebrew into water the most

83
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Popular yogurt brands

84
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
In the United States

85
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
And one thing about Stonyfield co-founder Gary hirshberg is that

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Even though he didn't really set out to build

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
The company

88
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
He knew what it took to run one

89
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Because

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
When he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire

91
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,136
His dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company

92
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,720
You know it was in those days they were probably

93
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
50 shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone

94
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
And probably

95
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,632
150 in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
So how many people did your dad's company employ

97
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
Several thousand I think at their Peak they were at the 2800

98
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Wow

99
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
These are true company Champs

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
Course in those days manufacturing was going to the state

101
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,808
Was built in the in the region of the country were built on things that we made

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
The dark side of that is that when they

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Essentially

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,464
Get because of Cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Shoe industry collapse

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
No all these communities did as well

107
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
And what happened to your family

108
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,495
Well it was really a 303 for the family's business

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Went bankrupt

110
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
My parents got divorced

111
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,663
And my childhood role model

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
A died suddenly of spinal meningitis how it was a

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
It was a wake up here

114
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
I mean did your lifestyle change

115
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Overnight cuz I will probably pretty

116
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Prosperous

117
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Family iPhone

118
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Yeah that we were certainly comfortable I was a ski racer I

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
You know I wasn't

120
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,703
Every worrying certainly about the next meal or bend in

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Getaway

122
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
Travel up north on weekends for skiing we had a

123
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Home on a lake

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
But yeah it it you know the world I mean I think everybody at 14

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Deneb conscious

126
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Sting

127
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Starts to

128
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Edit your life

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Undergoes

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
Changes better my case they were kind of expedited

131
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
My father I got it and began drinking

132
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
And so I had to ask her to confront

133
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
All of that

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
And

135
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
You know watch to sort of all the rocks

136
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Just suddenly turned to mush

137
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Hear my mom became a single mom with 5 kids I was the oldest and how does she support you what is she

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Well yes okra

139
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Again because

140
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
My dad's

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Business

142
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
It was gone now

143
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,111
You know there was a huge amount of tension there was lots of battling over alimony which

144
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
For money that didn't exist so

145
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,303
She wound up becoming a buyer for a local family-owned Hotel chain actually close friends of ours

146
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Which eventually sold to Sheraton and

147
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
And gradually she parried that into becoming ultimately the senior buyer for Sheraton worldwide

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,127
And then from there she became the senior buyer for Disney for the Epcot Center

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
When they built that so yes she she was like literally

150
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,343
You know Mom with 5 kids running a little general store part-time is kind of a hobby

151
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
To becoming a dino Global XX

152
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
So disliked

153
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
Major change in your life happens at the age of 14 which

154
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Of course

155
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
It's going to have an influence on you did you

156
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,983
Did you start to think about a business about being a businessman that early

157
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
I mean you said your parents were both entrepreneurial

158
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,663
No I I started to think about running as far as I possibly could away from it

159
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,831
Obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a result of a steady decline am I

160
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,951
My grandfather my father and my uncle were all in the business and I used to sit

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
Or work it there and I would listen to them screaming at each other know they were arguing you know

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Passionately

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
About what to do about this downturn

164
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,079
And so to me business was this thing where people got people yelled at each other

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,967
Are people hung up phones on each other people were stressed employees lost their jobs

166
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
And it been on top of that

167
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Serious

168
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Pollution so

169
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
It led to my deciding that business was the worst thing on the planet the last thing I wanted to do and

170
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,327
LED made a really pursue a career in The Sciences environmental Sciences

171
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Suicide would you do after high school

172
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
I went off

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Yelp to a college that was

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Just

175
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
And overtly

176
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,151
Liberal arts non-business environment is Hampshire College

177
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Joker skin burns and

178
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
If you want to get business knocked out of you that's

179
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Yeah

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,135
Yeah but stick with it because it turns out that it was probably the best training for an entrepreneur

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
That there is

182
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
It's cuz this is a school

183
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,511
That has no credits no requirements no grades

184
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
You only pass

185
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Matriculate through by Contracting

186
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
And making progress with an individual

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
Professors who take you on as their

188
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Essentially Apprentice

189
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
And in many cases the

190
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
The funding of

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
At work I mean I wound up

192
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
Diving deep into ecology and environmental Sciences

193
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
And

194
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Turns out

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
I was

196
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Those hating business still and thinking

197
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
You know again now I thought

198
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
Getting educated I realized my God we're warming the planet were toxic

199
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Define word depleting

200
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,119
Waterwood disturbing you know biodiversity everywhere it's all because of Industry so I was

201
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,703
Receta radicalizing in my environmental beliefs but

202
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
But actually getting Business School

203
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Bells all the way

204
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Should I get

205
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
College that

206
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
That you went and worked

207
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Yeah

208
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,015
At the time there was a little ethological research institute on Cape Cod called the new Alchemy Institute

209
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
And they were advancing the idea of using wind and solar power building releases

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Sustainable food source

211
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Customs long before those words were in our vernacular in

212
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
I went from

213
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
A windmill

214
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,631
Apprentice to Windmill technician to executive director and

215
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
And I saw them on The Cutting Edge

216
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Which of them

217
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Of how we were going to need to grow food in the future

218
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
In-N-Out around this time you also meet

219
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Sam human rights

220
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Right

221
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
And he is the guy who's going to become your business partner who's it and he

222
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
He's also running his own organic farm

223
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,439
Right so he was mostly teaching organic farming methods raised beds

224
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
Biological Pest Control

225
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
A greenhouse season extending

226
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Basically kind of back to the land types

227
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Stop. With that with an organic Focus

228
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
AC running this is a non-profit and just

229
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Oh yes it was a non-profit

230
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
So we're both we're each running nonprofit

231
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,919
But I got really excited by his work and of course he was back here in my native New Hampshire

232
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Which I loved and he's older than you

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,503
Oh yes he's about six

234
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
16 years old or Samuel

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
At that time

236
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Had six kids

237
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
I was a single guy

238
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
But

239
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
You know we became Fast Friends

240
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
And a he asked me if I would join the board of the world

241
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Education center to help him

242
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
With his money racing

243
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
IMDb have a hard time raising money in the first place

244
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,079
Well right about that time Ronald Reagan came into office and

245
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Essentially

246
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Cut off the lifeline

247
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
4

248
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,991
Sustainable energy research sustainable AG

249
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
So essentially money dried up

250
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
For these nonprofits and so we would sit at Samuels board meetings

251
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
At about the Royal Education Center

252
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
And by the way

253
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Critical to this whole story he had one cow

254
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Animal Ebel

255
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
And Samuel was experimenting with yogurt

256
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
And he was

257
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
A fermentation

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Nutcase

259
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
I mean he made

260
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Sauerkraut

261
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Pier One

262
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
A kimchi

263
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
If it fermented he made it

264
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
When I say he made it he made in

265
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Incredible

266
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Foods anime

267
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
This wonderful yogurt

268
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
From his cow has one cow

269
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
And we would sit at these board meetings

270
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Eating bowls of butter

271
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Absolutely incredible

272
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
Playing cream on top whole milk yogurt

273
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
And I'm just a back

274
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Up one step Samuel is originally from Brooklyn

275
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
I grew up very poor

276
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
In Flatbush but he got to know a lot of these old

277
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Jewish yogurt maker

278
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Down there

279
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
And they taught him yogurt making

280
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,759
And what they explain to him is it's very simple it's all about the weather

281
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,135
At meaning times and temperatures it's about the weather the humidity the temperatures and he

282
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,767
Answer Samuel for his family and for the school experimented with yogurt for many years

283
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
And one day and unfortunately none of us can remember who but one of us said

284
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
Why don't we start selling this stuff too

285
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
It'll make up for the lack of

286
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Grant money cuz it was

287
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
Nigh impossible to raise money during that period

288
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
And

289
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
You know

290
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Seemed like a pretty good idea so

291
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Samuel

292
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Was able to get

293
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Some Catholic nuns

294
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
Add to provide a $25,000 Grant

295
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Nuns

296
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Yeah

297
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
The Sisters of Mercy

298
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Which is

299
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
You'll hear the moment the appropriate name

300
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
Are they were taking Mercy on these two crazy entrepreneurs

301
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
They were selling their modest

302
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
And they were wanted to turn their principal into a

303
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Local community action

304
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,127
And Samuel use that money to build the first yogurt works

305
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
And

306
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
About the time that the money came in which was April of 83

307
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
When we opened

308
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
I decided that

309
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
I was

310
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
Pretty interested in joining him full-time not so much to run the yogurt but

311
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
I thought that I could

312
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Help him

313
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
Run his farming School while he did this little fun

314
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375

315
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167

00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639

00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
Three-story wood heated log

320
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Cabin with no Plumbing

321
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Can I put solar cells on it and

322
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
And it came and families live there

323
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183

How did you get

333
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Two customers

334
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Did you brush England for sale

335
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943

Finances

341
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
This little tiny Factory in

342
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
Tiny little room that you could only really described as a closet in a

343
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
1792 Barn

344
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
With a wood wood fired boiler

345
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
And

346
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
The way it worked was he

347
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
Put in a 50 gallon stainless steel tank

348
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
We bought plastic cups

349
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
And

350
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Sammy was a very

351
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,015
Charming and persuasive guy in after paying for his first shipment of Cups he managed to somehow get continue to get shipments

352
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
5 months without

353
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Paying for any more so

354
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
He started producing April 9th 1983

355
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
And took his first

356
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
Six packs of yogurt

357
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Drove down to

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
The local supermarket

359
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Tell her words and said would you guys sell this

360
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
They didn't know what the heck this was

361
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
And

362
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
They said what price should we sell it at 7 said I don't know whatever

363
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Whatever price you think

364
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
We were not business peep

365
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
So we started selling

366
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
At a dollar 49 a quart which is the same price down and was selling

367
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903

Six packs of plain cream on top yogurt

369
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
It was like Ambrosia guy it was the most incredibly perfect

370
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Product still the best thing we make

371
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
So you guys just start to

372
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
Basically

373
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Sell it locally

374
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335

And

376
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Eventually

377
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
The harwich port

378
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Because you know this is good

379
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
Selling

380
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
By the way below the price

381
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
If we could afford

382
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
So Sam is a great

383
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
So we eventually hired a young

384
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Local

385
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Guy to drive a van

386
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
We couldn't afford a refrigerator van so we just told him to drive fast

387
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
But yeah so by the time I got there

388
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
A 5-month tinnitus

389
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Samuel head

390
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Probably about

391
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
$50,000

392
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Versailles

393
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
And

394
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
My gosh the product

395
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
Was selling through but he couldn't keep up

396
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
And he was out of cash

397
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
And

398
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Course he wasn't paying bills

399
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
He was out of cash because

400
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
What is the lag time between

401
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,255
When he's getting paid and he had to pay for grain to feed the cows he had to pay this guy to drive

402
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,095
And bring the yogurt as I told you before he wasn't paying for his cups

403
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
But he had to pay people to help

404
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,287
And you have the $35,000 it started just appeared overnight

405
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Honestly I don't know how it got to

406
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
To 5 months

407
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Because

408
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
When I arrived

409
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
On September 15th of 83

410
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
Hit Samuel had these old army surplus.

411
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
Masks in this farmhouse

412
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
That the three desk

413
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
For piled high with envelopes on open mail

414
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Mister okay

415
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
I'm now the executive director of the relegation Center

416
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,583
And the vice president of Stonyfield Farm

417
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
And I'm going to spend my first Atwoods in the name of the farm Stonyfield

418
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
I'm sorry yes

419
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Are still there

420
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
So I spent the morning separating

421
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
I thought the checks

422
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
From the

423
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Bill's the only problem was

424
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
There were no check

425
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
I Samuel any money that I come in he had used it to buy feed

426
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
You know lubrication equipment

427
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Fuelwood whatever

428
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
And

429
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
By 11 a.m. that morning my first day

430
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
I calculator that we were $75,000 in the red

431
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
So what did you do

432
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,239
Well I did what any self-respecting entrepreneur does I called my mother

433
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
And I borrowed $30,000

434
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
From which she could ill-afford as I told you before she was

435
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
You know her own

436
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
Business women with for you no family but

437
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
You know what I had

438
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,903
A good fundraising scale so I went too many of my former funders and many of his and I said look can we

439
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Can we borrow

440
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:39,071
These were the the Thunder siphonic that you had run back in Massachusetts

441
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
Right well Samuel had a handful of

442
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,263
Foxwood been his fenders like I said he he raised $125,000 so they were

443
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
They're probably 20 or 30

444
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,663
Wealthy individuals and then I had raised a million dollars a year so I had

445
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
You know by net worth

446
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Individuals out there and I

447
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Look what I told him was very simplistic

448
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
You know the first

449
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
10 years of artwork

450
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,463
Was all about proving that you can grow food organically

451
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,839
But if we're going to be successful with this revolution I said to the funders who had gotten us there

452
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
Then we're going to have to prove that you can actually make money doing

453
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
And we're going to have to

454
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Build a model Enterprise

455
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
That will show that you can

456
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Avoid the use of pesto

457
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Besides avoid the use of hormones

458
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Cows

459
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Support family farmers

460
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
Not depend on fossil fuels

461
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,343
Etc etc all the things that we were doing in the nonprofit context

462
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
I said you know this is

463
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
I'd like to ask you to join us in the next phase which is

464
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
Helping us to

465
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,375
I build a successful business and instead of asking for a grant I'm asking you for a loan

466
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,215
And I wound up borrowing $125,000

467
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
Okay so you go out and you start raising money and did you and and and Samuel sit down and say

468
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,527
Construction is businesslike II we are co-owners is a

469
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
Joint venture like how did you did you ever do that

470
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
Well we did because

471
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
One of the things I did was I

472
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Hired a lawyer

473
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
Cuz I knew we didn't know what we're doing and the first thing this lawyer

474
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
Said to me was he said Gary

475
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,239
What percentage of the world Education Center's revenue is coming from the yogurt

476
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Well that point

477
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
It was getting close to

478
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
75%

479
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
And he said well guess what you've got to spin it off

480
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
Because under IRS rules that

481
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Makes you a business

482
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Not a non-profit

483
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
So Samuel and I realized

484
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,927
We're going to have to buy this from the Royal education

485
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
So we agreed

486
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
To a split

487
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
In the company

488
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
And then I

489
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
Went out to our lenders

490
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
725 k

491
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,055
And I said look up will you take stock in this company

492
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
We did our first private

493
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Placement

494
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
You know threw a dart at the wall figured out the value of the business

495
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
What's the time

496
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Well

497
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,855
We thought we're going to Value it at $1000000

498
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,183
By then in 1984 our sales were up to

499
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Around 200

500
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,535
50000 a year in this is Justin in New Hampshire or all of them

501
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Well

502
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
By 84 we were starting to

503
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Push the boundaries

504
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
We're selling the about 20 stores

505
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
And

506
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
Eventually we started selling to a

507
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
An Independent Grocer who had seven stores

508
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
I called Alexander supermarket

509
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Is now part of Hannaford

510
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
In the Northeast

511
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
Anda

512
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
This will give you the real flavor for this what was going on here someone Sunday night we're having dinner at the Caymans after milking

513
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,303
Hand of the phone ranks and Jack demoulas the nephew of the

514
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
Owner of the demoulas Market Basket

515
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
And says Samuel Le

516
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,799
Why are you selling to buy competitor this little seven store chain of Alexander's and not to me

517
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
He had 34 Stars

518
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
What time is Sammy said well

519
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,015
How to be honest Mister demoulas we don't have enough cause he said we'll get some more goddamn cows and he slammed the phone down

520
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
And we took that is very

521
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
Good business advice so we went out and

522
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Do I heard

523
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Even further and

524
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Denso we

525
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Now realize we needed to

526
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
You know

527
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,912
Get serious about this and so we did manage to lease a small refrigerator truck and started

528
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
Delivering actually to the Market Basket Warehouse

529
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
How much yogurt were you making at that

530
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
We're producing now about

531
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
360 cases a week of yogurt

532
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,248
And a case is like 24 cups

533
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Six packs of Courts

534
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
So by the end of 84 we were our run-rate was headed

535
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
In the start of half a million-dollar range but you were probably spending more money than you were bringing it right

536
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
You have no idea we were burning

537
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
I mean I kept

538
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Not

539
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
Weekly cash flows not daily cash flows I kept our leak

540
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,616
I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon

541
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,688
In order for us to buy then the cup guy and pick it up

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
You know Sammy wasn't paying I'm so

543
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
Now we are on very short terms with everybody I mean

544
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,904
My fundraising skill turn out to be

545
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
Will it be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family's unbelievable attention to detail they were

546
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
Perfectionist but we were also we would also be nowhere

547
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
Without my ability to keep getting credit and cash because it was burning

548
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
Believer on fumes

549
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
When we come back in just a moment have Gary and Samuel begged and borrowed

550
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
How to keep Stonyfield going

551
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
And how they almost lost it anyway again and again and again I'm Gyros and

552
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,512
You're listening to how I built this from NPR

Gyros

602
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
So in the summer of 1984

603
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
Gary and Samuel and Stonyfield

604
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
Almost

605
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Broke there

606
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
Basically running on fumes

00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Electronic bring in more money by

608
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Just

609
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Finding

610
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Kmart stores

611
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
To sell their yogurt

612
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
In those days

613
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
A Whole Foods didn't exist yet

614
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,624
But the holy grail for natural products was a little priest or chain called bread and circus Arts events

615
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Became part of

616
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
And that one store in Cambridge

617
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
On Prospect

618
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
And you know we were selling now to

619
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Demoulas Market Basket

620
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
This is now I'm talking to liability for

621
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
And

622
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
And we were desperately trying to get down there cuz we knew that

623
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
If we could crack

624
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,872
Bread & circus every other little natural food co-op in New England

625
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
Would 10 take us in

626
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
And we kept going down there

627
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
And they

628
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:29,856
Said no no no we've already got you know hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont

629
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
In their teepee with their wetgo you know they didn't need

630
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Another

631
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000

What you guys do

634
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
So in July of 84 I had my 30th birthday at the

635
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
The farm in my I had my old Ultimate Frisbee team

636
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
Come up

637
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
To visit me most of them lived in Cambridge

638
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
You might imagine

639
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
And

640
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
I said look

641
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
It's wonderful you've all come if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under Bread & circus

642
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
I'm prospects

643
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Cambridge and asked for my yoga

644
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
That was on a Sunday on Wednesday

645
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:07,744
Mary Carol Skinner the buyer Bread & circus called and said Gary I don't know what's going on but the man is suddenly gone through the roof

646
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,376
We're getting all kinds of requests for yogurt when can you get it in there will I got in my car and I

647
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Made the first delivery. Afternoon

648
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
About

649
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
A month later we were her number one selling yogurt

650
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
She took us in the other to bread and circuses

651
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
And off we went but

652
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
It was my frisbee

653
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
I mean

654
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,784
You know that's what it takes. You know I always say we can ship the yogurt 3000 miles

655
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Celeste

656
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,648
18in that makes all the difference you get in people's mouths and then they're going to ask

657
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
But it was the best-selling yogurt

658
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Bread and circuses

659
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,048
Loved it but you were not making a profit

660
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
No that's absolutely right

661
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Stressful

662
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Utterly

663
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
It was impossible.

664
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
This was crazy right we're growing

665
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
We're booming and we're burning cast soap

666
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Crazy

667
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Yeah we're 24

668
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,504
7 Samuel had six kids

669
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,576
Cuz it was sort of indentured servitude I mean

670
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
You know it was hard

671
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,928
If they were going to have dinner that night it was hard for them to say no to

672
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
No milking are making and by the way

673
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
Hit several of his kids were Arts

674
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Just absolutely

675
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
Astonishing

676
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
We good yogurt makers they had their father

677
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
And mother sense of

678
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
Pride in the product

679
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
And this is around the time we meet Meg

680
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
Become your wife

681
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
Yasso

682
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,920
A month after that fateful meeting with Bread & circus

683
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
We had our Summer nofa Conference

684
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Northeast organic farming

685
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Is it turn that I was the Keynote

686
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
What speaker

687
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
And so I started talking about this Enterprises

688
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
That was now

689
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
A year old and

690
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
You know all of the dreams of

691
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Organic farmers that we were sort of like

692
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,888
I didn't talk about our financial problems

693
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
Show the

694
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,728
The best possible that if you build it they will come

695
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,544
And I right after I finish my speech this

696
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
It's very

697
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Adorable

698
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Organic farmer from

699
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
New Jersey

700
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Who is running her own non-profit

701
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Farm down there

702
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
I waited patiently to ask me a question will that

703
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
Turned out to be what

704
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
Now my 31-year wife Meg

705
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
And

706
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
We began courting and

707
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,328
A Thanksgiving that year and 84 Meg introduced me to her family

708
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
And her mom had been

709
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
The Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture

710
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Weather for New York State

711
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
So she had a kind of an egg orientation

712
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,128
At one point she kind of whispered to me that she'd be

713
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Okay with

714
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
If I needed some money

715
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
Would lending me some

716
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Well course I needed

717
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Sochi

718
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Banda

719
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
$50,000

720
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
And

721
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,000
Now we're heading into 1985 we have now launched small cups of

722
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Unflavored yogurt

723
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
I

724
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
Now needed to raise about 500 thousand

725
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,448
Cuz we needed to buy more cups more fruit you know

726
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
People expected us to pay

727
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
So

728
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Doris had loaned us 250

729
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,640
Towards the $500,000 as your mother-in-law my mother-in-law

730
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
And

731
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
I started raising then I got to about

732
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
275 300

733
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
I just heard of a month or so later

734
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
Well I think we can increase

735
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,768
Insouciant Chris to a hundred and eventually I got across the Finish Line got the 500

736
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
Why did you need so much money

737
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Well if the factory itself

738
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
Was probably 300,000 the factory

739
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
On Stonyfield Farm

740
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
Yeah the little we call it the yogurt work

741
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
A little Shoppe

742
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
You know what's up

743
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Drafty Old Barn it was

744
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
We needed to switch over from wood

745
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
2 oil

746
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
We needed to just get more modern we needed to get the warehouse

747
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
The barn

748
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,392
You made sanitary we had to get real floor drains we had to

749
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
Stop being a

750
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
Kind of a kitchen operation

751
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
And what a cows how many cows do you have

752
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,608
Well that point we were up to 19 but

753
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
One Night in this same era

754
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Sammy without milk and heated milk

755
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
The first of the 19 cows and the power went out

756
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Samuel came in and said

757
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
You know I need help

758
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,504
Cuz he has his electric milker so Louise and I went out and started milking well

759
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,344
You know it was freezing the cows hated it if you haven't hand melt

760
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,160
Let me tell you that they didn't do it

761
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
It was a nightmare to Kaiser

762
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
Kicking over the bucket we had these

763
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:26,048
Kerosene lanterns in this firetrap Barn

764
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,632
You know everyone's well the car would kick one over in the milk

765
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Spell on the lanterns and

766
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
We finished milking the last

767
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,800
Kyle at about 3 a.m. in time to start milking the first

768
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
And that was the night when we realized you know what

769
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
We got to sell the cows

770
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
You had

771
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
To sell the cows because

772
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
You guys could not milk them

773
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
All by yourself

774
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Right

775
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
And until the next morning

776
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
We reached out to a

777
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
Local Jersey farmer cuz we're using all

778
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Jersey cow milk

779
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,120
And said look what you buy are cows and start selling us milk well he said I'm not going to have anything to do with that

780
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
That Organics

781
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,008
And he was fine with hormone-free antibiotic-free but he didn't want to

782
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,104
Fetus cows herbs and buy organic feed and put that was your condition

783
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Well

784
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
Honestly we had no condition

785
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
We were Beggars not choosers so we briefly

786
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:21,344
At this moment in Stonyfield life we briefly departed from organic

787
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
You had no choice

788
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
We had no choice

789
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
Did you get that disturb you did you

790
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
You felt like you were

791
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
Betraying your values at that Mommy I guess because you were

792
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
You are hammers you send me money

793
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
But you had this demand and you

794
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
You had to make and you didn't have enough cows

795
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Yeah and

796
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,008
I not only had all these problems but I had my mother

797
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
And worst

798
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
My mother-in-law's money

799
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
And so you know what that makes

800
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
A guy pretty practical

801
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
You know venture capitalist

802
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
The reason they want

803
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,112
What they call f&f money first friends and family money

804
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
It's cuz they know that you might is enough

805
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
Supernatural things get rough you might

806
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Get up and walk away if it

807
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
You know

808
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,608
Some Harvard MBA with a tie

809
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
But if it's your mother's money

810
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,216
Yeah and so now we worked for our moms

811
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,520
Which must have been pretty stressful

812
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
Oh yeah you know what happened

813
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
In this farmhouse

814
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
I always had payroll on Thursday morning

815
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
And by this point is a half a million dollar business

816
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
And I never had cash in the bank

817
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
That night before payroll

818
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Never just this has become our way of life

819
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
And so I thinking Meg was asleep

820
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Ann Arbor

821
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
Bedroom which is about 50 feet from my office I would

822
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
On many occasions

823
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,424
Tiptoe over to the office to call my mother-in-law

824
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,544
Have a chat to see if I can borrow another 3500 2500 to make ends meet

825
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
And eventually Meg got on to this one night I heard the Click Click of call waiting on my mother-in-law's phone and Meg was

826
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Just calling from the house to say mom don't do this with your wife

827
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business because

828
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
She's living in a nightmare when she saw

829
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,328
How crazy was it mean we had chimney fires we had

830
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
The well pump would go out

831
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
The power would I be wearing this Hilltop Farm a long way from anywhere

832
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,176
Well she had no reason to believe in it was insane

833
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,808
But why did you believe it and did you think it was going to three years into this thing

834
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
Are you not making money you are

835
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,184
Make that big time

836
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Yeah

837
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Well

838
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
Say this

839
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
Meg

840
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
You know fortunately loved me

841
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Even more fortunate probably loved the yogurt

842
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
And we have nowhere else to go

843
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,640
Is she giving up her job done on her Farm in New Jersey and signed on

844
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,992
To this crazy damn Enterprise but here's where the story if

845
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
I know that you think it couldn't get worse but

846
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
Taza

847
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
Lily Tomlin says it

848
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
It is

849
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,720
It got a lot worse before it got worse

850
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
Well so now I'm going to jump

851
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
A year-and-a-half

852
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
We've now expanded the plant we're buying milk

853
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
10 or 12 Farms

854
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,568
I'm going to guess let me just tell you the number we are at about a one-point

855
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
$3000000 a year run rate

856
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
And we have Max

857
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Out this

858
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Little farm there is no

859
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,040
You cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this

860
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
So presumably you are looking to

861
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Another Factor

862
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Right

863
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
So spring of 86

864
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
We are

865
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,584
Out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in Western Mass

866
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
This is Greenfield Mass

867
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,424
We were desperate we did not do any

868
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
Have the financial due diligence one would normally do we just

869
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
Got our way and then we started making yoga

870
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
And it was

871
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
Great jamming all of a sudden

872
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Pave roads

873
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
You know

874
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
Regular power

875
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
A dairy and we thought we were

876
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Coming out of the woods yeah

877
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
The yogurts being made somewhere else

878
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
Never see it yeah yeah

879
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,072
But now we're on the bend into the fall of 87 October of 87

880
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,936
A fateful weekend the weekend of the crash of 87 and Wall Street

881
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,496
But what happened for us was on the Thursday night

882
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Of that weekend

883
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
Becky capeless the bank there for his

884
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Manufacturers Bank

885
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Call Mia

886
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,504
At the farm and said Gary would you like to buy this Dairy

887
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
The theory that that was producing your

888
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
And I said no we

889
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
We don't have the cash to buy their dad.

890
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
And I said why you asking she said well

891
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
They're in their third year of their

892
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,656
Small business administration loan guarantee and the SBA has enough to not going to renew it

893
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
And therefore are back my boss is going to have to

894
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
To pull our loan to him

895
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
And that means that he's probably not going to make it

896
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,200
The next morning at 7 a.m. that their bank went in and put them into chapter 7

897
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Padlocked

898
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
The place locked it up

899
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
Mike Epps my Lids my fruit my yogurt

900
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
Was in there

901
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,416
But suddenly this thing is in receivership

902
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,488
Wait a minute your production comes to a halt

903
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Outsource

904
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
Blake production facility

905
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Stop

906
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
So it came to a screaming halt worse than that

907
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
I had to come up with $100,000

908
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,776
To take my get my inventory out of the building

909
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,128
Because again we owe them co-packing phase now the backs the owner

910
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,200
And so I had to go call my shareholders

911
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
And

912
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Find $100,000 within hours

913
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
And so I did

914
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
We got our inventory out

915
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:50,304
And that but now we have no Factory get your making no yogurt so we have no yogurt we have what was in the factory

916
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Also

917
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,656
What can we do if we took a look at the old yogurt work

918
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
Hilltop Farm

919
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
Where the roosters are now living as his son of a gun we got to come back here now by then our volume had grown to 100% more

920
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:08,480
You know when winter has been exceeded you could not make enough yogurt at Stonyfield Farm where you were living

921
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
Right right

922
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,880
But that didn't dantas that we can send me when I put on our Carpenters aprons went out

923
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
And kick the roosters out and restarted the old yogurt

924
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Unfortunately equipment was still there

925
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,888
And by Monday morning so it was $100,000 that we had to

926
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,912
Borrow to

927
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Payoff

928
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
The dairy

929
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
And then we had to put about

930
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
$100,000 into getting this place

931
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Up and running again week

932
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,968
You know we borrowed and burn and Burrows and you know I went to all the shareholders and

933
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
You know what course

934
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,088
They have no choice but to land because everything they had ever put in was

935
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Monday morning

936
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
We begin

937
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
Action against Stonyfield Farm now

938
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
The problem is

939
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
In order to keep up we have to

940
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Mapreduce

941
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Twenty-four hours a day

942
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
7 days a week

943
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,216
Assembler I had to make yogurt every other night

944
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
And guy this began

945
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,288
And continued

946
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
420 months

947
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
And we've started burning

948
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
Embrace yourself for this

949
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
You started burning $25,000 a week

950
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
On top of the 200000 that we had borrowed

951
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
So now I am in

952
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
Deep you-know-what and

953
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,952
How much money do you think you

954
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
You weren't

955
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Like a million

956
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Dunmore

957
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Well by the

958
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
Bike by Christmas of 87

959
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,216
You know running this Factory for 2 months

960
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
I can tell you we were already

961
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
A $600,000 in debt

962
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
By Christmas of 88

963
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,968
We were 1.9 million dollars in debt

964
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Bye

965
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Christmas

966
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Of the next year

967
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
We were 2.7

968
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Million dollars

969
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Can you put shareholders

970
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Say

971
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
I'm getting nervous

972
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
IQR

973
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Has it been a while here

974
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
And I email

975
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
She's like a lot of money

976
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Every one of them

977
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,800
And you know what you have to know at the punchline of the story is that I wound up by the end of this.

978
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,360
With 297 individual investor

979
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,200
There was no way to find common ground with an Institutional Investor

980
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
How to write a venture capital

981
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Believe me I

982
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
I knocked on every door and they were like take a hike

983
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Right

984
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
What about your shoulder

985
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
How did you end up dealing with

986
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
I

987
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Stayed in constant touch with

988
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Every single shareholder

989
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,144
I was in constant contact with my creditors I couldn't pay fruit suppliers I couldn't pay

990
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
You know our fruit supplier had lost

991
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,520
$75,000 when that Dairy went chapter 7

992
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
And somehow

993
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
They had

994
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
Not been paying attention and they

995
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
Continue to ship us fruit back up at the farm

996
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
So they

997
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
They figured it out you know

998
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
3 months later that

999
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
They were now into us for 125000

1000
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
And I

1001
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Guy said luck

1002
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
I can't pay it but

1003
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Can I come out and talk to you

1004
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
And I borrowed a credit card

1005
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
From a friend and

1006
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Flew out cuz we've certainly had no credit

1007
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
So that the Cleveland and met with the

1008
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,800
People and I said look here's the bad news we owe you a hundred twenty five thousand but

1009
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
Here's the good news

1010
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
Necedah current growth rate

1011
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
If we can meet orders

1012
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
We will be a 250

1013
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
$50,000 a year customer for you

1014
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Within six months

1015
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
So here's what I'm prepared to do

1016
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
I would like to see if you would Advance us

1017
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Another

1018
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,744
$125,000

1019
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
I will pay you back

1020
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,864
Starting a 6 month at your interest

1021
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
Whatever you want to charge which is a joke cuz nobody

1022
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
No Commercial Bank would even lend to us

1023
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
I said I will

1024
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,592
Pledge my stock as collateral

1025
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
Which was a joke cuz it was a liability not an asset

1026
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
And finally I said and I will pledge that I will buy exclusively from you

1027
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
Not from anyone else so that was a joke

1028
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,856
Cuz no one else would ever sell to us

1029
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,952
And they said well Gary it's an interesting

1030
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,792
They said could you mind if we go up and talk and they went into the back room

1031
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,424
And son of a gun half an hour later they come outside you know what we believe in you were going to do it

1032
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,056
Nmi at am I summary of that story and so many others of this. Is simply

1033
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
If you don't ask you don't get

1034
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:24,224
And Desperation you know breeds this thing where you just have no shame anymore you have to

1035
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,624
Asking now I'll just tell you the punchline of that story is those guys have sold Us in the 30-year

1036
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Dear sense

1037
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
And if so

1038
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Probably

1039
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,536
250 or 300 million dollars worth of fruit

1040
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
Amazing

1041
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,448
It's crazy because at this point in in all of my interviews normally

1042
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,056
It's were talking about how the entrepreneur like made it through the troughs in the

1043
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,943
Crucibles and just you know to start making money hand-over-fist but you are still in crisis I mean your

1044
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Company is

1045
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Am I doing well

1046
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,623
You didn't even have a factory to make yogurt at this point you you needed a new one

1047
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
Yeah

1048
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Nmi ultimately found one

1049
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,511
It was a dairy in Northern Vermont

1050
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
And

1051
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
We

1052
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,399
Negotiated for three months with this dairy in Northern Vermont

1053
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
To become the answer

1054
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Go to this whole thing

1055
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
Namely

1056
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
They would produce our yogurt

1057
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
Samuel and I would focus on sales and marketing

1058
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,943
And we would become partners and they would get

1059
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Pay the price for every cup

1060
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Tokyo Garden

1061
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
Just like the other day but this was a much larger

1062
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
70 million-dollar company

1063
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
So D day comes

1064
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,207
In April of 88

1065
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
To go up and get the

1066
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
Bastille sign and we had negotiated a deal that

1067
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
About to in

1068
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
And I went up

1069
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Gemini

1070
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,191
Left the farm up at this point Meg is pregnant with

1071
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Son number one

1072
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
And

1073
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
Of course I've got now

1074
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,847
I now have over $1000000 of her mother's money

1075
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Okay

1076
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
Like money she could never

1077
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Everything they had

1078
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,831
And a man comes to me at the door and as we're leaving

1079
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
She said you eat you promise this is done right we're going to

1080
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
Because I've been milking every other night

1081
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Right no vacations no brakes no no

1082
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
I'm leaving now to go sign the stalemate

1083
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,911
You promised me that all the details are worked out that when you come back tonight

1084
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Where

1085
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,727
The beginning of

1086
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Really going to happen

1087
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,567
Absolutely we have nailed down every last

1088
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Drove up to Vermont

1089
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,919
When I got there Sammy one of the rest

1090
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Restroom at the lawyer's office

1091
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
And I looked at my

1092
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Instead of the 2-inch thick

1093
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Agreement that we were going to go over

1094
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
It was a letter

1095
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
Timmy

1096
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
It said dear Garian bottom line is

1097
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
Dr Gary Samuel

1098
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
Basically they decided to trade

1099
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
Just to steal the company from us there there

1100
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
They said we've decided

1101
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,703
That you guys need us more than we need you

1102
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
We're going to

1103
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
Take over what we're going to do is have all of your shareholders convert their

1104
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
Stock into debt

1105
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
And you are welcome to work down there.

1106
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967

Perk-up Forever Yogurt

1108
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
Every cut my hair will take 2 years

1109
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
And at the end of the two years will negotiate your future employer

1110
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
So wasn't a deal it was

1111
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Steel

1112
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Wow

1113
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
Wait this this was just sitting

1114
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
On the table this letter that says

1115
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
Orrefors you

1116
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
This is

1117
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
We were stealing

1118
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:29,055
And all the while they're looking at me and that one guys winking at me like you know do the deal sign

1119
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
In your best

1120
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,175
You know your wife's back they're desperate for you to solve this get to

1121
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
HP smart

1122
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,503
Tell me what not even come into the room I got up

1123
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:42,367
I heard some things I can't say on public radio and grab Samuel

1124
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
And got in the car

1125
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,975
And we started driving now course as luck would have it

1126
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,791
Don't you know an April blizzard has started in

1127
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
So no cars are on the road we've now got

1128
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
A two-hour drive back

1129
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,471
And worse than that one of us is going to have to make yogurt at night

1130
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
And worse than that

1131
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,287
I have to face my wife

1132
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,359
And so we start driving

1133
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,687
I turned him I said what what will you do now cuz

1134
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,527
I knew we're going to have to sign the deal I I knew it was over

1135
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
And I said

1136
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Any setup

1137
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
I guess I'll do something in sales

1138
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,719
And you know my heart sunk right this is a guy who created this

1139
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:24,095
Incredible yogurt I mean he was a genius who is making the most perfect product and now he's going to sell widgets

1140
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,143
So you basically thought

1141
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Or at least

1142
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Sam thought that

1143
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
This was it I mean you guys were mean

1144
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
This is the darkest of the dark

1145
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,895
Hours for burning $25,000 a week

1146
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,967
We're taking money we cannot ever pay back

1147
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,783
We have to go back to this Farm we have no solution

1148
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
And so I turned to Samuel and I said listen Samuel

1149
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,207
Just for the fun of it what would be the cheapest yogurt plant we could build

1150
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
Somewhere that would actually cover our capacity

1151
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
They said you know

1152
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,959
I was thinking the same thing so he flipped on the dome light in the car pulls out his pad and we start designing a yogurt

1153
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,031
In the car in the car we're driving in this

1154
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
I'm driving he's designing

1155
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
We got back to the house

1156
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
About

1157
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
10:30 11:00 at night

1158
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
He goes in to make yogurt

1159
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
I going to see Meg shoes

1160
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Wakes up in

1161
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
She says

1162
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,903
So the deal signed is it down I said no no no

1163
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
That is not going to happen but we've got a much better idea

1164
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
I slept alone that night

1165
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Over my office

1166
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
And the next morning

1167
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
At 7 a.m.

1168
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
I was up

1169
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
At the SBA office in Concord

1170
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
Small business

1171
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Administration remember they

1172
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
They will guarantee loans to business

1173
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
So they make it possible

1174
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
For banks to lend

1175
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
2 high risk

1176
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,247
But you certainly were and you were I mean you you guys were in

1177
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
That you had no plan to come fill your orders

1178
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
How are you going to talk them into

1179
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Is it getting you alone

1180
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,999
Well we had figured out that we could build this

1181
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Factory

1182
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
For a 500 and

1183
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
$97,000

1184
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
So I drove up

1185
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
2

1186
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Vspa and I

1187
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
Sat down with them and they never

1188
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,127
Normally you don't go to the sbu go to the bank to go CSP but I sat down

1189
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
You know stoneyfield to pretty

1190
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Popular brand we're well known in the state so I

1191
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,367
I meet Bill Phillips the head of the New Hampshire SBA office when he walked in at 7:30 and I said

1192
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Bill

1193
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Here's the deal

1194
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
We can build this Factory

1195
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,279
597000 we need an 85% loan Guerra

1196
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
And guess what we've got a bag

1197
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,911
The back of New England's willing to lend us that was a little bit of an exaggerated

1198
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Jason day

1199
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
This is Stone Soup

1200
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Another story

1201
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,287
I said Anna and and I knew

1202
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
That I had to come up with

1203
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
20% of it

1204
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Shareholder

1205
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Equity so

1206
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,783
And I said I've got the hundred thousand hundred twenty five thousand from the shareholders also not quite sure

1207
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
Bill symbolism Theory

1208
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
If you got the bank and you've got this

1209
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
Plan and

1210
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,463
And you've got the

1211
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
Cheryl Dizon will happily do it I drove from there to the Bank of New England

1212
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
Set timer to look guys

1213
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
The

1214
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
SBA is going to

1215
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,727
Provide the loan guarantee and I got the shareholders will you

1216
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
Do this loan

1217
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
And they said well at the SPCA of the word of course we'll do it and if you

1218
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
You guarantee the Equitable do

1219
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
Call the shareholders to a meeting in Boston the next night

1220
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,575
Get together with as many of them as I could had my mother-in-law on speakerphone

1221
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Here we are guys

1222
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
We got the bag

1223
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,951
We got the SBA all we need is your hundred twenty five thousand

1224
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
And

1225
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
To make a long story short

1226
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
We got their money

1227
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
How much money did you raise

1228
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
All told

1229
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Including paying off the debt

1230
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
Two and a half million dollars

1231
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
And opened our new Factory nine months later

1232
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
In Londonderry

1233
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Where we are today

1234
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
And did you both you and Samuel to give up

1235
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Big chunks of Iran

1236
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,015
Oh yeah by then Samuel and I were down to

1237
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
To 10% each

1238
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
In the company

1239
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,159
Now we also had stock options like wheat we hadn't turned back

1240
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,767
The end of 89 we began Manufacturing in this facility

1241
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
The business is now doing

1242
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
3.4 million dollars in

1243
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Shoe sales

1244
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
But we lost 1.4 million that year

1245
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
The next year

1246
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,287
We did 6.5 million in sales

1247
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
And we lost

1248
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
900000

1249
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,455
The following year the second full year in the new Factory

1250
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,807
We did 10.1 million and we made $125,000

1251
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
This is 1992

1252
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
March 92

1253
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
That that was our first year making money

1254
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
To the nineties are this is just

1255
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:41,887
The growth. You guys are on the trajectory and when do you know that you are not sustainable and

1256
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
Things Are

1257
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Are looking at

1258
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
We hit

1259
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
40

1260
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,823
4 million dollars in around 95

1261
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
Now we've got

1262
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,455
Stability and cash flow and this gave us the courage

1263
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
To go back to our roots

1264
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:02,367
Initially with one farmer and eventually now with 1755

1265
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,719
Begin buying organic milk again and of course organic has evolved at this point

1266
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,815
Whole Foods has become a reality I'm in the organic sectors

1267
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Rio

1268
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
So

1269
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,959
In 95 we converted back are playing home if chords to organic

1270
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,287
96 we converted our small cups

1271
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
97 relaunch

1272
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Strength

1273
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
98 worth 78 million in sales

1274
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,503
99 or 100 million + sales

1275
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
And that's

1276
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,367
When I began negotiating with Jenna on

1277
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
2

1278
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Have them come in

1279
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
At this point

1280
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
It's been a long road right 83 you start the company

1281
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,095
You get a hundred million sales by 99

1282
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,679
What was the reason why you decided to sell

1283
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
You know huge steak toot-toot

1284
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,287
Down to the French multinational

1285
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,847
Is yogurt

1286
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Dairy products

1287
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,895
So the answer is

1288
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
The 297 shareholder

1289
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
I mean some of these folks

1290
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Came in

1291
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
In 1984

1292
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Without

1293
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,159
Children now they have kids going to college right I mean they

1294
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Do you need a return on

1295
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
I had no legal

1296
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,047
Application but I felt a moral obligation

1297
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
Shinto

1298
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,911
You pay them back and Samuel also was ready to retire

1299
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
So

1300
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,215
My idea was

1301
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
I'll sell

1302
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,847
My company to you you buy out all the shareholders in my partner

1303
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
But you leave me in control

1304
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,223
By then I was up to about 20% ownership

1305
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Diet through the earn-out

1306
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
And I said

1307
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,575
United

1308
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,647
Commitment I'll stay on for a really long time

1309
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
But you got to let me keep running the shop

1310
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
So I talked

1311
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,535
The 21 companies 20 of them left

1312
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
Actually even then on left and maybe

1313
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,423
The original head of m&a who came to see me said the

1314
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
Gary do you mean to tell me

1315
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,823
We're going to buy 80% of your company and you'll still be on

1316
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Core

1317
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
And I said yes

1318
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,687
And the banker and the lawyers and everyone laughed and

1319
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,295
You know two years later that's the deal we signed I I spent two years negotiating with them

1320
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,855
So you remained the CEO of the company

1321
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,415
End up in the 2000s if I'm if I'm

1322
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
I guess I have my server

1323
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Remember this

1324
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Like all of a sudden

1325
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
Greek yogurt chest

1326
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Loaded

1327
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
And you guys

1328
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
We're not a Greek yogurt

1329
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
What did that

1330
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
Due to your

1331
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
Sales

1332
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Well Greek is not 50% of the ogre

1333
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
The thick

1334
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
Unusual creamy

1335
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Taste of Greek

1336
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Just

1337
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Just caught on

1338
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
It just simply caught on

1339
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,087
And we have a wonderful incredible Greek line

1340
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,415
But it's only for us about 15% of our sales

1341
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
And you know

1342
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
While we're not

1343
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,791
The leader in Greek we are the leader in organic

1344
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
I think we're something like

1345
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,143
80% of organic yogurt in the US

1346
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,031
How much of what happens to you and your success is because of luck and how much because of skill

1347
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Oh

1348
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
Luck counts for a lot of mean

1349
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
I was lucky to meet my

1350
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,687
Incredible wife and

1351
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,247
Turn amazing mother I was lucky to meet

1352
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Samuel I was

1353
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,343
We were lucky to find people who lend us

1354
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
Money despite how

1355
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Syllabus was

1356
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,207
Scale helps you know

1357
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,511
What made this possible was Samuel

1358
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
And his genius and his incredible skills

1359
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,119
Okay without that Superior recipe

1360
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,935
None of this could have happened where you and I wouldn't be talking to yourself

1361
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Of course kill counts but

1362
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,311
You know school has plenty of fantastic entrepreneurs who

1363
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
Failed hue

1364
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
Wonderful skills

1365
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
But just didn't

1366
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Have good luck

1367
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
This

1368
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,063
Small little hippie like yogurt thing that you

1369
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,599
1983

1370
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
Has made you very wealthy

1371
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
It's

1372
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,231
First thought was that ever important you did you

1373
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,791
Did you always want to become rich out of this

1374
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,143
All I wanted was my mother and my mother-in-law to get their money back now

1375
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
I could you not know look you know we began this

1376
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
Interview by talking about my father

1377
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
His failed business and all that

1378
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Tragedy

1379
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Came of that with all the people in my

1380
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
Community Center

1381
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
You know I

1382
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
I was never

1383
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,063
A believer that making money was the Holy Grail

1384
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
You know I sit on many boards now I work with wall streeters and

1385
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
Look I know the

1386
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,767
Best way to convince these guys to invest in organic and

1387
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,351
Renault buses to show you can make a lot of money so and that's

1388
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,167
Basically we did me despite all these obstacles

1389
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
You guys hate

1390
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Yeah

1391
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:39,103
Laughing joke that we had a wonderful company just no Supply and no demand and no one knew that

1392
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,431
There was such a thing as better yogurt and certainly no one who would organic

1393
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
I and yet

1394
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
It's interesting that my dad

1395
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,831
And my mom by the way in both cases

1396
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,647
What I now realize I got from them was this

1397
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,951
Belief in myself that

1398
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
It didn't matter what we

1399
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
What's going to happen

1400
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,327
If if yogurt cups are leaking if

1401
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,935
Stores weren't accepting us if competition was coming on if I

1402
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
Couldn't meet payroll

1403
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,311
You know there was always going to be away and I I learned that from both

1404
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,127
And and your your mother lies she still rap

1405
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Sad that she just passed

1406
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
A couple months ago

1407
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,759
Sorry to hear I'm assuming that her million dollars was in the end of

1408
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Very good in

1409
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
She did

1410
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
Extremely well see

1411
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,415
She and I still Kept Secrets I was

1412
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,255
She passed it's a nearly 97 and

1413
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
I can tell you that

1414
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
The risk she took

1415
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,911
Was Tony Phil was probably whenever

1416
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:39,007
Greatest Point surprise you know she always had this conversation and

1417
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
Begging and pleading her mother not to mess and Taurus always had this one line what she had for decades witches

1418
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,503
Maggie I'm a big girl I know what I'm doing

1419
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,039
It's going to work out

1420
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,439
And she was right Gary hirschberg the co-founder of Stonyfield yogurt by the way back

1421
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
2017

1422
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,255
Same here we first spoke to him

1423
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,607
Danone sold Stonyfield to another company called black Talus

1424
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,423
What are the biggest Dairy companies in the world

1425
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,751
Any amount like Alice paid for Stonyfield

1426
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,591
875 million dollars

1427
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,919
Which is not bad for a yogurt business that began

1428
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,319
With just one cow

1429
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,791

First six months of advisory fees

1443

Do you curve has inverted in the past this has been an indicator that a recession is on it

1444
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
Way will this time be different

1445
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119
Listen to the indicator from Planet Money

Define doubt

1448
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:20,383
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that today were updating a story that we

1449
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,735
First ran last year it begins with Carin Luna ostaseski

1450
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
In back in 2009

1451
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
She was working in marketing

1452
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
In New York City

1453
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
After work one day a friend asked me if I wanted to grab a glass of scotch and I said no I don't drink Scotch that's

1454
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
That's my grandfather

1455
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:42,655
But the friend took her to one of those places that specializes in sky

1456
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:48,287
And that night I tried four different brands and I instantly fell in love with a brand called Oban 14

1457
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,687
And I love the Beauty and the nuances and the complexities of the spirit into almost instantly

1458
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
Karen became a scotch drinker

1459
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:02,367
She started reading about it and then collecting it and then eventually evangelizing about

1460
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,511
I became that friend Tina that was always trying to convince everyone else so you should try skeleton everyone always said the same things

1461
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,911
You know it's burning my nostrils it tastes like gasoline it's too expensive

1462
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:19,263
Hey I already have all this amazing scotch in my personal collection

1463
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
Maybe I could just

1464
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:25,407
Blend my own when is designed specifically to change the way that you think about scotch

1465
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:31,807
Very smooth approachable that has a lot of vanilla and caramel and citrus and just a little bit of smoke

1466
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,927
Starting out in her kitchen I would take two brands that I thought would go well together

1467
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,255
I take a measuring cup and free glasses and I would put

1468
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,399
When that was measured 50/50 another 25 75 and the other 75 25 and then have to renew blend

1469
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,799
And I did this quite a lot and I came up with some really bad not so great tasting Blends like even to summon know that

1470
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:57,919
Jump it before you and tasting it but eventually after about six months of experimenting

1471
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,735
Korean came up with the blind you really like

1472
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,391
At this point she was living in San Francisco and she starts to call and emailed dozens of Master blenders

1473
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,231
Is the only country that makes Scotch witches Scotland

00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,631
But time and time again I just got so many nose and fact they were a Dino's 80 nose

1475
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:24,031
It's an old boys club more than anything right especially being of all things and American woman living in California

1476
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,687
I think from a third-party I heard about yes that's that crazy American woman that's trying to create a scotch brands

1477
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Finally

1478
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:35,039
The 81st person was the one that said yes we can help you

1479
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
It was actually two sisters that they work for their fathers Scotch whiskey importing business and it was just

1480
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,839
Amazing moment that I realized that this could actually come together

1481
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:52,959
Raise $48,000 and use the money to blend her first bottle of Scotch

1482
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359

01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
It comes from Gaelic to the name Sierra means the number 6 and there are six whiskeys in the blend and a friend recently

1487
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,535
I pointed out to me that it could stand for

1488
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Scotch egg

1489
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
