00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,864
Support for how I built this and the following message come from Michigan Economic Development Corporation

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888

Is attracting top talent and top businesses by searching Michigan pure opportunity

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
Yes they were somewhere I think

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,832
So the knock-off Market became looks alright three to four hundred of them

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,648
Everybody came in and said all we can do this

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:31,488
Coke Pepsi Red Bull monster when they all came in

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
Actually our market share dipped

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
From about 90

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
3% down to 67%

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,704
However the one thing they all forgot was

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Yep have a great Prada

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
Robin PRP it's how I built this a show of activators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories

14
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
And the movements they built on Gyros

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
Today show how a former Hindu monk turned into a

16
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Billion dollar business

17
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848
Okay full disclosure

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
I have

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
On the rare occasion

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Swallow the contents of a 5-hour Energy bottle to podcasts and sometimes

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
To get stuff done late at night

22
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
I bet a lot of you have bought a bottle of the stuff

23
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
The airport or pulled up to a gas station late at night and added it to your pile of Twix and Dorito

24
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Frozen Diet Coke right

25
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
So how does it work

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
I don't exactly know I mean caffeine is Magic right

27
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
But I can tell you this little bottle

28
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
Made Manoj bhargava

29
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Billionaire

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
When you turn 14 this is in the late 1960s Minaj's dad decided to come to the u.s.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
India

32
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
Temperature degree

33
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Tok the whole family

34
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
I moved to a tiny apartment in West Philadelphia and started life all over again and they didn't

35
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
I have a whole lot of money so every kid in the family had to work after school and when Munoz was old enough to get a dry

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Driver's license

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
He scraped together enough money to buy a dump truck

38
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
It was the worst contract in the history of humans

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Cost me $350

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
So it was pretty beat up

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Italy to every fluid possible

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Water

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Oil gas

44
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Transmission fluid in the evening and

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
Everything would leave the Ender

46
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Good morning

47
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,704
So wait why did you buy the soundtrack

48
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Wow I got a job

49
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
To clean

50
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
Houses in the ghetto in Philadelphia

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
These are either abandoned houses

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Or houses that were being built

53
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
So I hired somebody some other kid

54
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
And we used to go

55
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Clean the houses

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Try everything on the truck

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Go to the dump site

58
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
And try to dump this thing scores to dump the Newark burial U-verse

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Jump up and down and try to

60
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Shut it down

61
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Tired after time I've ever had

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
How much money did you make doing this like was it really worth

63
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
The money

64
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
Well I made $500

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
For the summer

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
And I I sold the truck to somebody for 350 so I got all my money out of the truck

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
But you turned a profit

68
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
Well he thought there was a lot of

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,488
I don't know if it's a profit because if we worked 11 hours a day 5 days a week

70
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
All summer

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Private laws

72
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
It was incredible amount of profit there

73
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
Kissing you do this I guess

74
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,752
You know as you are singing about college

75
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
And then in the duplicate you applied College

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Well I apply to a few schools

77
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
And ended up at Princeton

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
That's pretty good

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
That's okay

80
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Ain't nothing

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
My father was happier than I was

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
You weren't happy

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Well I

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
I mean obviously honest

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
About it I feel like this is great but this isn't

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,071
And then you go to college for a really one purpose and I know

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Fancy people have different reasons

88
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
Broaden your mind mostly everybody goes to college

89
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Get a better job

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
That's why you really go

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
And so

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
I really wasn't interested in

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
The trappings of a

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Better job

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
So

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
I don't need this

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
It doesn't make any sense

98
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Site I got to find something better

99
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
And so after the finish the first year

100
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
And I left

101
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
You dropped out

102
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
Didn't your parents freak out

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Pretty much

104
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,535
Imagine what did he say to you

105
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
You know they were not happy

106
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
For sure they were

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
What are you doing

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
I pretended I'm just taking a year off

109
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
So what did you

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Like what you did you go back to Philadelphia

111
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
No actually

112
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
After the next

113
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Several years I

114
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
For lack of a better word I'd say

115
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
I became a monk

116
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Kind of a month

117
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Like a monk in a monastery

118
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Yes

119
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
I went

120
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
To a bunch of places all over there

121
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Please put on the song a lot of places in India

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
And

123
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,351
Found something which was really valuable

124
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
I practice that

125
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
A lot of years

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
And that's

127
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
That's pretty much all I'm going to

128
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Say about that

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Yeah

130
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
I don't want to pry too much into the

131
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Into the details of it I just want to

132
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
It sounds like that

133
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
Profound effect on who you became

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
History of Time

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
No doubt about it that was actually my true education

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:51,743
It was sort of an education on what is life how to live and how to live it so fundamental because it affects

137
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
How you do business how you do

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Interaction are you

139
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
How you do everything

140
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
But also

141
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
How to look at some things in a very fundamental way

142
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,615
Most of us tend to just assume things yeah you know whatever our parents taught us whatever Society.

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Well all of that was

144
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Taken away

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Start from scratch

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
That's a perspective that

147
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
That takes years

148
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And then when you look at things different

149
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
Did you work hard during that time did you do labor oh yeah

150
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Lot of work it was really tough discipline

151
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
I mean because you're never off

152
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Ever

153
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Day and night you're never off

154
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Yeah how long were you away

155
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
For a lot of years

156
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
A lot time

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Let's move on

158
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Okay no worries

159
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
What did you do when you got back to

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Why I guess my thought

161
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
Process at that time was that

162
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
You know I need to

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Probably

164
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
Earn some money so I can support all the work

165
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
That

166
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Is being done

167
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Yunnan India

168
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And then

169
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
I bought a business

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
That was going under

171
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
It was at what kind of business was it

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Amazon Plastics business

173
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Wow did you did you know anything about plastic

174
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
No but

175
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Look business is really

176
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Like Mustangs

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Tell me about common sense

178
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
Yeah and we bought it for under liquidation value

179
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
So the bank finance the whole thing

180
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,575
And it was losing money and I looked at it and I said okay I can fix it

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
So what was the business called

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,767
And Indiana called at Prime PVC while their biggest product was chair straps you know the time that

183
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
Outdoor furniture

184
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
So then they invented the strap

185
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
Wow they made that and then they got competition

186
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Got into trouble

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,079
How did you even begin to think that this

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
What you could do like cuz I'm

189
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
You had this incredible

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,503
Experience in India but I'm assuming you did not have any background in

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Elasticsearch

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
No

193
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
You just look at it and say okay you know I don't know their stuff

194
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
I don't have to go and make the plastic

195
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Stop

196
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
But I know

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
What it cost I can figure that out

198
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
He cut away that stuff which is losing its

199
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
I do it's not rocket science

200
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
But

201
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
If you use common sense you're in great shape if you use experts

202
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
You're in so much trouble

203
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
How long does it take

204
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
For you to turn that company around

205
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Make it pop

206
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Oh that that was 30 days

207
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
30 days

208
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Just by cutting

209
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,463
Cutting costs and and cutting the production time and they're just a bunch of comments and stuff

210
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
You know you look at

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
All right where we spending money

212
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
And why are we spending that much money

213
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
I got it took common sense you say okay

214
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
I spent $10,000 on this

215
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Sol Y

216
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Is it making anything

217
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
No

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
11

219
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
So how long were you were you running this company

220
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
Well I was involved in it for about 7 years

221
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
And we grew at

222
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
From basically from 02 about

223
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Hank

224
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
When I

225
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Left it was 23 million in sale

226
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Wow

227
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
So you sold that company

228
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Yes I I kind of retired from it first

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
I said okay

230
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
In that you have done this already alright I got to go do something else

231
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
So I left town

232
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
Soaps I'm assuming that the one you sold this company you were

233
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,383
Like financially secure for the rest of your life pretty much

234
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Okay so how do you go from

235
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
From semi-retirement

236
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
In the Plastics industry to

237
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Okay so

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
After my retirement

239
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
I thought okay

240
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
What do I do now

241
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
And so I thought

242
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,375
The only way to have residual income in other words

243
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Ongoing income

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,263
Is to have something that you own right you can you can either find

245
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
An invention or I can invent something

246
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
And otherwise you don't have a business

247
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
Adidas 2-way stood what is invented yourself

248
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
The second is to find it

249
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,087
So I started a company that looked for great Technologies worldwide

250
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
In the in a chemical area

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
And we got thousands of submissions

252
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Pasties all over the

253
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
And then eventually what happened is

254
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Founders

255
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Technology

256
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
I found it in it natural products

257
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Trade show

258
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Where where was it

259
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
This wasn't

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
California

261
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,615
See you work so you went to the trade chart show thinking maybe I'll do something in the Natural Foods world

262
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Well

263
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,271
Actually the other way around I want to try to go see if I can find something that I can buy or license right

264
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
So I went there and it

265
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
I turned out

266
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
I am meeting with you

267
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
These guys that

268
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Addison

269
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Sumproduct

270
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
So after the meeting a lot

271
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,351
And then it was like 2 in the afternoon I've had all my God I got meetings till 10 at night you know I'm not going to survive

272
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Tyler Reddick

273
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
So then they had some energy something so I said

274
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
I went back to the ranch

275
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,335
You know you said that energy product can you

276
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Can I get some

277
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
So they gave me a little bit

278
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
And my God it was

279
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,087
This is amazing with these are just people displaying a product at the trade show

280
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Yes

281
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
And it was an energy drink

282
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Yeah it was a big drink

283
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Cuz I 16 hours

284
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Yeah and it was amazing

285
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
For the next few hours and hours I was

286
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Great

287
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Syfy

288
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Okay I could sell this

289
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
I went back to them

290
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Undeserved

291
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Neil Science Guy

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
And I'm just a lonely business guys

293
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Basically cell get lost

294
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,039
What did you say you said to them hey I want to work with you guys I want to license this thing I want to buy this from you and they said no we're not

295
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Cracked

296
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
So

297
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,439
I I kind of looked at it's okay I should be able to figure out very quickly

298
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
So

299
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Yeah I looked at the later I said

300
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Okay

301
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
There's a good starting what was it what was in the drink

302
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,191
I mean in in when they list ingredients I don't tell you how much it was

303
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Right right

304
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
So you have to figure that out

305
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
You know how hard can it be

306
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
I'll figure it out

307
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
Sexy you go back to where you live and you started

308
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Tinker with

309
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
A recipe to try and recreate a version of

310
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
This drink

311
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Write my thought was

312
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
You know these guys come upstairs I can do better

313
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
What were you doing this in like a kitchen in your house

314
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
Well obviously I started a company and so we were

315
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
We had labs and so on

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Until what I did wasn't really rocket science

317
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
People always ask you all the genocides background

318
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
Video background inefficient

319
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,359
Know that only got only message you up further it doesn't really help you at all

320
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Okay because

321
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,503
Most inventions have been made by people who didn't have a background in whatever they were invented

322
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,879
If you look at throughout history the great stuff was made by people who didn't

323
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Follow

324
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
The rules of the experts

325
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Experts are great

326
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Telling you what what you shouldn't do

327
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
And for that they're useful

328
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Yeah but what you should do I don't have a clue

329
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,727
So what were some of the ingredients just that just I'm just curious at that they had that you were working

330
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
What is it called when you put in together

331
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
Basically they were vitamins

332
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Amino acids

333
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,967
I mean in layman terms it would be vitamins for the brain and

334
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
So what we created with something that is really not much to do with energy

335
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
But it had everything to do with Focus

336
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
I mean the first thing I do is

337
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
99 fortunately everybody laughs at me in the company as well as I try everything on me

338
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Cuz I'm not going to take it then I'm not going to

339
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Anybody else

340
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
So I tried it on me

341
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
And

342
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
And see if

343
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
If it actually does

344
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
What it supposed to do in

345
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
It does give you

346
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Better focus better

347
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Clarity

348
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
Every product we make

349
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Crime and get involved in

350
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
As if I can't use it if my family doesn't use it

351
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
I don't want to do it

352
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Because then you're just a con man

353
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
You know you just

354
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Selling people stop you don't use

355
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
I'm curious because at this around the time in the city early 2000

356
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Do a lots of energy drink

357
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
Out there on the market right likes it she like how are you going to

358
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Differentiate your product from from others

359
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
That were you out there

360
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
So

361
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
I thought about it and I said

362
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Like if I if I make another drink

363
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
First of all I got to fight for space in

364
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
The cooler

365
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
And against Red Bull monster

366
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
I got also fight Coke Pepsi and Budweiser

367
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
So

368
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
You promised that if you want to try that

369
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
It's high tide poke and the second thing that came to my mind was

370
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
What if I'm tired

371
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Why am I thirsty also

372
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
You know I mean it be like Tylenol selling 16 oz

373
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
Bottles of Tylenol I just want

374
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
To do a quick I want to drink this whole thing

375
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
And

376
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
2 oz it's really not a drink

377
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
It's a delivery system

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
So how did you take it from

379
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
This thing in the lab.

380
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Bottling it up and then trying to sell it

381
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Stores

382
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
How long did that process take

383
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
Think it took less than 6 months

384
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
You know we tried to product had it tested at a bunch of people take it

385
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
So then we find a toddler

386
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Michelle K

387
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
You make these things

388
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
How to design by Design

389
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Label and so on

390
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
And then off we went

391
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
We made the first batch

392
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Actually it was great

393
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
But it tasted

394
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
Horrible what would it taste like

395
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Why it tastes like cough syrup

396
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Badcock

397
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Not doing good cough syrup

398
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
It was really bad in just a moment, Noah's bark of a

399
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Turn that cough syrup into liquid gold it's how I built this

400
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,423

And thanks

433
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
It's how I built this from NPR

434
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
And Gyros

435
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
Totally nuts at the guy who invented 5-hour Energy sounds like he has never had a v

436
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Power energy drink

437
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Shelta hats

438
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,719
Anyway at this point Munoz had a company and a product that

439
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
You still tweaking

440
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
And the only thing left

441
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
What's it come up with a name

442
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
You know I didn't pay attention to

443
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,983
The advertising guys who said oh no it's the branding

444
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Imaging

445
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
You know you should name it slippers app

446
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
And you know

447
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Is it on

448
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Okay

449
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,919
To me I understand function

450
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
And that's what we're going to do

451
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
So we named it 5-hour Energy it's not a very

452
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Clever name

453
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Cuz my thought was that you have

454
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Less than half a second

455
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
The consumer to either buy it or Not by

456
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
You have to communicate

457
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
During that half-second

458
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
What are you

459
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
You know what you want to do

460
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
What are you about

461
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
That's all we named it five hours

462
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,495
So how did you even begin to sell the product where did you go

463
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Initially

464
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
Why we went to the largest vitamin store which is

465
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
Dancy

466
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,527
And so we went to them and they said okay sure the cubic the largest vitamin store in the country

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
You've no background of this industry

468
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
How did you even get into the door

469
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
I think one of the great Parts is not having a background in the

470
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Because

471
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,583
Those who have great backgrounds in the industry always think to takes forever

472
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
That we slow things down

473
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
So it turns out GNC

474
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Always looking for new products because

475
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Once the product gets Mass

476
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
GNC

477
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Sort of out of it

478
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
Cuz you know what Adam Walmart and everybody else

479
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Nobody's going to buy it

480
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,039
Antsy see you pitch GNC you went to their headquarters and Pitch them on this

481
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
I gave him

482
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Shots

483
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Cracked so they put them

484
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
Bunch of their stores

485
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Just like right at the cash register

486
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Right at the cashier

487
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
And it just belong there you could

488
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Tala just look that way

489
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,447
Should be there in a small around 2004-2005

490
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
This is for

491
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Mm

492
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
And how did they do

493
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Where do they sell right away

494
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Not really I mean I didn't advertise at all

495
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
The first week it's sold only 200 bottles

496
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
It was horrible

497
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Yeah

498
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
And this is a thousand stores

499
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,647
Are you sure you thinking maybe this is not going to work

500
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
No not at all.

501
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Cuz first week I mean

502
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Nothing sounds right now

503
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Accurate

504
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,375
So six months later we just waited

505
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Ensouled unco

506
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
And at the end of that six months

507
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
It was selling $10,000 a week

508
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
Just people tried it for 2 miles

509
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
A lot of exercise people that buy it

510
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
GNC in

511
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Jesse's

512
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
Has very limited customer

513
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
It's over for them to be doing ten thousand a week

514
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Astounding

515
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
I so then we went

516
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
To the drug

517
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Companies

518
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
We went to

519
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Rite Aid in

520
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Walgreens

521
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
And then our

522
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
How long did it take for

523
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
5-hour Energy

524
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
To become

525
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Prophet like

526
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
Profitable company was it in that first 6 months

527
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
No no no

528
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,591
And it took a few years it took to three years

529
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Cuz of the first part

530
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Is always the hardest

531
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
They're all kinds of interesting problems you know you have to advertise

532
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
And yet it's not everywhere so she advertises and nobody could find it

533
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Hillary get the plane for like

534
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
Nowhere.

535
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
And then you go to you know that's how you put it in a drugstore

536
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
And you said okay you can find it at this trucks

537
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,679
And then the customer goes there and there's nobody there that knows where it is and can't find it

538
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
It's in there

539
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
So

540
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
There's so many

541
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
Different issues that happen in the beginning

542
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
That you have to have to start over

543
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Just

544
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Get through

545
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
Music business business is one of those things

546
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
You have to do everything right and then you have to get lucky

547
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Yeah

548
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
When anybody says that

549
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Good luck is not part of it

550
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Is just arrogant

551
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Why do you think it

552
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Took off

553
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
Why do you think people bought it because

554
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,376
It's a weird little bottle I mean

555
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,448
I'm I'm used it I've used it before

556
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
And it is it does work

557
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
What is this weird bottle and you think

558
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
5 Hour Energy

559
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Good for me like

560
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
We are definitely the media is

561
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
Has sort of looked at it and said oh God you know it's normal person looking at it would say

562
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Different kinds of normal

563
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,000
If if you're working two jobs

564
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
If you're if you're driving truck

565
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Configure

566
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
If your on Wall Street working 16-hour days if

567
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
If you're in the

568
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Los Angeles

569
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
On a movie set

570
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
All of those guys work really long hours

571
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
At that point it's really not a choice it's like okay

572
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
I gotta survive somehow

573
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,040
There's a just a normal number of people that looked at it and didn't sort of believe the media hype

574
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
But you're right

575
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
The bottle

576
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Makes it

577
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
And because it's out front

578
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,744
People look at it until why I don't know I don't I don't know if I should try next to the Slim Jims

579
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
Unlike the lighters

580
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Yeah

581
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
But again we do Salah bunch.

582
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
If we sold it to everybody that needed

583
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
We would be 20 times outside

584
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm curious about competitors

585
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
I mean

586
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
For people trying to try to copy the concept

587
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Yes they were somewhere I think

588
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Knock-off Market

589
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
Became likes alright three to four hundred of them

590
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
Wow everybody came in and said all we can do

591
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Coke

592
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Came in with a product

593
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
The shot Pepsi

594
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
Red Bull monster they all came in

595
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
With shots

596
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Pinotage

597
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Return to Oz

598
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
And

599
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
I am starting to have better distribution muscle than we have

600
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
More resources than we have

601
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,616
And so people try a name and came in at the Lesser price than us

602
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
When they all came in

603
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Actually our market share dipped

604
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
From about 90

605
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
3%

606
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Down to 67

607
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
And everybody everybody tried their product

608
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
Yeah however

609
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
The one thing they all forgot

610
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
Was you have a great product

611
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,840
So your market share dropped to 67% once all these competitors. Come in

612
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Cracked

613
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
And now it's back up to 93

614
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
That's insane

615
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
I mean

616
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
There is nothing that has a 93% market share

617
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,360
Well whenever people ask me what product are you like I said

618
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
Where they wear WD-40

619
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
It's not a

620
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Category

621
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
It's

622
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
We own that cat

623
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Rihanna

624
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Wentworth guys

625
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,488
But there's lots of really great products at yourself admit that when you tried that energy drink

626
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,096
It's a convention years earlier that was a good product but that

627
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Never went anywhere

628
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Presumably

629
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
Well there's also this other part

630
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
You still have to have some skill and

631
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Some resources

632
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,336
You have to still get it in front of people

633
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
You got it

634
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,456
The start of a successful product is the product has to be

635
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
Okay that's just a start

636
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,576
Button that the second part II part is you got to understand

637
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
Digital Distribution Systems you have to understand

638
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
How to get it out there and have to work at it

639
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
Like I said you have to do everything else

640
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
At that point right

641
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
And if

642
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Both the great product

643
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
And that

644
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Comes along then you have a success

645
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,240
If you don't have a great product you can do everything right and still fail

646
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
What's soda

647
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
Your trait or personality

648
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
Trait that you do have

649
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
It is

650
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
Enables you to do this

651
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,088
To have the confidence to believe it I mean it I will you just

652
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
Incredibly optimistic that this thing was going to work

653
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,304
No not really I think one of the traits that you have to have

654
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
To be an entrepreneur

655
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Is to be able to

656
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
And you know to take the Heat

657
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
A failing

658
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Because

659
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,800
I mean there were so many projects I tried

660
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
Please ask me I said

661
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
How do you how do you get up

662
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
And do it again

663
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
Psychedelic I fall so many times

664
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
I've got pavement marks on my face

665
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
So what

666
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Just got up again and do it again

667
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
And I went to probably 20 different products

668
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Big failures

669
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Little failures

670
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
And you if you

671
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
Can't do that

672
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
You know you should best just go work in a large company

673
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
You have signed the giving pledge which means you what you promised to give away to 99% of your wealth is that right

674
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
And so 1% will be laughed and

675
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
You have a child

676
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
Get me now you going to

677
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
You know make sure that your son is

678
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
A life of comfort or or are you basically saying note can I get anything

679
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
Basically there's an old saying

680
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
That

681
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
If you raise your child to be useless

682
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Why giving money

683
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
And if you

684
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,984
If you raise your child to be useful why does he need money

685
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,592
Tok to you expect your child to do it all on his own

686
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,408
Absolutely everybody else does why you know

687
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,992
In order to make a a good worthwhile life

688
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,576
You have to have the confidence the only way you can have confidence to do it yourself

689
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
So

690
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Temeku

691
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
Are children miserable is not I think the job of parents and actually I mean I was lucky cuz he said great I don't want

692
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
And so

693
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,144
He kind of grew up as a cheapskate

694
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
The cheapest guy I know

695
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,384
How has becoming a very wealthy person changed you

696
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Double your lifestyle

697
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Not a whole lot I mean

698
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
Basically you know I get up in the morning and

699
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Pour myself some cereal

700
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,624
Go to work

701
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
That

702
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
I do have the most expensive Hobby in the world is to

703
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
It to work for that

704
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
People that don't have

705
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
How much

706
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
So now believe me that's a really expensive Hobby

707
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Well I found out that

708
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
Bottom third of the world

709
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
Doesn't even have electricity you know I mean

710
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
You know what it would be like to just at the end of the day

711
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,432
1600 after 6 7 to just sit there in the dark

712
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
Adam billions more than billion people

713
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,600
So we I created this thing called The Invention shop

714
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
And we've created equipment

715
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
To go into these houses really cheap

716
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
That'll give them electricity

717
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:49,376
It's actually a hybrid bicycle you buy pedal for an hour and electricity for a day

718
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
To me with exciting is

719
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
To see

720
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
It all

721
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
For example you gave these bicycles out

722
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
As a test

723
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
And there was a widower with three little kids

724
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
And

725
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
I mean she was busy all day with the kids

726
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
So now with the lights in her house

727
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
She's able to sold till midnight

728
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
And I guess if I bucks a day

729
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,928
And with that she feeds our family

730
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
They even have money for school

731
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
That's a thrill

732
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:27,520
If somebody listen to this is prized thinking about starting a business but no money no connections just

733
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Idea

734
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
What is it that they have

735
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,104
Do do what is

736
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
What is the the one thing that they

737
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Have to

738
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Have her Focus

739
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
Wild first

740
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Use your common sense

741
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Do not use MBA speaker

742
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Second you have to be totally determined

743
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
I hate the word passionate

744
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Because

745
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,816
You got hit in the face a few times passion seems to fade

746
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Determination

747
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Means basically you yet

748
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Your face hits the floor

749
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
20 times you get up 21 times

750
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
You know you just get up every time no matter what happens you get up and do it again

751
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
If you have those two

752
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,944
And the third thing is a need is a sense of urgency

753
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Do it now

754
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Don't wait

755
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Don't delay

756
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
If you have those three things those are all you need

757
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:20,000
Manoj bhargava is still the CEO

758
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,328
Innovation Ventures which makes 5-hour Energy

759
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,704
And despite his past life as a Hindu Monk and is General chilled-out Sensibility

760
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
Munoz does drink 5-hour Energy

761
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
He says about 5 bottles a week

762
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
I am assuming you do not drink it before bedtime that would be dumb

763
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,728
And please don't turn it off just yet in a moment

764
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
We're going to hear from you about the things

765
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
You guys are building

766
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors TIAA weather is investing advice banking

767
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
Or retirement

768
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
TIAA believe smart financial decisions should enable life not

769
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Define it

770
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,416
Because real success isn't just measured in zeros

771
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,744
Is having a career that delivers meaning and purpose

772
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
It's connecting with family

773
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
Friend and it's giving back

774
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,144
TIAA calls this the new success story

775
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,448
And I want to help you achieve it everyday

776
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472

777
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
TIAA

778
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,432
Hey welcome back it's time now for how you built that

779
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:48,576
And you know we've been doing the teacher for a while and we've heard about all kinds of products or making snacks

780
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,416
Clothing bags bikes apps but somehow

781
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
We have overlooked this

782
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
Very vital and growing sector

783
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
Early in the morning and right now. I just fed him they're getting

784
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
Morning breakfast Dripping Springs Texas

785
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,480
Chickens in her very large backyard

786
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
Anyway she got her idea for a business about four years ago when she and her husband Monte were on a

787
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,208
Road trip and that time he was in the construction business

788
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
We were

789
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
Just kind of lamenting how not find the commercial construction industry was an

790
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
We were brainstorming different ideas and I said you should build chicken coops or we Seville chicken coops

791
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,896
Diane only had a couple of chickens in her one coop

792
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
Outback and she starts Almonte all the ways that that Coupe

793
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,296
Could be better and so I just said

794
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
Okay don't be a chicken coop it has to have

795
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
You know easy access doors has to be easy to clean and

796
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
I just said

797
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
Don't build something ugly

798
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
Went to work building a coup

799
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:09,472
That was not ugly and I said okay that's cute it was a coupe with a rounded roof not to buy

800
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
Foxy with clean simple lines

801
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,944
We could start selling these poop to other Chicken Keepers across the country

802
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Because as the local food movement started to take hold all over the country

803
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,600
More and more people even in cities

804
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
Wanted

805
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
Chickens new people like the idea of fresh eggs even though it's just one item on your

806
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Breakfast plate at least you know where it came from but of course if you are raising a chicken in a city

807
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:46,080
I could really bug your neighbors which says Diane is why you need a very classy look

808
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,480
So we use Cedarwood completely different wood than anybody

809
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
Selling at a big-box store or something like that when you look at one of our tubes here saying that the gray

810
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
Reign of the wood bridges very pretty

811
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Their business

812
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
20 Cedarwood Loop start with

813
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:15,008
And they put them up for sale on Craigslist on a Monday and by Friday they were completely

814
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Sold out literally

815
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,176
Friday night we're out there with our car headlights Shining

816
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:28,576
Into the shop with our kids helping us assemble all of these coops

817
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,160
So they had a business Diana Monte built-in 8

818
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,000
Thousand square foot shop in their backyard to make more coops

819
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,400
And during our busy season which is right now they have 10 people working for them in the last year

820
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Diesel 1700 coupes

821
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,288
Which is enough to keep the family and the chickens going

822
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,176
The only problem the entire operation has become their obsession

823
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Oh my gosh we cannot switch

824
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
I mean we do

825
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
Sometimes talk about other things but I would say that good percentage of our time is spent talking about Urban

826
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
New company

827
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,096
Bet Urban Coop company founded by Diane 20 of Dripping Springs Texas

What did he do

852
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,352
To deserve to be killed that night and shot so many times

853
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:54,496
People see what they want to see almost no one can see those videos from a neutral perspective

854
