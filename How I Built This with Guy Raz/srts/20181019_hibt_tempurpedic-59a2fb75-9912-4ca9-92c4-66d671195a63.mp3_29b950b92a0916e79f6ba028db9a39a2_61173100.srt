And I hope to see you there

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
How did you raise the money to start this Venture at all

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
That's a really good question because I had to go back to all my basic same

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
People who invested with me in my other horse Ventures that failed right

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
That had failed gone broke so I had to convince them that even though we lost money in something that I knew a lot

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,672
What about that we were going to make money in something that I do nothing about

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Ramen

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Prp's how I built this

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,192
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

33
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
And the stories behind the movements they built

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
I'm guy Raz and the most spectacular pivots ever from horse race

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Racing 2 memory foam

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,136
And how we turned that gambled into one of the biggest mattress companies in the world

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
Don't sleep on a TempurPedic mattress

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
You may have tested one out at the

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Store or see more of those commercials where the people are jumping up and down on the bed next to a glass of red wine that does not

40
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Still

41
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
But either way you probably know that

42
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,920
Tempur-Pedic is why these squishy mattresses that feels strangely firm and soft

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
At the same time

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
What does memory foam that molds itself to your body

45
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
And today of course plenty of other

46
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,624
And pillows have memory foam

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Russell first launched Tempur-Pedic in the US

48
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,304
It was a completely new idea a new sensation

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Note to clear

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Bobby did not invent memory foam in fact

51
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,520
When you discovered it on a trip to Sweden absolutely nothing about

52
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
Foam mattresses

53
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
Even making a living in an industry that

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Couldn't be more different

55
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Horse racing and horse breeding

56
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Yes you heard that correctly

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
The guy who brought Tempur-Pedic to America

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
A two and a half

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Billion dollar company today

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
What's a horse breeder

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
The time he discovered memory foam

62
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
He was also we shall we say

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
Desperately in need of a new gig

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
He did

65
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Worcester CVS

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Credible

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Control in a new kind of mattress

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
Basically gambled everything to launch it in the US

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
Bobby Trussell grew up in Milwaukee

70
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
In the 1960

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
He's and was the oldest of seven kids

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
Sales and his mom is homemaker

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
And Bobby work

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
Odd jobs from the time he was a kid paper route some

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Things like that

76
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,536
But when he was about 11 years old something happened that

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Course

78
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Erase entire life

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
When my dad was I think early forties

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,544
He went on a vacation with my uncle

81
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
And

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
They rode some horse

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
And he came back and

84
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,736
He sounds like I'm going to buy a riding horse I was 11

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
In any kid who

86
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Here's that is

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
Totally music to his ears so I rode with my dad

88
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Between the ages of 11 in

89
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
I went to college was 18

90
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Pretty much

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Every week

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
And

93
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Horse racing became my favorite sport

94
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,263
We would get the issues of the Chicago Tribune and I would I would cut out the race results and keep them in a scrap

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
Apple can try and follow when it's been the same horse ran back

96
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,943
So that was I was totally enthralled in that

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Eventually went to Marquette University but

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
Horse racing was always in the back of his mind

99
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Pretty much yeah

100
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
I major in finance

101
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
But I would often be sitting

102
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
In the back row of a lecture

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Reading the racing form I would get my

104
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
Marquette buddies and we would get in the car and we would drive it

105
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
90 minutes south to Chicago and go to the races at Arlington or

106
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Hawthorne race track

107
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
And

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,807
We would have a ball but I know several times we were so broke on the way back we had to run the tolls

109
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
I didn't have the

110
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
Gates that you just Breeze right through my hope I didn't catch you

111
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Africology

112
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
You are assuming you went to

113
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Stop working with

114
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
With racehorses full-time

115
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
Yes the Thoroughbred to actually raised at the racetrack

116
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
And that's where my interest lies

117
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
So I

118
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Who wrote letters

119
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
To the top

120
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
10 horse trainers

121
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
In the country

122
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
And

123
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
None of them

124
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Didn't answer

125
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
And one of them

126
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
Was John Mayer rude

127
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
NTR UD

128
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
Who offer me two jobs

129
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
One at his farm in Ocala

130
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
And the other one

131
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
At the racetrack at Belmont Park

132
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Which is the New York ride

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
In New York

134
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
And I never been on a plane before

135
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
So I went there

136
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Here with my bag

137
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,311
Showed up at the front gate and told him I had a job with John a rude showed him the letter

138
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,455
And they said well missionary still in Florida he's not going to be here for two weeks

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:18,111
And I said oh no and they said well but his assistants here he's got 10 horses

140
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
Here you can go see him so they put me in inside the you track on the back

141
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,399
Stretch to call it where the Barnes are I went to meet the assistant trainer who was a

142
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
Yugoslavian guys book

143
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
You know very broken English

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
And I told him the story and he said

145
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
You have a college

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Degree boy

147
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
And I said yeah he said

148
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
What you doing here boy

149
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
I said I want to work on the racetrack and he said you can stay over the bar

150
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,535
Only one problem is we have the mattress frames came up from Florida

151
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Division but we don't have the

152
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
The actual mattresses yet

153
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
So

154
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
I said okay

155
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
That's fine

156
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
So anyway

157
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
I slept on the springs

158
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
For two weeks until the other horses in a mattress

159
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Who came up with the word

160
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,503
And who would have thought 20 years later you would have been sleeping on a beautiful Tempur-Pedic mattress

161
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,135
Yeah in that amazing

162
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Mid-seventies

163
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
You start working at Belmont and what was your job there

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
I started out at the hot Walker making $75 a week it's a Hot Wok

165
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
A hot Walker is guy who walks

166
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Hots

167
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Hots

168
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,799
Horses that come from their morning

169
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
I work out

170
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
And there

171
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
They're sweaty and hot and you need to walk him in a circle

172
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:53,599
For about 30 minutes and make sure any water them off slowly so he make sure that they don't

173
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
Drink too much water cause acne

174
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
And then cuz what I wanted to do was be

175
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
A groom

176
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
A groom a 225 a week

177
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
And they signed you three horses that were

178
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Totally yours to take care of

179
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
Toothbrush and have clean brushing to clean their feet than to put bandages on him and

180
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
Feed them and take care of them to do all that for a while but

181
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
What's the thing you really want to do

182
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Trainer

183
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Trainers what I wanted to do

184
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
But I did leave

185
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
New York after 2 years

186
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
And went to Chicago

187
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
And my dad

188
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Bought me

189
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
I really really really slow

190
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Racehorse

191
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Transfer like

192
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
1500 box

193
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,447
And so it got me my trainers license and I got in the game and

194
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
Ended up training my first winner

195
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
I was at Keeneland where it where is Keeneland

196
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
Keeneland is the racetrack in Lexington

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
In Kentucky

198
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
In Kentucky

199
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Lexington Kentucky

200
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
The great horses are

201
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Are trained

202
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
It's the horse breeding capital of the world right now

203
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Looks like

204
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
I guess you're assertive

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
Hitting up against the early eighties you're probably closed

206
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,559
30 years old at that time but we were you married at that point

207
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
No

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
You're single guy

209
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Single guy

210
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Focus on horses

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Single-minded single guy

212
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
What is UCR in Lexington Kentucky and I guess

213
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
You should Korean horse racing

214
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Right

215
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Yeah

216
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
I got a job at gainesway Farm

217
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
And I had

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
Studied a degree

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
While I was

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,391
On my RaceTrac adventure and became something of an expert

221
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
And they needed that

222
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
And that was the best move I ever made in my young life because

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Hi I was soon

224
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,935
Involved in racing at a very high level it said it was a horse that my dad bought me for $1,500

225
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,079
We were buying Kentucky Derby favorites for 10 million dollars a month before the race wait one horse for 10 million dollars

226
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Yeah and

227
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,479
Can a horse of his name is crowd appeal and he eventually ran last in the derby

228
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
But it was quite an experience

229
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
And we also have

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Significant interest in

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,207
In European racing we were just as interested in who

232
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,351
Was going to win the English Derby or the French derby are the Irish Derby as we wore the Kentucky Derby cuz

233
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
We are looking for stallion price

234
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
And so I spent a lot of time I went over

235
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Boeing horses that we had made major investment

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,407
At what point because I guess I will support you through branched out of one on your own and started your own

237
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
White horse

238
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Lending or insurance

239
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,807
Startup write that was in

240
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
So I was at gainesway from 79 to 86

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
And then

242
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
I decided to go out on my own with Tim Philpott he was the general counsel the in-house counsel for Gateway

243
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
And basically you would like the advising

244
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Trainers online

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Which horses to buy and sell things like that

246
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Absolutely

247
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
So we started stallion Management Service

248
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,687
To do the same thing we do the Gaines way but do it remotely for Farms that couldn't afford to have that

249
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Infrastructure

250
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
And then we also had a company called Thoroughbred Advisory Group which advised people

251
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Another horse related transactions

252
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
And that was

253
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,119
Very good idea but very bad timing because the horse business started to go into recession

254
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Is this is in the in the

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
The ladies

256
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
It was in the late 80s

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Prices start going down

258
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
And essentially

259
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Everybody

260
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
White Rock

261
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Including you

262
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Including me

263
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Like how broke did you go

264
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,063
Well I was I felt like I was the brokest man in America

265
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Because you know I did get married

266
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
When I was 34 in 1986

267
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
And so

268
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
I buy this time I fast-forwarding to

269
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
19

270
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
91 I had two little kids

271
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
And we moved

272
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
To a better location for kids than my

273
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Downtown townhouse

274
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
But I couldn't sell

275
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
The

276
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
First house my two houses

277
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Two kids

278
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Into mortgages

279
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
And no job

280
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
Did you have to

281
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Declare bankruptcy

282
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
No I never did I order everybody in town

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
But

284
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
Everybody else would everybody too so everybody knew that that

285
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
Suing isn't going to really helping

286
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
The big joke was it

287
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
If one guy could come up with

288
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
$10,000

289
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
He could pay $1000000

290
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
And that cuz

291
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335
Personae would pay B&B with Casey and

292
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
We come all the way back around a person a

293
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
So how how

294
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
How badly in debt were you

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
House probably $1000000 in debt

296
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
So how did you

297
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Pay your bills when your business goes bust

298
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Two kids

299
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
House that you've a mortgage on another house that you are living in

300
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
How do you what do you do

301
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Well

302
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
It wasn't easy because I would go to my

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,871
And my secretary say Bobby we don't pay the rent in a couple months in the landlord was down here

304
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
And then I got there Grand turn off the

305
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
Electricity and I would go home and my wife would tell me the

306
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
The same thing

307
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Gas company called and

308
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
So I

309
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Really didn't know what to do

310
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
I would

311
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Get in the mail

312
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
I would get

313
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Pre-approved credit cards

314
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
Going you're pre-approved for a $25,000

315
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Line of credit

316
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Piano

317
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
And I would say you're really stupid when I would

318
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
I would take them up on it cuz and we would charge groceries onto the credit card

319
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
Always figuring that you know things were going to turn around

320
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
But this was the period of my life where I

321
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
Fell back onto

322
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
My roots

323
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Catholic Education in

324
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
I started going to Sunday

325
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
Mass with my wife when we got married

326
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,327
She really move me up quite a bit but you know I would

327
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
So kind of going through the motions

328
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
So I kind of rolled up my sleeves and and went to church

329
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
And started going to weekday masses

330
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
And

331
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
Literally just prayed that God would show me

332
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
What to do when I said

333
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Doesn't have to be

334
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
In horses

335
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
I just decided okay

336
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
If people come to me with ideas

337
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
I'm just going to say yes

338
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Am I French

339
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Horse trainer

340
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Alliance the Lord

341
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
He called me and he said one day

342
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
I know a

343
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Swedish

344
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Horse chiropractor

345
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Who knew

346
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
A company in Sweden that makes

347
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Air cleaner that can clean the horses stalls

348
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,663
Can air purifier negative ionizer with kind of

349
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Zapya

350
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
What it was after

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
And so

352
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
My friend Alan said

353
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
This

354
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,463
Swedish horse chiropractor wants me to sell it in France and he said I'll go you one better I know someone will sell it for you in the states

355
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
So I started a company called Nayan

356
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
And it turned out to be the worst

357
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Company

358
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Because

359
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
The prospect

360
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Over there

361
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
200

362
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
20 volt

363
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Right over here at 1:10 so

364
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Half as good here

365
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
Wait before you got them shipped over

366
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
Noel Miller age

367
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
My my

368
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Market research was lacking

369
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
And then the retail price was

370
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
$500

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,511
Freddy's and there are products on the market that were similar

372
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
That were 4995

373
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Who can make exact same claims right

374
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Purify the air

375
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Right Plus

376
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
The

377
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:42,591
Company was owned by a guy in Sweden who's probably the only guy in Sweden who doesn't speak one word of English

378
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
So

379
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
So he would send me faxes

380
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
In Swedish

381
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,367
And I would have to take them to University of Kentucky and get them translated

382
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,255
And when I talked to him on the phone I had to use an AT&T language line operator

383
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
I need to call call me

384
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
$300

385
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
It was like the worst company with the worst product over

386
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
10 times the price of should be

387
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
And so

388
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
This was going nowhere fast

389
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
But I had to go

390
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
2

391
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Paris

392
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
In October of 91

393
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Because I

394
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Had horses over there and I was still kind of in the business

395
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
And the Swedish horse chiropractor said

396
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Call mrs. Bobbie

397
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231

Wire in Europe

399
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
I said why

400
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
He said there's another company

401
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631

402
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423

His name was CGI to CG

406
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
I don't want to hear it

407
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
Buy anymore of your Swedish crazy Swedish

408
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Connections

But I still

410
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
Said okay I'm in yes mode

411
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,295
I went to Paris and I got on a plane and went Stockholm

412
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,159
And I met him and he introduced me to a guy by the name of Michael Magnuson

413
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
And that changed my life

414
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Who is Michael

415
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
Michael magnusson

416
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
Is the guy he and his

417
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
Stepbrother. Landvik

418
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
On

419
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
The a manufacturing company which developed

420
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
The

421
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
First

422
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Tempur-Pedic products

423
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
And

424
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
He told me that they had just

425
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
Launched it in Sweden the previous month

426
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
And that they wanted to go worldwide with

427
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Launch what was it

428
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
Well it was a 3 inch overlay

429
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
The cast 3 inch mattress

430
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
Yeah exactly

431
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
It's temperature sensor

432
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Distribute

433
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Pressure over wider area so it was

434
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Breakaway

435
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
You can put your hand on it would make a hand

436
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,031
You take your hand off and it would slowly come back

437
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,919
Did you ask him about it like where did it come from how did they invented I would have

438
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
What is this thing

439
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Yeah it was originally invented by NASA

440
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
For the space program

441
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
To cushion the astronauts

442
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
I from G-Force

443
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
And since it was a

444
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Public

445
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Beijing US Government invention

446
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,351
US government and there wasn't a patent on it was freely

447
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
Alienable and my Swedish friend bought

448
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
A company in Denmark

449
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Call Dan phone

450
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
And

451
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
They made it better

452
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
And reproducible

453
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
And War

454
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Durable

455
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
And the idea was

456
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
Let's turn this into a mattress to sleep on was that their idea from the beginning

457
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
No

458
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
And that was the weird thing is they really didn't know what they had it would they had this squishy squishy phone was

459
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Slow comeback

460
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
And

461
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
They had originally been interested in it for football

462
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
But

463
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,191
They made some 3-inch overlays and they put them in a nursing home

464
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
And coconut

465
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
And

466
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
They were thinking maybe it would be good for bedsore

467
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,711
And the reports I got back is at 8 yes indeed it help people

468
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
Who had bed sores

469
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
And

470
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
The other thing they heard though anecdotally was

471
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
Hey the people who had back pain said it helped her back

472
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
And so that's when they said hey

473
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Looks like we got some

474
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Like a mattress

475
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,095
Look for sleeping like out like a mattress

476
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
That's when they wanted in Sweden and that's when I met them

477
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,799
In Sweden you mean with this guy Michael Magnuson

478
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
And he's looking to take this mattress

479
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Psalm worldwide

480
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
So how did you do how did you decide that you wanted in

481
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
So I stated house and slept on the mattress and I woke up and he said why you think I said this is the most amazing

482
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
I've ever encountered

483
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
And when I came home

484
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
After my first Swedish trip

485
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
I told Martha I said

486
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
Where in the mattress business

487
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
And what did she say

488
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
She said okay but can you change the baby

489
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,943
I mean it is remarkable right you do this overnight

490
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
Yuri open at Michael's house and

491
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,111
You sleep on this thing and you wake up and your thinking man that was amazing

492
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Every single night

493
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
Yep and Enzo

494
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
Writing an essay that I want to work with you or you just said hey this is kind

495
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
We keep talking

496
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Well given my

497
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
Position

498
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
In life

499
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
I was more forceful than that I said

500
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,543
I'm interested I want to get involved if it's any possible way he said

501
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
Well we want to go worldwide with it we have nobody in the states

502
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
So why don't you go back

503
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
And write me a marketing plan

504
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
And

505
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
I said

506
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Okay

507
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
So I did so I went home and

508
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
Go to marketing planning ahead some help

509
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
With some

510
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Old high school

511
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
Friends who eventually came on to work for us

512
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
And

513
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
We

514
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
Which is perhaps the worst marketing plan

515
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Everett

516
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,615
And what was your plan like what you said

517
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,943
We're going to sell it here and distribute their like what did you what was your picture

518
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
We said we're going to sell this

519
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
In truck stops

520
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Because

521
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,184
Because it's only 3 in a queef I would fit gradient

522
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
The back of the

523
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,792
Cabs of the semis alright they sleeping like that that

524
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Elevated

525
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Part of the cab right

526
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
We thought it would go perfect in there

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
And we are also going to put an ad in the

528
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Chiropractor

529
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Directory

530
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
So anyway that was it

531
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
And he came over Michael came over

532
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Late 91

533
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
And we met him in Milwaukee

534
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,160
And he I negotiated that he would give me exclusive North American distribution rights

535
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
For his products

536
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,328
In exchange for in exchange for two things number one I had to finance it

537
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Because he said we don't have money to finance

538
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
You have to raise your own money

539
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
How much did you have to raise

540
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
Well it was under fine but I was supposed to raise it what is needed so I raised about 500,000

541
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
$1

542
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
The other condition was we had to sell 10,000 mattresses

543
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
The first year in order to me

544
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Maintain exclusivity

545
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,832
And so I said sure you know I can do both

546
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,184
Let me just let me just interrupt this for for a sec Bobby and I forgive me for this but

547
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
I understand trying to get into the head of Michael Magnuson

548
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
He is a a Swedish

549
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
Restarting a

550
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
Mattress company in Sweden and then he seems him

551
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Success

552
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
End

553
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,848
He agrees to give you a horse trainer a guy whose entire life is in the horse business

554
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
The exclusive distribution rights

555
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
To sell

556
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Memory foam in the US

557
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
Why would you ever have taken

558
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
A wrist like that like what

559
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
It is a seem so implausible

560
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
That's really

561
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
A good question

562
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
But

563
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
I spent three days with him and and horse chiropractor

564
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
And we hit it off

565
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
On a horse level

566
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
Cuz he was in the horse business in Sweden

567
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
And so he was like my

568
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Swedish

569
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
Alter Ego he looks like Swedish spirit animal right yeah

570
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
And so

571
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
She got comfortable with me it's

572
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
The person I guess

573
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
And number two

574
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
He

575
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Wanted to control

576
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
He didn't want

577
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
2

578
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
Have some company in the US

579
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Dads

580
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
They're going to have their own ideas

581
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
He has certain idea in his head

582
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
Oh how he wanted this to play out

583
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,680
And he knew a figures anyway that he could

584
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Control me

585
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
Which she couldn't so we had a collaboration we work together

586
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
They talked to him everyday

587
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
12 years

588
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
Did he didn't even do any due diligence like you could have been a mosquito you could have been an Axe Murderer like he didn't

589
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Really know much about you like

590
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
You could have been

591
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
You know

592
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Horrible person my teacher

593
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,928
Took this

594
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Chance

595
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
He took a chance but his

596
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,584
Ace in the Hole was that I had to sell 10000 mattresses the first year

597
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
70

598
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
How did you raise the money

599
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
To start this Venture at all

600
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
Well that's another really good question

601
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Because

602
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
Now I had to go back to

603
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,992
All my basic same people who had invested with me in these yearly partnership we raced in Europe

604
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
And my other

605
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,112
Horse Ventures

606
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,976
So I had to convince them that we even though we lost money in something that I knew a lot about

607
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,816
That we were going to make money in something that I do nothing about

608
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:41,728
Oh my God

609
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,800
Memory foam and I need your money and did any of them say

610
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Are you out of your mind

611
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Well my dad

612
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
You know he gave me

613
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
50g or something and my mom did too

614
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Beijing

615
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Did it cuz

616
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
I love you

617
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Right

618
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
But the rest of them

619
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
I think they did it

620
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
Because a they were comfortable with me but d

621
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
When they encountered the product

622
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
They had the same emotional

623
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Reaction that I did

624
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
When I first

625
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Encountered it

626
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,520
This would include the first guy who invested Dave fog

627
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,336
How I met only a few months earlier

628
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
Told him the whole story that will bring me over the product

629
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,992
So I brought an overlay over to his house he was January

630
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
And it was freezing

631
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
And

632
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
One of the unique

633
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Properties

634
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:34,208
Of the material is at it freezes as solid as a board at 50 degrees

635
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
That's the temperature

636
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Your sensitivity sold the

637
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
The mattress

638
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Frozen

639
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
On the way over to Dave's house

640
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
And so

641
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
I come in I'm carrying this overlay

642
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
And I noticed

643
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,824
Ella likely that had a fire going in the fireplace so I

644
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
I'll just step this over here

645
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
For 4

646
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
For a while

647
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
And we can chat

648
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
Annies okay and so

649
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
We talked about it and I'm kind of buying the mattress

650
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
To see your baby look like

651
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Uncurling

652
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,464
Sony why it did fall out and he

653
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,000
I really liked it

654
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
And you wrote me out a check

655
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
So I think that's the answer to the question the product

656
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Tampa Bay Lightning

657
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Lights out

658
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,776
Michael Magnuson came over I told him I'm going to raise the money but can you help me so

659
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,336
So he came over we met him

660
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
In

661
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Chicago

662
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
And we went over to my Uncle Bill's house

663
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
And we showed him the mattress

664
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Told a story

665
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,136
He can see that you know Michael was really wasn't some you know

666
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,744
Fictitious guy cuz Uncle Billy lost a lot of money in my yearly in Partnerships

667
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
Uncle Bill

668
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,888
He goes into the back room he comes out

669
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
10 minutes later it has me a check for $50,000

670
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
So I'm just

671
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Absolutely overjoyed

672
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
I said thank you so much

673
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Michael and I left

674
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
I drop Michael off at O'Hare

675
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
He went back to Stockholm

676
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
I got in my car and drove back to Lexington

677
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
And on the way home I

678
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Stop that

679
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Fast food rest

680
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
The next morning was Saturday morning

681
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
And I get a call I'm dead asleep

682
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
9:30

683
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Annie's Uncle Bill

684
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
And he said

685
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
He called me Rob and he's

686
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Who's Rob

687
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
I got a phone call

688
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
From

689
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Connie

690
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
At a Burger King

691
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
In Lebanon Indiana

692
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
Who said she found a check for $50,000 on the floor

693
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
And I said there's no

694
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Possible way so I'm going through my

695
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Fat pockets

696
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,464
Cold then I said oh my gosh and I thought Uncle Bill was going to say

697
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,048
You know maybe my money is not so safe with you after all

698
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
And then he said

699
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
Can I overnight you another

700
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
I said okay

701
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Okay yeah

702
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288

749
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
Play Welcome Back to how I built this from NPR

750
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,472
Early 1990s and Bobby Trussell has gone all-in on a

751
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,824
Business he knows next to nothing about memory foam mattress pads

752
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
A shipping them over to the US in

753
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Containers from Europe

754
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,248
And he's come up with a marketing plan that mostly targets

755
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
But things

756
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
Are not going well

757
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,904
In a $500,000 raised from friends and family

758
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
A few months

759
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:29,376
We were spending the money on what product do you know the year that they containers were step

760
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
75 grand a piece we bought two or three and

761
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
We had

762
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,776
Sorry I wasn't taking a salary but I had two or three people

763
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Working for me

764
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
And

765
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
We were just had a burn rate

766
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,920
And so when you were out

767
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
How did you continue

768
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Operator

769
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:50,880
Well we had a container coming over it was $75,000 and

770
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
I called Michael

771
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
And I said

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
We have a problem and you said what's that

773
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
I said the container coming next Tuesday

774
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
I can't pay for

775
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
And he said

776
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Oh

777
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Okay

778
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Let me call you back tomorrow I'll talk to

779
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Doc

780
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Is

781
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
And brother

782
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,568
So next day calls back and says

783
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
Okay here's what we'll do we will swap

784
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
That container

785
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
For 10% interest in your company

786
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,992
Tempur-Pedic

787
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
And I said

788
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Okay

789
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Because I wasn't

790
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,440
No position we weren't going to make the $10,000

791
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
A minimum

792
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
And I've got a money and he could easily just pulled the plug on us and said okay sorry didn't work we're going different way

793
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
But he said I'll swap dad for 10% interest in your

794
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
And I said Gray

795
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Did you got into that position

796
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
Because the mattress pads weren't selling so

797
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
So why weren't they

798
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Well

799
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
The chiropractor's

800
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Who we were trying to

801
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Market these overlays

802
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
Couldn't tell you

803
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
They would say

804
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Bob

805
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
It's a pat

806
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
I said no it's a matter

807
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Chinese would say what do you do with it

808
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
I said you put it on top of your old mattress

809
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,072
They said it's a pad and how much were they how much do they cost

810
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
You're like

811
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
$800

812
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
McQueen said it worksheet

813
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
They weren't

814
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
What the chiropractors kept saying

815
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
How to make a pillow

816
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
Is that what more in their comfort zone

817
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Sewing pillows

818
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
They stole those anyway

819
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
And so they help me

820
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
Design

821
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
A pillow Along with Dan phone

822
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
And they came out with a pillow

823
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
Probably right around then right around July

824
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Of 1992

825
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,280
So then I said okay now we add another product

826
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
And I ask the chiropractor we are working with

827
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
How would you go about selling it if it were you and they say well

828
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah it's really unique products you need to get in in people's

829
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
And

830
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
I said well teether

831
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
40000 chiroprac

832
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
In the US we don't have any

833
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Rep for

834
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Distribution

835
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
How am I going to get it in the hands

836
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
Of all these Chiropractic than I asked

837
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
One of them when I said

838
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
What if I just mailed them

839
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
And the guy says

840
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
Well I guess it could work

841
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
So

842
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
We mailed

843
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
500 pillows to 500 unsuspecting chiropractor you just found their names and like a chiropractor directory

844
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah and the pillow you just sent them a package with a Tempurpedic pillow and what did it say it's a year ago has it because of pillow for free

845
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,944
Yep you had a letter on top of the pillow and it's big box and it said

846
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
This is the Tempur Pedic Swedish neck pillow

847
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
You know the best thing since sliced bread yada yada yada it's yours free

848
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
If you order for

849
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,512
And if you don't like it all we ask is you let us pick it up in Ark

850
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
So

851
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,448
We got 25% of them to buy for pillows and that was the major

852
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Breakthrough

853
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
That turned us out of the nose dive

854
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
And so all the sudden from that 500

855
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
A chiropractors weigh 225 of them Hulu

856
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
Bourbon four pills a month

857
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
We were selling it to the chiropractor

858
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
For $49

859
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
So we did about $300,000

860
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,928
Sales at first year all in the last four months of the year pretty much

861
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,560
And I always will have a fun place in my heart for chiropractors cuz they really

862
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
Got us going and we eventually

863
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,960
Solder have 10000 Power Practice which I believe you still do

864
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
Now selling the

865
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,800
Products in their practice

866
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
But of course

867
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:27,456
You know turning this business into a into a business that just distributor chiropractors was not

868
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
There's not going to be enough that was not how you were

869
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Blood testing open

870
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
Right and we

871
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
Always wanted to course to get it in

872
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
In stores

873
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464

882
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,920

You can find a store that will sell it

886
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
You may like go walk like walk to the mall and find a store that

887
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Would sell your pillow right

888

Walking through the mall

They sell pillows go show them your pillow

891
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888

I can give you the number of headquarters in New Hampshire

895

And he said all you need to talk to Steve Rich so

900
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
I left a message for Steve rich

901
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
And I sent him a pillow to

902
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
So I would call Steve

903
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Everyday

904
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
4 weeks and weeks and weeks

905
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
And leave him

00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
IMessage

907
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
And

908
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Finally

909
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
I don't know

910
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
2 months later

911
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
My secretary comes in

912
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Bobby

913
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
There's a Steve Rich from Brookstone online 2

914
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
And I said

915
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
And

916
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Who's calling me

917
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
To tell him to stop calling him

918
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
He had a note on his desk

919
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Everyday

920
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Bob Goff

921
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Audra Babcock

922
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Tempur-Pedic

923
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
And

924
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
I said

925
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Okay but all I ask

926
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:21,120
Is one thing make sure you took that pillow out of the box

927
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Because you can't

928
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Tell by looking at

929
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
He's all yeah it's very nice but we sell seven pillows and we don't need anymore and yours is what

930
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
Have to sell for a lot more than our other seven pillows

931
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:34,944
I said okay

932
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
So we hang up 10 minutes later

933
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,600
Is that Steve rich in Brookstone again

934
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
And he said you know

935
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
Maybe we'll take this down to research after all

936
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
Can pee and not taking it out the box

937
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,096
And when he did at Maya made him promise

938
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
He had the same reaction

939
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Emotional reaction with a slow comeback

940
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,544
Back home so taking it down to research men showing his wife

941
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
His wife

942
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
Do I slept on it

943
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
She said

944
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
This is the best thing I've seen

945
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:13,856
So they called me back the next week and he says you okay you got me on your side now I have to pitch it to the purchasing board

946
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,440
And they called you back okay that

947
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
We're going to buy 500 pillows

948
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
You got a hundred stores we're going to buy for free store and you got to give me a hundred demos and

949
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,008
I said okay I'll hang up the phone and talk about

950
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
High-fiving me that was the

951
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:38,432
That was the seminal moment we have never sold anywhere near 500 pillows

952
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:44,576
And within two weeks we were the hottest selling new product in Brookstone

953
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,208
Brookstone was already selling a bunch of pillows this was probably

954
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
Far and Away more expensive than the other one

955
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
Right he said we're going to have to

956
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
The Celtics Bobby rap to sell this at $90

957
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
And

958
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
I said really cuz

959
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
Chiropractors is selling it for more like

960
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
70 in

961
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,384
He said yeah cuz it just to make the numbers work I said okay well whatever you want to do so

962
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,760
They sold it for 90 bucks and it would absolutely and I started selling

963
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,368
Do you think the fact that it was so expensive was there was like added cachet

964
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
That like some people go to a Brookstone and say

965
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,280
A $90 pillow man must be amazing by that

966
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
The answer is yes

967
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
I think

968
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
If you sold it for 30 it sell less

969
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,776
Yeah and that is what Michael Magnuson

970
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
Wanted that's why he chose me

971
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
Is because

972
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,456
His vision was this was not a product that will be discounted

973
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
And he was afraid any other company

974
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
What discounted

975
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
And would become just like everybody else

976
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
We have something no one else has so why should you discuss

977
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
It's high-end and it's

978
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
And actually

979
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Perform

980
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
I would get letters

981
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
From strangers saying

982
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,704
Volume unit I had a sore neck for 30 years and now it's gone

983
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
That's when I knew

984
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
We were really onto something when I got these letters

985
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
And that's it what Michael

986
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
That was his vision is how to position the product

987
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Italian

988
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,248
Connoisseur of pause and reflect on this for a moment you were

989
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
I mean you and Michael had only known each other for a couple of days when he agreed to give you this contract

990
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,208
But over the over the course of time as your business really

991
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,280
Started growing and you had to run this together

992
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,096
Which attention or did you actually

993
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Continue get along great

994
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
There was a lot of

995
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Tension

996
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
And stress

997
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
And we got along

998
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
I mean he was very

999
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Exacting

1000
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
And

1001
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
He had his own ideas

1002
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,736
Of how to market and sometimes I didn't

1003
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Agree

1004
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
And we would kind of have it out

1005
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
So there was some stormy days

1006
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
But

1007
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
We trusted each other

1008
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
And one thing I learned about him

1009
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,304
Is if you do what you say you're going to do

1010
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,608
No matter how it turns out

1011
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
You're going to be all right and same with

1012
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Me and him he would always do what he said

1013
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
So we are very close

1014
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Working relationship

1015
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,616
And yeah it was difficult we had a lot of

1016
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,152
Ups and downs

1017
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Yeah

1018
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
So they had they owned up significant chunk of the company your investors own a significant chunk of the company

1019
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
How much were you able to retain

1020
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Well

1021
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,952
10% interest that they swapped for that container

1022
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Of pillows

1023
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
We had to do that for more time so they ended up going 45

1024
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Percent

1025
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
A Viacom

1026
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
So

1027
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,448
Me and my us investors we owned

1028
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
55

1029
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,824
And what was your what was your Revenue in that in like 97 idea or you doing

1030
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,480
2030 million-a-year sound like that my goal was always to get to a hundred million that seemed like it took us

1031
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
Forever but

1032
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
We did

1033
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
300000 + 92 + 2.6 million + 6 + 1/2 + 13 + 28 + 40

1034
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
45

1035
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,792
And mainly mainly from pillows initially right

1036
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
When initially but

1037
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
The mattresses

1038
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,704
Came in about 1994

1039
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Cuz what we were able to do is

1040
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
Customized products for the US market

1041
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,384
In other words we took that 3 inch overlay

1042
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
And we

1043
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Laminated

1044
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
To a 5 inch base of

1045
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Normal high density foam

1046
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
So now we had a 8 in

1047
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
Full mattress

1048
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
Which almost double the price

1049
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
So now we're selling a queen for like

1050
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,536
1299 or 1399

1051
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
But now we had something that could appeal to the US market

1052
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
So since she was a mattress

1053
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
Thick mattress you were able to

1054
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
Kris at in his truck to sell it in

1055
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Right

1056
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
How do people find out about them

1057
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
How do they know about them again

1058
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
To crack chiropractor

1059
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:58,783
No the chiropractor's never did really get going with the mattresses they were kind of pillow

1060
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Pillow People

1061
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,159
But we started selling in a store chain called relax

1062
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
The back

1063
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,767
Who had like 30 or 40 stores started in Texas

1064
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,351
And I when we first started marketing it we marketed

1065
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
The mattress

1066
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
As hey if you have back pain

1067
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
You got to have this

1068
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,823
Similarly to the analogy I use is Volvo

1069
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
When they started

1070
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
If you were number one concern to safety

1071
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
You got to have this

1072
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Exactly

1073
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
We had this

1074
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
Medical endorsement we have 10000 chiropractor

1075
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Selling it

1076
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Another

1077
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,927
15000 Chiropractic selling it all for Europe

1078
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
And so that was our core

1079
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
And we use that as a springboard

1080
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
And so

1081
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Okay we're in Brookstone we're going great guns

1082
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,495
And I told Mike Anthony the CEO of Brookstone that I wanted to sell

1083
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,079
One of them to sell the baymax is also now that we had the Americans

1084
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Fitness

1085
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
And he said Bob

1086
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
Our stores are tiny we can't fit mattress

1087
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
210 there

1088
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Wear a men's gift shop

1089
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
And I said okay

1090
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
So I started selling to sharper image

1091
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
Their archrival

1092
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
Brookstone add an absolute cow

1093
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
How about that

1094
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,375
And they called me Mike Anthony called me and he said

1095
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
Why we want you to

1096
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
Not to sell to sharper image

1097
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
Tooth going to hurt a business

1098
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,335
And I said okay I'll pull out of Sharper Image if you sell the mattress

1099
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
And he said

1100
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Okay

1101
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,831
So we bought a twin size mattress in the by this time they've got 200 stores

1102
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
And

1103
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,695
They were selling one mattress per store every 6 weeks

1104
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
And I was waiting for the call

1105
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
From him

1106
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
To say

1107
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Bobby

1108
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
We tried

1109
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
But he never

1110
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
I never got that call

1111
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
Cuz then it was one every 5 weeks

1112
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
And then six months later with one every

1113
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,895
4 or 3 weeks and ended up being like

1114
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
2 a week

1115
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,223
At the product got more and more

1116
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Momentum

1117
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
And the reason

1118
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
It got more momentum

1119
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Parallel to this

1120
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,415
We had an open up another Channel

1121
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
Call the direct response

1122
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
And that's the other huge

1123
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Moments

1124
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
When we were able to figure out

1125
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
How to sell direct to the public

1126
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,751
So I started advertising in the New Yorker magazine

1127
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
M

1128
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
My mango is to get our name out there

1129
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,735
Install we were started selling in the Wall Street Journal and USA Today and then one day

1130
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,319
I got a phone call from the New Yorker first two magazine

1131
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
He said you know you guys have an 800 number

1132
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,487
That means you're eligible for a direct response

1133
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Race

1134
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
Okay how much is that

1135
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
He said

1136
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
6 lb

1137
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
I said

1138
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
I've been paying 25000 and I could be paying 6000

1139
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
That changed my world

1140
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Cuz now I could

1141
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Advertise

1142
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Almost

1143
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Indiscriminately

1144
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
I can be everywhere

1145
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
And

1146
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
It was at this time

1147
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
That Brookstone was selling trying to sell mattresses and people became gradually more more aware

1148
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:22,303
And they would walk into the store and say that's the one I read about in the

1149
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
USA Today

1150
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
And so that's what got us going with mattresses

1151
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:33,823
Okay so let's get a sense of the landscape of mattresses in in the US like

1152
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:39,455
It's at time like who dominated the mattress Market in the US and a TempurPedic was even like a

1153
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
Drop in the ocean

1154
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,599
Right it was dominated by the four S's

1155
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
Sealy Simmons Serta and spring are

1156
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
At the time and they

1157
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
All were

1158
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Air Springs

1159
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
And

1160
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,167
They didn't even try to differentiate

1161
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
Add a product it was a commodity

1162
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
And they sold and prices

1163
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Terms

1164
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Hangouts

1165
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
50% off and you never have to pay

1166
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,151
That's how they they sold it so

1167
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,735
We came along with our message and our magazine ads same

1168
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Hey

1169
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
We have something that's a better wheel

1170
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,391
We have something that can help you in the 1/3 of your life

1171
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
That's your sleeping

1172
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,511
And so it's a product that can have a big impact

1173
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
It's okay so you have this

1174
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
This growing business

1175
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
And you know you went from

1176
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
2 million to 6 million of 40

1177
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Are you making

1178
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
Real money is it is the CEO of a company

1179
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
As far as

1180
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,847
My

1181
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Making money personally

1182
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
I

1183
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
Never was able to pay

1184
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,783
Much of a salary because we weren't making

1185
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
Any money until

1186
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111
We merged in 2000

1187
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,439
50 the demerger in in 2000 was basically

1188
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
Like all of these

1189
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
Subsidiaries or selling temp

1190
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Orthopedic

1191
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
Around the world

1192
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,095
She became one big company right

1193
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Right because

1194
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
From our standpoint

1195
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
We just had a a

1196
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
Distributor agreement with

1197
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
The Swedish guy

1198
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,895
And the day that they cancel that that agreement would be very sad day

1199
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
Can we be out of business

1200
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
Essentially they could have make it about any point

1201
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:21,087
Just gone directly to Brookstone and said you are exclusive distributor

1202
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
What would you have a contract but

1203
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Well that first year they sure could have

1204
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Probably the second

1205
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,023
30 years to then we probably were hitting the

1206
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
Yeah but still

1207
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,399
A contract with a Swedish company what if they challenged it I mean it was

1208
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Very flimsy

1209
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,031
But what I didn't realize is from their standpoint they had the same problem

1210
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,615
We were 60 to 65% of their World Sales

1211
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
So

1212
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
Is there a company was

1213
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
Only valuable

1214
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
Pretty much because of that contract

1215
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
So we both

1216
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
I were very highly motivated to merge

1217
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
The

1218
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
Problem was

1219
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
How do you value

1220
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
Yeah cuz they had the manufacturing play

1221
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,071
And they have the IP

1222
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,727
During the 90s I couldn't draw much of a salary but I what I did do is sell little bits and pieces of equity

1223
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
2

1224
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,567
Friends family and stuff so I was able to

1225
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,127
To keep going based upon selling it down so

1226
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
Very many

1227
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
People I talk to who at startups

1228
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,319
Jose are never going to sell controlling interest and I got a controlling

1229
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Well

1230
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,695
My Philosophy is the opposite is I'd rather have

1231
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
5%

1232
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
Of something really big

1233
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,327
Then 51% of something

1234
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
Small yeah

1235
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
And so my advice

1236
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
Stok you'd always like to control it but you don't have to

1237
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
So okay so you merge

1238
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
You end up with

1239
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
Yapper certain percentage probably

1240
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
L5r

1241
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
About 5%

1242
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Yeah

1243
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
And you are the CEO of this merch company

1244
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
And I guess

1245
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,415
Like in early early 2000

1246
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
You guys took outside investment you took

1247
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
A big chunk of of money from a private equity

1248
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,655
Right right to private Equity companies came in and

1249
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Bought it

1250
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
And weak

1251
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
We retained our car 20% for our

1252
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
Us group

1253
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
315 million dollars

1254
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
And in 2002 is that right

1255
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
Well there was a

1256
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,271
In early 2000s after weed emerge

1257
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
My Swedish

1258
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Friends

1259
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
Decided that they wanted

1260
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
To sell a partial denture

1261
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Cuz they needed it

1262
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Good for their other come

1263
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,719
This is only one of their

1264
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
1015 form

1265
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
But the investors

1266
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
We're slightly worried about

1267
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
I'm having a minority interest

1268
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
With a private Swedish

1269
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Company

1270
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
That they don't really know that much about

1271
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
And so the sweet came back and they said well

1272
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,455
We don't want to be minority so we'll sell the whole

1273
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,551
So anyway that's what the 350 million was

1274
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
The purpose of the transaction was to take the

1275
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
The swedes out

1276
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,927
Yeah not a ton of it

1277
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
I went into the company actually

1278
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,767
Soaps in 2003

1279
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,327
This is no longer a Swedish company

1280
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
2002 Act

1281
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
2002

1282
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,215
And so you're not calling your not calling Michael everyday

1283
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
Well they stayed on as a consultant

1284
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:25,151
For a Michael did it for a couple years in but not as much no certainly not

1285
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,991
And my boss is now was the board which was

1286
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
To private equity

1287
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
How did you deal with attitude

1288
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
Like that

1289
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
Difference

1290
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
Because

1291
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
There

1292
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
Thing was they wanted to buy into companies that day

1293
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,839
We're already growing already profitable and they were comfortable with mannequin

1294
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
They didn't want to run it

1295
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
So they pretty much

1296
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
Let me do my thing

1297
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,287
There was an equity kicker

1298
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
Involved

1299
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,639
That we hit certain numbers we will get another 50 million

1300
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,455
Which they didn't really think we'd hit the weed

1301
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,527
Blew the doors off and we hit it quite easily the next year

1302
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
Yeah it turned out

1303
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
To be

1304
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,183
One of the all-time great private Equity deals for them

1305
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,023
And then it took his public three months later so it was like

1306
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
They didn't have their money up for a year

1307
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,607
Anime like 10

1308
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
Soapstone

1309
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,727
Did you sell all of your your ownership as well and that deal

1310
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
So little

1311
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,895
I did get a little bit of a Payday but I got more options

1312
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,711
I'm so now I'm now

1313
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
Guy I'm CEO of a public company

1314
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
New York stock

1315
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
We're on ringing the bell

1316
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
There when we went public

1317
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
And so this is just

1318
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
Tumi

1319
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
The total answer to a prayer

1320
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
* 100

1321
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,727
So you are so that you're the CEO of this public company

1322
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:59,359
You still at what percentage of the of the market did Tempur-Pedic

1323
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
Control when you take a company public

1324
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
We were

1325
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Probably

1326
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
Then

1327
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
About

1328
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,343
L56

1329
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Percent

1330
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
Of the US mattress Market

1331
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
But we were

1332
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,487
How much larger percentage

1333
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,047
Of the $2,000 and up

1334
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
Price point

1335
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,215
Tempur-Pedic mattresses are very expensive compared to

1336
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Ordinary men

1337
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,055
Right right we are definitely in the Hyatt

1338
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
Luxury whatever you want to call it

1339
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,919
We

1340
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,967
Are able to operate

1341
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,759
Exclusively there because

1342
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
The practice just so good

1343
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,135
It really is a breakthrough in sleep science

1344
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,719
It adapts to your weight in your shape and your temperature

1345
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,071
And so your mattress is adapting to you instead of forcing you to adapt

1346
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Yet

1347
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,167
At what we always would say is he an innerspring

1348
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
Pushes up against

1349
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
Where is this breaks away from

1350
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
You can see

1351
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
That we have a better

1352
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,615
Product and that's why we're able to charge more

1353
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Yeah

1354
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
So okay so so Bobby I remember

1355
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
There was a certain point

1356
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
In my younger days

1357
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,319
When I bought a memory foam mattress

1358
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
Cuz I didn't buy Tempur-Pedic

1359
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
I couldn't afford it I just

1360
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
Ikea

1361
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,719
And it seemed like there was a point in you know sort of the

1362
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
Run 2006

1363
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
2007

1364
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
What everyone got into this game cuz

1365
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Clearly

1366
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,167
You there the other mattress companies

1367
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Just let you guys

1368
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,263
Dominate the sector until they realized

1369
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
They can step in and take away some of your market share

1370
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,223
Write all those years back in the early and late 90s early 2000 I was expecting

1371
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Ticket

1372
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
Call from

1373
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
From industry

1374
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
Player Mike Steele

1375
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
To say hey we want to buy you out

1376
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Yeah and we would have said okay

1377
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,535
But I never got the call

1378
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
Because I believe

1379
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,167
That they thought that we would go the way of the water bill

1380
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
I just was a fad

1381
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,103
That was one of the the main concerns of the investors is this real or is it a fad

1382
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
And

1383
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
We were able to convince them that it's real and

1384
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
Convince the public market status

1385
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Israel

1386
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Because it is

1387
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Yuan you step down

1388
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,903
I guess in 2006 as a CEO of a company

1389
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
You just feel like you know what

1390
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Been there done that I want to Cana

1391
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,583
Enjoy life a little bit and not works

1392
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
That was part of it

1393
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,447
And the other thing was I never really saw myself

1394
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
As a CEO of a company

1395
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,567
Talking to investors and end

1396
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,127
There's guys who can do this better than me

1397
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,943
Is what I knew from from the start

1398
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,039
And I yeah I feel like I had been in a long another kind of wanted to cash in my chips

1399
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
And and do something different

1400
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Yeah

1401
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Quite amazing about your story is that

1402
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,023
Your entire identity Bobby was

1403
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
About horses

1404
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
From the time you were a kid like

1405
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,399
You love horses you rode them you read the horse

1406
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,215
Trades you read the horse racing you know

1407
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
Newspaper

1408
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Section

1409
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,871
You went to college intending to get via train or you wouldn't did this in

1410
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Till you were

1411
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
40 this was your

1412
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,991
Tire light your whole identity was around horses

1413
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
And then you come

1414
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
Completely switched mean you went to something that

1415
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,623
You you had no natural interesting

1416
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
You just like the product

1417
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,231
Right eye I change horses in the middle of the stream you might say

1418
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
Yeah

1419
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:32,095
And I was in a situation where all all that I knew

1420
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,655
Hey kind of dried up and going away horses

1421
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,495
And when you're 40 years old and your resume says

1422
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Horse

1423
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
Now I can go and get a job at a bank

1424
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
Yeah

1425
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,151
You really

1426
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Have to

1427
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
Consider doing something.

1428
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
Venereal

1429
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,391
Which you were probably well equipped for cuz I can work your more equipped for that when you're forty than with them when your 20

1430
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
You have to

1431
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Have

1432
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
The

1433
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,279
Ability though in the mindset to take risk

1434
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
But when you don't have anything

1435
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
It's not

1436
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
So risky be think about it

1437
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Danielle

1438
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,215
The thing is I think it's important to

1439
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Have the propensity to think big

1440
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
And so

1441
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
I always kind of

1442
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
Had that

1443
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
You know my

1444
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,455
Feeling is you just got to keep trying

1445
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
Got to keep saying yes

1446
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
And

1447
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
And you got to keep praying and things will break

1448
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,975
That is a question of everyone who comes onto the show

1449
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,327
And it is a simple question Bobby which is how much of your success

1450
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
It is because of

1451
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,935
Your intelligence naskila how much because of

1452
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Just lock

1453
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
Well I think a lot of its luck

1454
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
I think

1455
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
It's the combination

1456
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Of

1457
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
Perseverance

1458
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
You know if I'm going to Pat myself on the back it's

1459
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
4

1460
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
I kept trying

1461
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
Different thing

1462
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,135
You know I had to ionizer business in the horse

1463
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
You know

1464
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,463
I'm definitely smarter than other people

1465
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,023
I think I'm a risk-taker

1466
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,815
And I got

1467
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,351
Very fortuitously match

1468
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Stop

1469
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
With a product

1470
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
That was

1471
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,031
Significantly better than what was out there and was something that no one else had

1472
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
So I think

1473
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
Perseverance combined with luck

1474
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Is what

1475
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Goddess

1476
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,199
Where

1477
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,271
We wanted to be

1478
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:32,159
Bobby Trussell co-founder of Tempur-Pedic USA

1479
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
By the way in 2012

1480
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,535
Tempur-Pedic acquired its longtime rival Seeley

1481
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,375
Making it one of the biggest wedding providers in the world

1482
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:46,239
Company with a market cap of two and a half billion dollars

1483
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,335
I'm just going to be frank with you for a moment

1484
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,127
If you are a child

1485
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,943
Like between you know 3 and 7

1486
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,271
Tempur-Pedic mattresses suck cuz you can't bounce on them

1487
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,367
Pictures if you're a kid you like you got to Tempurpedic

1488
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,159
You're the one glasses Yuan

1489
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
Jump on this thing

1490
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
Yeah they're better for sleeping

1491
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,983
And please do stick around because in just a moment

1492
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
We're going to hear from you about the things your building

1493
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
The first of quick message from one of our sponsors Microsoft

1494
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,759
Who wants you to know that the newest member of the Microsoft Surface family the Surface Pro 6

1495
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,087
As of just 13 and a half hours of battery life

1496
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,903
8th gen Intel Core processor

1497
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
You can work for as long as you want to

1498
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,743
Wherever work takes you

1499
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,863
Hey thanks for sticking around because

1500
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
It's time now for how you built that

1501
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,007
And today story does not start in the typical way

1502
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,567
A lot of people think of starting a company that

1503
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
I think I know I got to wait for that

1504
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:01,503
Lightning bolt moments just hit me like that amazing Insight that I was like oh my gosh I got to build a company around this

1505
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,831
But that is not what happened to Chris Rena Forest

1506
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
He did not have that lightning bolt moment

1507
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
What he did have was morfa Restless which he had a friend Harrison were feeling bored at their 95

1508
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,583
Five jobs Louisville Kentucky

1509
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,655
And I really wanted to launch a business they just

1510
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
I've no idea what the cell so we would actually walk up and down the halls of Walmart and say okay what

1511
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:31,455
Bat toy and smashed it with that home object will we get and what if we took that thing in tweak that

1512
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:36,831
Nothing what if we smashed this with that now with this

1513
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,135
They wound up in the garden section

1514
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,951
And they're pretty big selection of bird houses

1515
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,255
Increase looked at those birdhouses but

1516
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
Didn't think about birds instead he thought back to it how he and his dad used to build little houses

1517
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,031
Literally a place for bats to hang out and sleep in the backyard

1518
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,591
Which I know sounds kind of creepy

1519
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:02,687
50% of people out there will think that's horrible scary

1520
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
The other 50% will think

1521
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
Bats

1522
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:12,159
But whichever campuran Chris wants you to know that bats they get kind of a bum rap

1523
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,999
The vast majority of them do not want to put you in do not

1524
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
Carry rabies

1525
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,887
In fact in many places bats are in trouble they're actually running out of habitats so

1526
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:27,007
A nice little wooden house in the suburbs could be the perfect refuge and as a bonus

1527
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,567
They will also eat your mosquitoes

1528
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
A common bat

1529
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:34,431
We have 2,000 mosquito sized insects in an hour

1530
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,831
And that makes someone a Nature's greatest forms of natural Pest Control

1531
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,159
Their idea they were going to sell wooden bat house

1532
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,815
So now that we found this concept we started digging further into the Bathouse Market this is very neesham

1533
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:57,215
Particular space Market was even a space at all but clearly

1534
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,239
It was

1535
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,311
And we started noticing that most bad houses on the market

1536
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,711
They lack proper ventilation they're too small they don't have proper gripping for the animal to hang on or they just

1537
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
Don't look at it so Chris Harrison design a prototype of a wooden bat house with grooves inside that the

1538
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:20,511
That's could grab onto and then they launched its Indiegogo campaign and what kind of amazed what about 500 people

1539
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
Signed up to buy bat houses

1540
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,351
We asked them why did you buy this thing

1541
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
And I think about

1542
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:32,031
Two-thirds of them said like I hate mosquitoes but I don't want to buy pesticides I hate pesticides even more than

1543
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
Hate mosquitoes till the two partners find a manufacturer in Missouri and they shipped out there first bat houses in jail

1544
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:44,831
You should check out a picture of these things are made of red cedar they attach red for the roof of your house that hold

1545
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
100 bats

1546
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
And they look

1547
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
Sort of like the Scandinavian furniture you're going to want to put it up on the side

1548
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:00,191
Your house right in the middle of your yard and then when you have your friends over for a barbecue and they come over and they said what the heck is that

1549
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:05,567
Nothing you can say my bat house smell like bad house what and you say like

1550
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Let me tell you about that

1551
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
Chris and Harrison's company is called

1552
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
Bat BNB

1553
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,551
And since the beginning of the year the company has provided potential homes

1554
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,111
2 / 100,000 bat
