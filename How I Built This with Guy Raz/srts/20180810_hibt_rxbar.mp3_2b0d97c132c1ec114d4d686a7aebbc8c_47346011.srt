I'm building a better mousetrap to building a better app

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
The powerful backing of American Express

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
And one more thing before we start this episode just a little warning that my interview with Peter Rahal has

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Salty language in a

19
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
Peter

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
Definitely drops a few

21
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
POF

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
So if you're listening with kids

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
Just bear that in mind

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
And

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Puritas

26
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,904
You got this idea you have a plan

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,976
Did you think it was funny

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
So that was actually our initial plan a number of a deer and I like talking about the guy who didn't raise money from

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,984
Am I ever asking my dad like do you know any of y'all rich people acting like

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
You can connect me with us give us some money and you

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
And my dad was like he's old school is like super traditional things like you need to shut the f******

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
Install a thousand bars

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
From NPR how I built this show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

34
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,912
Stories behind the movement

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Peter Rahal turned egg whites cashews

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,456
$10 brand called

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Website like

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Amazon

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
And type in energy bars

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
Can you start counting all the different

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Types of bars that come up and I mean brand

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Flavors

43
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Brands of energy bars

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
You will probably lose count

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Around 300

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
And the actual number is a lot higher maybe as many as

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Thousand

48
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
No one really knows

49
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
The point is is that

50
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Energy bars

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
This is a really crowded sector

52
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
But six years ago

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Peter Rahal walked

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
Into that extremely crowded space

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Heather energy bar

56
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
So Peter and his co-founder started RX

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Bar in Chicago

58
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
With almost no money

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
And know it

60
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
Experience in the field

61
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
What they did have was an interesting idea

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
A way to market energy bars

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
People at thought of before

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,408
Cannabis side door into a very jam-packed Marketplace

65
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
And that side door

66
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,784
Making energy bars for a very nice group of

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Fitness Room

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
Even though they started small you can now find RX bars in just about any major grocery

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Free chain in America

70
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
You've probably seen them that got those

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,656
Distinctive packages with the ingredients listed right on the front of the label

72
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Egg whites

73
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
4 almonds

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
6 cashews

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Etcetera etcetera

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
That label and that app

77
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Approach

78
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
Peter drahos little start-up into the

79
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
In 2017

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,784
Less than five years after launching and Peter's parents

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Basement

82
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
RX bars sold to Kellogg's for

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
A hundred million dollars

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
It's an incredible story

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
And I was super excited to hear Peter tell it when I sat down with him

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
In front of a live audience

87
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Athenaeum theater

88
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776

Amazing

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
2

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Tell me a little bit about

96
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
Your home life as a kit using grub2 far from here about

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
20 minute drive or something

98
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Yashow

99
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
60 miles from Chicago

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
A pretty picture us

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,175
Suburban both sides of my family are Lebanese and I tribute a lot of my

102
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Strengths and weaknesses

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
Is to that DNA

104
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
And so what did what do they mean like did you guys eat like Lebanese

105
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Food did you

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,743
Like I don't know whether like cultural things that you did Growing Up

107
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Yeah

108
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
I think

109
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Comfort and conflict

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
Valuing trade and commerce

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
But like I mean around the dinner table was their comfort in conflict

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
Yeah yeah I just normal

113
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
You know you going to fight in the next 100 years

114

Nothing's wrong

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Yeah

116
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
It's unusual for an American culture

117
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
That's how our

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783

So you kind of grew up a little bit in this world of of the food industry

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
It listen to my dad all

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Metal hours

140
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Talking about

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
You know

142
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,911
Selling loads of apple juice and drums and all this language in jargon and

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
And like for me I just knew the food is all I really know yeah so he he really

144
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Introduce the business to the family

145
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Business his business was part of his life

146
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Inside

147
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
That was like normal

148
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,135
What about school was school easy for you or was it

149
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Yes school is probably

150
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
The first bit of adversity I face my life so

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
I was miserable at school and I'm not

152
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Meant to do anything

153
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Vanira

154
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
For example

155
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
I remember specifically in like

156
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
7th grade words

157
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
My friends were going to study hall

158
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
And I was pulled out of the normal study hall

159
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
And

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
I was put into a special study hall

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
And so for me I've always

162
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
Misinterpret

163
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,559
I'm not normal or I'm slow or I'm stupid

164
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167
I kind of always planted School informal education

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
Yeah did you

166
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
I guess

167
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Your your mom had you tested

168
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Brake for

169
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
What's wrong with him

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
You were dyslexic

171
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
How old were you when you when you do that

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
Wrong when I think I learn to read

173
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Like wait later like speech therapy all this s***

174
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Yes

175
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
I mean from from

176
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Second grade

177
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
22 I just thought I was like Nazi

178
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
You think about it today in our society like

179
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
When your 12 years old are 16 and even in high school and college your performance or success is determined based on your mark

180
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
School

181
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Mei was a d student

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Like and I tried

183
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
I worked really hard like I was a good deed I like had to climb a hill with a airplane on my back

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
So it was great conditioning for me to kind of go on and survive and I think about some of the early

185
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
What is borax or particularly

186
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Gerardus like survival

187
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Yeah

188
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
But you did get into the marijuana business

189
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,039
Is it over

190
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
In high school first of all

191
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
How do you know what to do

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
So is it

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
A child I was always fascinated by

194
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Cycle of life with gardening

195
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Seoul

196
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,631
Yes

197
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
It's really fascinating that you can make plant a seed

198
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
You take care of it you put it in a good spot

199
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
You nurture it and then it grows

200
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
In to say a tomato

201
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
And then you can Harvest it

202
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,247
It's for real as a kid I was into gardening

203
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
I'm headed vegetable gardens in them

204
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Securus

205
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
16 year 17 year old

206
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,975
This Is Why I'm Hot you said season apparently doesn't have seeds in it anymore

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
I got

208
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Mad Season I just

209
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Innocently

210
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
In my

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
Yea germinated inside with a light

212
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
And then my parents ruined my prayers have a beautiful house and the roof is really flat

213
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
And

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,407
It's one of those houses that's in the forest a little bit on a hill

215
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
And so is put on a Roof Inn

216
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,319
You know and it grew beautifully and

217
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
And then it came to harvest again I'm not a good salesperson

218
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,071
I was trying to sell but no one wanted by it's really a really just gave it to all my friends and I was just one process right

219
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
The next year I grew it again

220
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
I got more sophisticated

221
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
But then

222
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
The landscapers saw and my dad had enough

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Took it down

224
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
And I planted in the yard but then they

225
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
They mowed it over

226
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Habitat

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
That was the end

228
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
Alright so it's time to go to college right I guess and you were

229
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
As you as you say you hate you were not a good student

230
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
I'm what did you

231
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
Did you hard time getting into college

232
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
Yes my family's Legacy was through Denison

233
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
And I applied and I didn't get in

234
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
So

235
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
I went to school where I could get in

236
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
And I don't make a whole process I just like I didn't want to thank my mom filled up

237
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Well I mean he was probably

238
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
Dyslexia is not a joke I mean this right

239
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
It's hard to explain but

240
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,391
How do you how do you explain the people in the Civil War is it where's that you mean

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Can you not read easily like what does it mean

242
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
I think

243
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
Best way to describe it as any sort of sequential tasks

244
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
Tasks in a sequence is really challenging

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
Paying the bills when you think about like something as simple as that

246
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Dyslexics have a really hard time falling those things

247
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Understand what they're good at

248
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
And so

249
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,759
What dyslexics are good at is pattern recognition so I can facial recognition

250
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Recognizing shapes

251
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Elastic thinking

252
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
Things are really good in strategy did you know that at the time when you were in college

253
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,743
You just thought I cannot read I can do

254
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
It's my brain just

255
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Doesn't work that way

256
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
Yeah I just like I didn't know what I was good at

257
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,215
Honestly a lot of entry-level jobs required sequential tasks money or thinking

258
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
And I'm just now

259
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
I think that's why you see a lot of entrepreneurs who are just

260
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
So

261
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
You made it through you graduated you're done you get your cap and gown and what did you do your first job

262
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,183
So my father was grooming me for to work in the family business and that was like my

263
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
So then was to go work at Rahal Foods

264
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
You've been going there since you were in diapers

265
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
Yep clear nose so what what was the job that you

266
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,751
But you did so I had a bunch of internships at different fruit processing plants and see what they do is they take

267
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Like say apples

268
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
And then they will press them and they turn it into it like different products

269
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Juice concentrate

270
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,991
Industrial Products so that they could use company like moss would buy and put into their

271
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Products

272
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
And so

273
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
My father is able to give me an opportunity at Monday foods which is in Belgium

274
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
I'm in there a red food processor so red fruits are

275
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Strawberries raspberries

276
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
And I want to learn the business right

277
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Just learn

278
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
Pair me for the family business and

279
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
It's alright graduate in May and I

280
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
I have one week off

281
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Ending of next

282
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
Friday I was on a plane with a suitcase

283
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,151
To go to Belgium to move into an apartment

284
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
To start Monday

285
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Yeah

286
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
The number showing of my first day of work

287
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,367
I showed up in a suit that was like oversized and look like s***

288
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
And no one's wearing suits

289
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
I didn't get the memo

290
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,375
And was there somebody there was like I know your dad men come on Inn

291
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
I mean a Sprite I think your dad had been in this industry is whole life so

292
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Naturally

293
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
He wanted you to get experience experience

294
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Raisin raspberry mini red fruit

295
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Springer absolutely and how long did you end up

296
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Staying there in Belgium

297
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
Like 13 months

298
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
And and I guess there's a. Like server

299
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
For your. After you graduate college where you did that job

300
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
And then you kind of tried different things you went to

301
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
So Lebanon and

302
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
For a while for how long did you go to Lebanon for

303
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
I was there for a year

304
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
What did you do there

305
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
I was a student

306
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Not working for a degree

307
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Haha

308
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
Insert for me I have great pride in my

309
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
Family's origin and

310
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
I had to be there

311
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,439
Empathy when you are seeing how other people live

312
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
Really valuable experience ism

313
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Alicia Smith

314
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
So when you came back to the US

315
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Did you like your dad's okay Dad

316
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
I'm ready I've done my internship and

317
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Where's my office of real foods

318
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
No

319
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
I came back

320
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,455
The origin coming back I was like sick of being a foreigner

321
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
But I came back because I

322
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,855
I felt like I was being selfish in pursuing these

323
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,207
Self-serving things and be away from my family and I felt

324
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
I felt like my tree wasn't getting anywhere like

325
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
So I came back and I kind of knew it

326
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
I knew I need another experience so I want

327
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
My dad was like No just

328
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Go get in the shower

329
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Where else

330
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
He said go get a job so if you wanted to go work at real foods

331
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I think

332
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
If they wanted it I would have said yes

333
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
For sure

334
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
I didn't

335
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Spell

336
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,391
Let's just pause here because had you gone to work for real food your life would have been totally different

337
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
An end you might not be sitting here on the stage telling the story

338
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
So

339
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
But at the time

340
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
Did that sting at the time

341
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
I was

342
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
You look back

343
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
My history was used to eating s***

344
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
Because you are a bad student

345
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Feeling was not something foreign to me

346
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
And I've read that at that time in retro

347
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Respect

348
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
You describe yourself

349
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Is an Angry Young Man angry what were you

350
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
What would it would it would that mean

351
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
In combination of like hunger and drive and then being lost

352
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
And

353
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
And I think probably honestly a sense of entitlement

354
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
You don't even like I should be going here and

355
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
I just was short-tempered and

356
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
I wear my emotions on my sleeve I was unable to self regulate

357
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Soften my edges a little bit

358
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Were you living with your

359
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
Folks would have parents that time

360
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Yes

361
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
So you're like 24

362
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
No job what is so what did you do what what did you go work

363
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
So

364
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
I worked for a transportation brokerage

365
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
In in Chicago

366
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Another great

367
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Place to start

368
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
Does places hire like crazy to like Mills you know

369
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
Yeah people Mills Transportation brokerage

370
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
So

371
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
They get like moving

372
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,543
Something from ADB writer is someone who need something moved

373
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
And then there's like

374
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
The person who's going to move it

375
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
The middleman between

376
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
The person who runs the truck

377
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
And in the shipper

378
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
How are you able to do that with

379
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Dyslexia where you able to kind of

380
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Navigate that job without having to look at spreadsheets and no I mean I wasn't good at the job

381
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
I mean

382
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
I cannot sell stuff sometimes

383
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm easily distracted and

384
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
I think

385
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Ashley ditto

386
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Okay

387
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
But like 9 months

388
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
You're there for 9 months and

389
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Obviously we know what you went to

390
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
EcoStar butt

391
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
The idea

392
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
4

393
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
An energy bar even

394
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Come about

395
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Two origins of that so one

396
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Is

397
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Adam miserable job

398
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,679
I needed a new job

399
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
There was that drive to go

400
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Solve a problem right or finding opportunity

401
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
I was a early adopter of CrossFit

402
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
I was introduced to it playing rugby and I just really fell in love with it is painful at work to gain resolves is

403
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Great community

404
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
They advocated for like a Paleo dairy-free sugar-free

405
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,559
Insulite started obviously being influenced by that and

406
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
The question was like why isn't there a good tasting

407
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Barden

408
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
It's that

409
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
That was missing right

410
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
And then

411
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
Working on a CrossFit Gyms you start to see like

412
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Oh my gosh

413
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
There's a group of people that

414
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
I'll do the same activity that prescribed the same nutrition values and

415
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Get there

416
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,343
They're selling water they're selling T-shirts into like

417
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Can I see a Retail Landscape

418
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
There's nothing like that I mean

419
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
It was no

420
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Energy bar that

421
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,399
Fulfilled paleo you know criteria

422
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,007
Larabars

423
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,359
Which one protein receptors one called amramp nutrition

424
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Picasso

425
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,735
Inside sou circuit

426
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
So 2012 the wheels start to turn in your head

427
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
And

428
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
When you

429
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
First approached

430
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Let's say your friends

431
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Anywhere like yeah

432
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,839
I want to quit my job and start an energy bar company

433
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,959
In the most possibly the most crowded sector in the food business

434
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
If I was your front of the time I'd be like

435
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Dude

436
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
You are that

437
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Names of bottled water business

438
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
Yeah and I think a lot of people

439
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
When United Beaver excited about her we talked about it

440
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
The look on their faces like that's a dumb

441
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Dump

442
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Wrong

443
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,327
Necessarily

444
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
The market didn't another protein bars

445
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,703
For sure but you were like novice I think this is going to work

446
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
Or did you just not talk about it too many people

447
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,663
I don't have any friends and so there's an advantage of that I say okay having many friends

448
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
I was kind of private about it

449
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
We're just focused and we get some feedback but

450
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
You know if it's negative

451
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
Iphuck offered is going to do it anyway

452
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
And did you again

453
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,839
Like pretty early on did you decide to call your friend Jared. Jared Smith

454
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
Did to join you

455
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
You can hold them and you said what

456
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Tri-City Ellis liquid

457
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Your sound like

458
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
There's a moment we're going to do any commit it's like

459
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
Processed foods

460
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,735
You looked at it you looked at the ingredients of other bars

461
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
Yeah exactly so we just kind of like disemployment Arie market research and then

462
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Start learning

463
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Really

464
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
And what did Jared bring to

465
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
This that you didn't have

466
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
So one of them

467
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Main advantages of

468
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Being dyslexic

469
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Is you know very

470
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
Fairly early on in your life which you're not good at

471
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
So it was like I knew I couldn't do it by myself

472
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,383
But you couldn't like to the spreadsheets and yet

473
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Any way I can do a lot

474
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
And I knew I needed someone

475
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
To rebalance me out

476
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Jared's

477
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Temperament General like

478
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Nevermind

479
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
Weird amazing rapport

480
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Known since first grade

481
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
It was a natural fit

482
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,351
And and what did you guys do like what was the first thing you did like

483
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
You bought a bunch of ingredients

484
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,543
And you will like a Vitamix and you just threw it in there and blend it up like I did you start to

485
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Even

486
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
The first was we went to Whole Foods

487
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
And just toward the market

488
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,039
On that were like let's start playing around ingredients

489
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
Division for like what the product

490
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Be like

491
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Real life

492
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
The jargony term is like a minimal ingredient

493
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Fruit nut

494
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Protein bar

495
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Image of like principal

496
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,632
Or philosophy around the product is likely

497
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:31,008
Whatever part of the formula we needed we wanted to make sure the ingredients for the best

498
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
So you think about like binders

499
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Honey herb

500
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
Tapioca syrup like we wanted the best binder

501
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Fruits real food

502
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:46,112
And then meme of protein you can do soy or whey or these other things in

503
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
But they're not paleo no in from our world like

504
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Egg whites

505
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Superior

506
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
Protein Source the highest bioavailability in

507
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Americans in our culture like

508
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
We text everyday so closely associated with Health and Breakfast

509
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
In bodybuilding even like they crazy my legs

510
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,896
That's like a protein side right and then the other side like inclusions are flavor components or like

511
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
We want almonds peanuts and then

512
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Chocolate like

513
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,648
We searched the US to find 100% chocolate no sugar no sugar added

514
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
We found he's like

515
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
100% chocolate

516
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Basic cow

517
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,048
And so that was like

518
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
How we approach

519
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Glossier products

520
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
How much money did you put into this business

521
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
Start was like $5,000 each

522
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
A $10,000

523
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Can I borrow the five

524
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
And

525
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,856
And what kind of equipment did you have like a Cuisinart like I I interviewed Lara merriken

526
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
Created Larabars you may have heard this episode I mean she just

527
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
Two dates and nuts and put them in a Cuisinart

528
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
And then

529
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,352
Ruled it out and shaped it in that was how she did how did you do it in your

530
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
In your little

531
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Yo kitchen

532
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,752
So making protein bars is pretty similar to like making cookies or any sort

533
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Joe

534
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
So we just use a Cuisinart

535
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
And funny that you use a Cuisinart

536
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
What anybody interested in the Stream Energy bar business get a Cuisinart

537
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
Yeah

538
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,136
They're really good machines

539
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,232
And so the funny thing is in our in our lab or

540
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
What we do

541
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,536
Apricot almond today

542
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
We have the same

543
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
Red mixer that the

544
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,008
First recipe was made as a red queen

545
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Still that's the original one

546
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
So you guys would take dates

547
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:49,248
And stick him in the Cuisinart and you have cashews or

548
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
Cashews came later we had

549
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,696
We're so obsessed with being differentiated we want to be differentiated from our bar so we actually used

550
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
Dates and figs early on right

551
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
So that was a Guy Ritchie

552
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
The formula

553
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
So who was testing them were you

554
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,168
Giving it to friends and asking for feedback

555
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Yasso

556
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
It's like August

557
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
2012 to March 2013

558
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,176
You know we did like logs of this RX Bardot and

559
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
I'm never showing up to the

560
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
CrossFit gym that I would

561
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Was a member of

562
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
I was a weirdo with like

563
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Tupperware

564
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,440
Of this stuff and and was the first flavor that you made

565
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
Coconut chocolate

566
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
So you would you actually

567
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Made the bars put in my Tupperware and went to your CrossFit gym unpack to some Tupperware Ginger do the same at

568
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
Jim Hughes ambra

569
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,640
Why was pretty entrenched nextmuni so I can do the owners I knew everyone I was like obsessed with working out so

570
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Everybody was like

571
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
It wasn't just once it was all the

572
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,552
You know we collected tons of data

573
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Is this do you like this do not like this what would you like

574
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Would you pay that yeah

575
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Just ask

576
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
On a question

577
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
Yeah what point did you say okay we got it we can actually start to

578
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
Try and sell these

579
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
So like ideation was August 2012 in the first time we like collected revenue or made some sales

580
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
March

581
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
13th

582
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
2013

583
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,920
We moved pretty quick so we're really small like we started in my parents basement

584
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,272
Didn't have much exposure we are manufacturing ourselves we're doing

585
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Literally

586
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Every part of the

587
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,184
The business from filling it website ordering ingredients yeah

588
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
Like literally designing packaging printing it

589
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Labeling it

590
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
All of it

591
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
How did it what is it what is the packaging look like

592
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,448
I actually have some all right

593
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Not staged

594
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,080
Quora podcast audience i should describe his package cuz it

595
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:55,200
It could have been the same package you sold marijuana in high school

596
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
It's just say yes

597
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:03,392
A brown package and there's just a sticker on the front with some coffee beans is rx bar coffee to count on the back it says

598
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
No bunch of stuff

599
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,720
Are we couldn't afford

600
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,536
And I proper packaging

601
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,704
So we just designing a PowerPoint and then we would send them we would sin

602
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Send the file

603
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
To like

604
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Staples and I remember Jared

605
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,224
Going to Staples in Naperville and like negotiating with a guy to get better rate

606
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
Eventually developed a relationship with a guy named Steven

607
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:41,536
That this was going to be safe that it wouldn't go rotten that it was going to be shelf-stable like

608
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,584
Did you was there a point where

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,656
You have to hire somebody to do that or

610
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
No

611
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,056
So the hypothesis was all these ingredients by themselves

612
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Star Stable alone

613
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Okay

614
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
So you put them together they'll be stable

615
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
Simple as that yeah

616
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,296
In like in early stage of a business you can

617
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,392
You can't break the law but you kind of have to break the rules a little bit in life

618
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
And we're fine and

619
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
But but

620
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,936
I mean all the ingredients are stable and if so

621
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
It really wasn't a concern

622
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
With it and let you know you look at the market with larabar

623
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,360
Has the Aquino you kind of connect the dots

624
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
And how did you come up with the name rx.bar

625
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
So from the early days like

626
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
Dell strategy was to

627
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
Make a product that

628
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Is 4

629
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
CrossFit

630
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Architect Market in

631
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
For the

632
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
Helio consumer in

633
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,120
Build it online we go to web store and sell directly to Jim's then by product that would be like

634
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Consumers coming directly to us

635
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,728
And we would scale that eventually

636
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
Cross the chasm in

637
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,616
Could a co-packer and then go into more traditional retail

638
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,944
How was it that there was no energy bar that was

639
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
Directed toward the cross

640
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
How is it that no one thought about

641
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
What I think a lot of people look at it

642
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Niches

643
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
And or look at

644
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
A Smalls

645
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Segment

646
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
And then

647
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
It's not big enough for them

648
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Ha

649
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
It was like a side entrance almost it wasn't like

650
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
We'll start the Whole Foods it was

651
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Start with crossfitters

652
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
Yeah and we were very disappointed that I remember being like I rather

653
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
We rather have a

654
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,872
CrossFit customer in California than a local Chicago independent

655
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Just cuz

656
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,064
In a grocery store among the Sea of competition we had no awareness product didn't really make sense for everyone

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,416
Where is in a CrossFit gym we're by ourselves is literally engineer to design for

658
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
For that occasion

659
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Just perfect and so we really focused on

660
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Aladdin

661
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
And actually

662
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,144
That's the name I remember sitting in Jared's apartment was she still lives in

663
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
And

664
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,008
I member funny story like

665
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
So we had to go get the domain

666
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
Right right in this the guy some you know

667
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Cybersquatter had the domain

668
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
RX bar

669
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
And you wanted 10004

670
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
That was all your money

671
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Jersey

672
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
What's offer $1,000

673
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
He offered a thousand you gave it to

674
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,280
Ann Arbor realtor

675
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
We should offer 500

676
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,376
Wow

677
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Thousand bucks

678
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
So

679
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,336
Early on did you think it we had a lot of people on the show who early on go out and seek funding

680
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Did you I mean you got this idea

681
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
If you have a plan

682
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Did you think

683
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
Let's go raise money

684
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah

685
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
So that was actually our initial plan

686
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,464
A number of a deer and I like talking about guy who didn't raise money from like

687
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,536
Harassing my dad like do you know any rich people I can like

688
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
You can connect me with us give us some money and yeah

689
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
And my dad was like he's old school

690
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Super traditional

691
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Seems like you need to shut the f******

692
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Install a thousand bars

693
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Coming up

694
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Just a minute

695
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,112
How Peter and Jared sold those first thousand bars

696
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Whole lot more

697
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,464
I'm gyros near listening to a live episode

698
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
How I built this

699
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,144
From NPR

700
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,712
Support for this podcast comes from American Express

701
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Tracy Chapman

702
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Is Vice President

703
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Global

704
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
Experiential marketing

705
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Team created

706
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
Amex business lounges at

707
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Chaotic trade shows

708
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
Is Tracy I have a lounges of adapted

709
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Fit customers needs

710
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
When we first came up with the idea for business

711
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
We filled the wounds with laptop

712
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
And with printers

713
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
We found with the people weren't really turning on the laptops and they weren't using our printers they were sitting down and they wanted a place to call home

714
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
The kids

715
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
End

716
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
That really helped us evolve what we were doing

717
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,248
We need a lot of soft seating we need to put quiet areas that can absorb sound

718
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,832
We were able to recognize these people is more than just business owners

719
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,488
When customers are using our lounges we hope that they walk away understanding what it means to be an American Express customer

720
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
It means that everything that we do accounts for the human behind the job not just the job that you're there to do

721
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
To learn more about how America

722
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Express to have your back in life

723
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Business

724
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,080
Is it americanexpress.com do business

725
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
Hey welcome back to this live episode of How I built this from

726
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
Chicago

727
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
It's 2012 and

728
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Peter Rahal status

729
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:02,816
Just told him no I'm I'm not going to find some rich people to loan you money to start your energy bar company

730
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
You have to go out and

731
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Prove yourself first

732
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
Enercell sandbars

733
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Took Peter and his partner Jared

734
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Well

735
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
They listen

736
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:18,176
And you know. Jared and I are entitled kids you think

737
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
Raising money will solve our problems

738
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,416
That message is really powerful because it allowed us to focus on what's important and Arc what was important was proving it

739
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Was important

740
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
Figuring it out

741
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
And so

742
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Just let me know instead of going to a kitchen be like

743
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Move my parents basement

744
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
Instead of going to a designer we went

745
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
PowerPoint

746
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Like

747
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
Instead of going to a printer we went to

748
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Staples

749
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,664
Instead of going through third-party designer like website we like winter Shopify

750
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:55,808
That could do other like right when you are very limited resources basically so we both quit our jobs and

751
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
And

752
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
Started hustling like

753
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
Emailing calling

754
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,536
When you would say hey we have these can we send you some to test out

755
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Wolf first we would try to like cell

756
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
A Mike Haver selling this

757
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
$2 results

758
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
3

759
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,056
You know if there are reluctant or unwilling we would give it a

760
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
Consignment we do anything

761
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Bright

762
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,968
And I mean if your cold calling a CrossFit gym

763
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,576
Where they receptive do they blow you off what was their response

764
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
So is there an interesting time in CrossFit where like

765
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
The idea of retail was just beginning

766
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
So a lot of CrossFit

767
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,096
Gyms are very principled and like our job is

768
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
How to focus on training

769
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Physical fitness

770
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
Not selling Goods

771
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
And then some were like more

772
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Open to it

773
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
There's a little bit of Education like hey you know

774
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:56,480
Your customers are your training them you're doing a great job but they're going to buy a cross the street to buy product

775
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Don't forget about is like

776
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,320
Capitalizing in in selling out it's actually like

777
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Delivering

778
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
A great good and service to your customers

779
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
It's for the CrossFit world really shifted and became really explosive in popularity and you'd start ucg members

780
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,888
Becoming good operators and starting to build retail a front of

781
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
Mike Stallings t-shirts and Andrei

782
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,288
Developing the retail site with $10,000

783
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
How are you

784
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
You know making enough bars

785
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
And then bringing of Revenue back

786
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,760
Beginning in the middle of 2013

787
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
So one of the advantages of

788
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Manufacturing

789
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
Ourselves and

790
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
What to give an idea

791
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
From

792
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
8 a.m. to

793
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
Nude everyday during that would make like

794
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
327 batches

795
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Which Wich produce how many bars

796
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,936
Is like 440 bars a batch

797
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
And we had a team of girls that would pack them in the afternoon and then we would go back but I was our day and so

798
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Empires that you

799
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
I don't know their status was but

800
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
Did you hire your mom at some point help you pack

801
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Bars to

802
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Yasso

803
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,488
AmeriFirst launching my parents basement

804
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Mrs. Smith and misses

805
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Rahal

806
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Volunteered

807
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
We know putting labels on the front and back of this was the biggest pain in the ass

808
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
And requires a lot of standing line

809
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Accuracy

810
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
My poor mother is

811
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,344
Label them correctly and mrs. Smith was just nail in it and

812
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
I was like Mom you got it you can't put the front panel on twice on the package but in in she's like

813
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,376
Romantic idea of her son starting your basement switches love with it

814
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
After like two or three times and like this isn't working

815
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
So

816
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Your to fire your mom

817
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Yeah

818
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Basically well

819
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
So yeah so I mean you guys are making about 440 bars or so a day

820
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Temp 10001

821
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
You can make 10000 in how hello

822
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
A shift so

823
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
8 hours you can make 10000

824
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Two of you

825
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,792
And like

826
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:24,448
People to help you make them

827
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,520
Did you eat you

828
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
No longer working in

829
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,432
In your parents basement this is you you went to work at like a professional kitchen the place to be like rent out

830
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
No is a place called Allison flavors which is a

831
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,088
Repacker of juice concentrate used to be across from my fathers

832
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
So we just

833
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
Got thousand square feet there

834
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
And then started operating in his food safe as a grape

835
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:53,888
Play some would make the product they're make it ship it cell at work work out of it it was actually like

836
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
Really proud moments like move out of

837
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Your home in like it was like this is real

838
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
So

839
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,592
The advantages to manufacturing and doing it

840
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Small batch

841
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Is

842
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,248
You keep your inventory really low yeah so that's where your cash ultimate Lays

843
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
And so we didn't really need to raise a lot of money because we

844
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,952
Made a hundred bars and then went online and sold it we think about selling it online

845
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:24,096
You're collecting that cash how did people know about it online just Word of Mouth

846
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,728
We had a really clear early adopter like we didn't have these Ambitions of like going National or like

847
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
We are we are solving a problem for CrossFit crested aquatic like we wanted to preserve them cuz when your

848
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Quick protein

849
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
Oh yeah and it's convenient right there

850
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Or in the morning if you want to like

851
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Do workout have a protein chicken and grab a bar to go for later like

852
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
It was a perfect fit

853
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:53,280
So that's how they're wearing is really like organic in that community in like we talked about like product-market fit it just fit

854
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
Early Wellness were

855
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,888
A lot of the organic word-of-mouth traction came from

856
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
Mission

857
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,008
9 months of launching this company

858
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
You guys did 600

859
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,592
$1,000 in sales

860
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
Yasso April 2013 to end-of-year

861
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
We did

862
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,344
It's unbelievable real traction early on there's a lot of

863
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Demand

864
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
What we are making into

865
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
3 News special

866
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
We didn't realize how

867
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
Special about today

868
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Become

869
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,120
So by the time you hit $600,000 in Revenue in Year One

870
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,984
That all that money is coming back into the business using it to buy more supplies

871
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,056
And were you able to keep up with demand

872
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
No

873
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
So how long was the wait time it's like

874
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,968
With a CrossFit Gyms that had to wait like weeks or months

875
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
So like our capacity was

876
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Space around

877
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Are mixer in our people

878
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
So

879
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,976
Like between send an email for example or like promote too much

880
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,304
Because it would stimulate demand and then we won't be able to

881
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Show it

882
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
Which is actually a good constrain

883
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
It was as healthy we can grow too fast

884
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,032
And most important thing is we had a great empathy for the whole business

885
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
I guess production and demand became so intense that by the middle of 2014 you just hired an outside

886
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,832
A manufacturer to make it you guys decided concluded you could not make this yourselves anymore

887
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,648
Into the whole plan was to manufacture so

888
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,720
Skeletal point and then commercialized

889
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
So find a good partner to

890
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,328
And the partner was in here in Illinois

891
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,632
No region is upstate New York

892
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
And

893
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Good to go right

894
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
Knows quite a disaster

895
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Trey

896
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
I'm sure

897
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,104
But manufacturing Foods really hard

898
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
So I went to go overseas production and Jared is a HomeBase

899
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Making sure filling orders

900
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
You were going to New York Upstate New York production over there for a week and

901
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
You know this is like my

902
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Baby until

903
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
I'm like a lunatic like yeah

904
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
Walking around making sure the bars are made right in like

905
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Overseeing everything and

906
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
So you come back home and I might Jared this is

907
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Permafrost

908
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
Feel it when you were there

909
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
Yammy their leadership like

910
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
For example I was posted up

911
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
In an office for

912
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,688
4 days next to me was the president

913
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
And

914
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
I we were the only customer there

915
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
She didn't

916
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,136
Even acknowledge my presence he just hit in his office

917
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
So if you think about

918
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,000
What that says about the company in the leadership there in

919
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
But it wasn't a good vibe in

920
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
Two two weeks later after that production run

921
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Jared gets an email from

922
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
The president when the remix of his hand

923
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
Who's next to me and what he say

924
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,592
Just basically like Peter's not allowed at the plant anymore

925
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
He was disrespectful to our employees

926
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
Your pricing is going to go from

927
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,600
16 Center like whatever double

928
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
So Jerry and I are like

929
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
Yeah. Retains

930
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
Software product like

931
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
You never did shelf life studies birds

932
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
Too busy like playing offense I guess

933
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,960
There's are some stability issues with it and why was that

934
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
Well we only learn because

935
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,080
You know we should make back to sail until the first time we

936
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
We Trust lies we made

937
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
200 plus thousand bar okay

938
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,248
Selling it through and then

939
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
Basically

940
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
We had customer saying like AIDS

941
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
Jason funny or whatever and so

942
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
Add shelf life issues

943
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Antara product

944
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Yeah and so

945
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Yeah I think

946
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,256
One of the things we did

947
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
But I'm really proud of his

948
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
We took an insurance claim all that inventory

949
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,216
Adding most branches got rid of it cuz it was not up to your standards

950
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
And I can reflection

951
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
Most brands I'm pretty confident with a sword through it

952
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
And

953
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,175
It was a really dark

954
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
Without inventory worth at retail

955
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
$300,000 for $100,000

956
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,183
And I think about that and maybe did like $500,000 in sales by the end of that like

957
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Process

958
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,231
We are out of stock for

959
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Two or three months

960
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,839
Why were you like found a new partner

961
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
We would then be like August we did a hundred

962
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
20000 mm

963
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,775
Sign into that year 2 million in Revenue yet I know exactly

964
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,567
Not being able to sell stuff

965
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:26,175
Still primarily CrossFit gyms in people buying online through word-of-mouth

966
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,967
Okay I remember

967
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
First seeing these

968
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
In

969
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
2016 and Trader Joe's

970
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
And

971
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
I go out on Paleo sometimes easier

972
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,999
But I said I was going to paleo face

973
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
And I saw them eat this

974
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
How did you get into Trader Joe's

975
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,191
He has a Trader Joe's has a huge milestone for us

976
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Did you think about it for the first time

977
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
When someone asks

978
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
The company like

979
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,711
Where can I buy an RX bar for the first time our answer wasn't like will where do you live

980
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Yeah

981
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
So

982
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,415
It was really amazing to have that like hole footprint how did they even had did you get in touch with them did you pitch them to they come to you

983
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
So is that a trade show expressed some interest and then are like a buyer and come by your booth

984
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,935
Yep I was like a product

985
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,055
That was under-resourced probably tablecloth and just piles of RX

986
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Yep

987
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
So you get

988
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,967
Getting it how long does it take you between a trade show in the time that these bars are in Trader Joe's it along

989
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
So is like January to June

990
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
Was that an instant game changer for you guys

991
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Yeah

992
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
Yeah it was kind of like all right we're in the big league

993
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
It's a hard place to get into

994
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
You think about it like

995
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
If you go to the death set it's only the

996
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,679
Top brands they don't carry local our little ones like

997
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,007
That was like oh s*** this is really working moment and then

998
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Are performance there

999
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Just continue to grow in

1000
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
That year

1001
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
2016

1002
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
36

1003
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
Million dollars in Revenue

1004
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,783
Qunar aggressive forecast was like

1005
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
16 to 18

1006
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
Progressive

1007
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
But I mean

1008
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
Did you even have time to sit back with Jared and say

1009
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Well

1010
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
It's crazy

1011
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
No I think

1012
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
We're just too focused on like the but snacks when I

1013
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
Growing it I think

1014
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,079
In reflection now we wasting by the fond memories but in the moment we were we were pushed the garage keep going

1015
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Keep going

1016
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
So there was just a huge

1017
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,967
Bombshell announcement in November

1018
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
2017

1019
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Kellogg's

1020
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
Why is the company outright

1021
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Six hundred million dollars

1022
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,279
This is a company that was started in 2013 and your parents kitchen

1023
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Your basement

1024
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
Yeah

1025
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
Yai

1026
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
The number

1027
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,615
You know we never dreamed of any sort I'll come like that

1028
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
I think

1029
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,943
That number reflects like television just buy a brand

1030
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,527
That valuation whichever looks at his

1031
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,087
I really weigh more than just a bar I mean

1032
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
Under the hood with really special people

1033
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
You're great company Reddit great value

1034
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Yeah

1035
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
So you are now a Kellogg's employee

1036
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Yeah

1037
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,143
You are the CEO of the company as you've always been

1038
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
And

1039
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
You are 32

1040
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
Yes

1041
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
You got all of this money is it weird

1042
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
When did Jesus live

1043
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,663
Process it is a change

1044
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,967
Anything practically

1045
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,831
Does it change anything about the way you the way you live your life or how you feel

1046
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,415
No it doesn't change me I mean I still dress like s*** and have

1047
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
Same shity shoes that people make fun of me

1048
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,815
The only thing that changes is like where you sleep and how you

1049
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
The opportunity

1050
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,959
Where you can travel and I think the biggest thing is just Freedom like Financial Freedom

1051
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
You have to worry about

1052
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,335
Providing for your future and that's I think it's a burden that

1053
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
It's really hard and so I think

1054
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,455
You know me Jared's still lives in his

1055
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
400 square foot apartment

1056
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:19,903
Think about that

1057
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Probably

1058
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,071
Some capacity for sure I want to do good I think it's a responsibility

1059
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Like

1060
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
I've had some success

1061
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
And I think you owe it back

1062
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Get some in some way so

1063
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
So

1064
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
You were the podcasts before

1065
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,847
I know some folks in the audience have

1066
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
I always ask one question at the very end

1067
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,967
Which is how much it would happen to you

1068
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
Do you tribute to your skill

1069
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
Your hard work you're in

1070
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Intelligence

1071
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
How much to lie

1072
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,927
You know I think I'm very lucky to be born in the United

1073
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
States I think I'm very lucky to

1074
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
Have a family in

1075
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,839
And you know if I didn't have my father and mother

1076
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,655
Raise me the way I did I would be drunk at a bar miserable

1077
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Call United mean Mike

1078
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,311
So I'm very lucky for those things and very lucky that I I met Sheridan

1079
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Humble

1080
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Partner to do this with

1081
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
I'm very lucky to be dyslexic and

1082
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,527
Are the attributes and strengths and weaknesses with that

1083
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,831
I'm very lucky this is the Golden Age of

1084
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
Entrepreneurship in food

1085
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
So

1086
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
I think

1087
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
A lot of it is luck but

1088
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
Telecaster play a variable in it

1089
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,423
But it doesn't happen without good timing in lock

1090
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Peter Rahal

1091
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
Founder of RX bar thank you so much

1092
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,479
After removing

1093
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
I spoke to Peter at the Athenaeum Theater in Chicago and

1094
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,367
Peter sat down with me

1095
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,183
Even though it was kind of a crazy time for him

1096
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,279
Few days before he was set to get married

1097
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
He told me that

1098
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
11e standards

1099
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:09,215
The wedding was a pretty intimate Affair just a hundred and fifty or so guests

1100
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,287
I know the menu was not paleo

1101
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,615
Peter and his wife serve lots of to salad hummus

1102
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,151
Mountains of

1103
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Pita bread

1104
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,271
Hey thanks so much for listening to

1105
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,599
