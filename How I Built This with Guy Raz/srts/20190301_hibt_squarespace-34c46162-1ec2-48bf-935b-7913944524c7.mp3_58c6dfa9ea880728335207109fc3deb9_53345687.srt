Perfect pear

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,784
Somewhere along the way I get like a call on my cell

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,184
Hey guys like hey its course it's okay so I called the date

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
Hey can you reboot the server and it doesn't come back and it wasn't coming back

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
And I was like I got to go to New York right now and I just drive to New York and I'm having a panic attack to hold out come and get screwed I lost all day

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
That little experiment over

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
From NPR how I built this

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movement

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Anthony casso has dorm room coding project turned into Squarespace

20
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Is it

21
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Business schools that teach a bunch of ideas about entrepreneurship

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,904
The one that is the clearest path to creating something unique

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Is this

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Find a problem that lots of people have and solve it

25
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Example how can I get from this exact point I'm standing on to another specific

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
2.2 miles away in a relatively fast and cheap way

27
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Swellinfo cities in America Uber and Lyft have solved that problem

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,320
Cheap pair of cool prescription glasses that's the question the guys behind Warby Parker wanted to answer

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Answer website

30
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:12,352
Today that is not a problem but not that long ago

31
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
You either needed to know how to code or know someone else who knew how to code and charged you money to make that

32
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,128
List of course was the problem that Anthony casalena wanted to solve

33
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Belt before I go on

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Acknowledge the elephant in the room here because yes in the past Squarespace has sponsored this podcast

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
And so of other companies that do similar things

36
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
And I promise you

37
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,816
That fact will never influence which company's we profile on the show we look for great stories and

38
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
The story of Squarespace

39
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
As you will hear

40
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
Pretty great Anthony casalena literally created his product in a dorm room at the University of Mary

41
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,640
Maryland in 2003 21 a self-taught coder

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,736
I'm looking for a way to combine a Blog and a website go figure

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
And out of that small problem he wanted to solve

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Squarespace

45
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
It's a company with now value that around 1.7 billion dollars

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Anthony grew up outside Baltimore in

47
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Early nineties

48
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
Just as the internet was becoming a mainstream thing

49
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
His dad worked in sales for companies like HP and Cisco so Anthony was exposed to a lot

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Type of computer hardware

51
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
From a young age

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
My my dad always High computers around so

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,296
I would break those and incur the wrath of my parents and

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Eventually I got to a point where

55
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
They were sick of me breaking their computers and

56
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
And Amy are getting one that I could break myself

57
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
Which I hate you know

58
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,656
Learn how to load games onto and learned a little bit of basic and stuff like that and

59
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
And this is like the area of like

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
286 is 386 is

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
Dos Windows 3.1

62
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,640
Windows 95 that kind of era but I was always really really into that

63
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Cute you started to

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Tell her how to program

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
Is a kid I like how old are you

66
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Probably 1314

67
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Because when I was 5th

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
Teen I work for an internet company

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
In in Maryland in Baltimore

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Actually they were trying to actually work

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Croup my dad and

72
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
You know my dad was like I'm busy and I

73
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Employed excetera butt

74
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
You know

75
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,423
My sons are good programa you shouldn't you should talk to him

76
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Just to put this in

77
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
The right time for talking about the mid to late night

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
I think you're talkin about the midnight

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Give me the web was really new

80
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
It wasn't like

81
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Common thing

82
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
And I kind of gravitate towards this thing called

83
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Internet relay chat so it's like this like

84
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Global chat room UK

85
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Can kind of go into and

86
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,463
It was like a wild west of the internet like you were connected to this that is not work and

87
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Yeah I remember

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Earliest programming I did

89
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
Was programming scripts to go into the fire

90
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,751
Find that would control it and give it new functionality and things like that and I also

91
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
Was around people who new windows program

92
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
And I was obsessed with user interfaces and

93
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,503
I learned a lot of Windows programming because I just wanted to know how it how it all worked I mean

94
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,599
It's really cool I don't know why I was so fascinated by all that

95
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
But I was definitely into it

96
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
So you I guess

97
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
You decide one must have to go to college

98
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
You went to the University of Maryland

99
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Yeah

100
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
And you are

101
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
Studying computer science

102
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
And

103
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Time Life

104
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
People

105
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
On the Block

106
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
The websites and

107
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
You wanted to do one

108
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Be yourself

109
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Yeah this was like

110
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Mm

111
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
And in 2003 I wanted to make a website

112
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Myselfin

113
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
I'll take two things about doing that one at the time you had all these different software programs

114
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
We have to put together to make what you would

115
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Normally think of is a website right now right do you have blocking software but that's up with them page building software right like that was like

116
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Dreamweaver and FrontPage and all that

117
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Sheppard software that would like tell you who's visiting the website to be like statcounter or something like that

118
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Upload that somewhere and host that somewhere that was an old hosting services that you would

119
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Use an

120
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:19,903
I just didn't I didn't want I didn't want this mishmash of thanks and the other thing that

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
I was really into is I was just always into the way it look the way the interface work than I knew the

122
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
Give me the finest is going to be like

123
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
Create a blog and a website

124
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
Remember but

125
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,063
Even in 2003 right not really

126
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
No I think that

127
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,023
There was livejournal but that that wasn't a very nice I would like a professional right until you didn't put your professional set

128
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
Was blogger at the time which again very personal in nature

129
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
I wanted I wanted more of a more of a website it is soon as you start to do that

130
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
Yeah that's blocking Services didn't let you do that until you thought right well I gotta make this stuff let me try to figure this out

131
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,623
And so I started making it for myself and I show people it right I mean

132
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Logging software

133
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,743
Make a website with it too is not cool and I remember my friends being like

134
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Are you two hundred bucks for that

135
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
And I'm like okay

136
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Maybe other people could use this

137
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:40,287
And so I started turning it into like a multi-user surface where people go when they could sign up and you know

138
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,919
Service and they could go and create their own site and things like that and and you know it

139
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Pretty quickly evolved

140
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,831
Into this could be a business idea from the beginning

141
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Easy

142
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
To build a website was that was that what you were thinking when you were creating the software

143
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
So

144
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
It was always about

145
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Publishing

146
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
I wasn't going to be able to come

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Compete

148
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
With

149
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
FrontPage Microsoft

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Dreamweaver

151
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
Macromedia later Adobe

152
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
When blogging

153
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
I see it as a kind of beginning of this DIY

154
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Do it yourself

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Wave

156
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Where people who have otherwise been a little intimidated

157
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
Yeah it was just kind of like so I can do this to

158
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
But then giving them something more power

159
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Sing

160
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Lucky you can publish The Blacklist you can publish your page

161
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
You can publish if you can do all of these

162
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,559
The block was the anchor but it was always about doing more with it

163
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,655
So I take me into your arms at your dorm room like are you seeing from

164
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Computer just

165
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,543
Theaters at The Keys just like let's get in there yeah yeah yeah

166
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
20 toilets

167
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
University of Maryland

168
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
In Sky of the dorm is called

169
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
South Campus

170
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
And I was in a

171
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
How many bedrooms

172
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
203

173
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Four four bedroom

174
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
You know it's

175
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Single bed end

176
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Does my little desk

177
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
In front of it and I have

178
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
M20 computers have two monitors which is like a huge deal at the

179
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,727
Like CRT monitors right that he's like giant like heavy like Neymar with televisions used to be like

180
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
How do you say particular

What's thanks

182
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
So you were

183
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
In your dorm room

184
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Just yeah

185
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
And how long did it take you to actually build this architect

186
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
So

187
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
The original version of it

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
I start a program in 2003

189
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
April 2000

190
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
A little bit before that

191
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
And it took me until

192
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
November December I was

193
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
It's kind of like done and ready to launch at so

194
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
What's a 8 months

195
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
And and did you did you have

196
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Annie

197
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
Any money any

198
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
Small amount of capital to actually

199
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Try and launches into a business

200
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
So

201
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Back then

202
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
I didn't

203
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,503
And I did everything I could have possibly done with the

204
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,367
Whatever skills I had or whatever I thought I could fake right and so you know

205
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
I know how to program a thing I can write the homepage and do the right the marketing copy I can make the interface now

206
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
There's a couple things I couldn't do

207
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,423
Right I couldn't invent servers to run it out of nowhere so I needed to buy some

208
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
And

209
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
I need the money for the service so I went to my event to my

210
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
Who

211
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
I know how to calculate but I need a 30

212
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
And $3,000

213
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
To get 30000

214
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
To get this off

215
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
I needed I needed the servers I need

216
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
The two of them right because

217
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Crashes that

218
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
Yeah text nice quiet I know that using scratch

219
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Dad friend

220
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,911
And it was a fight I remember

221
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Parking of the University of Maryland

222
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
I was in that that's stupid parking lot outside of the door

223
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
And I remember being on my phone

224
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
NN yeah it was like why do you need to why can't you have one

225
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Why doesn't

226
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Yeah that would be half like I mean it was It was a

227
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
It was a fight

228
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
And

229
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
Yo they eventually

230
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
I eventually won that fight and ended

231
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
The first semester

232
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Did you call it

233
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Squarespace already like

234
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Did you already pick that name

235
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Yeah

236
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Exactly when I picked it but

237
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
I needed to get to the.com

238
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
The. Net

239
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
The. Org domain

240
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Dad-to-be open

241
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Rights I need to be able

242
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Negotiate for them

243
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Because I got in having mites o

244
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
I remember

245
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Googling it

246
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
At the time and there was Zero Google results for

247
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
And I was like okay

248
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
We're starting from zero here

249
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
And

250
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
For some reason just thought like

251
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Okay

252
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Squarespace

253
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Like

254
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
Monitors were more

255
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
Square that the time they were in his rectangular like

256
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
It's not your space online I guess that works and

257
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
You know I can probably draw the logo for the

258
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
But

259
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Yeah I mean that's kind of that's kind of where it started

260
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
So if I ran into junior year of college

261
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
What's going on

262
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
Is business now is it what what's the business what would

263
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Dakota publishing

264
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
I said you know what's a way to make websites and blogs

265
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
And I probably would lean more into to blogging back then cuz it was more topical and people were like what's that

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
DIY Thing 1

267
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Possible

268
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Yeah this is why when you launched it in 2004 like you just don't know

269
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
Play button and then and then it just like here it is or Squarespace

270
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
So I won the fight with my parents

271
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
On the thirty Grand and

272
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
Cerberus right

273
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
And so

274
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
They were on the floor of my dorm room for a while

275
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
And you're most vulnerable to Data Center these are not like

276
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Normal

277
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
They're like really flat really long

278
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
And really really loud and so

279
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,335
They're so loud that I have to keep him off cuz otherwise

280
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
Terrible back of the time I read

281
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
A lot about software development blogs I read

282
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
Was this guy

283
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,111
Joel spolsky and his blog was hosted

284
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
In New York by a company called Pier 1

285
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
And so I was like okay well when I do a Datacenter

286
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
Hear what sounds good they like Joe and say hello

287
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
I visited New York as a kid and

288
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
There's just something about it

289
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
That I I just knew

290
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
I just knew I wanted to be there

291
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,799
Eventually them up

292
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
A my car

293
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Put everything in

294
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
And turn them on check that I can remotely connect to them and tell when like at dinner New York and then

295
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
So when do you when you launched

296
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Squarespace

297
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
Spike from the perspective of a customer

298
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah it was just a website

299
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
People would

300
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Book find

301
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Right so

302
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
I turned it on and I was like what how am I going to get people shot like

303
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
I guess you can do advertising

304
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
And so I bought a bunch of Google AdWords what now

305
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Watch about like 200 bucks

306
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Google AdWords

307
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Underlight

308
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Website make a blog like all these

309
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Different things and

310
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
A couple people came to

311
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
3

312
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Like I'm even talking like

313
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Not a lot

314
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Sore like

315
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
To sign up

316
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Squarespace inc

317
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
So

318
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
Loon facts

319
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Actually for the

320
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
First gear

321
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Did have a

322
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Free plan

323
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
You could actually use it for

324
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Afraid we always had a free trial

325
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
But then I actually had a

326
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Free plan

327
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Any idea

328
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah there are plenty of examples of

329
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
People giving away software for free and no sings growing up

330
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
I like your Hover was free millions of account

331
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Myspace whatever it like

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
People going to give away for free and that people cannot

333
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
And so in the first year

334
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
I realize that

335
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
There were a lot of people who are going to use this thing

336
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
For free that were

337
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Never ever ever

338
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
And again I'm running this like

339
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
I don't like

340
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Other money

341
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
So I need to keep this thing running so I don't want

342
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
The people who are free

343
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
Who are never going to upgrade

344
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
Using up all the service beso and it was really not the point of the thing it was

345
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
But I was out there trying to make an ex livejournal

346
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Blogger I wanted the

347
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Let me focus on the people that want to pay for this

348
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Africa

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Between 5 and 2

350
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
15 bucks a month

351
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
They Don't Really inexpensive

352
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Soapdish

353
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
A man in that in 2004 that first year

354
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,447
I mean you are still a student and running this thing and what did that

355
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
What is your life look like in that plane

356
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,663
It was interesting how it evolved because the end of the year

357
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
I'm making 50 Grand a year my parents will I breaking a job after college it's a nice little side project but word

358
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
Your job and I really started to see at the end of that year if I double to Triple that like

359
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
They stay around right like they make a website for not leaving

360
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
Going to try and grow this until I actually stayed on the graduating in 4 years I waited in The Graduate

361
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Fit in 5

362
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
And kind of took some like

363
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,591
I just a pretty light workload classes on that app

364
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
I was buying myself time right I was buying myself out of like my parents really getting on my case

365
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:27,391
About getting a job cuz I got to pass them in school I mean I think that they were the inklings of how it would later impact my life

366
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
But I don't think it really it hit me that stuff coming like I I just wanted these events along the way

367
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
One of the early once was

368
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
This is my friend and we're taking a road trip

369
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
To Miami

370
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
17 hour drive somewhere

371
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Along the way

372
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Call myself

373
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
And

374
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
Hi guys like hey it's course it's okay and I'm like

375
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,063
I don't know

376
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
Take me to an internet cafe

377
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
This is ridiculous

378
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
This is mm

379
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
This is a different world of internet and I like log on and I can remotely log into the servers and like reboot

380
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Put something that comes back in the

381
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
And it was like my first taste of this like

382
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Responsibility

383
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
End

384
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Foreshadowing

385
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
What would that

386
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
App simulator

387
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
In your arms

388
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
You graduated from

389
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
College Inn

390
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
And by the time

391
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
You graduated college

392
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
I've heard that you guys had like

393
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
About 10000

394
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Townsend

395
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
He knows it's starting to look pretty good

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Would you were the only

397
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Person right you were the engineer designer and support rapping

398
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Can see you

399
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,423
Yeah I was I was kind of everything I mean so in the first year

400
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
I think we will like a run rate of like 50 Grand

401
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
And in the second year I think we were at a run rate of like

402
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
200 Grand

403
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Then it was like a million bucks every night

404
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
But it

405
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
In your to I was able to convince my parents

406
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Instead

407
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
I'm going to do this and

408
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
I started looking for apartments

409
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
In New York

410
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
I knew I wanted

411
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
In New York I put the service there

412
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
It was like the scene of

413
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,047
These like really happy moments in my life but also he's like

414
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Readily traumatic moments

415
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Where

416
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
There was nothing to happen maybe

417
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
A year in

418
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Where

419
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
I didn't have a lot of space

420
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
And so

421
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
I have my redundant one but it was

422
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
And so at some point this happen again

423
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Thanks black.

424
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Somebody say hates down okay I try and login to account login

425
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
So I called the date

426
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
I'm hating you reboot

427
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
The server

428
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
And it doesn't come back

429
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Bluegrass

430
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
And it wasn't coming

431
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
And I was in Maryland

432
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Evansville

433
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Yeah my girlfriend

434
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
And I was like I got to go to New York right now

435
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
As of 50 minutes

436
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
I just got the car

437
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
But server the backseat

438
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
And I just drive to New York

439
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Anime

440
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
Can I get screwed I lost all the data

441
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,455
That little experiment over like I should have the other thing

442
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
There is replicated all the stuff in

443
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
I had levels of redundancy

444
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
He just not that much

445
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
And so I remember going up there and

446
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Thing like IHOP's works

447
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
And taking baths

448
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Are the computers and taking all the drives at Awana

449
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Sliding them into the other

450
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
And turning the thing back on

451
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
And

452
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
Turned on

453
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
Africology

454
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
You decided to move to New York

455
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
God is it closer to the server

456
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Just want to live there too

457
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Yeah place

458
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,503
So I went to Craigslist

459
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Yeah I didn't know anyone in the city inside it

460
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Want to live alone there's no reason

461
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Incur that expense and like

462
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,791
I moved in with four other complete strangers off of Craigslist

463
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
And is a 5 bedroom apartment

464
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,959
4th floor walkup and I remember I had to Old BMW

465
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
Black 3 Series I

466
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Packed everything Ike

467
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,407
Could into this car I remember driving

468
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
Up to New York alone

469
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
And

470
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
The first thing I did is made like an illegal turn over 23rd Street and got a ticket

471
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
And then the second thing that happened to me was

472
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,767
I park in front of my place tonight I guess I

473
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,911
Park like this but I'm going to be running out of my car and carrying all my stuff up

474
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,543
Literally alone at the end of the last trip I was just sitting out on my phone my

475
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
4 and I was getting a little bit tired

476
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Take a minute

477
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
Exhausting and

478
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
I go down my car is towed

479
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
So it's like I'm just piled

480
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Tickets and no car and

481
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,695
I remember going back up to my room

482
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
And realizing like

483
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
I have a light in this room New York crap like

484
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
Go to like the tow yard or whatever on the west side

485
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
Get my car and call up one of my best friend

486
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Live in Philadelphia

487
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,687
And so I went back to fix the next day bought myself a lamp upon myself a pet

488
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
And I went on from there

489
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
This is 2006 and I think Square Face was still just

490
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,280
Yeah so I had at some point along the way a part-time

491
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,424
For the editors somebody who's doing part-time customer support and then I had contracted out

492
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
I'm somebody to do helping me with a template designs but they would know no full-time employee

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,176
And was your office your room in your apartment it was

494
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
And the time like

495
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Were they just internet thing

496
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
It's like the New York right and it's New York

497
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,256
10 years against not like Silicon Valley

498
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
What do you do you make websites whatever

499
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Anyway

500
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
Philly startup they're like oh you're unemployed interesting that's cool

501
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
So what's an 2006

502
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Speaking about

503
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
Tu250

504
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
And read something like that which would sounds like a lot of money

505
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Before

506
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
A guy in his

507
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Early or mid-twenties

508
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
Will you making a lot of money with a lot of profit or is it

509
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Just

510
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
We are expenses I would put it 100% back in

511
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
As much as I can

512
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
If I

513
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
May twenty bucks an AdWords I put twenty bucks back in

514
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
I made a thousand bucks and out of it that's in a thousand more

515
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
Device payment

516
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,704
Yeah I keep a little bit of a balance in case I needed it for something but

517
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
I would just put

518
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
Almost all of it back in

519
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
And

520
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Yeah I mean I didn't have a problem

521
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Pay my rent

522
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Yeah I was going out with other

523
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
People my age so it wasn't like

524
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Yet you won't go to Michelin 3-star restaurants

525
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
No no I couldn't even find someone to go with me if I wanted to

526
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
And

527
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
At some point

528
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Forgot exactly why

529
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
But I ended up being like okay I should

530
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
I should have an offer

531
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Just a split up

532
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Workday

533
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
And not work day and so I remember being the okay well let's see and took a course

534
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Craigslist

535
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
And I rented a desk

536
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Architects

537
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
Down in

538
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
West Broadway in

539
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
So it's like

540
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
Tribeca but you were still doing most

541
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Everything

542
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Like you were the

543
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
CTO the CEO you were

544
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,464
Designing stuff for a while and and how did you cope with that was it was exciting was amazing

545
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Are you stressed out or what

546
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
I think it took me years

547
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
To fully appreciate

548
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
What the stress was really doing to me

549
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
You know at some

550
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Point in this

551
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
Two things happen

552
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,592
One I stopped making progress I would set

553
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,992
These minor goals myself like the simple things like okay I want this feature out in a month and then you know

554
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
I just

555
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
Ryan Edwards I pay my taxes and like you no answer, so I didn't actually get anywhere until I started

556
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:01,280
This is Millwork into

557
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Yeah but they packed

558
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
And I didn't know what that was or where that's from or I'd never experienced that in my life before like like heart palp

559
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Applications engineer

560
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
Yeah yeah Hearts racing

561
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,944
Gets rights closing up you can't breathe a busy cuz you're having a heart attack or what you think in your mind to be a heart attack

562
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
Here's the funny thing and it's why I said that I didn't really appreciate what it was doing to me it was

563
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,976
Almost nothing would regret you just be kind of there and he start to get your

564
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:37,376
Your head start to focus on it start to get stressed and you know it was stressful in the moments where the server would cry

565
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
Something in my heart would be racing but

566
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
But that's not a panic attack panic attacks like

567
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
You just sitting there at like

568
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
2 p.m.

569
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
In your room

570
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Hanging out

571
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
And your heart's racing

572
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
They don't know why but was stressing you out

573
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
What do you remember what

574
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
The things that would stress you out

575
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah I think that

576
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Try to do it alone for a while

577
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
The infrastructure side is so I can't really like

578
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Explain to you

579
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
How stressful this was because eventually after

580
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Then crashed a bunch

581
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
You set up monitoring

582
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
The monitoring

583
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Check City

584
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
And if it

585
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Crashes

586
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
So there's a performance

587
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Problem or whatever

588
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
They would send a message

589
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Where's my phone

590
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
And so it would happen in the middle of the night it would happen

591
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,640
If I'm out to dinner and you never know what's wrong with it

592
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456
It's always like the psychological

593
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
Are you go figure out if your wife broke

594
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
Like and there's no one else who can save you

595
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Cuz no one else knows

596
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Don't think so

597
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Go for it

598
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
It was like in a way I was really free because I was in New York and I had control over my schedule at and all those Miami

599
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Plays in the self-service thing any other hand I'm completely and totally trapped

600
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
When we come back in just a moment how Anthony started to

601
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
Bring other people on board to help out and then realize that letting go of control

602
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,784
Is a lot harder than he thought

603
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,648

625
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
Around 2006

626
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Things are going

627
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
Pretty well for Anthony casalena

628
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Middle East business

629
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Personally

630
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
It's not so great

631
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680

632
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216

00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Squarespace

635
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824

636
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,224
Even refuses to travel by plane because he's afraid the server bike crash while he's in the air

637
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
It's a one-day

638
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
Someone suggested Anthony

639
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
She got some business advice

640
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,720
Converse lot of customers over chat with Verizon support and stuff like that

641
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
And it was a point where

642
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
I was having a lot of castles

643
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096

652
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096

Business I would say cuz I mean distance

What time and it's like this was a really successful project

658
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432

00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064

Get started a couple companies in New York I'm kind of

How are you going to

684
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,488
Hey I was there enough Revenue coming in Where You Are

685
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Pay you a salary

686
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Yeah totally

687
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,888
Squarespace always had enough money to

688
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
Yeah

689
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Salary is that kind of wasn't an issue

690
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
So he came aboard as your CEO and

691
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
Scholastic

692
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Gross

693
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah and I eat

694
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
For me at the time

695
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,224
I didn't know what it meant

696
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
2

697
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,112
Have a certain title or not have a certain title I was just like look this is fluid easy okay cool

698
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
I'm still running the show here like I you know

699
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
I'll just take this risk

700
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
And over the next

701
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,536
Couple of years we moved into an office

702
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,328
On Center Street in SoHo

703
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,144
And yeah we started adding people of the car

704
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
And frankly some

705
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
A lot actually join very organically

706
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
Play we had

707
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Some people join in

708
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Creative rolls who were

709
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
Customers actually some moves

710
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
15 New York

711
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
Yeah we had a guy join and help

712
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Yes

713
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Do people help with the infrastructure and

714
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Did that instantly

715
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Free you up

716
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Did that take some of the pressure off

717
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Honestly

718
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
More people there

719
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
So I am at least not like alone and in my head

720
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
And that really needs some stress but I

721
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
I think it probably

722
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
Created more stress for me

723
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Then I realized

724
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
Because I didn't fully appreciate

725
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
What I was doing what

726
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
I'm 20 what

727
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
Four five six

728
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
I never heard a single person

729
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Entire life

730
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,552
And I'd say that you're through this process site

731
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
I learned a lot about myself

732
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
I learned a lot about

733
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
11 people in a company

734
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
And I learned a lot of lessons

735
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
Really the hard way by literally making icing

736
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Pretty much every possible

737
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Steak

738
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
One can make

739
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
You start this thing in your dorm room

740
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
It's you

741
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,616
You're the engineer you're the CEO your the marketing guy

742
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
Team up with somebody who has business

743
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Experience

744
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Who has a plan

745
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,344
We need to start hiring people lie to expand which is exciting

746
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Camp butt

747
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
You would have to give up

748
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Rollover

749
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
The day-to-day running of

750
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Can imagine was probably not easy

751
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
Yeah and it didn't work for me

752
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
Was there friction between you and Dan

753
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Oh yeah

754
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Which is very normal and it happens

755
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
All the time

756
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
In startups

757
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,384
Write this is a story we've heard on the show before

758
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,456
He was there for five years

759
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Ukiki Lefton

760
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
Start his own company but during that five-year. Was it

761
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
Really difficult for you to

762
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Align

763
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
What your Visions were did you

764
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Kind of

765
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
Plow through that five-year period or or was it actually okay

766
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
There wasn't really okay

767
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
I think

768
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
You look I was young

769
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Bright and I think

770
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
The people had

771
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
A good intent

772
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,824
Send N I didn't know what I was getting into

773
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,176
I need to know what a good manager that look like I didn't know how much stress I was supposed to have or not have

774
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
I didn't know what kind of dialogue

775
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
We're good or bad at like what the

776
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Dysfunction look like what

777
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Yeah I didn't know that

778
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
And so I was in this motorbike

779
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Keep it all together.

780
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Is keep it together

781
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
Don't let it fall apart

782
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Don't go back to zero

783
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Keep it together

784
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
And try and find a way through this

785
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And that was a lot of what I was

786
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
What's the temperature

787
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Actual

788
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
Website publishing status

789
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
Intersect

790
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Cuz I mean Danes there's

791
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Scrolling

792
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Is like

793
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
The delay mm

794
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
Let's see what's happening on the

795
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
On the product side

796
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
So

797
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
The product

798
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Add squares

799
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
This is always

800
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
Ben one of the

801
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
Primary growth drivers

802
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
And

803
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
A lot of good things happened

804
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
The time I mean we

805
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Suspender advertising channels

806
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Adding more

807
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
People method

808
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
I wasn't in this mode anymore where I was sort of

809
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
Just constantly like not hitting any goals and so

810
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Around

811
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
So

812
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
We launched

813
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Squarespace 5

814
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Which was

815
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,832
A huge huge update to the platform mean

816
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
Deers like

817
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
07 wait something like that

818
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Animations and things on a website and web apps

819
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
Like we're entering into a different era

820
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
And

821
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:43,680
Launching Squarespace 5 was either one of the things that helped Propel us forward and I would say that

822
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
It was a total disaster

823
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
We flipped it on for everyone at once

824
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
It had these

825
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
Really hard to track down bugs

826
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,872
We're literally working

827
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,920
24/7 overnight

828
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Every single person

829
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,528
Cuz it was just crashing and crashing and we couldn't roll it back

830
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
And

831
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
You know I think that we finally got

832
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Through it and

833
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
We kept growing up

834
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
And at the time

835
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Yeah we had a couple

836
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
People in mark

837
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
We had more people in product view more people engineering we had

838
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
85000

839
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,168
Weather South 10 million-dollar run-rate

840
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
And at some point

841
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
We were approached

842
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Just to sell the car

843
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
And

844
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Yeah so we got approached by Getty and

845
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
And

846
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
Yo Gotti sells

847
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,296
Stock photo stock photo stock video stock audio Etc

848
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
I want other ideas as well a lot of these

849
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
Images end up going with websites why don't we

850
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
We sell stock websites to

851
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Yeah this is little company in New York

852
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
15th Virginia

853
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Job so

854
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Banded up

855
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Coming and talking

856
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
With me

857
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
And

858
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
You know I don't come from

859
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Like

860
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
Money or anything like that

861
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
And I had never started

862
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Squarespace 2

863
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Sell it like

864
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,944
I was having a good time. We were making impact on the web

865
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
And some dishes are not insignificant

866
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Offer to buy the company

867
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,368
And that would have been a really

868
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,720
I really I struggled with it

869
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
So what you do

870
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,656
Brown the same time I was also approached I don't even know how they like caught windows

871
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Spotlight

872
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
What's meant Pastor saying hey you don't have to

873
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,544
To do that you don't have to sell it all

874
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,128
If you want some liquidity why don't you accept an investment from us

875
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
School put some money into the

876
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
The company you can sell some of your shares to us

877
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,320
You can keep running it will put a board and play as well help you recruit Executives and all that

878
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
And I am

879
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,024
I like that and if if the other shows did anything it did cause me to go down that track

880
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
And realize

881
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
I want to keep

882
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
I want to keep running it

883
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
I want to

884
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
South of my shares in the company

885
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
What a real board in place

886
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
I want

887
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Different kinds of kind of a different kind

888
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
So we closed

889
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
An investment from indexing

890
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Cell

891
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
In July of 20

892
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,504
10 * 2

893
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Forums index

894
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Dentures and Accel partners and

895
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Think I read

896
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
38 million dollars

897
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Yep 38.5

898
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
And I think that

899
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,048
That was the one of the catalysts

900
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Stormy kind of kicking off

901
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
That era of

902
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,168
After this investment

903
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,216
We started looking at the product

904
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,776
And I remember this moment with

905
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Dinner with one of my main

906
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Prada people and we were looking at the site survey

907
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Cradle cap form

908
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
I'm a businessman

909
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Texarkana

910
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
But

911
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,528
Not growing as well as you know we had

912
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
We're starting to tap out on a couple different

913
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Add channels where you reach kind of exhaustion

914
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Spending

915
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Not hit appointment

916
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
But

917
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
I'm in the web is changing there were

918
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,072
Did the iPhone

919
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
NN so people were

920
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
More used to saying okay the web

921
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Experience on my phone while different

922
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,496
Needs to be very high fidelity

923
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
And The Sting the sting that we had

924
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
Add Squarespace five

925
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Yeah it wasn't going to

926
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
It was going to do it I mean it too

927
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
These look like outside bars

928
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Leaving work on phones what is it

929
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
And so

930
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Me and a couple people

931
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
Started to rewrite all squares

932
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Like the whole thing

933
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Wow this is an

934
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Hits in 2011

935
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
2010

936
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Until we start to work on Squarespace

937
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
Escorts basics

938
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,400
Don't look if anyone knows what it sounds like when I'm like I will

939
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Just rewrite the thing

940
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
Like that's probably the worst

941
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,312
You never want to be in a situation where you're rewriting core platform

942
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
It always takes three times longer than a week

943
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Expect another people who Ridge

944
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
And it's usually disaster

945
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
But

946
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Yeah I want

947
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
To take another shot at

948
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
Does that was the point of the investment

949
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
The point of the investment was

950
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
We're not done

951
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
We know we can

952
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
Make something better

953
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
It's over 2 years

954
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,512
A small group of people

955
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Made Squarespace

956
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Which

957
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Really division was

958
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
And we want to be able to create any kind of website

959
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
You resumed

960
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,152
The role of CEO after Dan laughing around 2011 that right and the 2010

961
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
And you are leading the re-architect like a complete re architecture

962
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
Encoding how are you coding

963
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,208
And also try to like be a CEO to where you

964
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,328
Cuz you're good coder obviously were you able to also be a good CEO I think

965
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
I was in a mode where

966
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
I knew I didn't have the right kind of support around me

967
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
I think during this time

968
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
I started realizing

969
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,104
What a horrible manager was

970
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
You know after this invest

971
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
It was a year after

972
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
And I ended up meeting are our first

973
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
VP of engineering

974
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
John Coulton is

975
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Great

976
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
And I was trying to code running

977
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Nearing team ahead

978
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,488
Weird relationships in like

979
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,048
He just like immediately

980
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Took

981
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
Such a massive amount of stress away

982
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
With respect to

983
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
How to be a manager

984
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
How to remove Roblox from people

985
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
You like I just learned so much and I've never worked anywhere else really it sounds Anthony like you

986
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
You

987
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
Grilling

988
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
I mean you were a kid you know

989
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
Premature like you eat a weed overall

990
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Different versions of ourselves

991
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
Fox as we get older than me at 30

992
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
NBA 20 are very different from who I am today

993
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
And it sounds like

994
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
You

995
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
You started to kind of

996
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
Realize this

997
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,288
What are you okay with criticism and feedback or did you when you get defensive

998
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,408
What are things that happened a long time ago in Squarespace when

999
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
Doing a lot of customers

1000
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Support and doing it all alone

1001
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
It's like

1002
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
What do you like

1003
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
The feedback or not you're about to get a lot of it

1004
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,880
Right I mean people cursing me out saying idiot

1005
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
ATS equipment manager on the line even though I'm the only person the compass

1006
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Like

1007
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,560
Then then literally leaving and being like I'm

1008
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Done with you

1009
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,192
This product sucks and so over the years I think I I develop some amount of

1010
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Realization that

1011
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
I need to create a

1012
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800
Find where I hear feedback

1013
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
I always have

1014
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
To agree with it

1015
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
But to create event we don't

1016
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Here it is

1017
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Is really the scariest

1018
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Sting for me

1019
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Because I think that

1020
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
If you remain closed off to it

1021
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Vulnerable

1022
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Is big like

1023
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
Seismic shifts where

1024
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Ignored something

1025
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
The point where things really going to break

1026
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
So I'm worried about

1027
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
China listen to what's there and

1028
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Figure out what I can

1029
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
Can figure out from it

1030
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Because look

1031
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,680
At the end of the day I've made so many mistakes it would be so silly

1032
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
For me to sit there and think that I'm not

1033
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Making any now

1034
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Have to be

1035
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
Help him just more to intuitive

1036
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Chaster resolving

1037
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
What what

1038
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
And it sounds like a turning point was when

1039
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
This new team started the

1040
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Cam you start

1041
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
To rewrite the software but

1042
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Divisibility of squares

1043
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Space Also change like you guys

1044
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,696
A pretty interesting

1045
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Strategy which was to advertise on

1046
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
Podcast

1047
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Seattle disclosure

1048
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
And then people weren't really doing that in mm

1049
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
10

1050
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
Yes so we did it even before 2010

1051
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
I mean podcast

1052
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Yeah I remember

1053
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Yeah we were going to we're going to maybe try podcast

1054
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,896
The first pocketed it was This Week in Tech

1055
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
And

1056
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
I'm sure it cost like

1057
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
Xiaomi like 30 grand

1058
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
That's our whole AdWords budget

1059
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
Like the whole month

1060
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,744
And how many podcast reads and what's the audience in are you sure like I don't know but you know what at the end of the day

1061
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,328
And it immediately worked for us

1062
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
Yuasa traction right away

1063
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Right away

1064
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Right away

1065
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:47,776
You could do this is really authentic thing around like you are supporting a show host that show host

1066
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Has a connection with their audience

1067
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
You are supporting the creation of that

1068
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,479
Content and you never hide the fact that it's sponsored but you know

1069
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,855
People genuinely like okay I'm bored with this I love podcast I love this show thank you Squarespace for doing this

1070
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
And I think that

1071
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,767
It was a it was a really great thing for us like every podcast was sponsored by

1072
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
We tried

1073
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
We really tried

1074
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
I'm later on

1075
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
It was a joke

1076
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,191
When we first did I Super Bowl ad

1077
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,775
Somebody was tweeting they were like I didn't know the Super Bowl to the podcast

1078
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
So yeah I mean we went in his face and it yeah it was great because I mean it's something we related to what we did right Square

1079
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,527
Play supports lots and lots and lots of independent creators make a lot of podcast series

1080
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
We're independent

1081
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,415
Creators and they had you know voices in and show Concepts that otherwise wouldn't have

1082
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,023
Will you know existed if it wasn't for that Medium so it's really amazing to be able to support it

1083
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
The way we get

1084
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
As you serve began to turn a corner did the growth just come from in a combination of

1085
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:55,871
More outside capital and the ability to Market your brand more is that was that the game changer

1086
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
For you

1087
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
The outside capital

1088
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Is not it main driver for it

1089
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Was

1090
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
Squarespace 6

1091
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Launching

1092
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
And that changed every

1093
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Lacrosse

1094
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
This is Mike 2012 July

1095
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Is version 6 is Squarespace

1096
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Version 6 of squares

1097
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
This is the one that you know

1098
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Small team couple years after the

1099
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
This investment

1100
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
Came together

1101
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
The rewrite

1102
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
You can use today

1103
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
Yeah this is the one that's online today

1104
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,543
It's technically seven but it's not a big

1105
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Diversion difference

1106
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
And it changed over metrics

1107
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
You know you had all these

1108
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
Crazy Beautiful sites you could do

1109
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
It portfolio sites

1110
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,575
The fullscreen images you could use those for businesses

1111
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
The sites were

1112
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
If some of the first sites that

1113
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,207
Work perfectly on mobile phones without any adjustment

1114
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
That's right and so that was a bee

1115
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Big deal

1116
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Without that product squares

1117
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,655
I'm curious how did you I mean you started this in 2000

1118
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
3 write in a dorm room and it was really nothing

1119
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Like it out there

1120
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Today

1121
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
There's a lot of competition

1122
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
This much more complex

1123
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
World that was

1124
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
20 shifts

1125
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
When you first had Squarespace

1126
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Lights out in the world

1127
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Yeah

1128
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
Yes it was funny

1129
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
It's almost love

1130
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Last Dragon

1131
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
And you know I don't know if you

1132
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
You could grow this

1133
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
AdWords

1134
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
The same way I did

1135
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,719
15 years ago cutting people look they look for the brand

1136
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
It's definitely a different landscape and also

1137
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,351
When you got companies like us that have had such

1138
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
Investment

1139
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
For such a long period of time

1140
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
In the space it's really

1141
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
As we've grown

1142
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
The ambition of the company is scale

1143
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
It started with

1144
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Can you make a website for

1145
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
From South to

1146
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,407
Yeah can we make blogs in these other kinds

1147
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
To you know the kind of sites

1148
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Kraton scores

1149
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
6 in

1150
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
Converse platform medicine

1151
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Can you sell on Squarespace

1152
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
A lot of people selling on Squarespace

1153
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,415
And yeah we're just really centered around entrepreneurial success

1154
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
Can you put the site online

1155
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
We help you be successful in marketing yourself and

1156
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Starting a business

1157
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
That's really the core with Squarespace is about

1158
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
You now have this

1159
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Huge

1160
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
It means that with that comes like

1161
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,151
Responsibilities that you probably never even imagined power

1162
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
You probably never even imagined or wanted

1163
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
Charlie Wilson

1164
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,087
Controversy I think last year where some like white supremacists are using

1165
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
Squarespace and

1166
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,695
You know you're going to face these things all the time

1167
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
Yep how do you delay each

1168
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,303
Each situation

1169
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
You know what would you do

1170
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,167
You try and have rules around it and so

1171
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
1

1172
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,519
Thing that's great about Squarespace frankly versus other

1173
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
Situations other providers are in

1174
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Is the

1175
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Is a paid service

1176
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
So we have to avoid the worst of

1177
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
That Sprite very rarely as somebody like

1178
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,111
I'm supposed to punch bad stuff online. Here's my credit card and here's my address and I'm going to post you know what I mean like

1179
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
We're very lucky

1180
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
So

1181
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
Are Stan's like everyone else

1182
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
The stats has to evolve Wellness as

1183
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
As time goes on because

1184
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
Yeah we are business

1185
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
We're not

1186
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,471
The government and we're not you know trying to protect every possible

1187
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Viewpoint on the planet

1188
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
And so

1189
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Yeah we need to make sure that

1190
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
And I we're doing business with the right

1191
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
You know the kind of people we need to do business with

1192
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
I think at the end of 2017 Squarespace raise

1193
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
$200

1194
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Funding

1195
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,183
Valuing the company at 1.7 billion might be valued higher now

1196
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,511
A lot of money and you were

1197
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
You know your attack

1198
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Success

1199
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,423
These conferences

1200
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
But

1201
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:37,055
You are also does it also make it challenging

1202
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:43,199
To you know to make new friends and to meet new people because you never know if people just want to be around you for that reason

1203
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,367
Yeah I'm really lucky in life that I've always been the kind of person that I've made good friends that have

1204
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Kind of gone

1205
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,207
Through a lot with me and I know kind of what that

1206
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
But that looks like when it's

1207
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Nanjing

1208
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
Superficial and

1209
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,887
Yeah I still have a lot of friends from

1210
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
Like from that that original apartment in New York

1211
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:09,567
I think that's been a really positive part of my life actually have we stay in touch in

1212
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
You got older and

1213
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Contact

1214
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
So it is harder it becomes harder than

1215
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,319
Wilshire any when you're when you're 23 24 and you got your reading roommates and you

1216
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,927
Have a bunch of time and you have your school friends whatever like yeah people are more up and now more people are

1217
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
And kind of Family Medicine everything

1218
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
You want to do that

1219
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Have family

1220
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
It's a great Quest

1221
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
I've really put Austin

1222
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
So much has changed my life so rapidly

1223
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
It's really been focused on all of that

1224
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
I'm not ruling it out I just

1225
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,687
It's not front and center right now

1226
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
But you know

1227
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,039
The things are friends and reminded 25 and 35

1228
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
15

1229
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Different

1230
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Your mom

1231
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
When are you going to go

1232
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,535
They do that they do that though don't don't don't worry that voice

1233
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Anthony obviously you're

1234
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
You see how you were like

1235
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
Super talented

1236
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
Coder programmer

1237
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
From young age

1238
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
And I have a lot of talent

1239
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,591
How much how much of your success

1240
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
Because of that talent and your skill and your

1241
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Intelligence how much of it

1242
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Do you think it's because you

1243
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
You just got lucky

1244
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
Oh man I've been lucky so many times in my life

1245
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
My parents had a computer around me

1246
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,743
Yeah I'm lucky that they didn't get deleted their Alita but all these scenarios I mean

1247
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,839
Yeah we're words even scratching the surface of the other crazy things that have happened that mean

1248
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
I'd say the

1249
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
There

1250
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,983
Qualities I probably have the

1251
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Have helped

1252
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:47,871
Me stay here around you know perseverance and pain tolerance in

1253
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,223
And make us some level of adaptability

1254
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,295
My best moment some kind of self-awareness but

1255
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,647
No I think that anyone who possibly claims that

1256
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
They didn't get Lucky's crazy that's Anthony casalena

1257
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:11,679
Founder of Squarespace last year there was speculation Anthony would take the company public

1258
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
But for now

1259
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
Squarespace has decided

1260
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
Stay private

1261
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,359
Meanwhile Anthony still keeps a vast collection of magic

1262
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,431
The Gathering cards that he bought when he was a kid

1263
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,527
He says he's got hundreds of them sitting in binders in a storage space

1264
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,343
Including the rare Black Lotus car

1265
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
Said to be worth more than $20,000

1266
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,423

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1280
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,327
Time now for how you built that

1281
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
What's a story starts in mm

1282
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
16

1283
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:19,007
Right outside of Boston with K Westervelt waddling around Target

1284
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
Waddling around Target because

1285
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:26,943
She just been released from the hospital where she given birth to a 9 and 1/2 pound baby boy

1286
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
So Kate was sore

1287
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,039
And she had stitches and

1288
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
She was really up for a Target run

1289
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
Now the thing you should know about Kate is that she's kind of a planner so she's already fully stocked her Nursery

1290
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
Free with everything she thought the baby would need

1291
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
Diapers and wipes and

1292
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Clothing

1293
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
But she didn't really give much thought to the things that she might need

1294
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
After her baby was born

1295
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,847
The nurses walked in with things like mash underwear and

1296
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Ginormous pad

1297
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
Plus ice packs and

1298
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,479
Squeeze bottle to help keep her stitches

1299
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Clean

1300
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,063
Old stuff she needed for her recovery

1301
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
What stuff Kate didn't have at home

1302
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:11,487
On the way home from the hospital while her husband and new baby waited in the car

1303
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
She went shopping

1304
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
And

1305
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Chevelle

1306
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
Kind of Clueless

1307
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,607
I got

1308
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
A bunch of different

1309
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:24,287
Breastfeeding AIDS you know organic pads synthetic pads whatever I could get my hands on because I was

1310
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:29,919
I was just desperate and in dire need of any help and I'll help and I knew I wouldn't be able to get to the store again in the next

1311
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Couple days

1312
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
Kate left the store

1313
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
Totally overwhelmed but

1314
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
She also left

1315
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
With an idea

1316
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,975
We live in a convenience economy we get razors delivered groceries delivered everything is delivered

1317
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,791
How are we not providing this convenience for new moms

1318
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
You need it the most

1319
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,447
And as soon as she got back in the car Kate. I'm going to go build this thing

1320
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
And by this thing

1321
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
Cement a box

1322
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
Build with products

1323
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,079
A new mom would need

1324
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
A box delivered right to your door

1325
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,455
She kept thinking about this idea during her leave

1326
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,271
Choked after she went back to her nine-to-five job

1327
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
Kate decided to start working on it

1328
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
At night

1329
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,391
After her baby went to sleep

1330
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,999
I would order various products then I would test them all

1331
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,583
Maternity pads creams protein bars herbal supplements

1332
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,423
He tried more than 400 products over the course of a year

1333
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
And eventually she settled I set of

1334
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
And items

1335
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,287
To go into her first boxes

1336
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
She said the friends and family and she asking for feedback

1337
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,199
And the one products are test mom's really like

1338
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Ice pack

1339
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,271
At the hospital they give you the

1340
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,367
Bags of ice and stick them in your underwear and say good luck

1341
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,207
So Kate found the perfect ice pack size and shape

1342
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,255
Some new moms could walk around

1343
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
But there was some women to told her you know this ice pack

1344
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
Rate

1345
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
I ended up with a C-section

1346
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,727
And what I really needed was a heating pad to play some

1347
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
Belly

1348
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Or

1349
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,847
Some sort of oil for my scar in my incision line

1350
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
Shiki decided maybe I should

1351
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
Curator C-section recovery box

1352
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,599
She went on to put up a website and build a social media following on Facebook and Instagram

1353
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
Really viral 60% of moms

1354
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,207
Momsource across the internet

1355
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
So Mom started to talk about this box

1356
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,911
And in January of 2018 nearly two years after her frustrating Target run

1357
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
Kate sold her first box

1358
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,775
It was designed to look just like a present

1359
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:38,431
Pink and glossy and I thought you know let's put a handle on this box because it makes it feel like a

1360
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,735
Special arrival like a special trunk

1361
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
Filled with self care items

1362
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,111
Kate decided to jump

1363
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:52,511
Bully into this Venture so she quit her job launch the company and in her first year she sold almost

1364
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,911

Conspiracy theories seem to be everywhere

1377
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,239
But they're far from the modern problem

1380
