Glossier

21
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
The police have to show

22
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
A lot of people ask

23
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
How can we support

24
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
How I built this

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
And the best way to support what we do

26
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,640
Is by supporting your local public radio

27
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736
Cured NPR we're launching our annual fundraising campaign starting

28
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
So we flew to LA and we drove

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
During rush hour all the way down to this Lake Middle of Nowhere place

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
Empty there's a stray dog like roaming through it like tumbleweeds blow I mean I was like why don't we just go

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Call it this is most certainly not our guy but we went in and inside was this

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
64 jacked like Dad so excited

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Women's skincare would not believe

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272
Is how I built this

45
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,600
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
And the stories behind the movement

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Built

Andre Rison

00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Beauty blog

50
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
A brand that now shaking up the entire cosmetics

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Back in 2012

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Facebook page

53
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Billion dollars for Instagram

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,832
I remember we actually interview the Instagram founders

55
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Back when we

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
First launched the show

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
What made Instagram

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
A valuable proposition

59
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
What is the time

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Profitability

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Instagram

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Basically a

63
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
React

64
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Posted the photos

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,216
But we did have with 20 million users

66
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
M Facebook

67
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Saw in Instagram

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Self years before

69
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
You build a customer base first

70
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Figure out how to monetize

71
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
Business with those customers

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
This isn't

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Easy way

74
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Need to start a business you have to

75
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Create something

76
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Free that's compelling enough

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
People coming

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
After you introduce

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Product

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
And this is sort of the story

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Can I say sort of because

82
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Emily Weiss started her fashion and Beauty Bar

83
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
10

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Do it with the intention of one day creating her own cosmetics

85
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
But what happened was that blog

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Into the gloss

87
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
It blew up

88
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Hundreds of thousands of readers

89
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
Became obsessed with hearing about other women's

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Skincare routine

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
And so as the Blog crew

92
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Emily started to wonder

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,512
Could I actually create a cosmetic brand for my readers

94
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
In 2014

95
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
She found a single investor

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
She watched a small line of skincare and makeup

97
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
And today

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Just four years later

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Glossy a is valued at around

100
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Four hundred million dollars

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,944
If her customer base of millennial women is the

102
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Envy of the Cosmetics world

103
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
How did Emily Weiss

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
To disrupt

105
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
The first thing to know is

106
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
She didn't come out of nowhere

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
Emily's been walking lock since

108
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Age 15

109
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
What you talked your way into an internship at Ralph Lauren

110
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
And then

111
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Vogue where she ended up working

112
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
For several years

113
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
For quitting

114
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Focus

115
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Full-time

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
It's a Blog that inspires

117
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,039
Fierce passion among her readers and when I sat down with Emily for a live interview on

118
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
On stage

119
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Skirball Center for

120
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
The Performing Arts

121
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
And York

122
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
You could hear that passion

123
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Wow

124
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Think you got a lot of fancy Emily

125
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Amazing I wish I could do that everyday

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
I'm walking to your

127
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,407
Your living room and there's like a transaction

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Alright so

129
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
This is really it is actually very serious question

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Can we clear one thing up

131
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Is it is it glossy a

132
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Or glossier

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
Classy okay

134
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Do people do people sometimes ask you that question

135
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
All the time in France

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
We just want to be friends

137
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,983
Is glossier and you're like no

138
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Yeah

139
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Let's start Lister when you are kid right you Google up in Fairfield County Connecticut starts you a couple hour and a half from

140
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
New York City

141
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,039
Tell me what you were like as a little girl I was really

142
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,135
I mean I'm still really weird I'm into a wide variety of

143
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
So

144
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Love animals

145
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
I had almost every kind of pet

146
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Like a turtle

147
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
Pair of blue capped cordon bleu finches

148
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Ya like bread

149
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Guppies fancy

150
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,543
Detail Guppies and tried to sell them to a fish store

151
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Yeah

152
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Yeah

153
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
At the same time I was

154
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
Super into

155
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
I think

156
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
I think fundamentally storytelling

157
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,367
Like I was really interested always and I always have been in

158
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
The power of narrative

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,511
And storytelling and kind of imagining like complete worlds

160
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
Or like systems yeah I was definitely

161
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
You know very into makeup I used to make my own costumes like I was like so like butterfly costumes for Halloween

162
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
For sure

163
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
It's not even like

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
Action specifically or beauty specifically it's

165
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Again that like power

166
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Of

167
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Creation like you can create yourself through fashion and beauty and you can create different looks and you can

168
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Kind of

169
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Use them as tools

170
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
So I've always been really interested in kind of products are like crayons you know or closer

171
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Creative

172
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
So if if we were happen to a time machine and go back to high school

173
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Your high school

174
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
Urine and I always saw you there what was

175
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,015
Would people have identified with the time as Echo there's Emily why she's really into fashion like it and you would see this

176
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
High school students order Pinterest

177
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
You know

178
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Define

179
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Yes it but it wasn't good

180
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Like I wasn't I wasn't good at it

181
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
I was probably doing things way too young

182
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
Like I remember

183
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
Well I'll tell you one thing I did I went to my first day of middle school in a new

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
New school and new town

185
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
God bless my mommy

186
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Clewiston Jessica

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
And I was

188
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Really excited about wearing

189
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Those outfit

190
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
And so I wore thigh-high stockings

191
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
First day of six

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
With high heel loafers

193
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
And like a fool

194
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Kilt

195
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
And like a feather pen

196
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
In this like town where people were playing lacrosse

197
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
You know like so I never like who is

198
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
So

199
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Like many teenagers you were a babysitter

200
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
And you happen to do

201
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
A babysitting gig

202
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
For a family that

203
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Would eventually land you an internship

204
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
Ralph Lauren

205
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
How did that happen

206
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Story

207
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
I mean that is you know people often ask me

208
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
What amount of your successes

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Contributed to lock

210
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
I really believe in kind of grit

211
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
I mean I didn't make that up that's Angela Duckworth and her book

212
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Grit

213
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
A very good book Buy

214
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
That actually just was luck

215
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
I mean that there was nothing pretty about babysitting for your neighbor

216
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
And he happened to work around 4

217
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
That the dad was Ralph Lauren

218
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,431
But you were like 15 and how did the conversation come up you were just like

219
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,503
Oh my God I love you was a very brief conversation

220
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
Remember standing in their kitchen and at some point I don't know how long I've been

221
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
You know how many times I babysat for them

222
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
And at some point I

223
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
I asked her he said

224
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
I work at Ralph Lauren in New York City and

225
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Can I said

226
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
How can I work at Ralph Lauren in

227
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
New York City

228
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Instead of

229
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Beijinger kids

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
And they were lovely

231
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
They were really great and

232
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
He was a real sport to propose in 02

233
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,735
Ralph Lauren HR what did this is a long time ago I'm sure this was is illegal now given up his food

234
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
15

235
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
My interview with HR and I went through the process and I think they saw something there and I worked

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
But offer

237
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
For two summers and you were going to Ralph Lauren's

238
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
Headquarters on 650 Madison Avenue and was on Madison and 60th

239
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
There was a hot dog stand in front that I would

240
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
I was so excited about I'll never forget this I was so excited about getting these hot dogs and I was in New York City

241
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
This is what you do

242
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
They were like oh my God

243
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
What are you eating

244
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Timati fat

245
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
I remember like

246
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
I didn't know

247
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
And what do you what do you remember about

248
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,695
Like what it what did you what did you do there maybe you were 15

249
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,535
Sixteen-year-old whatever whatever they had to take a photo.

250
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
I was I was so happy

251
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
You can give me anything

252
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
I was scanning I was

253
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,471
Running errands I was I was the happiest intern you've ever seen

254
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
Did you ever did you ever meet Ralph oh yes

255
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
So I know I remember I was in a room

256
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,759
You know I was ability note-taker so I was sitting in the room the back in the corner in like

257
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
You know everyone was

258
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
I don't know meeting and I was taking notes

259
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
And Ralph

260
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Turned

261
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,975
Yeah I think I'd actually maybe she has had him at one point but

262
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
He has no man you know

263
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
And he goes and everyone just stops and you look Migos

264
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
What do you think

265
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Hahaha

266
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
I don't know what I said I don't remember I just remember like the whole thing

267
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Stop

268
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Things they were talking about something

269
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Yeah

270
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
So you did those two summers

271
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
As an intern at Ralph Lauren

272
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
And then

273
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
The temperature College you went here to NYU is

274
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Studied

275
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Studio art

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Once you moved here

277
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
You got another internship

278
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Vote Yes

279
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Ativo

280
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
A Teen Vogue

281
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
I know I mean

282
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
A lot of us have have an impression of what it might be like to work and you know it like a Conde Nast Fashion Magazine from Devil Wears

283
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Prada

284
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
The great film

285
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
It's a great feeling

286
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Is there any truth to that

287
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
I mean

288
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
So I was really fortunate because I had a great boss

289
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
So I was actually

290
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,575
At 8 or Teen Vogue as an intern at Vogue which was

291
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
The job that had before building this company

292
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Sure

293
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
And I was there I think it's all about it's kind of like anywhere all depends who your boss is

294
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Like doesn't matter what company you're at it's like

295
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Isn't there that

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,287
I just heard from someone that your personality is the result of the like three or five people who you spend the most time with

297
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,431
Do you know if you work with great smart talented people which I was very fortunate to do then you learn a lot

298
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
When you were

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
When you are an intern Teen Vogue and you got your purse

300
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Chabot College

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Adverb

302
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Did you envision that your career would be as a fashion writer or a fashion editor is that what you thought of this is what I'm going to

303
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,071
I do with my life yes I mean you know my dream was to be an Editor in Chief

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
So at the time you don't like in my early twenties

305
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
That was you know I looked at

306
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Someone like Anna Wintour and that was incredibly inspiring

307
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
How did you guess

308
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
At some point you were able to

309
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Right

310
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
For Vogue you were able to write

311
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
An article

312
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,111
Which was about

313
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
So I didn't turned in

314
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
I was always working in fashion

315
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
And beauty is kind of like this

316
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Ugly stepsister to Fashion in in magazines and in media it's really funny because all of the

317
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Revenue rose a lot of income

318
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Songs from Beauty and these magazines

319
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
You think about it like

320
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
Treating an issue of a fashion magazine

321
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
Beauty can sometimes at least

322
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
You know and years ago be like

323
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Five or six

324
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
10 pages no there such little airtime

325
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Dedicated to you know this

326
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
The topic that in many ways you're like

327
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,951
Forced to deal with on a more fundamental level everyday than even what you're wearing right it's like

328
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Personal hygiene

329
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
So I never worked

330
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,119
Covered that's like I enjoyed talking about

331
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
People but

332
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
I'm not even someone who's wearing who's like

333
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
Fast with you teanaway if you Define obsessed as being you know wearing a ton of makeup

334
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Or

335
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
I'm spending like lots of time I don't know

336
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Getting facials like

337
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Found out that was not me

338
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
But I was on a shoe

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
In Miami Florida

340
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,903
This is like 2010 this was 2010

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,999
And I was on the shooting Miami Florida with Doutzen

342
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
Krause I don't know if I'm saying her name right was them is the model

343
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
We were in a trailer

344
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Which is often the case you're in this like you know RV in

345
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
At some point the model Doutzen she said

346
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
She start talking about

347
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,943
Amazing self tanner that she loved and I don't even think I've ever use a self-tanner and she was like all the other ones really crazy but when you

348
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,295
Use this when you exfoliate this way and then you put it on it's like air foam and doesn't smell it

349
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
You know all these things

350
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Pittsburgh until 10 or 2 change my life

351
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,023
So I remembered it I got it from the CVS in my in Wilton where it where I was for the summer

352
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
It was great

353
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
I mean it was really a great experience this this self tanner

354
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
So

355
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
I wanted to write about

356
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
Like I was like someone else needs to know like I heard it because Doutzen told me which is a super crazy

357
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Baby situation that no one else is going to be in

358
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,271
And I need like my civic duty is to like share this with the world

359
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
So I went to the

360
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Beauty editor of Vogue

361
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
Who is the Fulton theater and I hadn't met her

362
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,999
Yoshida's Legend Sarah Brown

363
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
And

364
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
And I was like excuse me you know I

365
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
I have an article I'd like

366
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
If I can write for vogue.com but I think I would love to

367
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,263
Just admit it to you and if you like it you can publish it if you don't like whatever I just have to like

368
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Calphalon

369
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
And she said yes and I and I wrote this article is like

370
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Little

371
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
Little article about the self tanner and she published

372
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
And so that was where I actually caught the bug where I was like

373
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
I remember I had so much fun writing this post

374
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
I'm sure you can find in Google it it's what I don't even know it might be terrible but

375
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
I am such a cathartic moment

376
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
To have this conversation around a product

377
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
That I never really felt around like a shirt

378
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,007
I mean I want it's like we're cool shirt and look nice and

379
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
A picture but I didn't feel the urge to

380
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
To be like

381
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Is anyone else out there wearing this shirt

382
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Like can we talk about how great it is

383
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,831
It is a didn't get that buck and it was just a few weeks or months later when you actually

384
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Decided Solange

385
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
Your block we should become famous into the gloss

386
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Is that

387
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Why you did it

388
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
I need to

389
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
To figure this out

390
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
To more of this

391
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
I mean your this was the era of

392
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Personal style blogs it was like when all the like bloggers were starting and it was kind of this new thing

393
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
Not monetizing but like really individual

394
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
Like these early human beings and how they actually put

395
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
These things together

396
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
Supposed

397
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
Very tightly held images from fashion brands our campaigns it was like this is what's actually going on literally

398
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
On the street

399
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
With fashion

400
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
And I remember thinking we'll why does this exist for beauty

401
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,399
Like why is there no like in-depth exploration of people's Beauty

402
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
Identities in Lake Beauty stories and there's really no where to find me

403
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
Cheerleaders blogs that existed long before it's the glass around

404
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,663
Typically much more about kind of like what's new

405
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Like it would be like

406
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,783
This new mascara from you know XYZ brand just hit the market

407
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
It's so great because of all of these things

408
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Yet I off in Salt Lake

409
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,743
It's not necessarily what's new that I'm most interested in is what's that

410
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
And this idea of what's Best in Beauty

411
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Because it's

412
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
There's no single what's best

413
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
Yeah like I might love a

414
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
Matte lipstick and say it's five out of five stars

415
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
But you might love

416
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Shiny lipstick and be like this lipsticks dry

417
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
AF

418
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
I don't want it

419
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,455
0 out of 5

420
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
So how did you actually

421
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
How did you actually

422
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Launch this

423
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
I mean did you was its source of as simple as like going to

424
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:40,095
Are WordPress or whatever blog in a hosting aside and then setting it up so I'm not very technical

425
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
So WordPress is

426
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,215
What hosted the first blog and I had a really amazing

427
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,871
Set of collaborators who I don't want

428
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,455
Interview I've said like 900 or 700 or like 8:50 but

429
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Under a thousand thousand dollars

430
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Solange

431
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,647
The website part was not expensive the money literally was just for the camera

432
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
To buy cameras you knew you were going to take photos Canon DSLR has great little camera

433
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
What was the what was the vision of it

434
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Edit Eminem shirt evolve but when you when you went to like

435
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
Your parents are

436
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Your friends you said

437
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
I want to start

438
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
What is blog

439
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,871
It's going to do what that's going to give a voice through Beauty give people a voice through Beauty

440
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
What was the first post about

441
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
Bruce post was a publicist you worked at a fashion PR firm called Nikki Dean and I thought

442
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
She had like really cool hair and great

443
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Sort of like styling

444
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Australian kind of

445
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,583
And I I just interviewed her and I took a picture I was asked her about like her hole

446
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Hair beauty makeup the whole thing and

447
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
The very

448
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Very short they progressively gotten much longer

449
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
And it was a pic

450
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
Picture of her and that was it and we were Off to the Races

451
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Picture saying you are at that point

452
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Emily Weiss

453
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Young woman

454
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
In the world

455
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
You don't have a giant network of

456
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
People

457
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
You don't have a whole lot of money and access to

458
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Media platform

459
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Adding people even know about it

460
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah so I mean listen I definitely was in a great

461
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Position to attract you know key

462
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
People to beef

463
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,495
Turn on the block now whether or not they said yes I want to take an hour out of my day to go be featured on

464
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Unknown website

465
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
With unknown reporter

466
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
Was a different question but I was sitting on you know the floor photoshoots with like a fifteen-year-old Carly

467
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,831
Clocks like tying her shoes now she's like you know a supermodel whose

468
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,463
Instagram followers

469
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,047
We're all kind of place where time together be like hey can I like you know

470
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
Take a picture of my new blog and I had enough Goodwill in sort of that

471
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
A lot of people said no I mean literally like 80% of the people I would ask but I think once I turn featuring

472
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,383
If you have a couple people than different media sites start to email hyperlink

473
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Ensayo today

474
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:06,271
There's a profile on you know Karlie Kloss on this blog called into the gloss

475
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,879
And you would basically feature a different person

476
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,999
And their regiment

477
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,071
Clear it was very clear and I think

478
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,679
I've always focused a lot on good design like my personal flask

479
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,287
Don't put things out into the world don't like make work that isn't really great

480
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
It should be time well spent

481
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
Don't don't waste people's look like

482
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Fat content

483
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
So

484
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,295
The fascinating about into the loss of some of our most popular features like

485
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
They're not celebrity

486
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
You know like we're in this celebrity culture and we

487
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
We

488
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Pure how much

489
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
You know influence influencers have

490
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
And yet like

491
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
If we all really take a moment to think about like

492
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,399
Who's the last person who told us where to eat or like

493
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
You like their outfit and

494
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
You know you sites like

495
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
They're probably not the biggest celebrities

496
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Probably someone who

497
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
A friend from college

498
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
The following Instagram or

499
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
You know someone you work with

500
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
And I think that democratization of

501
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
Expertise and the democratization of influence

502
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Just like the power of the

503
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Individual to influence

504
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Another individual

505
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Is something

506
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
That's fascinating in part of the reason I think why into the gloss really resonated

507
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
You are doing this to put this in context

508
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
You eat a full-time job at Vogue

509
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
This is your side hustle you were like nights and weekends

510
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
4 a.m. to 8 a.m.

511
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,712
Uninstall Abbas like transcribing the or posting or editing

512
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,296
And then on the weekends I would do all the shoot so in the interviews

513
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
So I booked the interviews and shooting each one I mean I spend

514
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
I had I had your job

515
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,560
I love interview people so I would sit on people's floors and their bathrooms on there like closed toilet seat lids

516
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
You know with my tape recorder out

517
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,680
Yeah and it's amazing because

518
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,312
It's so hard for women to be the right level of Maine

519
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
If you're too low maintenance

520
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:13,248
Then you're lazy doing enough

521
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,904
And yet if you're wearing a lot of makeup or your like looks like you really care about you know beauty or appearance than your scene

522
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Sort of frivolous or like not to be taken series

523
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
So

524
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
The kind of intricacies

525
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
Beauty as like a

526
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
Even just like a anthropological tool

527
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,032
Is really really really fascinating to to me

528
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm wondering like at what point after you launch

529
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
The glass did you start

530
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
I realize that

531
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
It was more than just

532
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
You know

533
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,112
Some friends are a couple dozen people or couple thousand people but like

534
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Enzo

535
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Thousands

536
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
Pretty soon after lanzhou it it's

537
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
You know it was it was a slow build but within

538
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Within the first

539
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
Year it was such that

540
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
You know

541
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
I I had gone to my first

542
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:10,336
Brandon had my first media partner with Lancome advertising is cash money

543
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Letting was lanco

544
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
Yes it was what it was wrong, and was it enough money this

545
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
No no it was $5,000

546
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
And

547
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
You know this was more money than I'd ever

548
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
Had in my light like ever had in my bank account

549
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
I think it was two and a half years

550
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Before

551
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
You know after you launched into the gloss you are

552
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Still with Vogue for 1 year

553
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
When your 12 months because at that point you know we had enough

554
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
You know it's funny because people I say well how did you and this is one of the key questions for entrepreneurs right like when do you quit your day job

555
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
How did you know when to quit

556
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
VO2 gopher

557
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,248
Full-time hustle for personal decision based on a ton of different

558
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Strap for any any entrepreneur

559
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
For me it was really just one decision to make

560
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Which was

561
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
I have to pick one

562
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,536
This is taking too much time and there's too much momentum

563
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
It's impossible to continue to deliver the

564
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Products that people want like people readers wanted

565
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
The point of a really

566
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,824
Big Community was really wanting

567
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
But I felt like I really

568
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
There was really no choice

569
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
It's not even just follow your God it's like

570
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,480
Follow something that is

571
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
Is really working is really delivering like

572
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Ghettout changing things and once you knew that

573
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
You knew it was time

574
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
Time to throw everything into that

575
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
I would have thought that

576
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
That at that point

577
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
You know into the gloss was you were going to use her thinking about this as a media proper

578
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
Pretty right like

579
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
This is a Blog

580
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:46,080
Maybe you would spin it out into a podcast or a video show or something else like a deal with cable t

581
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
TV

582
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
But that's not what happened you did you decided to

583
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Create a

584
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
A product

585
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Was that

586
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Again like was that

587
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Something that just

588
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
Just kind of happened on its own or was it really

589
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Deliberative

590
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
Hip hop through thing

591
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Yasso the

592
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
It's a really good question and

593
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
Things to sing that has

594
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Lead to every decision that I've made

595
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
It is this very Central thesis

596
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848
That you can create conversations and connections through Beauty

597
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
Into the gloss was the first

598
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Burden of

599
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,528
Like that was the first step it was a necessary

600
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Beginning

601
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
That showed a certain behavioral shift

602
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
You know it was like encourage people to

603
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
Just be like oh okay I'm sharing now what goes on in my bathroom

604
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
You know that I used to do totally alone

605
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
And in doing your in and working on into the boss

606
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
The first year

607
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
I was exposed to all of you beauty

608
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
So I was working

609
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
She was long gone

610
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,872
I was working with Estee Lauder I was working with Cody I was working with you know every big conglomerate

611
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Beauty is a

612
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
Huge industries

613
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,736
The 450 billion dollar Global Market

614
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
It's going to be 750 billion in 6 years

615
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
And why is that

616
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Because of social media

617
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,512
Because of sharing because of the ability to have conversation that beauty is now something that is not just

618
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Tightly held in the hands of

619
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Sales people at you Noah counter

620
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
It was the last time any of you have like

621
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Really relied on that

622
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
Yeah 50% of people who go into a Sephora

623
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
Take out their iPhone

624
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,944
You're Googling your texting your friend I'm in Sephora should I do what was that thing you told me about

625
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
You know

626
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,040
That's how things work and what's interesting is these companies

627
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,416
I was hearing in these interviews from from women as I was sitting on the you know on the bathroom floor

628
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
I was hearing this like disconnect

629
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
That would have been answered if you tea brands

630
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
Just listen

631
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
Like if the actual Beauty Brands were listening to

632
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
Well first off they knew who you were

633
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Which they don't think

634
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Because their client

635
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
What is the retailer

636
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Judy Bradfield products

637
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
Can clients for the needs of you know Macy's end

638
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
Sephora and Ulta in

639
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
CVS in those are shelf space needs

640
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Seasonality

641
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Margin needs and

642
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
And all of these different needs

643
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
That have nothing to do with you

644
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
As a customer

645
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
So that results in this

646
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:15,328
Kind of subpar like product Experian the kind of brand relationship

647
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
There's not really this like personal like

648
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
You get me

649
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Relationship

650
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,008
And that was what led to the creation of glassy-eyed

651
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Because

652
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
All of every Beauty brand that I've ever known

653
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
Is been built top down

654
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,480
And the idea for glasses what would happen if you could build a beauty brand bottoms

655
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
You could ask a question like

656
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:38,112
Who makes your dream face wash and get a thousand responses

657
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
Who played your face watching a movie

658
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
And have them say Eddie Redmayne

659
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Like

660
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
Yeah

661
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
So so that was where did you flossing came from was you know this is the next

662
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
FaZe

663
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:54,752
Like this is the next way that we can bring together this mission of of giving voice their beauty

664
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,056
Weren't you

665
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
Didn't anybody say to you

666
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,944
Do you really think you can take on yuno L'Oreal

667
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Estee Lauder in

668
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Revlon even know the name of the biggest

669
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Huge

670
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
Enormous multinationals like

671
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Did anybody say

672
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
You know

673
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
Despise not going to work

674
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Oh yeah

675
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
For sure

676
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
I mean

677
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Literally all the odds are against

678
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,984
Mosquito RR

679
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
You know a lot of it I mean for 1

680
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
You know

681
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
4% of venture capital

682
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Deals last year went to female CEOs

683
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
So far out of a hundred deals when to win

684
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
So already

685
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
It's like well how am I going to find this

686
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Because

687
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Like

688
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
No one's going to give me money for this

689
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
You needed money Avi

690
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Create

691
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,888
A product for sure yeah a number in your head of what you needed to start in fact I do

692
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,192
And it was based on precisely nothing

693
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
Hahaha

694
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,800
I was like it is going to take $1000000

695
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,408
That's what you said I was like I bet you

696
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,760
I need $1000000 to make this happen

697
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Let me come back

698
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Just a moment

699
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
How Emily got her million dollars

700
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952

00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Chemist in the middle of nowhere

And a new tribe of customers

703
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Just about everywhere

704
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Stay with us

705
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
I'm gyros near listening to how I built this

706
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
From NPR

707
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
Support for this podcast comes from America

708
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
Pekin Express

709
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Tracy Chapman

710
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Is vice president of

711
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Global

712
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Experiential marketing

713
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Team created

714
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Amex business loan

715
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Chaotic trade shows

716
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
Is Tracy on how the lounge's of adapted

717
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
V cast

718
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Mermaids

719
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
When we first came up with the idea for

720
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,816
Business lounges we filled the lounge with laptops

721
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
And with printer

722
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,448
We found was the people weren't really turning on the laptops and they weren't using our printer

723
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
They were sitting down and they wanted up

724
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Place to call their kids

725
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
That really helped us evolve what we were

726
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
We're doing

727
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
We need a lot

728
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Airsoft seating we need

729
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Quiet areas

730
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
Sound we were able to recognize these

731
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
People is more than just business owners

732
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,880
When customers are using our lounges we hope that they walk away understanding

733
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
What it means to be an American

734
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Express customer

735
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:26,048
It means that everything that we do accounts for the human behind the job

736
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Not just a job that you're there to do

737
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
To learn more about how America

738
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912

American Express.

742
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Cam

743
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
You business

744
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Hey welcome back

745
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
How I built this

746
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Text from NPR

747
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
So it's 2013

748
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
And Emily Weiss

749
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Has decided

750
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,832
To make her own beauty products

751
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
If you think she'll need about a million dollars

752
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Make it happen

753
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
How did you know how did you know where to start I mean

754
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
You're in the New York Fashion World obviously

755
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
Successful blog but like

756
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
A lot of that is Silicon Valley itself

757
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Sea money is out there in that

758
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Whole world

759
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
How did you

760
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
Nowhere start over so I was like what is Visa

761
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
T-Money

762
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
Like what is VC

763
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
Like what is it like a venture capital what is that

764
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
I mean let's not forget I went to Art School

765
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,368
I did not go to Business School

766
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
Did not I did not work at a

767
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Tech company

768
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
And by the way a lot of founders

769
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Fast growth venture-backed companies

770
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
Work

771
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Astrocenter bags

772
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Right

773
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
So as an outsider

774
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
Really hard to start

775
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Very intimidating

776
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
Better get back to that Tower of

777
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Grit

778
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
I just kind of plowed through on this

779
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
You know exploration like I think my

780
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
Personal superpower if there's like one thing that I think

781
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
Is I'm really good at I'm super curious

782
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,976
And so I I kind of made a list frankly it wasn't even just about raising money I remember

783
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Having a whiteboard

784
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Like what are all the steps

785
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
It's going to take

786
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
Did it to build this company

787
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
And I wrote you a fee seemed like raise money

788
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
Build website find chemist

789
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
You know

790
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,080
Make logo

791
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,200
You know she's like what are all the ingredients that is

792
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Taken of course

793
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
You don't know until you find out

794
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
From one conversation what the other ingredient is you're missing in

795
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Just you just have to

796
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
Start to start somewhere so

797
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
You know the money needing to get raise happen pretty early in

798
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,072
Process what was your like elevator pitch to BC's they

799
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
So you go in and they tell k

800
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Next yeah

801
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,704
My pitch to feces in the beginning was

802
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
You know

803
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
We have this great community

804
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,872
We understand you know Beauty and people in stories we have this robust community

805
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
2 We Believe

806
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Deserve a better

807
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,808
A better Brands like a brand that that really hears and understands them and

808
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,368
And there's a lot of room in the market because

809
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
The huge huge industry

810
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Really ripe for disruption

811
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
There weren't very many Direct

812
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Consumer brands

813
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
The time now you have you know

814
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Colourpop and Kylie and

815
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
Kim Kardashian

816
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Aldi's differ

817
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
That hadn't happened

818
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,104
I rather that you pitched a no 13 or 14

819
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Vici

820
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Companies

821
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
And mostly men

822
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
And only one

823
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Eventually agreed

824
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
To give you that initial

825
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
Funding it was

826
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
The

827
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,464
DC was a woman Christian green

828
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
6% of venture capitalist

829
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Are women

830
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
And hopefully that will go up

831
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
So

832
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,240
Listen we have incredible partners

833
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
I think

834
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
You know initially

835
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
So much of

836
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,432
Funding is around pattern recognition

837
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
And so you have

838
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,088
Venture Capital whose job it is to make smart bats on companies that are going to grow

839
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Super super

840
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Fasting and become the next

841
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,560
And so it's hard to I think look at like a female CEO who does not have business

842
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
Business school degree

843
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,168
And and sort of say we're going to take the bat and it felt

844
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
You know it's exhausting

845
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
And I think

846
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
I know a lot of entrepreneurs

847
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
I think it's hard for everyone

848
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Is it was

849
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
It was exhausting to go and we would hand

850
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,736
RR Co and I we would hand our products you never little

851
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
LOL goodie bag

852
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
And end in bring them to different

853
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Rooms full of

854
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Guys and

855
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,488
Get the bag and say oh that's so nice thank you I'm going to give it to my wife and

856
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
You ask her what she say

857
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
And I would say to myself

858
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:50,496
If you don't some like Financial technology company came to me and pitched me I wouldn't be like

859
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Ask my husband

860
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,080
Explain this to me

861
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,968
Yeah I would like learn about it I would like to like show me your product let me understand this let me put it on the back of

862
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
My hand

863
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
Can you tell me about like how people use it

864
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
This product

865
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:09,696
And the best people did do that and we have seen a handful of really amazing adventure capitalist we 254

866
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
Percent female board in our first investor

867
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Kirsten

868
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
I spent a lot of time with

869
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,608
And she was the she was at

870
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
That one

871
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
She believed in this idea she wrote you that check

872
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
Do you know

873
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Why

874
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
She decided to take the

875
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Take the risk

876
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
It has a really

877
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Got

878
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
And dated back to Knox

879
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,248
Identifying consumer product

880
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
She invested in Warby Parker she invested in bonobos

881
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,208
She invested most recently in a way so she she's got good in

882
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
She is really doing things the right way around

883
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
Around around what are people going to care about what they want to live with

884
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
You don't like what are they

885
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
What

886
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
People I mean this is a really emotional

887
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Category

888
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
Beauty you know again there's no like single truth

889
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Right

890
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
So it's really just about like opinion and preference and and so many

891
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Other ingredients

892
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
Alright so you got this A Million by

893
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Raised raised

894
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,880
Too well because you can't spend everything that you let you know

895
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
And so

896
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
How do you start a makeup

897
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,768
Company like where do you go like what do you call up and what do you say like

898
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
Can you make me this make up a little bit there's chemistry

899
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
Like how do you need

900
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,192
How do you make makeup I mean you know

901
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
Let me tell you how I built this

902
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
So okay

903
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
So my first hire

904
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
So first of all always higher

905
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
For your weaknesses

906
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
Write an end and surround yourself with

907
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Just the most

908
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
Brilliant people you can ever convince

909
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Succumb

910
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
Work on the shared Vision that you have

911
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
And my first tire was an incredible

912
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,816
Director product development who had over a decade of experience at MAC cosmetics

913
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
That was my first hire

914
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Because I've never made

915
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:59,008
Make a product and I don't know how it works or vendors or how long things take like I've no idea

916
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
And

917
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,848
I remember she ended up getting a recommendation for a chemist

918
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
Best from someone who can use me beauty industry

919
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Who was based outside of LA

920
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,784
So we flew to La we got our like Hertz rental car

921
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
And we drove during rush hour all the way down to this like

922
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Middle of nowhere place

923
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,232
And we pulled into the parking lot the parking lot empty there's like

924
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,584
A stray dog like roaming through it like tumbleweeds blow I mean you know is very

925
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
It did not look like this was going to be Arquette

926
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
There's this little mirrored building

927
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
It was literally like mirrors

928
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
So you couldn't see entire mean

929
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,616
I was like why don't we just go this is most certainly not our guy

930
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
But we went in

931
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,760
And I am so glad we did because inside was this like

932
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Six four

933
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Jack

934
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Like Dad

935
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
2

936
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Like it like that

937
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Who's like

938
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,792
Building game changing skin care products for some of like the biggest

939
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
Brands that you

940
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,376
You guys are literally sitting here wearing products

941
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
That he's created

942
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,728
Is so excited about women's skincare

943
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Like you just

944
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Would not believe

945
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,896
And and that became our kindness and he's actually developed like

946
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,016
I don't know almost all of our skin care products

947
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
This Centura want it like

948
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
How do you

949
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,744
Tell him what you want yeah it's it's really a huge collaboration I'm trying to think of like what I can do

950
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
Wait at you maybe like the relationship between you and liquor Ark

951
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
Like if you're building a house

952
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,960
It depends cuz there's lots of like each of us would have a different relation

953
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
It was an architect like one of us might go to them knowing

954
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
Exactly what we want with exactly the ingredients

955
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Exact approach to

956
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Inability and

957
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Exact budget in like maybe

958
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Super involved in other ones of us

959
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
Maybe like I kind of want like a white

960
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
House Tyrell

961
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Nnc

962
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Where we were is we were more in the

963
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Former camp

964
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
And so

965
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
We came inside

966
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,536
We have these four products we want them to do these things

967
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
We want them to you know

968
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,960
Have these ingredients and not have these ingredients and we want the price to be this and so we have to figure out like how to

969
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Find the most amazing you know ingredients

970
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
And it's really just a back-and-forth and we would spend

971
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
You know an average maybe like

972
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Two or three months or four months

973
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
Just shipping samples back and forth to each other

974
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,296
But a lot of it was just nerding out in the lab

975
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Yeah wait a little room

976
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
Full of ingredients like Rama.

977
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
Cereal is what they're called so

978
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
Literally like they'll be like a vat of like

979
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
Cubicle butter from like

980
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,328
You know the Amazonian rainforest

981
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:36,448
Just sitting there like that's like part one of the things you see listed on the back of your you know whatever will

982
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
In bulk

983
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Sitting in a

984
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Thanks

985
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
So he would say like

986
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
Undo a giardia

987
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Elvis you know her

988
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,456
About a thing and put it on your hand and say sleeping in a Chef's Kitchen

989
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
And so it really is all about that personal relationship that you have in your ability to work with someone your ability like real

990
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Each other

991
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
That is led to some of the most amazing innovation

992
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
It it seems like baked into

993
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
The business model from the beginning was this

994
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Very

995
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
Deliberate idea that you were not going to

996
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Add your product into CVS

997
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Or Sephora or

998
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
At

999
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
Bloomingdale's or lordandtaylor wherever

1000
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,128
Bet that this was going to be direct-to-consumer

1001
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Why

1002
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
Why wouldn't you

1003
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
You know

1004
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
Make it available at

1005
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Other places

1006
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
Because we can build better product by having a direct relation

1007
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
2

1008
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Every person

1009
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
We don't have to make

1010
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Decisions

1011
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
For anyone other than the end-user

1012
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Play. So first of all that alleviates

1013
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
The tan of

1014
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Things that don't

1015
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,288
Things that don't matter to you holding something and enjoying it

1016
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
It also enables us to like ask

1017
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Ask you questions

1018
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,920
It enables us to like send you like questionnaires

1019
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Have you been happy with

1020
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
Do you like what you got you know how would you improve it

1021
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
What should we make later

1022
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,392
It allows us to create platforms that connect

1023
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,256
Our customers with each other to talk about in a shared experiences around UT so

1024
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
You know we've put

1025
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,168
A thousand of our top customers in a slack Channel who exchanged over 10,000 messages a week

1026
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,752
Yeah I mean it's interesting because I was talking to

1027
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Disabled people about

1028
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
And

1029
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Yo it's

1030
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Many people

1031
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Many women will go into us

1032
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
Sephora and try stuff on and with

1033
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,088
The question is how do you know what this is going to look like and

1034
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
What's amazing is that you can

1035
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
You can just go on YouTube and type in

1036
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
You know

1037
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,024
Classy a this exactly

1038
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
And you will find

1039
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Dozens and dozens of videos

1040
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
I'm from women with d

1041
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Skin tones and shades

1042
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
And you can almost see what it

1043
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
It looks absolutely it's almost like you

1044
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:54,175
The most companies start with a brand and then build a customer base you had a customer base

1045
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
And then you introduce your brand

1046
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
Yeah although you know our customer base now is

1047
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
Is much wider than your readers event

1048
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,767
For sure but I think what you just described is again this kind of like shift of

1049
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,071
And it's not about again

1050
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:16,959
The influencer being this 2 million follower Freeman follower million follower thing it's the ability for your

1051
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,823
Feedback on boy brow like that can be our customers video right like that

1052
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
It's like this is how I

1053
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,431
Use this in this is how it works for me and

1054
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
You going to ours

1055
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
What stores we have to

1056
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Flagship

1057
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
It's one in New York in

1058
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
101 in LA

1059
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
That is what is happening in there

1060
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,135
I mean

1061
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,695
Women are waiting in line down the block

1062
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:44,351
Meeting the person in front of them the person behind them talking about whether or not they use glassy before I like what they like what they don't like

1063
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Weather from

1064
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
Do they need a roommate like suddenly they like work

1065
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,031
Together like he doesn't like lifelong relationships that are being formed

1066
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,175
And then you go upstairs and people are up there for like an hour and a half and they're talking to each other in the mirror saying what color is that in

1067
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,223
They're barely even talking to the people who work

1068
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
You know work

1069
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,855
What about 4 for women who don't who don't have access to those stores in the makeup is so cheap

1070
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
Personal thing

1071
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,951
I mean most of your customers are buying

1072
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
The products without trying them on first

1073
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
So how did you know that

1074
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,351
People were going to be willing to take that lie

1075
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,935
Waking part of it is by having a product philosophy

1076
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Sofia approach

1077
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
Two content that

1078
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
Facilitate

1079
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Is that leap of faith

1080
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,127
What do you mean well I mean if we had you know a super high coverage Foundation

1081
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Product

1082
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Then that would require us to make

1083
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,735
You know 50 shades

1084
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,783
Or something or 55 shades

1085
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Is there something like that

1086
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
Which would be almost like impossible to sell online

1087
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:43,231
I would have a really hard time like shade matching myself if there were Fifty Shades of

1088
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Something like I would not know how to do that

1089
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
But we can do is create

1090
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,679
You know a product like boy brow that's super intuitive

1091
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,263
It's super easy to use that doesn't deposit too much that

1092
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,127
You know is sheer enough that it can span a wide range of eyebrow hair colors

1093
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
You know this is something that

1094
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
Facilitates that

1095
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Participation

1096
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
You launched this company

1097
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
In 2014

1098
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
4 years on crystal how many

1099
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Employees do not have

1100
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:17,279
Oh we have some changes every week cuz we have like five people starting week even this Monday

1101
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,863
Now we're I think a hundred and eighty-six employees

1102
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,215
At 150 showroom editors I think since that

1103
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
First million or two million

1104
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,639
NC funding you've raced more than 80 million the company is now valued

1105
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
Add more than 300 million Navy close to

1106
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
400 million-dollar

1107
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
4 years

1108
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
That's crazy

1109
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
I have to imagine

1110
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,559
Set the big Cosmetics companies

1111
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
The L'Oreal

1112
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Estee lauder's

1113
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,983
Are really paying attention to what you're doing and really want to buy

1114
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
By this company they really want to own this brand I mean

1115
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,895
You know you can go down the list Bobby Brown and and

1116
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
You know some of these other

1117
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
Iconic brands at work

1118
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
Purchased by the larger

1119
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Brands

1120
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
What happens if and when they approach you maybe they already have

1121
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
So

1122
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
The company is that I'm most

1123
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,583
Admire are companies that create

1124
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,351
Conic

1125
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
Products

1126
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
That really stand the test

1127
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
The time

1128
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
The other thing that I think a lot about is our mission

1129
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
So I think about

1130
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
How else can we connect people through through Beauty how else can we help people sit up a little taller feel better

1131
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
How to solve

1132
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
True beauty

1133
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,295
We have a really long way to go

1134
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
In in terms of

1135
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Actualizing the vision

1136
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,183
In fact I think about where we are today as

1137
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Truly just the beginning

1138
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,767
Like being 4 years in for me

1139
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
I wake up everyday I

1140
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Think it's day one

1141
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
And

1142
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,423
Typically when you sell to a larger conglomerate

1143
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
It's because

1144
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
You need more District

1145
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Fusion

1146
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
Because

1147
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
Is the benefit of having

1148
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,615
You know being a Loreal and Estee Lauder company

1149
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,199
Like that that they have this vast network of every dealers

1150
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
Macy's

1151
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
And you don't need that

1152
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
We don't need that

1153
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,599
We create you know our own channel

1154
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Through our digital

1155
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Platform through glossier.com

1156
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,023
And one of the things that were most fascinated by right now

1157
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,351
Is the fact that this beauty shopping experience the

1158
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
This experience of walking into a store and yet wanting to be connected to someone who you pick and then wanting to find it

1159
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Information

1160
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,127
Through a person that you relate to or that you are inspired by or choose

1161
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
There's really nowhere to do that online

1162
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,247
Like you can go on YouTube but it's really like look

1163
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Space

1164
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,855
It's really about kind of like I want to do a cat eye or I want to do

1165
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
A unicorn

1166
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,951
Halloween makeup or something like that

1167
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,047
But in terms of finding that individual story for beauty

1168
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
It's really really tough Somme

1169
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
We actually just hired

1170
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
The person who

1171
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Built

1172
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Idioms and

1173
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Camera Instagram

1174
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
And then we also made another higher of the guy who was Employee nine Instagram who's an amazing product designer digital product is

1175
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
Desiigner because we're spending a lot of time thinking

1176
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,503
About how to create that digital

1177
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,551
Platform that channel

1178
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,367
Because you've already built these tools right but like where is the

1179
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,671
Place where people can come together

1180
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
To talk about beauty

1181
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
T22 to share what they

1182
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Learn from glossier and

1183
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
All the other brands and products that you know they use and talk about how can they find each other like they could do it our at our flagship

1184
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,007
I have to imagine with a big house medics

1185
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Companies are looking at your

1186
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Customer base

1187
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
Very young

1188
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
Multiracial

1189
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
Super coveted

1190
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
Demographic that you've got

1191
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
Hard to recreate right cuz there's a

1192
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,647
Antissa T2 what you do and there's a risk of inauthenticity when you try to manufacture

1193
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:01,023
Are you watching your competitors as well do you keep an eye on what they're doing

1194
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
Well it's interesting because

1195
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Beauty is not that

1196
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,191
Competitive in my mind because

1197
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,591
How many different brands are we all using everyday like how many different lip products do I have in my purse right now you don't want to know

1198
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,431
From like all all different brands like a different

1199
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
Lip balms and lip glosses and lipsticks

1200
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,807
And I'm not interested in like consolidating that

1201
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,671
That is like not a realistic

1202
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
Expectation

1203
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
Of any of us

1204
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,327
Like no single Branch can make every in meet you know all of your needs and it comes to

1205
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
The beauty at least in my mind

1206
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
So for us it's just about how can we be a

1207
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,495
Part of this of this conversation

1208
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,871
How can you be a part of facilitate the conversation happened

1209
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
When you when you think about an end

1210
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Actually answer this earlier but

1211
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
When you think about the Arc of your career and your

1212
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
Still so young and you have so much

1213
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,695
To do ahead of you may build two or three more company

1214
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Who knows

1215
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
How much of wood

1216
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
What's happened to you and what you've accomplished

1217
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Do you attribute

1218
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
2

1219
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
Your

1220
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,679
Persistence hard work grit and how much to

1221
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
Two till two lucky breaks

1222
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
I think

1223
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
I definitely believe in luck

1224
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
But I don't

1225
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Rely on luck

1226
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,943
And I don't attribute lock to

1227
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:27,039
Where I am today I really believe that it

1228
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Is

1229
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
A combination of

1230
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,415
This passion in this perseverance

1231
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
And

1232
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
Probably a little bit of

1233
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
Having a very short memory

1234
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,839
I think it's such a gift

1235
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
I just keep going

1236
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
I think when you fall or when

1237
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
Someone says no or when

1238
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,263
I'm something you try something and it doesn't work

1239
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
The ability to just

1240
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Continue

1241
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Might just pick up

1242
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,479
There's a resiliency right like there's that's really what I hear the regret that's what it says to me is there is a resiliency to just

1243
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
To just brush shake it off right and then keep going

1244
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Just One Last Cry

1245
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
Question for you

1246
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
If you were sitting in this idea

1247
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
10 years

1248
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
And you're watching somebody like

1249
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
IQ

1250
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
And you had a dream or idea in your head

1251
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,655
What what would you have wanted to know what are you

1252
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
What

1253
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
What do you now know that

1254
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,775
You wish you knew when you were starting out

1255
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,639
I don't know I would use the Phil Knight quote from Nike of like

1256
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Just do it

1257
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,991
You know I mean it sounds

1258
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
Be courageous

1259
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
Like be curious and be courageous

1260
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
Because the worst it's like my friend says about dates

1261
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
It's either a good day

1262
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
Or a good story

1263
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,423
And I think that's really good advice try things it's going to help you grow and learn

1264
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,495
You know learn something learn something about yourself

1265
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
I really do believe that

1266
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,895
Emily Weiss founder of glossier

1267
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
I spoke with Emily on November 1st

1268
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
At the skirball center for

1269
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
Performing Arts at NYU in New York City

1270
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
And just a few days after that

1271
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,927
Classy opened its first permanent

1272
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
Flagship store in New York

1273
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Bury Saint address

1274
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Company was founded

1275
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
I need space

1276
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
Painted glossy pink

1277
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,423
And is ready for the camera which means if you

1278
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
Couldn't be there

1279
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
You may have seen it

1280
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
On your Instagram feed

1281
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,079
Are episode was produced this week by Rachel

1282
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
