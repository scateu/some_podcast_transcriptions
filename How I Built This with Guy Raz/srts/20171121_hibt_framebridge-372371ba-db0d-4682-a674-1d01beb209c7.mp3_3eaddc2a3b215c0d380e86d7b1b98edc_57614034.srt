Okay here's the show

45
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
There were days

46
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
It is possible this thing doesn't

47
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,992
Scale and it's possible we won't dig ourselves out

48
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,600
We can't keep up with the order so the issue was not that you were framing them badly but they're just

49
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
Oh yeah we were framing that perfectly just

50
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Took too long

51
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
We started to see

52
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Really angry

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Mickey Mouse people saying like

54
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,144
This was the very special gift for my grandmother's 90th birthday and you ruined

55
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
And

56
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
It felt terrible

57
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
NPR how I built this

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Show about innovators entrepreneurs

59
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Idealist

60
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Stories

61
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Gyro House

62
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
Only spent $1,600 framing posters

63
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,912
And then turned her sticker shock into a more affordable idea

64
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Cold Frame

65
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
So there are pieces of artwork

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Hang up in my house that

67
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,944
Cost a lot less than what it cost to actually frame them

68
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
You know you drive

69
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Story

70
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Get the Madden

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
Frame glass and soon enough

72
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
You're down like four hundred bucks

73
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Then if you're like me

74
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
Just stop framing stuff you end up turning a closet

75
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
In your house

76
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Do you like a

77
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Photos and artwork

78
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Storage Center

79
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,728
And this is exactly the opportunity Susan time and saw about

80
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
5 years ago

81
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
When she start to think about how to make

82
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Raining

83
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Cheaper and

84
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
Now at the time Susan was already a veteran of a

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
Bunch of startups that mostly failed

86
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Experiences

87
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,416
She figured out how to raise money to start framebridge and so far

88
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,256
Bringing more than 37 million dollars

89
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
But unlike a lot of the companies we had on the show

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,960
Framebridge is still in its building base it's still working to become a sustainable company

91
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
And Susan is still working like

92
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
Crazy still starting early

93
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
And still staying late

94
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
What you said

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
She got that work ethic from her dad

96
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
Who used to run a small Tugboat business

97
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
Meaning the little votes

98
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
That's how big us

99
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
And so it really operationally intense

100
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Business

101
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
Our family really revered

102
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
His job and

103
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
When into providing for our family and then

104
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,776
We ate dinner at 7:30 because that's when Dad got home from work

105
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
That's so cool like

106
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
I'd never

107
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
Met anybody who's

108
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,968
Is there something just iconic an awesome about.

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
So are you know I certainly have

110
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Been on my share of togs and I think

111
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,208
My ones had a party trick when I got to be a teenager was if we were an event downtown

112
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
And there's a Target on the water you know my dad would have them

113
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
Honk their horn when they went by us

114
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
So your dad and did you were you involved

115
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
In the business of all the Jew

116
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
I mean we pinch it I remember you know

117
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
Receptionist without we go in and answer phones for my dad and that sort of thing

118
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,335
We are certainly

119
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
This isn't like reverence for were

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
And what it took that it didn't come easy

121
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
Yeah I can just imagine my dad on vacations on the phone or

122
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Are the phone ringing late at night and

123
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
If something goes wrong and

124
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
In a business that operationally intensive it's really gone wrong so

125
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
I remember that

126
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Drama

127
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
Do you or did you grow up thinking

128
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Entrepreneurial like I'm going to be an entrepreneur because

129
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
A Charming world around Saint jhn

130
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983

BMV Parma

132
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Culture

133
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,103
No I think I lost my dad and I thought I was going to be the boss but

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
But I didn't

135
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,271
That wasn't like I'm going to be the boss and great things come with being the boss it was like and all the responsibility that comes with that

136
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
And soy

137
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
I guess I had that vision of a business career

138
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
He's but you said you didn't think I'm going to go to

139
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Call Jeanette

140
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Like a lawyer

141
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
No I did

142
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
And I certainly had a lot of ideas

143
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
None of which were great like there should be a pancake delivery service

144
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,287
But you know I was always thinking along those lines always solving consumer problems

145
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
Susan went on to study at the University of Virginia

146
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
And then she got a degree at Harvard Business School

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
She different toes into the

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Startup world for a little bit

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
And then

150
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,135
She went to work at the White House during President Obama's first term

151
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Battleground 2011

152
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Susan once again

153
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
How to start a bug

154
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
So at the time

155
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
Some guys I had worked with previously

156
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
I had started to start up

157
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,519
In a hot new space called daily deals on soda company was called living social and I

158
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Was watching them from afar

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
I was just jealous

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,247
Load it was social Groupon that was the daily deal thing in there still around

161
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
And you were

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Seeing

163
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Friends of yours

164
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
And you were thinking

165
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,439
I got to get into this I got to get on it I am so jealous like

166
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Truly a joke

167
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
When when one of them called

168
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
And asked me if I wanted to join assertive Hadlock my desk packed up I was like I'm ready

169
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Wow

00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Cheap a cup and you are like

171
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Great I'm going to do this and what did you do at least

172
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
How it works with a sent emails with deals to local

173
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Merchants and shops

174
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
And so they decided they would do some specialty ones

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,271
Hired a guy to run travel and heard meet

176
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Do anything else

177
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
So I did

178
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
You don't first

179
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Family-friendly deals

180
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
And then HomeServe

181
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
So like what kind of deals

182
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Yasso deals for

183
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
You don't things like Gymboree and child care services and things like that things that a family might be interested

184
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
It in apple picking

185
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,775
And then it was just like what else could we sell into what other group

186
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
What was that

187
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
Time like cuz I I mean this and not that long ago were talking about like

188
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
67 years ago

189
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
I mean

190
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
I remember LivingSocial here in Washington DC

191
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
It was

192
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
YouTube

193
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,135
It just seemed like everyone is throwing money at it what was it like working at a time

194
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
It was really really exciting

195
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
Ghetto we were all really driven

196
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
We were all really bullish

197
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
We knew that

198
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
Eid mattered and in that case in that industry really

199
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
And so it was fun cuz we had to unlearn I had to unlearn some things I was coming right out of the White House I mean you had to

200
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:46,687
Like this email doesn't have to be checked by 10 people we just got to get it out the door and

201
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
That was exciting

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
It was like a gold rush

203
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
I didn't speak to you remember what LivingSocial is valued at

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
Now it's couple billion

205
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Yeah

206
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,815
Remember even the business lines I was running I got to launch when I got 280 million in sales like

207
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Get out of here now

208
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
So was it insane re working all the time

209
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,287
Yeah I was I was working a lot but again it was coming from a job where I work a lot so

210
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Clearly something I'm used to

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,663
And also it's funny cuz I had you know

212
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,247
A baby at home and it was a bit certainly a startup

213
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
Party culture as well and I found for myself there at

214
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Like I meant her aunt

215
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,791
Do a lot of people like I was where I was a little bit older

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
When did you start to see

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
I don't know sings at LivingSocial kind of

218
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,263
Turn a little bit when did you start to notice that maybe

219
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
Maybe this isn't going to

220
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Work out the way

221
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Everyone thinks it will

222
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Obviously you see

223
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Metric to see growth slowed

224
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,831
And it makes you start to question certain things

225
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
And then obviously you see Talent

226
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
You know some people admired started to leave

227
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Just even though

228
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Composition of the whole experience

229
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,423
Penta LivingSocial capacity

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
What what actually went wrong

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
You know I think it's a multi-part answer

232
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Some of which

233
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Was

234
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
You know that

235
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Exchange was really that local Merchants would get

236
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Loyal coffee

237
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
And so that had to be the case

238
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
And I think in some cases

239
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,951
That trade-off didn't exist and so some of the best Merchants add not in

240
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Anymore and so then

241
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Do you know if burn is exciting and they didn't have the best

242
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Restaurants in stores in southern customers

243
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Became Legends

244
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
The idea and so it was that

245
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,799
It when that cycle was reinforcing it was Unstoppable but when it started to unwind

246
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
It got hurt

247
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
Did that give you an insight into

248
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Stop

249
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
A thing of

250
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,295
New things new technology new product new apps like

251
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
I don't not to pick on Living Social or Groupon her appointment

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,463
Give me the times of these examples where you know one day at company's value today

253
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
5 billion dollars

254
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
And then

255
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
It seems like a year later

256
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
It's sorta like the emperor

257
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
You know MP

258
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
First new clothes everyone's like

259
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Google what is actually what's the value here

260
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,543
Well I think no doubt it led me to a business that I could

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,639
So I think yeah I just learned

262
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Give you some of those businesses are hard to

263
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Hard to know whether they're going to be transformation

264
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
So at what point did you decide to leave

265
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
So

266
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Growth was slowing and I think

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
More importantly I thought my personal development was slowing

268
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
And I thought you know I really

269
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
I want to run something

270
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
I just do and I always sort of

271
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Just feeling that

272
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
Were you anxious about your future

273
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
I don't think I was anxious about

274
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,759
My future at that company I was anxious about my future

275
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
In general I just wanted to get on it

276
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,695
And at that time I had started to think about building my own business

277
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,303
I'm in and I with my head was going there when I got a job offer that sounded

278
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Melissa and Joey

279
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Woodworking for a taxi app

280
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
It's called Taxi Magic that was actually had an iPhone app to hail Taxi

281
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Free Uber

282
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
And so I thought well. This is

283
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,431
That'll be close enough to doing my own thing

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
So at the time it was but certainly nowhere near

285
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
Living Social

286
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Free snacks

287
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Foosball the whole thing

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
You know that company

289
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Sales Retreats beautiful graffiti on the walls

290
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
CTE

291
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
You were trying to convince taxi companies to adopt

292
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
Taxi Magic app or whatever and then

293
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
You would click on the app and then you can order text you that was

294
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,663
Align with hex magic that works exactly and how long did you do stay there

295
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
Wasn't there long I was there only about 7 months be

296
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Because

297
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
As soon as I got there I realized

298
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,695
And I really want to do my own thing that I just that feeling could not be stated

299
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
In another way

300
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Yeah and so what

301
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
What did you talk to Jesus start a canoe

302
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
Rainstorm possible ideas did you have no idea

303
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Idea

304
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
For a long time

305
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,895
I met someone should make custom picture framing better how did you get the idea

306
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Originates

307
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Truly back probably

308
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Eight or nine years

309
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
I had

310
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
National parks posters

311
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
I've never had bought on these annual hiking trips I went

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
On with my sister

313
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,255
And I took them to a local frame store to be framed

314
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
The terrible experience

315
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Really intimidating and

316
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Really expensive

317
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,543
Like more expensive the posters much more expensive and the framing was for

318
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
$400 each

319
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
I spent $1,600

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
And so you were thinking what this has to do somebody has to change this

321
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
And so

322
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,951
I just always had I like I had a mixed reaction even towards the posters when I finally picked him up three weeks later

323
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
I just thought I'd like headed that happened to me

324
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
I just started going about my life

325
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
And I kept noticing things

326
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
That I would like and I have

327
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
You can have that you can frame it

328
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Chester Patterson

329
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,823
Because it this is I'm having flashbacks my conversation with the Warby Parker founders

330
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,663
Which it was similar because glasses are so expensive

331
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
And they were asking why I mean

332
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Plastic in

333
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Ghettos some hinges

334
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
It's right in Hawaii

335
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Why is the framing

336
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
Why am i spending so much money

337
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Sofer a local store

338
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
They don't

339
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Store any inventory they don't

340
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
Store any of their materials in their store

341
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
And sew in or when you go in and you select from the thousand

342
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
Frame styles on the wall

343
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
The

344
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
That bring sword actually buying those

345
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Materials for your pee

346
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
When you

347
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Place your order

348
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
So it takes weeks

349
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
And it's really heavily marked up you're buying from a distributor

350
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,831
So our Innovation which a doesn't seem like much of one was really like why don't we

351
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
Choose frame styles We Believe are beautiful

352
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,743
Invest in them and make it centrally so you can't so so basically you have

353
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Some options but not

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Yep

355
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
40 styles

356
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
I'm rotate

357
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Driven by Trends but we don't

358
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
Yeah we don't overwhelm you with a thousand Francine one

359
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
And you have the infant

360
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Then we have

361
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
And the concept was that the

362
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
That you would roll up your artwork

363
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Nail it in and then it would

364
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Come back Frank

365
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,343
Yes that was the concept the concept was for less than half the price of a retail store

366
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
With very clear upfront pricing you choose from a

367
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Beautiful selection

368
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Weed Melia packaging mail us your art

369
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
We send it back to you in a couple days Reddit

370
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
You're working a taxi Magic

371
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
But if you have this idea for a long time what was the

372
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Spark that

373
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Actually got you

374
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
To do that to actually

375
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Believe in

376
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,967
Make a go for it multiceps at

377
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
LivingSocial I sold a lot of

378
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
And so people I new customers are looking for a deal on this

379
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
This category but didn't

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
They still didn't like their

381
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Experiencing

382
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Validated it

383
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
And then

384
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
When I get to Taxi Magic I had

385
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Ash you know

386
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
How many smart people are competing in this category

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
And I have a category

388
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
I am just

389
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
So eager to make better

390
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
And nobody's thinking about

391
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
You you started to tell people about this idea because a lot of people are secretive at the beginning

392
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
I'll steal it

393
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
You told people about

394
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,231
This idea you had a dead and it was essential I did because

395
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
You know I needed to know when people actually use

396
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
Did people think it was a good idea to everybody.

397
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
You're truly an image of me at a cocktail party already

398
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
You know

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,591
Ifriends baseball game and in just thinking about you know

400
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
Telling people the concept didn't then I kept hearing the same stories about

401
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Either me or my partner

402
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
You know

403
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
An industry was always involving $600 worth of Framing and I bet I wouldn't believe it and I do believe it that's why

404
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
I am going to fix it

405
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
But everybody present was like saying to you

406
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
What an awesome idea Susan

407
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
But like

408
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Let's just be honest here

409
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,911
A million conversations like that happen everyday

410
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,055
So to this day at least twice a month someone says you know me and my friends we were talking and we were

411
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
Coming up with that same idea we had an idea for a framing

412
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Having a disruptive Raven coming

413
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
List of the medication are witches

414
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
Is is an idea enough

415
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
Yeah a lot of their lot of really awesome ideas

416
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Now and ideas

417
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Wheeling hour

418
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,607
I mean I so let's at least an hour sorry it's

419
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
It's worth

420
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
It's all that

421
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
I mean into or you

422
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,359
Like financially secure enough to take this leap to actually

423
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Leave your job and try this

424
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
No

425
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
We're living a life that required

426
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Too hard working

427
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,487
Parents and required to salaries for Mortgage in our two kids they were one and four at the time

428
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Two little girls and

429
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
It's obviously child care for them

430
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
So yeah it was kind of a crazy time to decide to start a business

431
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
And I think a lot of people

432
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
Tell me all the reasons this

433
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Couldn't work

434
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
So what was the first

435
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,455
Think me so the first thing you did as you start talking to people and tell him about the idea

436
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
And

437
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
What was the first like

438
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Concrete thing you did did you

439
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
Did you know anything about Frank now

440
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
I knew nothing about framing

441
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
So certain most notably a kind of for a framing course

442
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
That I took at a Hampton Inn

443
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
And

444
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
So they actually take

445
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,167
Bring small framing equipment into conference room

446
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Sponsored by

447
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Just like somebody

448
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
Picture frame and really the advertisement is like

449
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
Look at the highest margin business

450
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,575
Come learn how to frame

451
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
Learn how to frame then you can start to open a shop because

452
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Is margins are so hot

453
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
And so

454
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
It was really important for me to make sure I knew

455
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
What is getting into on the production side but also

456
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Yeah that makes it was five

457
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
BECU

458
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
You leave your job to to learn how to frame

459
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
I leave my job to learn how to frame

460
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,567
And I go to a trade show in Las Vegas

461
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Just two

462
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,967
Just to check it out just to check it out

463
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Because I thought

464
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Yelp

465
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
What have I gotten myself into

466
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,391
I just whispered one around looking at frame styles like they actually

467
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Certainly

468
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Add opinions on

469
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
On what satellite didn't and

470
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
And had some design learning but really I just thought like

471
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
What am I getting myself into

472
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,959
I remember standing alone on the Vegas Strip just for

473
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
Having paid my way there at my own pocket

474
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,359
Thinking like what am I doing like am I ever going to pull this thing

475
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
When was Ed Sheeran

476
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
2013

477
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Debt ratio

478
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
Set 2013 and in what year were there like taking notes and to just

479
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
And what did you want to do with that information

480
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
I was still in the you let me make sure I'm not missing

481
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Sing face and then also like well gosh I'm going to have to get started so I have to call these people up and tell them I want to buy a quip

482
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
And one bite you know what

483
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,775
Try to develop contacts in the industry

484
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
There are few folks I met their who are still vendors to this day and I really give

485
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Credit for listening

486
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Because I do think most people just

487
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Orton like

488
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Oh well

489
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Absolutely didn't

490
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,511
To this day I think I'm still trying to explain to people it was really kind of reverence for the end product

491
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,071
That I started this business so I actually think

492
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Getting something custom framed

493
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Really really special

494
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
And so

495
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
I believe that I just believe

496
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
More people need tax

497
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
But presumably some of these frame

498
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Folks were like

499
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,943
We don't want this kind of disruption we don't want

500
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Your Harvard Business School degree to come in and make this thing cheaper for consumers

501
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Of course

502
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Of course

503
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,975
And so going on in building this business I have

504
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
Run into that a number of times but I think

505
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,655
It requires someone out of the industry to be able to sort of plotted from the consumer's viewpoint

506
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
And I think by this time I

507
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
It felt like

508
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Too late to back out

509
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
It and so at that point I started trying to

510
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,711
Why did you decide to go to investors

511
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
From the get-go rather than

512
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Just pulled together

513
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
Money from family and

514
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Anywhere you can get

515
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
A little bit here and there and do it on your own

516
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Yeah I joke a little bit that we were

517
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Somewhat I'm lean in the beginning

518
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
In that

519
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
We Believe

520
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
I believe

521
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
That in order to actually

522
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Do this business well it had to be done it

523
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Such a high

524
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Holiday

525
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,128
And that was that the site had to look beautiful

526
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Packaging had to be

527
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Branded

528
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
You had to trust

529
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
Awesome enough to roll up a diploma and

530
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Send it to us

531
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
And I really thought like

532
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
There is no

533
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
Really minimally viable

534
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Product version

535
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Of this business

536
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
It has kept me.

537
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Like that anything to just test whether the concept worked wouldn't

538
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
We had to do a great and we had you are so

539
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
So how did you

540
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,984
How do you get the money to do this cuz I have to assume you need

541
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Did a lot of money to build

542
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
An app to get the materials to hire a team like YouTube how much money were you looking right yeah so

543
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
Hilarious I remember saying I was looking to raise $50,000

544
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
And initial investors saying you realize that's not going to

545
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
To be enough money

546
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,256
Really we raised $2000000 so we were going to raise a real round

547
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Cbrown navigate

548
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,680
And what was your pitch to investors by where you like a million half dollars value that 10 million dollars

549
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
I put you say that did you even know what to say how I didn't I didn't know any of those things and quickly learned in you learn because all of them

550
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Meeting start to sort of melted together

551
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
And you learn those things along the way but the picture was really clear and

552
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,528
In a way I'm really proud of we built the business

553
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Which was young

554
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
When inside

555
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Look you know

556
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
I say we because there were some people on the PowerPoint

557
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Pizza Shack

558
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
But they were just like aspiration

559
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
So yeah it was just

560
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
Kay custom rings too expensive

561
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
And

562
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Pretty big Market it could be

563
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Way bigger

564
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
Is someone made it less expensive and less of a hassle

565
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
And here's I'm going to do it

566
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
How did you find people to even pitched

567
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
So an investor at Living Social

568
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
But I met for breakfast he was actually wondering why I had left Living Social it was just a sort of a social call

569
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
And

570
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:33,632
I had no business bitching him at that time cuz it was really not a strongly enough developed idea but I

571
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Told him

572
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
You know

573
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
I pointed to frames on the wall and said you know those should only cost $100

574
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
You know that

575
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Antes

576
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,128
Serta leaned in and said you don't you should do this

577
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
He's a really intense guy

578
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
And so

579
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
I thought well gosh that was the reaction

580
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,600
You're like validated right there yeah and so I

581
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Revolution

582
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
So so he's acting in the Mid-Atlantic

583
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Pretty well-known investor

584
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,840
He is a well-known investor and yes

585
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
And he also calls it like

586
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
So I knew like it is not the one who would be

587
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
He just bought a breakfast or lunch with this guy and he's like

588
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,080
Go for you got to do this Susan

589
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,664
He said that it is a good idea

590
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,248
And so great we left and about a week later

591
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
He sent me one line email how far along

592
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
And I thought

593
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Yes

594
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Okay

595
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
And it certainly it was not a promise of anything but it was enough to make me think like

596
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
He's at this is a nitrogenous we got it

597
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
I have built this

598
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
So he said pull a few pieces

599
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
This Together come up with you know what I'm doing next

600
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
How you get this thing off the ground and come

601
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
We'll talk.

602
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Pitch to sing for real

603
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,896
Find a pretty good presentation I thought of

604
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Of how I would pull up

605
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
First guy to give you the money

606
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,296
And you were looking for a million bucks

607
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,160
And I went in and I went through everything in the deck and he said

608
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
This isn't

609
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
I don't think there's enough

610
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
Here

611
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
That we can make

612
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Annabelle

613
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
What

614
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
He goes from saying go do this to saying

615
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Yeah I don't I'm not feeling as a

616
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
What it what was it that he did not

617
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Like about your

618
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
I think you didn't like the certainty

619
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
Uncertainty part of it

620
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
We had

621
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,600
Yeah I had ideas of how it would pull everything together but

622
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah

623
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
And didn't have anything yet

624
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
And so

625
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
I think he felt like

626
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,120
Can't come back and say I found this great early stage company but they haven't said anything yet

627
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
And I remember walking home that I was to distance I needed

628
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
Did the cat but I walked home that night thinking like

629
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Oh my gosh

630
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
So that's done

631
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Now you got to move on to the next

632
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Yeah and by this time

633
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,112
You know I'm spending money at a trade show at a framing course out of your own pocket

634
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:07,488
You are not independently wealthy no longer

635
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,120
It was you looking your bank account and Insignia kid is a certain point where I'm going to hit a limit like

636
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
$10,000 - $20,000

637
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
What's $30,000 and I'm going to be in

638
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
Big trouble yeah I remember actually having it

639
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Serious conversation

640
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
My sister

641
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
In

642
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
January 14th

643
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
I was staying with her new your cousin

644
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,320
Interesting on her couch and she was her like

645
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Sister I'm the one who has to tell you like eventually

646
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
You going to have to give up

647
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
In a moment, Susan Tynan got off her sister's couch and into her own framing.

648

Hey welcome back to how I built this from and

679
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
NPR

680
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Gyros

681
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
First investment pictures went

682
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Nowhere

683
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
A lot of people told her to

684
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Give up

685
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,384
But of course she didn't she convinced some Engineers to help with the website

686
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
Promise that eventually

687
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
She would pay them

688
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,344
I really convincing Engineers like this is all happening we're going to get money so

689
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Start building

690
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,928
So based in start codon we started building

691
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,120
Even at that point anywhere so we're finding what the name for framebridge would be and

692
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:58,752
So I started building as though it would be funded obviously anything that required a big check I couldn't

693
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Obtain

694
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
But otherwise certainly I could get you know

695
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
Samples of materials and things like that and so I just started

696
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
Proceeding as though it would happen

697
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
And

698
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Meeting anyone who might

699
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,672
Be able to write a check and just using using your own money for bits and pieces here and there my money for bits and pieces

700
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
But that point things starting to pick up more and I think

701
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Again a lesson in just

702
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
If you're moving as though the business is going to work the rest is going to

703
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,264
So that point I had gotten connected to another investor I knew as well

704
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
In the DC area in the DC area National investor

705
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
A

706
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
Female partner

707
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Venture Capital firm

708
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,576
Who and we had lunch and I told her the idea and she said you won't believe this I was searching

709
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Last week

710
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
For the solution not mine and I know it

711
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
It doesn't exist I looked

712
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
Should I love this

713
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,024
I get it I I know this need exists

714
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
And

715
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
GTA V money

716
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
It wasn't that easy

717
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,008
It was definitely a series of meetings in sort of a show me how you're putting this together

718
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,360
The same way with a lot of like blue show me more in the next time show me more

719
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,176
And so she was the first to act actually sign up

720
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
And a how long did

721
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
Prices of when you started

722
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,088
Raise money to when you actually raise the millionaire million 1/2 that you needed how long does that take

723
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
Meetings wise it was

724
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
You know 10 month

725
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
Really intensely probably about

726
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
4 months

727
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Which

728
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Felt

729
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Really grueling but I think is

730
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,120
You know everything's gota ribbon easy run

731
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
4 months death of

732
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
The money so you have

733
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,032
Like a little over million bucks in your hand

734
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
And your bank account you're looking at those zeros

735
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
What do you do with that money

736
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
First thing I did was

737
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
Hire my first

738
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Employee

739
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
I'm a woman and Tessa who would work for me previously

740
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
And so

741
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
Truly the day the wires hit

742
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Quit her job and

743
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
And what you do

744
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Everything

745
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Everything is like

746
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Cheap men's merchandising creative but I mean we did

747
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Everything we

748
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,680
Began actually doing a lot of product sampling

749
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
So we were sitting in this co-working space and we were getting

750
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Boxes of

751
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,616
Real wood chips wood mouldings being sent to us

752
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,528
We shouldn't really go in a co-working space so they can sing every night you know you have to bring your leave with your boxes

753
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,600
And so we would Uber home at night with boxes of

754
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Example materials but we just started

755
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Again doing everything on all fronts

756
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
Like meeting with packaging vendors meeting with UPS

757
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Like it was just a

758
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
In hindsight I don't even know what that word plant looks like but we were just reviewing every single thing at one time and what was the plan like with them

759
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,616
With that c-money the plan was to build a NASA website and

760
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Launch

761
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,504
Yeah so the plan was to build an app and a website and to find some framer friends

762
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
To do the initial production and remember we had for the first 9000 frames

763
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
I don't know why we said that for the first time doesn't Prince George's find someone who'll do it

764
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Eating like an outside frame company

765
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,608
Okay and I think that was a way to get our initial investors comfortable with the fact that we were

766
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,656
Add no experience on that minivan

767
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,728
Ringside but you had to find a framing company that

768
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,056
Would do this but they were expensive right so we didn't

769
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,712
So we started talking to you don't framers in to see if we get them interested what we're doing and

770
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
We realized

771
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
I just a lot of questions like we couldn't control quality we wouldn't be certain about anything and both of us

772
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,024
Sticklers for for quality for precision and we just did

773
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,376
So we realize in order to even buy materials we would need a warehouse

774
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
And so

775
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
We need a warehouse we might as well get bring me a quid

776
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
And we might as well

777
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Make the very first

778
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
And so had to tell her investors like

779
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
Congratulations

780
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
You're going to own a frame Factory

781
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
And we drove around

782
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
The DC metropolitan area which is not really an area known for

783
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
Industrial spaces

784
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
But we found a space

785
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
And started building

786
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,232
So you ordered like equipment to make

787
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Frames which I guess is like

788
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
Band saws and I would like we would but did you get

789
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
So we actually

790
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,216
Met a guy through our travels we met a vendor who said

791
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
The guy who sells used equipment

792
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
And he's a great guy on death frame store and said like

793
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
Moonlight for you guys

794
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
And help you get this

795
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
And how did you tell him to take like from the time you get your investment

796
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
The time you rescued launched

797
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Set up the website and

798
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
And the app how long does that take

799
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,744
We got money end of February by April we signed the lease on the

800
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Facility

801
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
Production facility

802
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
And

803
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
July we did a soft launch

804
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
Yeah it was but I mean

805
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
We felt under pressure I mean we had met again

806
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Elise

807
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
For a warehouse and not a function website

808
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Elise for warehouse

809
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
UWE paying rent on

810
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
And wear your investors like okay guys come on

811
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,552
Yeah they definitely were I think every week

812
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
Pre-launch

813
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,696
Felt scary and unknown

814
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,000
I mean this was just a real

815
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,096
Field of Dreams right this was a iPad customers really want this service

816
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
And so we launched

817
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
We wouldn't

818
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,752
So you're so you launched in July

819
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
2014

820
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
How do you get the word out

821
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,224
Right so hilariously we started with me it was a password protected site cuz we didn't want to be overrun

822
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
I'm which was not to be worried

823
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,672
So we launched with with that little beta site in July and then August we opened up and you know told her everybody menu on face

824
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Got a couple orders

825
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
But they were all Serta

826
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
You know

827
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
One degree of separation to degree of separation I went to college with that guy texting

828
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,192
And so we started to send out for him

829
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Instead

830
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Folks Enterprise

831
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,824
And first couple months we got

832
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
Two big hits architectural digest and install

833
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,456
You just friend like random things incense

834
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Yeah but not ran

835
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
We were like

836
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
What exactly would

837
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
What frame style would this

838
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Editor and this

839
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Magazine like

840
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
What is something about their life we can figure out so that

841
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Reframing

842
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Interesting young we were really thoughtful

843
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
And those those were really valid

844
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
What about you

845
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Did that have a measurable impact

846
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,336
Show Anatomy I mean at that point we're selling stuff you anything was measurable Seuss measurable

847
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
With everything

848
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,456
Sort of manageable and the time we had said like will really be something

849
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
For selling a thousand frames a month

850
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
And we had told her head of production

851
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
Be prepared

852
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
And he was in the frame

853
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672
Good luck girls like you. Get 2000s

854
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,304
True if the first month or two and then late October

855
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:52,704
Someone a home decor bloggers wrote a blogpost and we had our first real sales by quadeca

856
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
And that was the first day without okay

857
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Like it.

858
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
How many

859
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Orders were you getting in a day

860
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456
So at that point we were probably would felt

861
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
Overwhelming were probably getting in 50 or 6

862
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,856
For folks who works in production we're making the frame

863
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
But

864
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
V

865
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,976
Team of us who were you don't make me website marketing everything where the shipping

866
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
2 at 4 p.m. every night we

867
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,608
Pushed aside our laptops and walk to the back of the factory

868
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
And bubble wrapped and packaged up

869
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
Including you the CEO better believe it

870
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,544
You are you are like wrapping up and

871
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,848
You better believe it I had I truly remember

872
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
An early board meeting

873
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,736
And I thought oh my gosh they don't know that my hands are covered in paint

874
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
It's like they don't get it it was just

875
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
At a level of all hands on deck

876
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
Continued okay but we are approaching our first holiday

877
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
And

878
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:53,632
This guy is part-time head of production came in one night and said in this is an Earl

879
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
They like

880
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Stress

881
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Yeah I started didn't sign up for this

882
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
I thought I'd get you guys started but I don't

883
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,272
And I said we're about to hit our first holiday and things are picking up like I need you I need you to help me

884
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,832
Frames but I don't need all this responsibility

885
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
This is the guy who's

886
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Running

887
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
The brexit

888
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Timeout

889
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
And you said

890
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,680
Well I'm not sure I can say what I said no I think I tried to appeal with the light

891
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Please let me down

892
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,544
But there is really sore. He really was like I just

893
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
I took you this far

894
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Timeout

895
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
You freaking out

896
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:45,344
You know you do everything and so that was one of the few down there probably a dozen times or you say like

897
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Is it the end of the end

898
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Yeah

899
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
Yeah and I think about everyone in like your investors who believed in you and then you believed in this guy who said I'll just work part-time

900
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,864
Time in that was fine and how did we get into this

901
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
So what you do

902
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,264
Don't I immediately called a friend who would work in operations

903
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
Wart LivingSocial

904
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
Put me in touch with another colleague of ours so

905
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,944
You don't miss a certain mutual friend colleague

906
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
I'm with in between gigs and said this will be funny I can do this I can learn

907
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Tie me up and so truly within 2 days

908
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
We had a new

909
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Hadoop production

910
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm who had no experience in a warehouse but was

911
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Goodman

912
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
And how long they take

913
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Just like 2 or 3 days

914
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
And he knew how to make friends

915
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
No

916
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
But he was

917
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
Sufficiently ID and

918
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,800
And really thought it would be fun he just said like I can do this and we knew I mean

919
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Yes

920
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Super nice and super smart and

921
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
Day three he breaks his leg

922
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
In the factory

923
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
So I was like okay well we're out again

924
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
And so then

925
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,160
We just heard at that four of us that Regional

926
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,464
Corporate team had to just stand in and

927
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
And figure it out at that point

928
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
He came back on crutches

929
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
And we got through our first holiday

930
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
So you guys

931
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Make it sweet

932
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Christmas and then

933
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,032
I just couple months later you hit another crisis right

934
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,128
Yeah we did I really clever Father's Day promotion

935
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,456
Where we asked about this style of your dad and head

936
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,808
Unique craft paper designs if you had a preppy dad or hipster dad

937
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,368
I was really clever marketing but

938
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
Broker Factory bean

939
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
Required

940
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Did they match

941
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:32,096
Not only all the components of a custom frame but also the right craft paper

942
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
And we started to slip into

943
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
A production backlog

944
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
So we started was really the daily issue and that we were selling about a hundred grams a day and making about 7

945
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
And

946
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
When we got into this Father's Day back login and

947
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
That's something diverse

948
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Summer

949
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
There were days

950
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,392
It is possible this thing doesn't scale

951
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
And it's possible we won't dig ourselves out

952
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,536
It won't scale because you you start to realize we cannot keep up with the orders

953
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
We can't keep up with the order and that's a good problem to have

954
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah it felt like a good

955
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
Problem to have except we were also oriented to

956
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
Customer Delight

957
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
We started to see

958
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,336
Yeah really angry

959
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Amount of people saying like

960
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,664
This was the very special gift

961
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,992
For my grandmother's 90th birthday and you ruined it

962
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
And

963
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
It felt terrible

964
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
And I remember having this really intense debate about do we send the email to customers who think it's going to come in three

965
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
4 days dad says it's going to come in two to three weeks

966
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,864
So the issue was not that you were framing them badly but they're just

967
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Oh yeah we were framing that perfectly just

968
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Took too long

969
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
I'm an insult that leads

970
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Did the bigger question

971
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
Can we get out of where we are today and can this thing even

972
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,664
Cuz you need to confer to work

973
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
It has to be as convenient and quick

974
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
Is going to like

975
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Your local frames

976
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
It has to be quicker are custom

977
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
Charter internet Choppers they care about

978
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,720
They're and Tuesday they're getting ready for something they're doing on Saturday and we

979
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,816
Tell me how it how you were sort of organizing your

980
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Life because

981
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
I'm imagining

982
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
You got to talk to your investors

983
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
You're bored

984
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
You got a bazillion emails

985
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
You're also like running the staff

986
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,896
What did you save everyone is like scream and take your hair out

987
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,968
Yeah I remember hosting a board meeting

988
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm at our production facility it a like a rented

989
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
Conference room nearby

990
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,440
Cuz I thought maybe I should bring them in on this backlog issue

991
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,024
Actually take a tour of the facility and see what's going on

992
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
You don't Maybe

993
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
In this case honesty is the best policy

994
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
So I remember

995
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,216
Touring with them and they saw these like numbers on the board like let me get this straight

996
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,288
You have that many yet to build in your building this many a day

997
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
I got

998
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
That math isn't

999
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm going to add up and so

1000
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
You can't

1001
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
Yeah run to True that you have to

1002
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Yeah

1003
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
Bring everybody in with what you're dealing with

1004
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
How did you solve the problem

1005
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
We heard a lot more framers

1006
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
We got a talented

1007
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,951
Add a production operations who

1008
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
New how to dig us out

1009
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
And really required all of us

1010
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Just give up

1011
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Weekends for a couple months

1012
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
To get out of it

1013
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
I remember one conversation where I said

1014
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
We're not going down like this

1015
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
And

1016
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,591
A woman who runs product for us at

1017
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
And so I was like okay

1018
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
We sailed that

1019
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
When I go down like this

1020
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
I really was thinking

1021
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,295
I once read that like

1022
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
How fast do you

1023
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
You can jump up from

1024
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
Burpee is correlated with your life expectancy

1025
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
And I think that's a lot like a startup

1026
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
It's really how bass like oh

1027
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
The production

1028
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
Manager quit we got a new product

1029
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
You like it

1030
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
It's like that as fast as you can

1031
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Keep going

1032
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
When did you start to

1033
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
CDOT the light at the end of the tunnel

1034
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
And euphoric

1035
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Next Christmas

1036
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
So how many seasons really big for us

1037
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,807
App for uploading digital photos to I mean Edison

1038
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
The greatest gift

1039
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
So we've been spiked in the holidays

1040
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
And so

1041
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
I think once we had

1042
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,255
Hero up a professional operations team

1043
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
And we

1044
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,375
Live through that crazy spiked of a holiday season we realize like we've got some

1045
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Zofran Bridges is

1046
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
3 years in the

1047
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:26,847
Is it is it like smoother sailing with a company or do you still have prices

1048
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
Now wait there's always a crisis

1049
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,295
What will happen it's always what you didn't see coming

1050
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,647
So I'm relatively recently the beginning of this year we were raising more money in

1051
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
Assertive at this stage in a tin

1052
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:45,279
Ventures cuz it's your job well done

1053
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,399
We got a real business here and so I had spent months on the road talking to investors including my own and

1054
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Stitch together

1055
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
A round of funding

1056
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,799
And I had been told I was to receive a term sheet

1057
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
The finding

1058
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
The next day was it

1059
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,943
Tuesday was so is that Monday and I knew Tuesday I was getting it from cheating so

1060
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
Starting to feel a little bit of relief

1061
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
My job is to

1062
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
Think strategically focus on the customer but also

1063
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
And so

1064
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Was feeling good I was doing my job

1065
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
We had a brand-new CFO

1066
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,559
Is 3 weeks and on the job and we were talking

1067
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,631
Monday night and he said you know you're going to kill me

1068
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
I got you taken a vacation

1069
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
We got to get the same clothes

1070
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
And he said no

1071
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
I got another job

1072
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
What

1073
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
Yeah lyrics

1074
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,687
So anyone who's ever worked for a business knows that

1075
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Cuz I mean you're like

1076
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
What's going on there if you're see about leave so I

1077
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Immediately knew like

1078
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,647
This is going to Spook the hell out of everybody

1079
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Turn trouble

1080
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Yes

1081
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,767
And most importantly is going to speak these investor

1082
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
And so my first thought was

1083
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
Shut up why did you tell me that

1084
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Because it's one thing to leave but like

1085
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,519
If you leave me right now I have this knowledge

1086
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
And I have to

1087
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
And so his credit he had been in the running for public Company CFO job really big job

1088
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Stream job postings happen

1089
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
But I'm just could not have been

1090
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
So

1091
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
I left the building

1092
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,951
Like a ghost I remember couple colleagues asked me about minor things and I like couldn't even answer them

1093
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,255
I went for a run and it was

1094
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
Sodalite

1095
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
What do I do I just get the term sheet close the funding and then say I was surprised this guy is leaving you can't but you can

1096
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
When inserted like

1097
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
Just heard a frantically called

1098
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,359
All the members of my board to try and get out ahead of what I knew would be

1099
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Haley

1100
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
Get started with an explosion

1101
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Which it was

1102
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
They reacted by sang

1103
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
Thanks this is really bad you know that yes

1104
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,207
We'll get through it by the way that you are

1105
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,535
It's a lot of money it's a lot of money on the line and so you can

1106
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
You know

1107
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
People

1108
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
I want to believe $17 is going to

1109
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
As a company you can't blame them

1110
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
Skip this

1111
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,687
And I remember I'll never forget a one of our board members they said oh he's on vacation but I'll try and call you and you called me and I could hear was

1112
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
Steel drum band in the background

1113
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
And he said

1114
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
We're just going to have to do so well this guy feel

1115
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
And I said okay you're right that's what we're going to do

1116
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
And so then they said everyone

1117
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
Started to come around but I had to do sort of like

1118
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
Yale Sports

1119
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,655
Psych with everybody to say like come on you believe in this business you believe in me

1120
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,471
We got this we're going to do this this get throw us off

1121
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
I mean I really had to like

1122
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,823
Bring everybody together like it was the beginning of the company

1123
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
And so you got the money

1124
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,711
And we live to fight another day

1125
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,319
The difference between your company in so many companies

1126
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
Turn on the shows that you're still in the thick of it

1127
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
You are not

1128
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Like

1129
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
Able to just sit back.

1130
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,023
Where in the throat

1131
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Yeah like what's going to happen with her maid

1132
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,655
Your competitors like are they going to try and lunch stuff we're doing probably

1133
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
You know what we get to be a sustainably

1134
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
Yashow healthy business

1135
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,847
It looks like it but you know but it's really

1136
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
Require certified Commando crawl

1137
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
An insult

1138
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Crazy amount of work

1139
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
All the time

1140
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
Yeah it's a crazy amount of work all the time like I said they're just

1141
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
So many talented people now to share it

1142
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
But

1143
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,207
I can't help myself like I

1144
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
Do always want to be

1145
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Skimming

1146
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
No customer

1147
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
Four tickets and things like that

1148
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,887
How much do this

1149
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Point of view race

1150
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
Lee Priest 37 million dollars

1151
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,775
Meet at some point all these investors

1152
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:46,175
Oh yeah they want something they want something back and so they're going to either and their two options inside of you go public

1153
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Or you sell to somebody

1154
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,527
Those are probably the two most

1155
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Likely

1156
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
Do I think we can be a big enough company to go public

1157
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
Absolutely anything we can get fundamentally good enough company to it and understandable and Evan a forecast of Alaska business to go public

1158
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
I believe that

1159
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
I also believe

1160
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447
All of those things that make us interesting

1161
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Would make us interesting

1162
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
As a partner of another business

1163
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,127
Does it I mean obviously you couldn't

1164
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
Do what you've done without those investing that money

1165
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,015
What does any part of you kind of think

1166
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
I wish I could figure out how to do this

1167
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Without

1168
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,439
Yeah I've given up a tremendous amount of ownership biting people would be shocked

1169
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
By how much

1170
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
So at some point

1171
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
I bet I'll reflect on that but

1172
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:40,447
Really I think a lot about the fact that I don't think it would have worked unless we had done it in this really

1173
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
It's really high quality way and

1174
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
The money allowed me to recruit

1175
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Truly the best

1176
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
Terrific people

1177
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
And used

1178
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Very good materials and

1179
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
You don't have a very open liberal return policy and everything that has to go into

1180
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,439
Building a great company and so I just don't think I could have done in another way

1181
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
I think a lot of people

1182
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
People here 37 million dollars in

1183
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Assume that you have 37 million dollars

1184
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
But

1185
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
Give me a heart that is that that's not the case right

1186
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,127
So that is interesting I think that's very confusing to people

1187
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
There's a lot of

1188
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
This thing is real we employ a lot of people

1189
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:29,599
We are growing really rapidly those are real

1190
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,671
Swimming in money and throwing it up in the air

1191
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
Is a funny thing

1192
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
We still have

1193
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,047
Cash-strapped conversation

1194
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
YouTube to friends of yours.

1195
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Assume that you're like

1196
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Rolling in cash

1197
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:46,495
Yeah I laughed cuz I started to get a lot of things from like all the schools I went to

1198
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,895
A lot of like yeah but the thing is is that there's

1199
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
A very hyper

1200
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,991
Possibility that you will this will make you very rich

1201
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,527
If this turns out

1202
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,551
The way

1203
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
Your investors imagine you imagine

1204
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,695
I can make you into a very rich person how important

1205
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
Right

1206
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
It sounds

1207
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,559
Cute but I cannot be my Folk

1208
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,351
It truly if I take

1209
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
My eye always on the ball at

1210
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
On what we're delivering

1211
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,495
It will crumble I strongly believe that

1212
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Just like

1213
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,359
Pasadena far away the hardest thing you've ever done

1214
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
Oh it is so hard

1215
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
I laugh about

1216
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
I work a lot of startup

1217
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Like that has nothing to do

1218
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
It is not it is like barely even pepper

1219
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
For this

1220
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
It is extremely hard

1221
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
It's like

1222
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
Is only they almost think like

1223
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,071
Come at me like I have me merging

1224
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
It's so much stronger like I'd like you to throw any ham

1225
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
As soon as I know that

1226
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,007
You guys are still in the in the building mode

1227
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
In face of the company

1228
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,639
This is a question that I asked you to pretty much everyone on the show which is

1229
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,967
Do you think that so far you know

1230
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,063
Your success in the success of framebridge is because of your

1231
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
Hard work and intelligence or

1232
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
Or is a lot of it just like

1233
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
Yeah of course a lot is locked

1234
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Truly Almighty early team

1235
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
Wolfpack from different jobs

1236
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
And so

1237
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
A lot was

1238
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Being able to

1239
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
Really pull at everything together and in like

1240
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
It's really windy road a lot is locked

1241
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
But a lot of Hustle

1242
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
And I think

1243
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
I think a lot about the intersection

1244
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
I guess with blocking beliefs

1245
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
I believe in this idea I believe that I could do it

1246
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,575
I still believe it will be a big business

1247
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
And I think that

1248
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Translate salak

1249
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
I'm so light is like I just believe

1250
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Enough

1251
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
You know one thing we don't always talk about on the show is just the amount of personal sacrifice

1252
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
It takes two

1253
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
Build a company right like

1254
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Pinotage

1255
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,007
Spend away from your partner or your kids your family and

1256
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
Probably haven't taken

1257
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,359
You know a lot of vacations over the past 2 years

1258
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
It is still worth it

1259
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Oh absolutely

1260
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Absolutely

1261
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
And it's really

1262
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
It's the

1263
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,599
People understanding me

1264
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,415
Is bream part that's worth it it really is

1265
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,487
Walking through our facilities and seeing what people framed

1266
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
Like that is just amazing it's like

1267
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,119
I believed you had this stuff and you did

1268
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:25,471
And so a truly I see someone and I have like a scar from the running of the bulls

1269
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
That passes from

1270
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
Disney World am I

1271
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
Just like I believe

1272
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,199
You wanted to bring that stuff and you got it you understood what we did

1273
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,783
And you're doing it with us and that is just it's just a thrill

1274
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,111
What is the most unusual thing that you

1275
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
You've been asked

1276
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
We framed a lot of fun you

1277
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Usual things

1278
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,279
We did framed

1279
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
A ponytail

1280
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Which was faster

1281
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
But

1282
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Butcher

1283
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
You know we're up for anything

1284
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,239
My favorite actually won one of my favorite

1285
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
What is a

1286
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Cardboard

1287
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:05,407
Piece of a kid's fort and I had the rules of the fort on it

1288
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
And

1289
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,063
These kids when they were young and Mom and saved it and bring it for them when they were in their early 20s

1290
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
Now they're framed

1291
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Rules of the fort but they were really

1292
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Really endearing

1293
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Be kind

1294
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
The rules were really

1295
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
It was like the way you should be

1296
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
And I

1297
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:28,191
Animal Farm Road us a note saying you know and he's kids get iPhones I can give him everything

1298
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
And this

1299
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Like what hands down

1300
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
The best of Christmas

1301
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,335
And so I thought you know that was like

1302
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
You get it

1303
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,967
Susan Tynan founder of framebridge

1304
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
How do I remember that

1305
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
First Investors sheephead

1306
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
Tige Savage

1307
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,879
The guy who encouraged her to start

1308
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,695
Company and then told her he wasn't ready to invest

1309
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,791
Well it turns out Susan managed to change his mind

1310
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
And Tyga

1311
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,655
Actually invested in framebridge in every subsequent round

1312
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
And today

1313
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
He sits on her board

1314
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,783
And stick around because in just a moment we're going to here

1315
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551

1316
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Things

Vizio

Thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1324
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,663
In the story begins with Alex Van do Ark

1325
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
Chico California who has a

1326
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,551
A question yeah so it's have you ever Mix Concrete before

1327
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,623
I personally have not mix concrete before

1328
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,463
But Alex has mix a ton of it especially when he was a teenager

1329
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,767
You're helping out with small jobs as dads

1330
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Construction

1331
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,607
And typically what you do is you grab a bag of concrete

1332
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:06,239
You put it in the wheelbarrow you break it open you throw water in there and use the trouble to mix it around

1333
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
And then you

1334
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
Need a wheel that wheelbarrow wherever you need a new portal

1335
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,175
And when you do this over and over it can get to be a real

1336
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,551
It takes too long it's messy and then pouring it is just too challenging to do

1337
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,415
So my dad and I would say okay we need a better way to mix the stuff

1338
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,231
And so one day I kind of want to fly really

1339
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:32,095
Alex and his dad ditched the wheelbarrow and they decided to use a lightweight

1340
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Harp instead

1341
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:38,495
Who are the cement and the water onto the tarp and then held it up between them

1342
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:44,895
And instead of using a shovel or any other tool I would just use these four corners no kind of pick one side up at a time

1343
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Ineffectively

1344
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:51,039
Fold the pile of concrete and water over itself and it would mix

1345
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Very quickly

1346
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,695
And then you can just sort of pick up the tarp from one side and pour it into where you needed it

1347
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:02,303
Okay so what's up pretty basic hack and Alex really didn't think much of it

1348
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,119
But a few years later when he was taking business classes

1349
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Is a college

1350
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
He said to his dad you know

1351
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,775
Maybe we can make a sticker tarp to mix cement and then sell it

1352
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,615
But for us it was like this really difficult Lee Benigno

1353
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015
How do we create something that does what we wanted to do without knowing how to create it

1354
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:25,343
We didn't really we're not experts in the textile industry

1355
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
We know how to mix concrete and that's that's it

1356
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,719
So in order to Market a mixing bowl

1357
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,023
That people would actually want to buy

1358
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:39,423
Alex had to invent a tarp that would form the pain of a bowl when you held it so the cement wouldn't spill out

1359
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,239
Another tarp had to be tough and water

1360
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:48,639
Open even after he and his dad found just the right material is called a polyester denier blend and

1361
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
It's coated with PVC

1362
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,967
Even after they found that

1363
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
They still had to find a way to make

1364
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
The actual Matt

1365
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:01,695
I was calling people in China and Mexico trying to just see like okay who can make the sand

1366
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
I thought it would be easy

1367
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,023
And that took

1368
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
Years to do

1369
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,703
We finally got the mat manufactured a few years ago but when they pitched it to their dream retailer

1370
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Home Depot

1371
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
Home Depot shed

1372
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
No

1373
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
And the funny thing is I spent in probably a year learning the same lesson over and over which is

1374
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,015
You're not going to get into Home Depot if you're a nobody

1375
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,343
So this is where a brand new business has to Pivot

1376
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
And that's exactly what Alex did

1377
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,975
He figured maybe he could get churches and Charities to

1378
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Baidu

1379
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Text Matt Sandlin

1380
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,583
Donate them to places that really needed them

1381
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,983
You know a huge amount of people that are impoverished in rural areas of the world that have absolutely nothing

1382
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,383
And they live on dirt floors of already bought the mats to help rebuild after natural disasters

1383
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,175
In places like Haiti in Mexico

1384
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,783
You know it started off as a slow tech product we just wanted to sell to make some money

1385
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
And

1386
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,391
It has transformed into an opportunity

1387
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
To help people

1388
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
That's Alex vandywork

1389
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,767
Co-owner along with his dad

1390
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
LC which make

1391
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
The mix

1392
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
For now the business is

1393
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:19,775
Not making a ton of money so Alex is still working with his dad construction company and keeping his day job

1394
