Perfect pear

11
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,760
What was the year was the first Wikipedia entry

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:28,416
The earliest article that anyone has found was an article on the letter q

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,816
And it was very sudden you just be the first person to say Africa is a continent and hit save

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,448
And what's not very good wrong and it start

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,104
From NPR how I built this

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists

17
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Stories behind the movements they don't

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
The story of Hope Jeanne whale started

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:08,608
Online encyclopedia as a side project to grow into one of the pillars

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Internet

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,408
Okay I'm going to read you the list of the top five most

22
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
Viewed websites

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
In the world

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
So number one

25
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Is

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Google

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
Then comes YouTube

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
And then Facebook

29
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
And then why do witches

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
China

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
The biggest search engine

32
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
And finally coming in at number five

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Wikipedia

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Imagine for a moment

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,120
That you are the founder of one of these

36
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Websites

37
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
How much are you worth

38
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
Forbes

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Annual list

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
And

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,408
Larry Page founder of Google sits 50 billion dollars

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,504
Mark Zuckerberg ageism out with about 70 billion

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
Each of the founders of Baidu are worth around 15 billion and the founders of YouTube walked away

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
What's half a billion each when they sold a Google back in 2006 and the founder of Wikipedia

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Jimmy Wales

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
V

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Most visited websites in the world

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,080
His personal Fortune is estimated to be not much more than $1000000

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
He is quite possibly

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
The least Rich internet Titan in the world

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
But I like a lot of famous founders

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,928
Entrepreneurs Legacy is likely to live on for centuries because he is in some ways

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
Like a modern-day Johannes Gutenberg

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
It's like Gutenberg Press made it possible to spread knowledge Beyond The Village or account

55
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,008
Wikipedia made it possible for every single person on Earth with an internet connection

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
To gain access to

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
Probably the biggest collection of knowledge ever assembled

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,968
Like a lot of the entrepreneurs we interview on the show

59
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Give me Well story starts with influential people and important events that happened

60
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Early in life

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Grew up in Huntsville Alabama weather

62
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Uncle owned a shop

63
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
It sold early

64
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Computers

65
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
It is too big Hobbies word

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Greenwood computers

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
And reading reading just about

68
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Anything he found interesting

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
Basically anything I get my hands on her including

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Simple all the time reading the encyclopedia

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
You know you

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
Hear about something and you want to learn more and you going to have sex

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
Find the article and read that

74
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
It was it was a beloved

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Wikipedia move it all use it

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Did you buy in the store or did

77
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
Did somebody like come to your house in the house

78
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Dora Dora when I was a baby

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
As the family Legend goes that somebody came to the

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
House and sold it

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
To my mother

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
Every year that was send out an annual update

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
Yeah

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
For example the article in the moon was updated when someone

85
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
Landed on the moon

86
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
And so they they were all these stickers and you would

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Take the sticker out and you would go to look up

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Moon you would find

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
The old article on the moon and you put in the sticker saying there's an update

90
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
My mom and I would do that

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
My first editing in a second

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
Jimmy eventually went to college in his home state of Alabama

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
And he was really good at complex mathematics

94
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
So good in fact that

95
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
He went on to do a PhD in finance

96
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
1982

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
Jimmy decided that he'll really wasn't the place

98
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Vim so

99
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,455
He left to take a job as an options Trader

100
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Chicago

101
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
What I was doing is really just trading like buying and selling everyday Arbitrage

102
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Modeling

103
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,767
Prices of different things to each other to look for opportunities to

104
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
Find imperfections in the market in pricing

105
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
So while you were in Chicago and the early 90s this was also around the time the internet starts to become

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,199
People like browsing the internet did you get into that I was I was really

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,319
But even when I was before I came to Chicago I was really getting into the internet

108
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
So what I was doing I had no life I was I just traded in the day and then we go home at night

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
I was working on my own web browser

110
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
You were making

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
Your own web browser like on the side like in your apartment

112
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,471
Just like sort of self-taught

113
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
Yeah I mean I'm very quantitative data analysis things like that

114
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Lunch program

115
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
I was a bad programmer by I can cook

116
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
I just remember very clearly

117
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
The day that Netscape went public and was worth as I recall 4.3 billion dollars

118
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
On the first day of training

119
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,255
And I have the

120
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,839
I've been convinced refused time that the

121
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,703
Internet was going to be really big and really important and really kind of fundamentally changed the world

122
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
And this was the moment when I felt like okay look the market is validating that like other people are singing at people really

123
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Investing money here

124
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,735
And so it was a bit of a transition. But it was really in 90

125
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,807
Essay about 98 is when I left Chicago

126
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
And I moved to San Diego and that was when I really

127
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,743
Decided I'm going to focus full-time on my internet ideas and

128
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
What's Jimmy settle down in San Diego

129
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
He founded a small internet search company

130
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
I called Bahamas

131
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
And because this was the late 1990s

132
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
During the.com Boom

133
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Company for paying top rate

134
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Advertise on the website

135
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,759
It's over the next few years those at dollars made it possible for Jimmy to pyra small staff

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Programmers

137
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
And they have the money to just

138
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Experiment

139
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
The idea was really at that time this is

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Pre Google

141
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Remember

142
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
The best web directory around was Yahoo

143
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,911
And Yahoo hired hundreds of people to go around in index manually by hand index

144
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Topics and categories on the web

145
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,079
I said we'll look maybe the community can do that maybe other people can help out and you

146
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
If you could get

147
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Thousands of people involved

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
It could be really bigger than

149
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
Yahoo's doing that was really the thought

150
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
So we allowed people to come in and build

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
An index

152
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
To any topic

153
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
If they were interested

154
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
We call it a web ring

155
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
I remember one of the first community members

156
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Came in and built

157
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Webring about

158
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,863
Jupiter

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Put it in with like

160
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Okay that's cool that's right now course

161
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
We doubled in all kinds of things we had

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
A few blogs

163
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
I remember my

164
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Business partner

165
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
The time was talking about

166
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Building what

167
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
To that I would say

168
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
His idea was sounded a lot like Facebook

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
But it was really more about

170
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,647
People reconnecting with people from their schools and universities with a classmates.com

171
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Kind of idea

172
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
But I'm keep in mind that

173
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
This was also where we

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
We started

175
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Nupedia

176
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
The predecessor to Wiki

177
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
Tell me about that because why you're at Bahamas

178
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
List

179
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
This thing new pediagrow

180
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
What what what what

181
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
I said at that promise we were always

182
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Experimenting

183
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
Thinking of new ideas a new car

184
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
Possibly new things to do

185
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
I was looking at

186
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
The model of

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Open source software

188
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Seeing that that work

189
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
I was also looking at

190
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
You know I promise we had community members who were building indexes to content they were in

191
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Interested in

192
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
So the idea of nupedia

193
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
What's the best clear up

194
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Look at that disable let's build an insect

195
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
PDF

196
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Volunteers contribute to it

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
And I just thought you know this this seems like

198
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
Low-hanging fruit actually I remember I was in a quite a panic when I had the idea to hurry up and get started because I thought it was so

199
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Obvious

200
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
So when I

201
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:56,063
Started nupedia I really thought that other competitors going to be out there but after

202
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,671
2 years it was still no one really competing with us because it maybe wasn't as obvious as I thought

203
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
And the idea was basically did just put a

204
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Make an online encyclopedia

205
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
At the time

206
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Really understand

207
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Wiki

208
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,935
The concept of a website anyone can add it

209
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
And also

210
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
We had

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
You know what's 7 stage review process

212
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Skin anything published

213
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,639
So how to work you would

214
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
You write an article for

215
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Eupedia and then went through

216
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Like seven stages before we published

217
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,599
Seven stages what I mean some of the stages had to do with first yet

218
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Posey article

219
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
Qualifications to write it

220
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
We had

221
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
Some stuff so Larry Sanger was the editor-in-chief

222
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
And he would

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
It was a whole process

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
Where about you could apply

225
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
Me to submit something and so forth and then

226
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
It would be copy editing

227
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Reviewers much like

228
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Academic review where you send it out to

229
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Experts in the field 4 review

230
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
And actually one of the things that

231
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
Was really a lightbulb Mama to my mind was

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
One of the first few articles that

233
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
Got through that process and was published we had it up on the web for

234
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,071
A few days I would say and suddenly it came to our attention somebody said hey this is really plagiarized

235
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Oh and we checked into an acai couch

236
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:19,263
So like somebody just copied the encyclopedia

237
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
But it was

238
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
It was not good

239
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
I realized

240
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
Even with all this process we built up to

241
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Prevent this

242
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,271
It was still plagiarism and that was a huge problem in the fact the only thing that

243
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Revealed it was

244
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
More people reading

245
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
People singing This is actually problem

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
And that

247
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,535
There's an old saying in the open source software world that

248
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow

249
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
I want that means

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,007
Oftentimes when your programming there's some kind of bug in your coat and you just cannot find it and if you get

251
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Another set of eyes on it

252
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
Sensitive eyes it becomes very obvious somebody will Spot It

253
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
And so

254
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
That concept does actually apply in Watts

255
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Areas of life

256
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
If you get a lot of people looking at something

257
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,367
People can say hey there's actually problem here that maybe nobody else noticed and then sometimes a fruit

258
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Oh yeah that's kind of obvious

259
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,999
So I read that within a year after launching eupedia

260
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
You the site produced a sum total of

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
21 article

262
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Doesn't sound like it was

263
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,799
Churning burning that was not good and in fact as we proceeded through that year

264
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
And I was very frustrated with the slow

265
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
Pace of progress

266
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
I decided to write an entry myself

267
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,575
But I just need to go through this process myself to see what's wrong with it or how can we improve it

268
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
So I decided to write

269
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
An article about Robert Merton

270
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Because

271
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
I'd read all of this

272
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Option pricing Theory

273
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Special

274
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
Back in Academia

275
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
South qualifier

276
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Enough to write a basic biography

277
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
I found it

278
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Very intimidating

279
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
Because I knew that they were going to take

280
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
My draft

281
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
And send it out to the most

282
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Prestigious Finance

283
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
Professors they could find to agree to review it and I was going to get

284
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Feedback

285
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
And it felt really a lot like rats

286
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,599
Yeah and that was really the moment when I said okay look this isn't going to work like this isn't Fun

287
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
We really have to make this a lot easier and a lot more open

288
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
I really crucial moment

289
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
The moment I tried to get something

290
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Through the system

291
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
So when do you work

292
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Working on new PDI and you were like sending these draft articles around

293
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
I guess probably

294
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
You like all over the country

295
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
How are you collaborating

296
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
Well I mean this was the thing one of the problems that nupedia had

297
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Is that

298
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
The only real

299
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Way to collaborate back then was

300
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
What's the email around a word doc

301
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
If you emailed around a word doc

302
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Then

303
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
The typical cases nobody responds for the worst cases five people

304
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Responding to both change the document

305
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
In different ways and now you got to figure out how to integrate that all

306
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
You know the the concept of a Wiki

307
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Which is a website anyone can edit

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
Was actually invented by guy called Ward Cunningham

309
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Lovely great

310
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Programmer

311
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
Wiki Hawaiian word

312
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Which means quick tan

313
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Collaboration

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Intellij idea is that

315
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
There's a document on the web but anybody can come along and edit it

316
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
And save it

317
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,535
We were the first to really say hey let's use that tool

318
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Building encyclopedia

319
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
Sogeti it was you would

320
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Eat you find out about this

321
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Wiki soccer Anythink

322
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Alex democratizes process

323
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Writing articles throw it up and everyone

324
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
And the entire Community will

325
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
What kind of cross reference in check-in

326
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Well I mean

327
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,271
Equal or more organically than that we had a good-sized community of people

328
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Who are working on new PDF

329
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
And so these people were

330
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
All very eager people who love the concept of a free encyclopedia for everyone and their own language that was a

331
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
A really exciting

332
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Concept

333
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,447
And so initially we thought we'll let's start this as a tool for that community so

334
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
It'll still be nupedia but we're going to use this Wiki

335
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
As a way for that Community to begin to work together little more efficiently

336
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
And I made the decision

337
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
To put it up

338
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
Domain name wikipedia.com rather than

339
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Keep it on nupedia

340
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Because we weren't really sure like

341
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
We have a lot of academics and although very serious people on the mailing list

342
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
And seemed a bit

343
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
Have a crazy idea and we thought they might find it offensive

344
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,655
And so we said okay let's just set up on a different domain and see what happens but of course

345
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
The history is that

346
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Wikipedia very very quickly outstrip nupedia

347
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,591
In terms of the content created in the quality and everything else

348
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
I should know this

349
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
To me but I don't what was the

350
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
What's the first

351
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Wikipedia entry

352
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Unfortunately

353
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
There was no history kept of the very early days

354
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
The earliest history was lost

355
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
So don't really know that the earliest article that anyone has found

356
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
I was an article

357
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
On the letter

358
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Q

359
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
And

360
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
I'm sure that was not the first article in Wikipedia I know the first words and we can

361
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Wikipedia

362
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
They were hello world and I know because I typed

363
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
And then I started doing list of things

364
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
So I guess you laundry

365
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
Wikipedia in January of 2001

366
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Nupedia still

367
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,927
In like two weeks you had more articles on Wikipedia the new pedia generated

368
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Previous two years

369
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
That's right yeah yeah of course as you mention earlier that

370
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Summit County warrants

371
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
It was a pretty minor achievement a month since but it wasn't a opener

372
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
It was like why we got this great community and

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
People just started right in

374
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
Making articles on various random things and

375
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Other people editing them

376
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
And

377
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Is lot of pent-up

378
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Excitement about

379
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
Let's just get started building this isn't the the change

380
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
From really this

381
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
Huge very intimidating process

382
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,903
That was not very collaborative to being able to say

383
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
You know and it in those early days it was very sudden you just be the first person to say

384
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Africa is a continent and hit save

385
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
And what's not very good

386
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
But it's not wrong and

387
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
It's a start. That was very thick

388
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
Vvid that you could actually

389
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Chainsaw

390
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
This is all being run out of

391
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
We're like

392
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
Did you have an office in San Diego or was it your apartment or what

393
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,783
Small office with this was during the Obama stay so we had

394
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
A few programmers and

395
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Cheap office in a warehouse

396
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Space

397
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,975
This is the period of time when ad Revenue was good

398
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
So we were able to just

399
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
How some people get started

400
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,655
I guess you very quickly realize that Wikipedia is canopy

401
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Can potentially be

402
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,495
You'd like it seemed clear like within the first

403
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Months of year

404
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Yeah it did it did I mean it

405
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,455
Remember looking at a list of the top websites at the time

406
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,087
And there was an encyclopedia reference kind of site at ranked at number 50 and I thought

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
See if we do a really good job we might be

408
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,231
Number 100 or maybe even in the top 50

409
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,815
But there was always this idea of like this could be a big thing

410
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
If we can figure out how to do it you can have a huge impact

411
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
In just a minute

412
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
When Jimmy Wales was faced with the question of how Wikipedia was going to make money he decided

413
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
And it wasn't

People often think annuities are too conservative to complex or only for retirees

Welcome back to how I built this from

440
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
NPR

441
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Gyros

442
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
In the early days

443
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
Jimmy Wales was able to get WIC

444
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Wikipedia up and running

445
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
And he was funding it with money you from

446
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
His first internet startup

447
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
Thomas was run

448
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Ads

449
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
The.com boom was in high gear but then of course kmvt.com crash

450
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
And all that add money

451
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,791
Get dried up pretty fast and vomits would eventually have to shut down completely

452
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
But at the same time Wikipedia was growing

453
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,983
And Jimmy had to figure out how to keep it growing without a lot of cash

454
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,359
There was no money really to support Wikipedia but it didn't cost a lot of money it was really community-driven

455
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
And so

456
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
One of the reasons that

457
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Wikipedia

458
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
Became a huge success I would say

459
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Ironically is

460
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
The lack of funds

461
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Because

462
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,767
If I have had the money if I'd gone to Silicon Valley and convince somebody to

463
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
Give me millions of dollars to start this

464
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Then your natural instinct if you have any problem on the site

465
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
Is this okay we just need to hire some

466
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Moderators

467
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
And we're going to make decisions when I have stuff

468
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Members who decide things

469
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,175
And instead it was no money we couldn't hire anybody so as a community working together we had to

470
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Firearm Solutions

471
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
We had to say

472
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,087
You know what are the software Solutions we need to be able to control for vandalism and then

473
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,671
Imagine we have a really really tough editorial decision

474
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Have to make how do we make those decisions

475
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
All of those things

476
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Happened

477
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Because there was no money to hire anyone

478
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Our people

479
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Prevented the rise of

480
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Amor natural

481
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Set of solutions

482
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
And who was managing it was

483
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Is it just you

484
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
And Lori Singer

485
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
The two of you

486
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,663
Yeah I mean we had other employees who were helping out

487
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
And this and that

488
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,039
You know it's basically we had to think a lot about

489
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,647
How to glue the cleaning the right direction you know there were a lot of really complicated questions around

490
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,183
Okay when do we ban people

491
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
When do we block people from editing when I when do we think

492
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
They've gone too far and a lot of the editorial policy

493
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
You know you have questions like

494
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
To what extent do we allow peep

495
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
People to write essay

496
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Commentary

497
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Decor

498
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Put jokes in article

499
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Neutral

500
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Point of view is like Ark

501
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Core belief and so on

502
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
But all those decisions had to be made and they were made

503
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
In discussions with

504
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Community in

505
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
You must have known to me at this point

506
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
And just wanted them to that

507
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
Wikipedia was growing supervisor

508
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
And it was going to be

509
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Could potentially be

510
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Huge

511
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
You decide a r I guess around 2000

512
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
3

513
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
2

514
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Basically create a nonprofit organization

515
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Wikipedia what was that

516
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
The thinking of

517
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Why'd you do that

518
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Set a review things going on there so

519
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
First of all

520
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
This was still the depth of the.com crash

521
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
There was no obvious business

522
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Smaller

523
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,160
The community of volunteers very much wanted it to be in a non-profit when I thought that had to be

524
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Taken

525
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Consideration

526
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,024
And it finally for me it just made sense like it was

527
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,168
Aesthetically it just seemed like the right thing that Wikipedia my ambitions for week

528
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Wikipedia

529
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
To become a really important

530
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
Moments in history in a really important cultural contribution

531
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
Really made a non-profit I'm a much more sensible option in India

532
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
You know I think if we'd gone in a different route

533
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
It would be very different

534
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
You can interview

535
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,904
2 /. What's it like. And you said

536
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
Imagine a world in which

537
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
Every single person on the planet

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Is giving free

539
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,072
Access to the sum of all human knowledge

540
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
This amazing idea

541
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
But I wonder

542
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
Why you could not have done that same thing

543
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
And still

544
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
Cats on Wikipedia

545
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Yeah I mean so here's the thing

546
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
If you think about the

547
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
DNA of any organization

548
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
It's very difficult to

549
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Stop an organization

550
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Shin from following the money

551
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Wikipedia is a non-profit

552
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
And as a nonprofit We could run ads

553
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
No legal prohibition on nonprofit

554
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
Running ads is that as a means of support sure

555
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
Yet

556
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
Cuz the organization tend to follow the money then suddenly inside the organization people would start carrying a lot more

557
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
More about art

558
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Traffic in

559
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Highly developed

560
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Advertising marketing

561
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
We would begin to care more about which

562
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
She does your reading

563
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Because if you're reading about

564
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Queen Victoria

565
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
Differently very little to sell to you and there's probably the ad rates are very poor

566
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
If you're reading about

567
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
Tesla cars or

568
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Vacations in Las Vegas

569
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,608
We would have an incentive to start creating content

570
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
That would drive higher ed revenues which

571
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Just really not

572
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
What we wanted to wear in a second

573
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
PDA we don't think about adding

574
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Features that might drive

575
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Pageviews

576
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,176
For traffic we just think about how do we make the encyclopedia better and how do we reach more people

577
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
Tickling the developing world

578
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
That's just like fundamental

579
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
What this is all about

580
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
So when you basically said rights nonprofit

581
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
We're not going to have any advertising

582
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
We're going to it's going to be use regenerate

583
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Content how do you even

584
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Fun

585
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,864
How we going to get the money to even funded the pain the servers and

586
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,680
Yeah well what happened was the main reason that

587
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
We went ahead

588
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,032
And set up the nonprofit was exactly thinking of that

589
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
For the future but I had no idea

590
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Whether it was going to be

591
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
Set up a nonprofit in June and

592
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
At that time we were running on

593
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Two or three servers

594
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Bento

595
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Then we had this

596
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Disaster was a Christmas Day when

597
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
2/3 service

598
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
Crashed and I had to scramble to get the site running on one server

599
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
It was painfully slow and so forth

600
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
And it was clearly obvious.

601
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
Because the traffic kept doubling that we were going to have to buy a bunch of servers

602
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
And so that was the first time that

603
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
I decided to do

604
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Fundraising

605
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616
To ask people on the site to get money in

606
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
These days we call it crowdfunding and it

607
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
You know

608
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,504
Everybody knows it but back then it was not a normal way of doing things

609
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
I remember very clearly that I had hoped

610
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
To raise about $20,000

611
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
A month's time

612
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,768
But in about two weeks time we had raised nearly

613
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Sofia the First

614
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Fundraiser was

615
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
A huge success

616
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Some people really

617
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Said hey Will

618
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
This is great we really want to support this and so

619
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Lot of small donors net

620
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
Of course today is the model

621
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Wikipedia.

622
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
People

623
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,920
Who believe in Wikipedia who think it's useful in their lives

624
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Site

625
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Hey I should chip in

626
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,808
When did you soap soap Wikipedia really kind of started

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Blow up in

628
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Early 2000 when did you

629
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,464
When were you first sir cognizant of that when did you realize that

630
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
Wikipedia was

631
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
Becoming really big like part of the

632
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
National conversation

633
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,448
I think they were there a few moments but I think one of the most important ones

634
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:50,080
There's a guy John siegenthaler Junior who is a very esteemed journalist

635
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Kia

636
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Call me

637
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Complain about it

638
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Entry

639
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
When was this

640
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
2005

641
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
And

642
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
He said hey there's a problem because

643
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Wikipedia says that

644
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,208
I was briefly suspected of

645
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
Having something to do with the Kennedy assassination of this is a man who

646
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,864
Was one of the pallbearers at Robert Kennedy's funeral

647
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
If I remember the story correctly so big friend of the Kennedy family

648
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
And the store was absolutely untrue

649
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
And

650
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Muncie

651
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Called

652
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
About 10 minutes

653
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
To get that fix

654
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
Extend and change them we looked into how it happened and so forth

655
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
A problem resolved but then he wrote this scathing editorial in USA Today about the site

656
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
And it got a lot of attraction

657
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,672
That story so we had this

658
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Really big thing in the night

659
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
They tracked me on CNN to yell at me and Sophie

660
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Suddenly we're in all the Press everywhere

661
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Are traffic

662
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,168
Really

663
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
Exploded

664
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
Because of all the news coverage so that was the

665
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,824
That was the upside but that's not the way you want it to explode

666
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
But in the end that was actually a mama.

667
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
Important for us how come why

668
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,552
Yeah so this this lad in the community to a real reflection on

669
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,160
Quality on sourcing this is when we

670
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
Came up with the biography of living

671
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,792
Persons policy and really started to say look if it's

672
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,328
A biography of a person

673
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,448
Then anything negative in the article really needs to have a good quality source

674
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Because

675
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
That's just not acceptable to have

676
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
Negative things about people that

677
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Aren't true

678
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,920
Became quite Vigilant about that I'm after intercourse is always

679
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Possibility of

680
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
What is happening and so forth and it does happen

681
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
But the queen is very very

682
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
Vigilant about it

683
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
Keep anything like that out of

684
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,976
Is music is Wikipedia on a day-to-day basis everyone is I use everyone

685
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Use it use it

686
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,792
I remember that time

687
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
John seigenthaler article

688
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
2005

689
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,192
Umpr we were not allowed to use Wikipedia as a source and it wasn't

690
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
NPR news organization

691
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Wikipedia is not considered a reliable

692
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
Sorts and it just shows you sort of

693
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Yeah well I mean

694
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Think that should

695
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
It still be your pillow

696
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Wikipedia is

697
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,832
Quite good it is definitely not perfect then what all we say is

698
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Wikipedia is the place to go to get the

699
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
Questions are the answers

700
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
It's the way to get yourself oriented in the contacts

701
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
And I always say

702
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
You want to talk page

703
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,120
Age of any article and see what are the wikipedians struggling with

704
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
If they're saying

705
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,984
GE you know this source is this and these sources say that in the

706
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Has to be complicated that might be the most inches

707
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
Question you can ask

708
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Let's get to the bottom of this

709
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
Is there conflicting information out there

710
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
And also you know

711
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
If you want it

712
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Use

713
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
Wikipedia as a starting point then

714
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,088
You can always go to the footnotes and go to the actual source and that's why

715
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
What you should do

716
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
I just cannot imagine

717
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Running

718
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
This volunteer

719
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
Organization with hundreds of thousands of Millions

720
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
To work voluntarily editing

721
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Syttende

722
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,216
Did you ever just like get you so

723
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,544
Don't want to do it anymore

724
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
It's not really a nice thing is

725
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,760
I remember the very early days I would get up at night and check the site cuz I

726
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
Was convinced that somebody's going to come in and trash it overnight which never happened and then quickly I realized

727
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,928
Oh yes Vandal did show up at

728
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
3 a.m. my time last night but guess what somebody

729
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,096
It was an uncommon remember was up in Australia next week

730
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
Problem it so you can understand like communities do inherently scale I think

731
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
That is part of

732
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
What helps me not

733
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
We are one body

734
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,432
So we're now in this phase

735
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
The history of the internet

736
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
People fake news in like that term

737
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Chinese reasons but with so much

738
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Information

739
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Looks real that's

740
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
Real human history

741
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,024
But now because there is so much information available

742
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Sometimes difficult

743
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
Discern what's real and what's not and I

744
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
And I wonder whether

745
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
One of the challenges

746
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Wikipedia is

747
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
Reasonable people are disagreeing about

748
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Basic facts

749
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
How do you reconcile

750
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Adam

751
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
Is Wikipedia a deal with that

752
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
The elements 01

753
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
When we think about the quality of sources

754
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
That's a really core

755
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
Sitting in Wikipedia and we have a lot of

756
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
Discussions and debates tonight I think a fairly sophisticated approach

757
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
The thing about the sources

758
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,168
I agree with you I don't like the term fake news but the original use of the term was really about

759
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Clearly

760
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Completely made up website

761
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Look like news sites

762
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,104
With no concern for the truth with outrageous headlines and so on

763
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,432
Those kinds of sites have had almost zero impact

764
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Wikipedia because

765
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
Wow

766
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
They might do well to share on Facebook

767
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
Something that comes from a publication called the Denver Guardian because

768
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,768
It looks like a new site and Denver everybody knows Denver's a city in America and

769
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
Guardian sounds like a newspaper so

770
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Wikipedia's would take one look at it and say

771
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
I've never heard of that

772
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Paper

773
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
That stuff doesn't really get into Wikipedia

774
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,848
A broader problem that I am concerned about is

775
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
Right now that the Trust in Media

776
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
In the US but also around the world

777
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Really at an all-time low

778
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
Peanut butter

779
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
It's a tough problem and I think it's a societal problem to say

780
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,744
Look we really do need quality information most people are very passionate about

781
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
Wanting to be told the truth

782
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Yeah you know that the best way to

783
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Prepare people for

784
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,728
Authoritarian rule is not to indoctrinate them into an authoritarian philosophy

785
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,800
But you make them believe that there's no such thing as truth

786
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
And that's that's a trend that I'm not happy about

787
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
How many did you know how many weeks

788
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
Wikipedia pages that are today in English

789
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Green apple

790
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
There's just over 5 million

791
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
So

792
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
So total probably

793
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
In all languages

794
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
40 million

795
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Close to 50

796
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
+ 250

797
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Do you know do you know how many people contribute to

798
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Wikipedia

799
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
Around the world

800
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,776
It's something around 75000

801
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
People every month who make at least five edits

802
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
It's probably three to five thousand

803
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
The core community

804
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
People who are making

805
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
100 mm or at it

806
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
And so that's

807
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,648
Unwanted people but it's not as many people as some might think

808
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
Dark Horse

809
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,952
Making 5 edits

810
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
In a month

811
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
That's not a huge amount of participation but you're pretty you know you're around

812
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
A lot more people who just make one it a year

813
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
But in terms of a real Community it's probably that

814
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
75 South

815
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
Jimmy what

816
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Motivates

817
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
75000

818
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,872
People are few hundred thousand people to

819
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Donate

820
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
Hundreds of hours of a Time

821
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Every year

822
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
For free

823
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
To do this

824
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
Yeah I think it's two things

825
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
So

826
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
First you know the mission

827
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Free encyclopedia

828
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
Everyone in the world

829
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Is meaning

830
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
You could spend your

831
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Hobbytime playing

832
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Grand Theft Auto

833
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,704
Doing something else and the world wouldn't be any better off when you're done and

834
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
If you spend a few hours editing Wikipedia

835
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,824
You can go to sleep and think yeah it was productive

836
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
The world is a little bit better than it was

837
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
And someone somewhere will benefit

838
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
That's great

839
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
Evan also just fun

840
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,320
People you get to meet people are interested in the things you're interested in the motor house

841
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
School

842
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,928
Ethos of the community is to say

843
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Look no personal attacks

844
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
We're here to discuss

845
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Content

846
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,352
If you go on the discussion page for

847
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
A controversial

848
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Protopic

849
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
You're not there to just debate that topic

850
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
Can do that lock the place on the internet what do you get a Wikipedia

851
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
A debate about

852
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
How do we improve this article

853
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
And that's just a refreshing kind of feeling

854
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
That's a lot of people really find it

855
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Suits their personality

856
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Do you do you know what the revenue

857
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
He is like angry at me for

858
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
Wikipedia from donations

859
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Yeah Revenue I should know the number exactly off the top of my head but I don't but I think last year

860
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,840
Was around 85 million dollars

861
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Just from donations

862
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
Primarily from small donors

863
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
That's important understand that

864
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,544
When the community gets together to debate something about what they want

865
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
Have Wikipedia say when a policy should be

866
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,408
There's never a question of will what will the Thunders

867
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
Yeah

868
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,344
Over the years we've really tried to run the organization in a very financially conservative way

869
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Every year we try to build our Reserves

870
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
A lot of our donors one of the things that they really want

871
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
From Wikipedia is that

872
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Wikipedia be safe

873
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
You can soak

874
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
That rises to say okay

875
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
They don't want us to run on

876
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
They don't want us to run

877
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,008
Nearly a break-even of nearly going broke every year we need to be stable

878
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
And that's been a real value

879
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
When you think about

880
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
This

881
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Thing that you built

882
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
And your role in the house

883
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
History of

884
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
The internet

885
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
How much of of the success of

886
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
Wikipedia do you think it's because of

887
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
Your Brilliance in your hard work and how much

888
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Do you think

889
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Vlog

890
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Huge amount

891
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
To the lock

892
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
Brilliance and heart

893
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,888
Work okay maybe not so much I do think a component

894
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Of the successor

895
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,936
Wikipedia is that

896
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm

897
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,752
Very friendly and nice person

898
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,824
I'm very laid-back and so therefore

899
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,920
I was able to work in a community environment where

900
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,760
People basically yell at you and you just have to kind of roll with it and

901
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
You're in some sense a leader but

902
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
You can't tell anyone what

903
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
Do the volunteers so you have to work with

904
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
I love and reason

905
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Move people along in the interviews

906
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
So where do you think that

907
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
I am not

908
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Irrelevant to the process

909
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
But I also think that

910
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
You know the community is amazing

911
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
And the luck

912
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
The timing

913
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Really

914
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
Kidding that moment when

915
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
It was possible

916
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Ulta Bill Wikipedia

917
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Jimmy Hughes

918
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Scene

919
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
The estimate

920
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
That

921
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
And that if we can pedia wore a for-profit

922
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
It

923
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
Could be worse

924
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,320
At least

925
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
5 billion dollars

926
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Maybe more

927
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
Does it mean anything to you

928
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
No not really I mean it's

929
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
People

930
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,400
They love to write about Jimmy Wells is not a

931
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
Billionaire

932
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,264
And does it actually the articles without headlines

933
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,336
Exactly an infirmity that's all a bit odd because

934
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
You know my life is

935
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
Unbelievably interesting

936
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:40,320
I have the ability to meet almost anyone in the world who I want to meet

937
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Wells founded Wikipedia

938
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,768
On the largest chain of car dealers

939
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:55,168
Across the southern part of America whatever like not that interesting

940
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
God I do I do think that

941
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,312
Remember me remember Wikipedia

942
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
And that's really really something I mean that's something that you can really hardly even get your mind around

943
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
Comparisons to the Gutenberg Press right this is the biggest of dissemination of knowledge in modern world history

944
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Well yeah but I don't know it's been embarrassing to talk about it that way

945
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,376
Jimmy Wales founder of Wikipedia

946
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
Oh wait a few years ago Jimmy got grief for trying to change his own Wikipedia

947
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:38,176
A big No-No is entry showed he was born on August 8th 1966

948
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Which is what his birth certificate also says

949
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,112
But it was a mistake because according to his mother Jimmy was actually born

950
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:51,232
Shortly before midnight on August 7th

951
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Only to be confronted by Angry Wikipedia editors who demanded documentary evidence

952
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,448
Which of course he could not finish because

953
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,288
All he had to go on was his mother's version of when it happened

954
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
And please do stick around because in just

955

Cam

967
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Built

968
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Thanks so much for

969
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Sticking around

970
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,872
You built that the story starts almost

971
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
20 years ago

972
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,224
When Florence Wonderwall was working in fashion

973
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Helping to pay

974
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
Clothes that models wear

975
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Which sounds like a pretty cool guy

976
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
But I was not happy with the work itself

977
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
I really was missing the creative

978
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,328
And the designing of things Florence was missing designing

979
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
Things because well she's a designer

980
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
She grew up in France

981
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,008
And then move to Atlanta where she did that fashion job

982
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
What you want

983
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Start something

984
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
For herself

985
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,224
And I need to create a company you I need to do something that's going to come for me I was going to cut into some kind of a spy

986
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,296
And Florence was looking around for something to in

987
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,600
Spider her and as it happens

988
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
Her mom was working in

989
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Peru at the time

990
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
And what her mom invited Florence

991
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
Send a friend to come visit

992
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
We had no idea

993
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
What we were going there for

994
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,192
But we exploring what the locals we're making into

995
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
Business that could be done with that

996
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,872
Susan were exploring the local markets

997
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
In Peru and they can't process

998
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Finger puppets

999
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
You probably have seen them be little

1000
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Cute animals made out of yarn

1001
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
People have been doing this for many years

1002
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
And for some reason they're really like we just fell in love with him

1003
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Sofa Ronson Suzanne

1004
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
And bought a bunch

1005
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,256
Church of the puppets and they started to sell them in Atlanta

1006
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
And they did pretty well

1007
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Cat thinking

1008
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
I don't really want to sell someone else's work

1009
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
I want to design my own thing

1010
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,568
I was thinking what is it that children really want what is it that children like

1011
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
Like when I was

1012
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,408
A kid what is it that was confirming my more

1013
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Most vulnerable moment

1014
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
And so he was really

1015
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,320
This dog is little companion and I thought

1016
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,648
I could really turn this thing into a doll

1017
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Seth Rollins design her own doll

1018
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
And she took those designs

1019
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,888
Back to Peru where she gave them to artisanal Knitters to get one for her the first.

1020
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:44,288
You said it was too traditional in Alexander was narrow and then the arms and the different shape to it and I really want

1021
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
Wanted to do something modern

1022
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
Chapter three years

1023
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Of working with different Knitters

1024
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Peru

1025
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Florence and Susan

1026
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Finally had a doll

1027
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,552
They were ready to sell this really cuddly

1028
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
Squishy

1029
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,952
Creature that's needed and so you get a sense that it could have been

1030
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
Done by your grandmother however

1031
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,840
The look of it is really modern the dolls are stitched

1032
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
With these simple and

1033
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
Clean lines

1034
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
And they got these long arms and legs

1035
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,848
Generic as a dog and a Frog bunny

1036
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
In 2003

1037
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,176
And Florence decided to name them

1038
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,992
Bla bla dolls and it's just so playful

1039
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
Really works for kids company and as soon as I said it's another that's it that's it

1040
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,392
Grecian actually launched boutiques

1041
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Across the US

1042
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Became interested

1043
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,768
End table dog even started to appear on

1044
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,352
TV shows like Homeland and in Celebrity magazines

1045
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,752
They became so popular they inspired copycat and wow blah blah is still relatively small

1046
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:52,895
Lawrence and Susan say they are now considering bringing in an outside investor to help scale the brand

1047
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
And they're in talks about doing a possible

1048
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,551
TV show they have a life of their own that we

1049
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,879
We confusing them it's so it's a really beautiful story

1050
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
By the way

1051
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
Totally coincidentally

1052
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,999
During a recent slumber party at the

1053
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
Arroz household

1054
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,679
Several of the boys have been to bring along their favorite stuffed animals including at least

1055
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,471
