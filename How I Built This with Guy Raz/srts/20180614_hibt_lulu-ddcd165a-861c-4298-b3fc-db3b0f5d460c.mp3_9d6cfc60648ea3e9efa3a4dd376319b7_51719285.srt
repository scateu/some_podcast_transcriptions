Into a fashion statement

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
And along the way

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Delta breakout brand

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
Worth billions

34
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
So used to be that the clothes you wore

35
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
To the gym

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080

High School logo

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
Kind of short shorts.

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Jay would have worn on the back

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Basketball court

45
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Anyway most of the superior was

46
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
Cotton Bass

47
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Baggy

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
Look so great and honestly nobody really cared

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Add one job to do

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Which way is to sweat

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
At the gym

52
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
But at some point in

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
In the past ten or if

54
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
15 years

55
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
All of that

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Change

57
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Because simile

58
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
The clothes you wore to work out

59
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
We're also the clothes you could wear today

60
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
The grocery store or at a restaurant or

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Even at work

62
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Soap for better or worse

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
People were wearing their gym clothes

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Outside of the gym on purpose

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
It was called athleisure

66
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Chip Wilson

67
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
He was one of us

68
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
I am here

69
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072
The brand he built out of his house in Vancouver

70
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Is now worth more than

71
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
14 billion dollars

72
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
Now before I go on

73
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Address

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Elephant in the room

75
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Chip

76
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
I said some things that are well

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Rude and boorish

78
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,736
He's put his foot in his mouth on several occasions he's embarrassed the company

79
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
And you will hear about some of that later on in the show

80
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
But he's also an open book

81
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
An open to getting grilled all about his life

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
He's not a conscious Media training sound bites

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Sky witches in park

84
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
What makes him interesting

85
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Because that sort of power chip grew up

86
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Without any pretension

87
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
Middle class kid in Calgary Canada

88
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Chip was athletic he played hockey

89
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Football

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
His dad taught phys-ed at the local high school

91
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
His mom

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Weather

93
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
She live for it it's worth

94
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Total passion was

95
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,392
She tried to make clothing for the kids but of course we didn't we never like what she made for us

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Bedtime

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
You know if I want to spend time with my mom it had to be as her foot in the sewing room

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
So did you learn how to sew a like from an early age

99
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Seahawks

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
I can definitely so

101
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
But more so I think it was working with the Butterick patterns and watching my mom

102
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Lay them down on the

103
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Fabric Indian

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
And then how she move them and twisted them in order to save fabric

105
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
I only see how important that is because

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,624
Once I got into big production and you'd lay fifty to a hundred layers of fabric down

107
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
When you can save even

108
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
567 in of fabric that can mean thousands of dollars

109
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,839
That before chip would go on to sew and design clothes for a living

110
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
He actually got his

111
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
First real job

112
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
Add an oil company

113
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Working a

114
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Ruling button

115
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Credibly lucrative job

116
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
On the Alaska oil pipeline

117
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Almost

118
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,359
2 years

119
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
How much should you walk away with so much gas

120
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
Well interesting in today's dollars probably about 600,000 and walking back then it was about a hundred

121
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
75000 American

122
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
19

123
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
You were just as cash and and that's

124
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
Simply cuz it was all of this money to work on the Alaska weather

125
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Brighton

126
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,775
You know but I can tell you know I traded my life in for money I mean there was no girls there was you know nothing there

127
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
For you know you

128
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
You work so

129
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
I always wondering if everyone got that offer

130
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
Opportunity would they have made the same thing out of

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
But I didn't

132
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
Pretty good use your 18 or 19 or 20

133
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
What did you do what you do with the money

134
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Will a turtle's head

135
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
Three goals in Alaska when I wasn't stolen my own house by the age of 20

136
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
I have to be in my own business by the age of 30 and retard Buy

137
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
By 40

138
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
Retirement meaning that I was doing exactly what I want

139
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
To do so

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
So I did I bought a house and then I finished up my degree and I work for an oil company

141
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
Removed

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
Right now I guess in like the late 70s

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
That's right I'm pretty much at

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Around the time you graduate

145
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Colleger

146
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
Start to make

147
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Shorts

148
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Baggy shorts for men

149
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
Yeah because I didn't you know how yet

150
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Have to get what it was like at that time

151
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Men wore very short shorts that were very very

152
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Tight me know you only have

153
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
To look at

154
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Movies from the header

155
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Turn the lights to get that kind of

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Picture and.

157
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
And they made a lot of sense to

158
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Because

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
I had very big legs and I

160
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,391
I think because I was working out 3 times a day I was always in a constant sweat

161
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
And the idea of wearing shorts

162
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
All timers

163
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Very appealing

164
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Eventually

165
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
And these were like

166
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Flower printed like

167
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Loud Hawaiian like I'm up

168
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Give me the Trader Joe's like those shirts like that's

169
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
What the shorts look like

170
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,543
Yeah exactly but you know we have to see it in a context that

171
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
There was nothing like that

172
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Before everything else was

173
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
That are of

174
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
Brown rust off color okra

175
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
Yellow like solid colors it was

176
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
No brightness in the world at all that kind so that was a radical

177
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Sorry I started

178
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Because I couldn't get blouse

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,839
Flower prints in 2000 which is kind of what a person needs to go into business

180
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,655
I started doing what my mom did she quilt

181
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Fabric so I would

182
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,775
Get masses of different types of patterns of fabric and then I would

183
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
I cut them into squares and then I would

184
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Quilt them

185
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,711
And then in order to keep the stability of that I put up backing on it if black fabric

186
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
And then I realized I had

187
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
Reversible shorts only where they long and baggy in

188
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Reversible

189
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Really revolutionized

190
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,071
And then the skateboarder started taking them on because it kind of covers their knees

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Seldom somewhere

192
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,239
Well I mean that's the invention of a vertical retailing because I

193
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
Made about 300 pairs of the shorts up in 1980 and I went to the big department stores here in Canada and the

194
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,479
They would have nothing to do with them so I had my first inventory problem

195
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
So I thought well what am I going to do so I basically set up a lemonade stand for the shorts and

196
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
Calgary in the downtown mall in Calgary

197
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
And I had a

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
Partner girlfriend at the time

199
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
And so we did that

200
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Together and

201
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
In a week

202
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
You know we played all these shorts out and then a day would make like $1,000 a day selling the shorts and I was making like

203
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
$120 at the oil company so

204
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
Did wasn't tough to figure out

205
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
The master.

206
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,783
And what are these formats swimming shorts these are just like what like who would wear these shorts what would you be doing while wearing

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
Well these particular shorts you know I couldn't really

208
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,511
It was tough in the oil business of conservative Calgary

209
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Four people wear Prada suits and

210
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Cowboy boots to sell them on

211
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Loud

212
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Peggy

213
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Shorts and socks

214
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Originally

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Call the barbecue

216
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Two shorts because I needed to give

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Men needed an excuse to wear them I knew they won

218
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Underwear

219
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
But as you know a couple years went on that

220
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Begin that's when the skateboarding Market

221
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Took over from the surf mark

222
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
And the young boys me Noah

223
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
10 days

224
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
18 * 2

225
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
So this is

226
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
This is 1980

227
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
You've got barbecue shorts by the way the barbecue seasoning Calgary cast

228
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,791
Really short like a couple weeks

229
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
40 days you got 40 days to wear these shorts in Calgary

230
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
I mean not a brilliant

231
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Marketing move but it worked

232
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
1980 and then

233
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
It's the same time you were still working for this oil company on the side or or you were doing this on a circuit board

234
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
And how long before you quit the oil cover

235
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Well I had my goal of quitting at being in my own business by 30 so I worked through it all company for 5 years and

236
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,023
Quit on my birthday gift 30th birthday

237
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:43,935
Did you create a brand around around the barbecue shorts I called it Westby

238
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Beach which at the time was

239
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
I think it's

240
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Holly from being in San Diego and I was young and probably the

241
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
The incredible feeling I had from living on the beach

242
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Everyday my total kit

243
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Yeah when I was little

244
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Keira Knightley

245
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,343
Being in Calgary tells 1 to get back to the beach I was going to get back to the West Coast

246
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
Wake us right field best so that was the brand I built up around it

247
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,815
And who an insult initially your customers were in Calgary but how did you get the word out around

248
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Canada

249
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Well I went to

250
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
Candy was pretty easy because you know that

251
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
I got into it almost a decade

252
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Before anybody else I think

253
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,407
But in so I could slowly kind of move across like that we opened up a store in Toronto

254
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,271
But then I went to a trade show and signapore and then another one in Munich

255
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
And so you know

256
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
A person kind of comes out with something that's

257
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
So different like that

258
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
You know there's a lot of interest in

259
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
And then I had this sense looking 5 years in the

260
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Future that

261
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Skateboarding and surf markets were going to be

262
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Huge

263
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
By the

264
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
Sort of that time the mid-to-late

265
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
80s what were you

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Well

267
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
I mean the beautiful thing is I

268
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
When I formed a partnership with my

269
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
Two guys in Vancouver I moved to Vancouver

270
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
And then in sat

271
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
But starting in 83 in Calgary at started to do snowboarding and I could see snowboarding coming and Snowboard

272
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
He was going to be way bigger than

273
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
A surfer skate

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
And I didn't care about the

275
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,727
Boards and the boots in the bindings cuz for me that was low-margin hardgoods

276
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Where I knew all the money we

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
HP made in

278
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Clothing

279
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
Especially for us because it would take up the other eight months of the year which

280
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
We weren't really selling very much

281
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
And Snowboard clothing was

282
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Or five times the price of

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Surf & skate t-shirts and shorts

284
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Who is designing

285
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
The apparel that West Beechwood selling

286
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
Well I was that was my thing and I

287
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
You know if I look back at it now I mean I never had any money

288
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Free clothing when I was young I probably had

289
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
It's genetic

290
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Desire for eating

291
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
Kind of ideas that I had

292
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
I think part of it was

293
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
You know my size and I think part of it was

294
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,431
I wanted athletic clothing that actually fit me so I think there was

295
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Driven to both those

296
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
What were you making the stop by the way where's the closing theme

297
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,415
Well I'm making it in Calgary I found some Italian Couture designers that were

298
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Just like my mother they were at home and

299
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
They weren't working and they were amazing

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
So we set up a factory

301
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
And so if you can imagine

302
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
Almost everybody else in the apparel industry I think everybody else

303
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Beastly made clothing than wholesale

304
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Did somebody El Wright

305
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,943
Not only was I doing my own manufacturing but I own my own store so I

306
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Beasley taking the profit

307
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Set of two middlemen out of the

308
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
But you know the big

309
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,903
Revenue part of the business was in wholesale

310
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
But my wholesale business was losing $1000000 a year and then I had these two retail stores that were making $1000000

311
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,423
Because you have these retail stores

312
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
And they were doing well but you

313
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
User wholesale business which was losing money

314
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Well it was a quandary because I needed the volume from wholesale to get to economy of scale for duck

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Action to bring my

316
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Prices down

317
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,111
And because my prices were down my retail stores could make so much money

318
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
But I couldn't really make any money in

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Wholesale because

320
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Find me something

321
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
For $20 and I would have to sell it to Dick's Sporting Good

322
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
440

323
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
And then they would sell it

324
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
480

325
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Wearing my own Realty all stories than I was

326
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Wicked putting it in there for

327
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
420

328
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
And making $80

329
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
So there was a $60 profit

330
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
And so I kept thinking to myself how can I

331
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
Get to economy of scale production in that was the

332
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
You know that

333
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
The big Big Driver

334
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
And were you

335
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
I mean

336
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
What was your vision did you think this is going to work in at a con

337
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
Ruby the biggest snowboard apparel company in the world

338
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Sure I mean in in a

339
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Japan had just

340
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,423
Exploded so it's about 30% of all silver

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
And

342
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,823
The drive to grow in the grow fast knowing that

343
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
What I'd seen in Surf & skate wear

344
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
It started off

345
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
What three companies went to 500 and then went down to

346
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
3 again

347
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
I need the same thing was hacking to happen in snowball

348
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Morning soap

349
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
When's the right time to get in

350
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
What's the right time to build with

351
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,279
What's the right time to invest in windy get out with Saul's in the back of my mind and sure enough

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
You know probably in 90s

353
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
6 or so the Japanese Yen store

354
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Collapse

355
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
Starting to think that snowboarding was in

356
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
The cool thing to do anymore

357
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
And so the market was changing drastically and

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
We still weren't making any money be

359
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Because we were just

360
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Reinvesting

361
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Just to keep on top of

362
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
The competition

363
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
So you decide to sell

364
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Well yes

365
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,647
Wheaton result to a public company out of

366
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
Salem Oregon Morrow snowboards

367
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
And

368
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
You know we

369
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,423
Quite honestly could not make payroll on Friday and we sold Wednesday based on brand value only

370
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Repair iWatch with a good

371
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Johnny Cash

372
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
Well I had

373
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Partners and I had Banks

374
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
And I had private equity in there at that time

375
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
So I walked away with a million and that

376
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,271
Tax 800000 and then

377
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
You got a

378
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
You know I had peed myself probably 30 to $40,000 after 18 years so I

379
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
No I needed

380
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
The car and I used to

381
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,351
Buy a house of some sort which was the best thing I ever did

382
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Living in Vancouver

383
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Okay so okay so here you are

384
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
Early forties and end

385
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
What were you going to do

386
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Well actually my goal was

387
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
To be financially independent

388
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
840 so I failed in that goal

389
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
And

390
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
You know what

391
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Thinking about what I wanted to do and

392
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
And then I

393
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,159
And I had this thing I have always bleeding this three times thinks when I see something three times and I

394
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,463
Moving they move really quickly

395
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
So it's Cena

396
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,095
I seen an article in the paper about yoga at cine poster

397
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,191
Telephone post with a little rip off about the yoga class and

398
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,263
Then I overheard a conversation in a coffee shop

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
About yoga and I went well

400
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
I went to this yoga class

401
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Yeah I know

402
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,015
It went from about 6 to 30 people in 30 days I was the only guy in the class

403
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
And it's any

404
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Jim and Heating

405
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Course I'm always noticing

406
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,231
Athletic bodies and clothing and outfits I mean

407
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
I'm really a big data guy around you know I look at everybody talked to bottom and I have analyzed it and

408
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
At the time

409
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,775
The fashion of Jim's was to wear your very worst clothing

410
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Mostly because Polly

411
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,431
90% of people in gyms were men and

412
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
And you you know you knew you were going to sweat in that you were going to get ugly in it and you just want to throw in the wash afterwards so nobody

413
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Thought about

414
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Athletic clothing being nice

415
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,487
Certificate inside your head hear you're in the Chevy class

416
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
And you are observing

417
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
What everyone's wearing

418
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,167
You must have been thinking already I have a business idea

419
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
When did you start to

420
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Add two and two and say wait a minute

421
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
I can make this this type of clothing like

422
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
How do you go from one

423
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,943
Yoga class to that thought was an instant that it take a week to take a month

424
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Well

425
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
I wasn't doing anything

426
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,367
And I think I was looking for what my life was going to be and so

427
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
What I saw in yoga was exactly the same thing I saw on surf skate snow plow

428
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
So like I said it went from 6 to 30

429
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
People

430
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
In 30 days and I extrapolated out

431
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
2

432
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
5 years away and I weigh

433
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
This is going to be

434
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Substantial

435
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
No I didn't think it was going to be as big as surfskate or snowboarding and I had really no idea at the time

436
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
It would be a hundred times bigger

437
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,295
It's a big deal right this like your ear spotting a trend

438
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
Like really early

439
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
1997

440
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,207
Until you probably can't fully explain why you were able to

441
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
See that trend

442
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
But it was just

443
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
Dislike intrinsic feeling you had you just

444
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
A part of you just knew that this was going to be a

445
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
Yep you can I was extrapolating

446
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
But

447
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,615
You also have to get as probably the only person in the world thinking about

448
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
Technical clothing outside of mountain Club

449
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
So

450
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,575
You know think the real question my mind is do I use this or do I

451
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Just say

452
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
You know that I called

453
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
I called my 18 years at West Beach my 18 year MBA

454
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
And so

455
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:47,167
You know do I just leave all that information behind or do I say you know I've got something here and it's

456
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
It is worth using

457
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
After the break at Rick Wilson eventually use that 18 year MBA to graduate

458
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407

Hey bucket back to how I built this from NPR

481
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
So after attending is

482
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
First yoga class

483
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Vancouver in a late night

484
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
90s

485
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Chip Wilson had this idea for his next

486
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Clothing

487
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
But it took him a while before he acted on

488
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,551
Yeah I had to read an article in the paper one day that told me

489
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,879
That's 60% of the graduates at a university where women

490
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
In 1998

491
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Then I went wow you know

492
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,327
Something really really big is going to come out at this and that is

493
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,191
We're going to end up with a market that's never occurred before and that is that

494
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
22.

495
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
35 year old

496
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Single

497
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Professional

498
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,199
Well-traveled stylish athletic women who owns her own condo and and

499
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
And that's okay

500
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
You know what I kind of put these things

501
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Gather at end

502
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
I think that it just reinforced that this Market was there and ready for something big specially in athletic

503
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,560
Clothing diesel what did you what did you do did you

504
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Did you run back from that yoga class

505
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
And I

506
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,472
Go back to your house or where we were living in start to sketch out ideas

507
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,568
Yeah there was a little bit of that and I talked to a quart

508
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Puma staying Who was the

509
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
My yoga instructor

510
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Can I dropped out of the New York Financial

511
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
World

512
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
To become a yoga instructor in Vancouver

513
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,416
And like I did answer skating snowboarding I started to use her as a

514
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Sounding board in his ass

515
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Creative

516
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Source because

517
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
Unlike sir skating snowboarding where I was a boy and I could

518
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
You fit in the clothing I knew exactly what was going on

519
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
I obviously wasn't a woman

520
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
And I could see that

521
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,056
You'll get that time anyway with 99% women and

522
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,152
If I was going to do this and I was going to transfer my knowledge of what I'd learned in

523
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:14,016
Snowboarding Lycra stretch pants into yoga then I needed some advice

524
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Icy Hot

525
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Some money to play with

526
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Sale of your other company

527
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,488
And you knew how to sew of course and you knew how to Source material so what was

528
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
Liquid your first move in starting the business

529
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Well

530
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
One of my

531
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,912
Big issues in life is always been about rashing of clothing

532
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
And I could never really believe that

533
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,592
Apple Nike was at shoe company so I know they didn't really understand clothing either because

534
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,944
Even in their running shorts they had these open seams in between their legs

535
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Run 5K and I totally rash

536
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
So for me it was like solving athletic problem

537
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,464
I went to Japan I'd heard about these machines that were $40,000

538
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Peace which was

539
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Shoot at the time

540
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
And I bought for the machine to do what

541
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Paper

542
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
Flat seam so it's a

543
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
First time you could put two pieces of

544
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
The fabric together

545
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
And the Machine would

546
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,128
Flat seam fabric together and then cut off any excess fabric

547
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
So there was nothing flopping around on the inside

548
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
City idea was to

549
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Basically make

550
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
Athletic wear that would eliminate rashes

551
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Yes and

552
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
When I was running 10 K's or triathlons

553
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
The rationing was the thing that was always

554
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,352
18 point of what I call a high-level Athletics

555
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
Begin what I because I became a fabric scientist of sorts

556
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
I could bring in the wicking

557
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,640
If the moisture wicking I could bring in the anti stink I could make it thick enough where

558
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
It would smooth over a girl's body so chic

559
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
Feel comfortable wearing it

560
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:53,344
You're getting up in the morning putting it on at work and then you walking down to the yolk

561
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Class and then walking home

562
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
Boise idea to just make

563
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Pedicure yoga clothes or was it

564
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
To make

565
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Fashionable

566
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
You know apparel

567
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:10,240
Well I think I was just you know the right person to be putting like I said the two together in my

568
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
My driving what differentiates Lululemon from everybody else's I came at it

569
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
Function and then put fashion into it

570
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
Heartless do a reality check here

571
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
It's 98

572
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
You don't have a lot of money

573
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
You took a pretty big bat like a

574
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Pretty much bet everything you have

575
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Right

576
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Why why would you

577
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Why were you so confident this was going to work

578
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
I think because when I started to do my first

579
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,728
Design meetings with these 10 groups of 10 women

580
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
And we had like

581
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,824
Five or six samples and they touched

582
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Fabric

583
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
And they put it on it was the

584
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
The first time that

585
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
Really is synthetic fabric felt like caught

586
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,320
There was nothing like it any like it was just nothing like it

587
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
So I think that

588
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:03,744
Looking in the eyes of the consumer I could tell that this was something that was going to be

589
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Unbelievable

590
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Alright see you bet everything on this

591
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
And then you open a story

592
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Yeah but it's at

593
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,080
You know what I can only get a store on the second floor in the right area on the right Street in Vancouver which

594
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
Probably got more athletic stores in any place in the world

595
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
Cuz if you know the type of environment we have

596
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
But I can't you know it's really hard to get p

597
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
People up to the top

598
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Floor

599
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
So the only way I can I figure out how to do it is

600
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
2

601
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
This to combine my business with

602
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Fiona staying my yoga teachers

603
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
And I had all my clothing on rolling racks and remove it all out

604
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Decide and have

605
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Yoga classes there early in the morning and then at night

606
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
That would bring women into

607
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Yoga but also see weather

608
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
The clothing was and then it

609
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Kind of moved from there

610
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
It's your first

611
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,896
Store was essentially a yoga studio

612
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
With a like a booty cancer

613
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Crap

614
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Because you have

615
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
Are you having this company which

616
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
What you decide to call

617
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,440
Lululemon

618
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
I probably get

619
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Asus

620
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Once a day

621
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
And soap

622
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
When I had Westby

623
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Beach Ibotta

624
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
Skateboard brand called homeless

625
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
And with homeless I started to

626
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
I sell that to the Europeans and that Japanese

627
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,688
And it is certain to occur to me that the five big

628
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
Trading companies in

629
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Pan

630
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
We're making

631
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,648
North American brand name clothing in other words they would come up with their own brand name and order to

632
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Deliver that

633
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
The Japanese custom

634
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
But Japanese those big trading companies would never come up with a name with an L on it because it doesn't exist in the Japanese line

635
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
And so

636
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,472
But I got was that the young kids

637
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,616
Could see through that they went a name with an L in it is more authentic North American it's not like a

638
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
A Japanese knockoffs what had real value to

639
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
So

640
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,040
I started go all that's really a neat idea so I

641
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,648
Over the next couple years I just started doing alliterations in my mind and with l

642
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,560
But it was a pretty risky name at the time because lemon was really connected with a really bad cough

643
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Call Detroit

644
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:20,448
Write a lemon yeah but I actually came up with about 20 names and it 20 logos

645
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
What were some of the other names

646
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
I'm bored the only one I can remember right now is called athletically hip

647
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Also

648
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Well that's what the girls thought too because I had

649
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
10 focus groups of 10 people and I had them vote on the names and the logos and they came up with the name blue

650
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Lululemon

651
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
But the logo actually came from athletically hip

652
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,584
So it was a was a stylized a from the athletic

653
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
Here's a person a question

654
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
I'm curious I'm amazed you know

655
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
A man like you

656
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
And you you are selling

657
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
A product primarily to women

658
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
In a

659
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
Youth sport that yoga

660
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Exercise

661
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
You weren't really an expert

662
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
And you are not like some

663
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Yogi Guru you weren't

664
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
I'm your big guy you're looking

665
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Football player type of guy

666
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
And yet you were

667
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
Trying to

668
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Create a market

669
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Send and sell a product

670
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
2

671
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
Toot toot toot young women

672
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
How did you do it did you

673
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Set a step back and and

674
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Have

675
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Other women

676
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
Kind of sell the product

677
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
For you

678
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
Yeah I mean I had the

679
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
In between

680
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,040
West Beach and Lululemon I really decided that I only want to work

681
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
People I love to work

682
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
And so I was really determined to

683
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
Develop people

684
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,488
Train them to Mentor them and then get out of the way

685
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
And as I

686
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,168
Was running out of my money for my second time I had taken another $200,000 loan

687
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Weight because of

688
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
The first time you ran out of money

689
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
You were

690
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
You're right

691
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Brighton

692
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
I got

693
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
West Beach mold company moved back from

694
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,200
From Salem to Vancouver and they asked me to run

695
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
And it was like a gift out of Heaven because I have

696
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,648
We were really low on money we're I didn't want to advertise I wanted Word of Mouth.

697
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,744
Of the quality of our clothing to be The Branding Niche because I

698
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,376
I really did believe in the Tipping Point and it had to come from people that couldn't come from advertising

699
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
So

700
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
I was

701
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Begin another

702
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Probably like you thing I hired this woman who

703
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
With Shannon gray was her name

704
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,176
The first person I've ever seen that had a design portfolio

705
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
What's up with using stretch clothing

706
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,040
And it was in about 2 weeks I

707
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
After hiding her eyes

708
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,160
I left her in charge of Lululemon to seal for a year and I went back in

709
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Beach and that's how you were able to

710
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Some cash

711
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
That's how he's able to make more cash

712
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Exactly

713
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,168
So you are and so we should foreshadows is a foreshadowing here that Shannon eventually

714
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
How's your wife

715
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,872
Do you salute lemon like really launches in in 98

716
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
In this neighborhood

717
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
Vancouver and does it take off right away is it was

718
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
Just like insane or was it a Slow Burn

719
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
He was very slow burn

720
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
And

721
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
And then

722
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
It was so slow that even when I left

723
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
4

724
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
To rent West Beach

725
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
We were running out of money

726
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
I had a lot of inventory B

727
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,936
Because I need to make at least five to six hundred of every of R6 Styles in order to get the price down

728
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,752
So I fell into the trap a wholesaler

729
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
Men soy

730
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,384
I made a big deal to wholesale to sporting goods company in

731
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,456
Vancouver and ice ship to them and they

732
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
Immediately went bankrupt

733
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
So that really took

734
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
The company to the very edge we had

735
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,160
No money to pay payroll again I was only a

736
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
Couple weeks away from the end of it

737
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,816
We had just decided to move across the street from our second floor into a

738
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,144
The store on the main floor on 4th Avenue at

739
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
$10 a square foot because it was an old

740
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
Beat up electronic store

741
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
And then

742
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,128
Another thing from Heaven came and it was they fired me

743
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
West Beach swell

744
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Can I use that Loosely but

745
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,528
They combined with Sims skateboards in the co Sims Skateboards

746
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
CEO survey

747
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,488
He let me go with the 7c a $50,000 and if it wasn't for that $50,000 we never

748
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Never would have been able to finish our store now

749
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,680
Just before Christmas time mm yogasan mm in even though we had this great

750
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,496
Yoga pants and tops.

751
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
Shannon had to decide this

752
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Polar fleece bra

753
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,688
We got into the newspaper and brought everybody into the store and of course while they were there they

754
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,064
They mostly bought the yoga pants cuz they could Tina we're in a position then to educate

755
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
People on

756
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,672
The technical features of our patent once we had somebody in them they

757
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
They were customer for life

758
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,792
And if you were taking a yoga class in Vancouver that

759
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Presumably you would have

760
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Scene

761
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,448
The label cuz the label was like right on the outside

762
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Of the waistband right

763
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
Yeah I put it there because I was

764
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
Very clear that I that I

765
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
I didn't want big low going

766
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,968
And I thought that somebody should look in the mirror

767
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
And not see any logos

768
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,832
And I definitely didn't like logos on the left

769
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Breast because I looked at it as being

770
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,720
Kind of corporate low going you know it's always there on the left chest

771
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
So

772
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,608
I decided I wanted to logo small I wanted to be discreet and a place

773
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
I said nobody could see

774
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
So you

775
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
I guess around 2000

776
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
To you open your first store outside of end

777
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Tourism Toronto

778
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Martorano's

779
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
In Toronto

780
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
We had

781
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,784
You my second floor you know in Vancouver was a really a pop-up store in the you know where people had to relieve

782
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Find it

783
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,160
We did the same thing in Toronto almost a year before we open the store there and it was

784
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,232
We got a way of developing the marketplace with

785
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Team

786
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
A Lululemon business model so

787
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
We would go into every city in the future

788
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
Set up a store in

789
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
In the back alley or in a side street

790
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,776
And develop our Market invite yoga instructors in

791
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,872
Before we spent Dino 602 $1000000 on a store New York

792
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,736
Again created word-of-mouth which was you know my favorite type of marketing is break-even Market

793
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
Cuz I never had any money for Mark

794
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,184
You guys did some some stunts right like and when you opened your shop in Vancouver

795
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
You said the first 30 people who show up naked get her

796
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Free outfit

797
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,656
Well that was worse than that I actually put my first at in as anyone that shows up gets a free outfit

798
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:48,800
And then I realized it's in Vancouver and I was going to get every person in the whole city would show up naked so I couldn't really do that

799
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,128
So I had to put another ad in a week later saying the first 30

800
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
And did you get that happen

801
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Oh yeah and it created global

802
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
Got media everybody showed up

803
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
There was PV trucks all up and down the street and

804
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
Maybe make it in front of the store

805
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,488
Welby showed up it was a October morning it was

806
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,792
You probably never heard the Spot Vancouver it was

807
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
Overcast and drizzly

808
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
You know they all showed up in their trench coats and

809
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
And then

810
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,568
You know we went out when we went with open the store I went out with my wife and put my arm around her and then we

811
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
He said thanks for coming and everyone dropped their

812
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
Trench coats and went running into the store

813
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
And like no one even know he was arrested cuz like this

814
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
This is not normally allowed in most

815
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Well specially in 2002 but I think it's it's part of the culture here and there's lots of nude beaches so I don't think

816
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
It was

817
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
I don't think it was out of the realm for

818
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,656
Vancouver very proud of our city and our police for

819
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,728
Frisky no stepping back in Dino just observing

820
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,360
Cement 2002 glulam really starts to grow like

821
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
2003 US Open

822
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
Your first store in the US and Santa Monica what should I do

823
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
Obviously you chose that because that was sort of

824
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
Write the center of the

825
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Yoga culture in the US

826
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
Yeah I think probably the big thing that happened after we opened up Toronto and the

827
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,280
Second store in Vancouver is

828
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,144
You know I asked my lovely wife to marry me she said yes and so

829
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
He was April 20th

830
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,728
Saturday when we were to get married

831
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Panda

832
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,872
I'm working in the store and really I became almost a traffic cop because that

833
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,480
The number of people come in the store was something they would never seen before I think it went from

834
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
At $10,000 Saturday to a $30,000 Saturday

835
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
So

836
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Obviously

837
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
You've got a store in Toronto

838
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,720
You got one in Santa Monica and then I guess

839
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
Melbourne Australia you're growing fast

840
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,632
But you but you still alive

841
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,216
Did you Stitch an assumed you didn't have enough cash flow

842
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
To really scale the business

843
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Well I only

844
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
After that we started making a lot of money and I don't

845
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,968
Just don't mean a little bit of money I mean a lot of money

846
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
I mean

847
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
You have to understand that

848
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Again.

849
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Nobody

850
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
In the world had

851
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,696
Was was owning manufacturing right to the retail

852
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
I mean I was taking

853
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
Triple the profit

854
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
At most people

855
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
It was 2005 that you

856
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Went out and

857
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
And so

858
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Outside investors

859
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Who then

860
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
He's good at that point you don't 100% of the company so you sold

861
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
I guess about half of the company and then

862
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Step down as a

863
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Why did you do that what was that the only way you could

864
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
Expand and scale

865
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Because I

866
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,696
Retail stores around the world that done Global manufacturing I mean

867
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
Honest to God I could have done it all

868
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:53,120
But I even though it was making so much money I've never taken any money out

869
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
My wife and I

870
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
Neither of us came from money and we were always scared

871
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
You know we were scared that

872
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
An earthquake Woodhead or

873
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:05,664
You don't like this seems really good but is it true is it happening that have to pinch ourselves every morning

874
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,552
And then and I wanted advisors I wanted people around me that could make sure that I wasn't

875
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Going to run into roadblocks

876
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
Okay so you sold about half a company to private investor

877
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
A new CEO comes in

878
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Are you staying on a chairman

879
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,096
And then and then I guess you become like

880
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Chief Innovation officer

881
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
At this point right

882
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Brighton

883
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
It allowed me to sit in the middle of the

884
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Design Department

885
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,104
Which is my love is innovation and

886
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Quality Inn

887
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
And Athletics

888
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,712
I mean that's where I really flourished

889
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:45,088
And I hadn't developed as a chairman I didn't understand public boards I didn't understand

890
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
How to act or bi mean I think people think oh you know I ended up with a lot of money on you know chip Wilson Seville

891
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Businessman butt

892
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,584
Nothing really could have been further from the truth

893
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
The passionate product guy

894
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
So

895
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Because

896
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032
Even though you are still the biggest shareholder

897
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
You all of a sudden head outside investor

898
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
Who came in

899
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
And

900
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
Had their ideas

901
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
How this company

902
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Should be run

903
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
So I have to match

904
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Starting in 2005

905
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
Even though you're no longer CEO

906
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
There was some tension that be

907
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Well

908
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Yes

909
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,096
My my mistake happened when I was at West Beach and I brought in private equity

910
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,496
We had a board of directors but they had no vested interest they were there to help us out and they were wonderful

911
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,664
So I had this context of my mind that bring in private equity and having a group of like really great

912
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,456
Visors with me

913
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,784
Where we are all on the same page and moving in the same direction

914
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Was going to be another Wonderful Life

915
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
But it was

916
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Do you know that

917
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,024
It's my own fault I'm in the private-equity they're there to make money for their investors and

918
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,584
I had it very long term

919
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
Vision for Lululemon and

920
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Bad credit short-term

921
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Pink lemon

922
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,008
So we went to we ended up going

923
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
Public way too quickly

924
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
Right when you guys went public

925
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,176
I like in 2007 this was a hot stock

926
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Yeah you actually

927
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,296
Chunk of stock pretty early on

928
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,416
Yeah you know again you know I had advised use that were just giving me advice that was good

929
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
For them and not necessarily for me

930
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,120
You know I really only want to sell 30% of the stock to the private-equity guys but end up selling 48 so I lost

931
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,448
Control of the board seats and I didn't know how to negotiate for them

932
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
So that

933
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
Is important because as we go public then

934
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
You know the advice I got was

935
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,664
Each of you should sell more of your shares in the market

936
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Play Schism or shears are out there the more

937
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
The more the institutional investors will be able to get a good chunk of it and be able to hold it for a long time

938
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
But the reality of it is

939
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
All these were techniques to have

940
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,280
Kind of an owner founder

941
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,608
Dissipate and kind of move into the background and not have the

942
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,192
The power so to speak to control outboard

943
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
And that's really

944
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Would I lost and ended

945
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,592
It's my own fault and but that's what I ended up with

946
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
But this company just like

947
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
Aquent took off

948
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Right I mean

949
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
What is early 2000s into

950
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Mm and then

951
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
It just it was on fire

952
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,880
Write a lemon was goes everywhere

953
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Where in NY

954
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Today but

955
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
I mean that

956
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Despite

957
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
The challenges

958
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,304
The you face

959
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
It did

960
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Exploding growth

961
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
If you got admit that

962
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
Oh it was unbelievable I mean you know okay so things happen to me big deal I mean definitely iPod

963
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
We have a

964
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,432
Long-term vision for my family and I had a long-term vision for Lululemon

965
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,040
You know those things never kind of work out perfectly but all in all I mean

966
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
You have to admit that what

967
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
And what has happened is

968
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
Made me incredibly happy and incredibly wealthy

969
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
2

970
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
In 2011

971
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
Lululemon are you land

972
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
On the list

973
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
Canada billionaire

974
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Which I mean means you

975
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Achieved your goal

976
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
Financial

977
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Security and more

978
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Was that like a a marker for you was an important

979
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
For you or did you

980
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Think that you're not really care

981
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,272
But I could die really didn't care because I

982
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
Begin my dries

983
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Poor family

984
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
And my my absolute

985
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Fashion

986
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Frat letter

987
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
The clothing

988
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
And I think my wife and I

989
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,840
Again we just always so scared of losing it all

990
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
You don't like

991
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
You still go to snooze

992
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,704
The store and only buy one tuba toothpaste

993
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
You know we couldn't like speaking see ourselves by

994
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
How to save time

995
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663
I could do it my business but I couldn't do it at home

996
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,759
Alright so let's address the one elephant that everyone I say

997
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
Supposed to be on the show everyone says

998
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
That guy

999
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
Didn't he wants say in This Is Us

1000
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
Let's just give the outlines of story

1001
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
2013 Lululemon has to recall

1002
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
Certain pants

1003
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,839
Because they were concerned that they were too sheer that

1004
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Literacy through

1005
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,471
And in an interview you gave offhand you said you know look some of these

1006
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Answers don't

1007
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Look good on all women's bodies

1008
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
System

1009
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
And this cause an enormous

1010
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Uproar like

1011
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Essentially

1012
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,223
The interpretation of

1013
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
Was that you were saying overweight women

1014
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Shouldn't wear

1015
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
What happened

1016
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
What's your take on what app

1017
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,279
Well I think you have to go back into the end of 212 I mean I was

1018
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,327
Quite frustrated with the

1019
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,495
With the board I think that you know the board and I didn't see eye-to-eye on how the company was being run so

1020
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
And then there was

1021
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,359
Everything can I I said what happened it happened it was

1022
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
Huge quality issue

1023
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
So I went on this side

1024
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
Program on

1025
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
I think MSNBC Bloomberg

1026
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
And

1027
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
I did know

1028
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,255
From working in the stores that there was definitely something happening to our

1029
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
Clothing and I didn't know

1030
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
What anyway that the question was a really about the

1031
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
Pilling and I

1032
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
Sidwell

1033
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
The fabric pills

1034
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Right

1035
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,847
What was you know you've done that

1036
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Interview with

1037
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
Bleakley on Spanx

1038
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,479
So suddenly

1039
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,319
Women were coming into the store and not wanting

1040
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
Lululemon for

1041
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Athletics

1042
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
They were coming in looking

1043
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
Ford the Sheep their body

1044
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
But the

1045
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,071
Sewing technique in the fabric wasn't meant

1046
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
So

1047
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,703
What they were doing is buying two to four sizes smaller

1048
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Then

1049
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
What their size

1050
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
In order to

1051
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Get out of the

1052
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Garment

1053
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Would it wasn't me

1054
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
So

1055
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,271
When you stretch anything to limit

1056
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
A 10-minute

1057
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
You sit on a

1058
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Wooden

1059
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
Bench or something like that

1060
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Then

1061
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,719
Cooling occurs

1062
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
To a greater extent so

1063
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
Anyway that but I didn't know that till afterwards ahead and lie but

1064
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,935
Two two two together didn't realize what a big issue it was and

1065
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,751
At the words that I said we're not

1066
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
All women

1067
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Pick something Alwyn

1068
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:35,199
Long and every pair of Lululemon said quite frankly some women's bodies just

1069
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Don't just actually don't work

1070
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
Yeah oh yeah

1071
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,111
Which is a lot different than what you said which is that allowed

1072
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
I thought you said that

1073
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
Overweight women shouldn't wear

1074
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Lululemon

1075
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,535
Yeah I mean what you said is what I think people here

1076
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Which is a lot different than what I said just so

1077
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Did you want one

1078
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Did you get depressed

1079
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,519
Yeah I'd have to say I was because you know didn't they

1080
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
The board took me off a

1081
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
Is Chairman bao

1082
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
Because they felt like I wasn't the right front man for the

1083
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,967
The company anymore and I was at liability to Lululemon

1084
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
I mean this is he know after

1085
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
30 years of doing you know

1086
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Thousands of

1087
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Public interviews and

1088
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,463
You know I say one thing and then suddenly

1089
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
I'm a liability

1090
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,583
I mean so how did you kind of

1091
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
Did you do you think about that any

1092
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
I take your point that you

1093
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,775
Feel like you were misunderstood and that that wasn't your intention but whatever happened

1094
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
That's what came out and that was

1095
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
How it wasn't

1096
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Interpreted and

1097
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Did you have some

1098
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,431
Time to reflect on in the sink

1099
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Allison I'm just

1100
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Well it was a poor choice of words

1101
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,255
It was absolutely devastating to me it was devastating to my family I mean people would

1102
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:57,375
Come up to my wife and go how can you be with a man like that that would say that type of thing

1103
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,751
But more so was the antithesis of everything I built to know with women and

1104
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
For women for Lululemon it was the very opposite

1105
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
Bedtime

1106
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Yes it was

1107
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
It was

1108
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
If I could take it back I certainly would

1109
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,207
Is it is it strange to ask a question about the founders chip is is strange

1110
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
To build a company put your blood sweat

1111
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Tears in something

1112
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
People

1113
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,167
Don't pay attention to for a long time and all of a sudden everyone jumps on it when it starts to take off

1114
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
You know right

1115
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Success has a million

1116
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Our fathers in end

1117
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Failure isn't

1118
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
So all of a sudden

1119
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Your company

1120
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
This thing you built your idea the name

1121
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
The product

1122
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,991
And then you're no longer in control is that

1123
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Is that weird

1124
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah

1125
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,159
My vision for Lululemon and what I could have been there.

1126
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,951
It's not everything that I think is

1127
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:59,327
Canby Encino life is all about how you handle setbacks and I think Lululemon still on them

1128
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,447
On the most informed cheerleader and I think it has you know it's a great future still

1129
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,519
Give another give another business in you

1130
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,871
Well what I learned is that

1131
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
When I left Lululemon

1132
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
You know what even though it was maybe two billion dollars in sales ad

1133
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
What's the time I

1134
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
My brain was on Lululemon being 78 billion dollar

1135
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
And I

1136
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
Work so hard

1137
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
Building a company like

1138
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,255
Play Brick by Brick that it was good

1139
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,815
I don't think I can go back and

1140
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
And be a starter of a company at the age 60

1141
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
To anymore and

1142
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,751
Probably got to get a life don't want to do that again

1143
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
And

1144
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
To make my absolute

1145
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
Favorite thing I do is my 12 year olds

1146
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
Twin boys and I'm coaching flag football

1147
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,015
And nothing could be more fun

1148
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Nothing could be more

1149
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Chip

1150
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Event show before

1151
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
How much of your

1152
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
Success is because of your

1153
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,839
Intelligence and work and how much of it is because you were really lucky

1154
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
I think

1155
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
I was

1156
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
Pure passion

1157
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
For athletic

1158
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Technical product

1159
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
And I would have worked

1160
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,407
18 hours a day for the rest of my life for no money

1161
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Now I think what happened

1162
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
What is I got lucky

1163
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
Because my

1164
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
Drive and passion

1165
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,903
Met a world that wanted what I wanted

1166
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,231
And that was the lucky part

1167
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
Chip Wilson

1168
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
Is the founder of Lululemon

1169
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351

1179
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,391

What are you working forward to

1185
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
Hey thanks for sticking around because it

1186
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,263
Time now for house

1187
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
You built that

1188
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,359
Is it a story starts about 8 years ago

1189
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,687
A TV producer named Mike Sorrentino was out in the field

1190
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,271
And using a smartphone to take pictures for his company's website

1191
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,623
And what I found was when I would be in a place like

1192
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,023
Louisiana after the BP oil spill I was constantly having to wipe smudges from my camera

1193
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,375
Am I doing that is missing a lot of really good shots

1194
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Meanwhile

1195
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:48,799
People were starting to worry about whether cameras in your phone could get hacked and I kept wondering why nobody

1196
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
Solve these two things

1197
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
Yeah well think about it

1198
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,479
Forget you have a camera that you carry around all day everyday but it doesn't even have a lens cap

1199
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
So Mike figured he would design an iPhone case where you just slide a switch of the top to cover up the camera

1200
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
And on the inside of that lens cover

1201
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
Is a fabric lining and it also wipes the lens

1202
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Of any smudges

1203
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
So a pretty great and simple idea

1204
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,959
Around four years ago when Mike first thought of that P said first thing

1205
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
I got a patent

1206
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:23,103
You know that's the most important part of getting a patent is having a good patent attorney

1207
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Attorneys really expensive

1208
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
My wife gave you the great advice of

1209
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Do some side work

1210
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
And find a way to finance your invention

1211
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
So I started doing some video production

1212
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
Decide to pay for a lawyer

1213
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:40,511
Meanwhile you work with an engineer who helped take his paper sketches and make a prototype with a 3

1214
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
3D printer

1215
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
But at the same time

1216
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,119
He was getting some pushback

1217
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
Even close friends

1218
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
Spore like this

1219
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,239
Is a dumb idea why are you doing

1220
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,383
Right people kept saying hey bike your TV producer why are you trying to break into the iPhone accessory business

1221
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,943
Mike says they had a point

1222
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
Yeah I'm not one of these

1223
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,271
OtterBox

1224
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
Stacker one of these major brand phone case companies who gets this

1225
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
Spex in the designs of these phones

1226
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Before they come out so

1227
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
I got to wait for the phone

1228
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
To come onto the market

1229
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,791
Then I've got to go to the Apple Store

1230
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
And measure it

1231
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
And then send it to the engineering

1232
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Lot of back and forth

1233
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
But by the end of 2014

1234
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,031
With the help of $20,000 that he raised on Kickstarter

1235
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
Mike found a factory in China to make his first run of iPhone 5 and 5s cases with lens caps

1236
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
And then

1237
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Somebody give him a tip

1238
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Somebody said to me

1239
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
If your products already

1240
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
In January

1241
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
You have to go to the

1242
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,623
Consumer electronics

1243
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
You have to be a CEO

1244
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
Yes so that's what my did

1245
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,535
Federal Way to camp out in someone else's boo that

1246
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
The Consumer Electronics Show in LA

1247
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Las Vegas

1248
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
And there were

1249
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,935
A lot of people that came up to me and said

1250
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
I feel like they should be on the market already

1251
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
But no Mike says he was actually the

1252
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,151
First guy to come out with an iPhone case that has a lens cover and

1253
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Cleaner

1254
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:06,015
Right and our logo is something I made up in Microsoft Paint a little

1255
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,063
Phone case that looks like a little pirate

1256
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,391
Can I attach that's why I came up the name iPad case

1257
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,439
Because it covers up the cameras I

1258
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Since he launched the eyepatch case

1259
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,583
Mike sold about 5,000 of them and he's making a profit

1260
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:24,959
But he still splitting his time between iPhone cases and video production and

1261
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
He says it's a pretty good combination

1262
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
I work in an industry

1263
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
That was all about ideas and content and things that you could not touch

1264
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
Should I have a physical tangible product in my hand

1265
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
So incredibly rewarding

1266
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,087
If you want to find out more about the eyepatch case or here
