1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Quickly before we start to show

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
October

12

The Summit

Supported by America

Instagram / JetBlue away Jeni's Ice Cream

00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
And many many more

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
The Summit is a man

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Incredible opportunity to connect with

21
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
Other builders and hear from experts on how

22
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
Grow and scale your business

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,688
You can get tickets for both the DC live show and the Summit AT NPR presents

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
And helped

26
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
To see you there

27
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
So the meeting that we went to with the new buyer

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
The first meeting tonight with the first meeting I think I was nursing I remember being in that room having a baby

29
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Baby and just presenting this woman was I don't know in her late twenties and

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,360
She was not responding to anything that we are saying in a positive manner

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
So it was a hard meeting

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
And without them we were sunk

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Running PR

34
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
How I built this

35
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Innovators entrepreneurs

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Idealist and the stories behind the movements they built

37
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
I'm guy Rising on the show today

38
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,544
Tell chance with a black panther inspired Susan Griffin black loyals

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
And then grow that idea

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
EO products

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,456
What are the most successful independently owned Natural Body Care

42
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
A word that gets thrown out a lot by Venture capitalists and Rich folks

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Invest in startups

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Is scale

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
If you've ever tried to raise money for a business

46
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
Probably found yourself seated across the table from someone who asks

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Taking a scale this thing

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
Really asking was

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
How to get a girl your company into a

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
Billion dollar Venture so I can get a hundred X return on my money

51
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Scale

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
Big profits for investor

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Engrossed

54
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Only goal that really matter

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm more interested in a

56
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
Slow sustainable growth model

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
Which is why they avoid venture capital

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
Binky Barnes fanart of Patagonia

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Or Seth Thibodeaux

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Tofurky or Kim Jordan of New Belgium Brewery

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
All of those companies are independently owned

62
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,944
Beholden to neither shareholders nor venture capitalist

63
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Same thing with a company whose story you are about to

64
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
Because EO products is in a way

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
The opposite of scale

66
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
Brad and Susan Griffin black have never taken any Venture money

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
And I never had much money of Their Own

68
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
So the story of EO products is a story of a Slow Burn

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,496
Nearly 30 years of building up a brand one product at a time

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,848
Fighting for every store and eventually and sustainably

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
Growing into one of the most recognized natural body

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
Are brands in the US

73
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,600
The company does about 50 million dollars in Revenue a year for 30 years ago

74
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
What you started the company

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,744
Susan Griffin black was a single mom raising her son in San Francisco

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
But that's not the most amazing thing about the story the company itself was barely scraping by

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Buy Ford's first 15 years

78
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
And once it actually started to take off

79
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
Unraveled because the co-founders split up

80
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Their marriage

81
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Collapsed

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Will get there

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
For now

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
What started the years before Brad and Susan Matt

85
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
In the late 1980s

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,368
They were both living in San Francisco

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Brad just moved there from the East Coast

88
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
After leaving a job in computer sale

89
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
My initial motivation was to move to Australia yet this is

90
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,471
Pre-internet and I didn't know anyone in Australia so I had a couple friends in San Francisco

91
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
And you know I sold everything

92
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
I guess I had

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Two or three thousand dollars in the bank account

94
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,431
And moved in with one of them who was on Haight Street

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
And what did you do

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
We started a clothing company

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Called

98
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Maniac

99
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
And Maniac is spelled as in the state of Maine right Maine - IAC end

100
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
You know we

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Hell

102
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
The space of

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
I like rock

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Climbing and mountain biking

105
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
This was a time 88 it late 80s

106
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Where the whole

107
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Activewear thing came alive

108
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Stussy

109
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Mossimo

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
And so

111
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:09,503
It's activewear and then that tied into our lifestyle

112
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
So then we would mountain bike and we would rock climb

113
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
During the day and run the business

114
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
And then we would go out and party at night

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
All the time wearing our clothes which

116
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,791
Like who doesn't want to show off what they do

117
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
And if you make your own clothes and we made our own clothes and

118
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
We would sell our own clothes

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
I mean much of it

120
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Via ignorance

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
And Blake

122
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
How is the business doing

123
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
The business was kind of secondary

124
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
2 lifestyle

125
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
We were living at Large

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
Entrepreneurs in San Francisco and

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
This is before the.

128
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Cam internet

129
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
Sing head and it was very vibrant a little

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Gritty

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Yet

132
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Artistic

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
And

134
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
We could really own it and

135
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
You know we would peddle our Wares and we sold to

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Nordstrom

137
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
And we sold to the

138
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Hardcore rock climbing

139
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,847
Shops yet we didn't really ever make money and when we had the Opera

140
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Trinity to make money

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
We just never

142
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
I don't know if we were mature enough were that we

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
Saw the opportunity that was

144
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
In front of us yet

145
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
We didn't make money

146
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
Around this time I guess

147
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
You also had a

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
The clothing store in in San Francisco

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Yeah

150
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
It was a great little store

151
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
End

152
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
We got written up in the chronicle

153
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,287
Probably within the first couple of weeks and so that gave us a great start and

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
You know

155
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
The part of the local design community and

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
It was a really

157
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Vibrant time

158
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,783
That time of your married to

159
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Lawyer

160
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:55,999
Yeah you know we were I think we were in an apartment by that time in the marina

161
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631
Passes the bar and goes to work for a big Law Firm

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
And

163
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
Things were more much cushier

164
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
Eventually

165
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,847
We went from the marina to a very nice building in Pacific Heights

166
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
He was working really hard I had a store on Sutter Street

167
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,551
Mike was born my son was born in 1986

168
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
And

169
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,231
All looked very good it didn't feel very good to me but it looked

170
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
Why does it feel good

171
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
I don't know I

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,727
I guess I had fallen into what was considered at the time

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
The Yuppie life

174
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
I'm a free spirit and I really liked the whole heart scene which I wasn't really doing much of anymore and

175
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
All of sudden it was like waking up one day and

176
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
Feeling like I was at the wrong party

177
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Like I didn't really

178
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
No more

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
Play relate to the people who are there and

180
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
I had this like a doorman

181
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
A kid

182
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
And a French

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Nanny

184
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
And

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
It all look good and it just

186
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Started to feel

187
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Fragmented

188
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
My conversations our conversations were

189
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,735
Pretty stilted and got very tense because I really felt like

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
Bill had sold out and he was hurt on the wrong side of things

191
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
I just felt like

192
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
It just wasn't my life

193
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
And I couldn't make it my life

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
So

195
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
When Mark was

196
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Two and a half

197
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Have we split

198
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Yuan Bill split

199
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
So you left behind

200
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
The Nanny the doorman in Pacific Heights the

201
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Fancy apartment in and

202
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
You left behind

203
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
He had much to my mother's dismay

204
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Imagine

205
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
So so what about your business I mean

206
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Did you

207
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Continue to run your business

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,439
I did for a short amount of time and then I sold that to my

209
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,511
Partner at the time for $12,000

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
So you're now a single mom

211
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,631
And what it was your plan what did you say

212
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Think you wanted to

213
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Well I wasn't

214
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Stressed financially

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
I took a job

216
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,895
Because I could see that I would get stressed financially

217
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
So

218
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
I ended up

219
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Doing some Consulting

220
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,599
True friends in the clothing business and helped a few friends start

221
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Beer companies

222
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Andam

223
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951

224
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Hi

225
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,071
Took a job at asprey working for the late Doug Tompkins

Yes and originally he was an asprey was it was a huge grin definitely in the eighties nineties and still

229
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Yeah

230
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Alright so this is like

231
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
The early nineties

232
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
Both of you Brad answers both of you are in San Francisco

233
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
Both of you are working Kennedy apparel business

234
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,695
At one point Susan you having to go into

235
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
I can do any bread store in

236
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
Is that worth for the two of you

237
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
Yeah it was their warehouse actually and all of the products were there

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
And I remember

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Brandeis shokan

240
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
He was cute

241
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
He was smart I like them right away

242
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
But you like seem like a good guy

243
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,199
It was really resonance right off the bat

244
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
And after

245
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
Susan left I got her business card and this was

246
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Is June of 1988

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
I wrote her

248
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Dear Susan

249
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
You know thank you for your time

250
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Connected

252
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
And

253
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
We kind of stayed in touch

254
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
She would help us a little bit or I would help her

255
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Really

256
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,383
Struggling entrepreneurs and

257
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,479
Were able early on to engage with each other like

258
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
Shelly Scott me

259
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
And I always

260
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Got her and

261
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
And even now you know I mean it's like

262
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
In 30 years and

263
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
She can start a sentence almost and I can see

264
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
But it really started that way

265
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Respect

266
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
You guys right away were attracted to each other

267
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Yeah

268
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
But you guys were not dating at that point

269
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
The richest

270
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,103
Hanging out with a friend we are friends already so you guys

271
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
Start meeting app Susan you are working at asprey

272
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
This company that really was just like

273
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
I remember every

274
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
When wearing a binder of Benetton sweatshirt or innisfree sweatshirt

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Oh yes

276
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
And

277
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
Also at the time you know during that time

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
Doug was very interested in

279
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
Transforming the company into a more sustainable Environmental

280
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,335
Company and looking at all the processes that were involved in manufacturing and

281
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:03,455
At that time there were just so many incredible people coming through whether it was

282
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
You know David Brower the environmentalist

283
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Or

284
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Yvonne chenard or Anita Roddick from The Body Shop

285
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
I mean it was a portal for me

286
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
Into really

287
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
Thinking about and looking at

288
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Sustainability

289
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
And so

290
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,191
I had met Anita Roddick from the body shop and she was opening

291
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Franchises

292
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
In Northern California and

293
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
And I loved her but I wasn't totally

294
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Crazy about

295
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Products

296
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
I've always been a product person

297
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063
I feel like I'm you know I've been ahead of it and trust my instincts I think

298
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Eventually anyway

299
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
So when I see something

300
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
That I like even if it's like a little bit off

301
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,047
As soon as people learn about it and understand it they'll like it too

302
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Pegasus all couldn't begins

303
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
To come together

304
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
For you when

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
When asprey sent you the London

306
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
To go buy something like a buying trip

307
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Is that

308
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Is it right

309
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,199
Well yes you know we would go to trade shows you know fabric trade shows it was the way to

310
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Certified interpret Street fashion in

311
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
And up-and-coming trends

312
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Yeah

313
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
And so

314
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
I was in London on a buying

315
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,511
And I was sort of running through the Covent Garden area

316
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
And I

317
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
Ran into this little store and ice

318
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Was just

319
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Taken

320
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
I want it smelled like

321
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Moussy store

322
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
Neal's yard remedies

323
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
Yeah right next to Neal's yard Dairy yeah yeah

324
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
So

325
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Stairs

326
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
You can see an herbalist or an acupuncturist

327
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Homeopath

328
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
And then

329
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
You would come downstairs and get your prescriptions filled in this little apostle

330
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
And so the reason that it smelled the way it

331
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Smelled

332
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Was

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Because of

334
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
The essential oil

335
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
And the herbs

336
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
That they stock

337
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
So I picked up this little bottle of

338
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Lavender essential oil

339
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
And I inhaled and everything check

340
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Like I

341
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
I knew what I wanted to do with my

342
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
My life you know the body shop Sardis

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Help me pay attention to that segment of

344
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Product in the market and then

345
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
This was like oh no this is

346
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Wow

347
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
This must have been like totally mind-blowing right is essential oil still kind of hippy dippy right it's not

348
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Not mainstream

349
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
No no it was very hippy-dippy

350
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,959
Yeah and you go in there and this was like nothing you would seen before you hadn't known about essential oils

351
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
You know around that time they were all those awful

352
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
You know candle stores and

353
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
All sorts of stores that you would go in and it would

354
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
Have a really synthetic coin smell

355
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,623
As did a lot of perfume most perfume right someone would get on that elevator and be like oh

356
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
Lord you know this was like

357
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Being in

358
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,119
Beautiful garden you know I mean it reminded me of great parts of my childhood just like

359
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Being in my at my grandma's

360
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Watering tomatoes

361
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Smell of lilacs

362
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
It was real

363
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
And it was very different in that store and what you're there and you're thinking

364
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,271
Cigarette do something with this like this is what I want to do

365
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,623
Yeah you know I had to sort of live that lifestyle

366
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
So I think them you know I was searching really

367
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
For what made sense and what was real and what had heart and meaning for me

368
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
And so that just opened up

369
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
A New Path

370
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,263
And something new to learn and I was very passionate about

371
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Social like what did you do

372
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,383
Do that put additional I contact the founder and say

373
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,967

In the US

376
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Is that what happened

377
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Yes and

378
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,743
She wouldn't talk to me until I worked in the store so it worked in the store for three days

379
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Motioning

380
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Romy Frazier

381
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
And she said you can work in the store

382
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
Before we talk

383
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
She said if you're interested

384
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
You know I mean the retail is the heart of what we're doing yell

385
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,127
I was you know mixing herbal tinctures and in the back room and

386
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Doing all sorts of things and I loved it and

387
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,503
Amy met after and

388
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,855
Basically the idea was to open retail store

389
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Bat in the US

390
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,231
And and you said around me I want to be your person doing this in the US

391
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Yes

392
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
But let me just I just hate driving

393
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Obviously you are super talented super smart and driven

394
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Good like

395
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
You have no money

396
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
You had no

397
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Access to it like

398
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
Immediate Capital you know track record

399
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Selling essential oils in the US

400
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Why would you even consider working with you

401
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,575
How you know she also was a small company they I think at the time they had a couple of

402
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
She could see how sincere and interested I was

403
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,791
And also you know from being in the clothing business I did have relationships

404
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Swift

405
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Buyers in

406
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Cheeto

407
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Merchandise managers

408
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Owners of

409
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Specialty store

410
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Torso

411
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
I had some access to

412
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Understanding distribution

413
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,407
So what did she say to you she said yeah go back to the US and let's

414
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Do that song

415
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
But

416
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,575
Well essentially I tried to put a plan together for retail stores

417
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
And

418
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
I could see that that would never work

419
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
Because you needed people who were very well-versed in all of these alternative modalities in aromatherapy and

420
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Homeopathy

421
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
And I was running out of money

422
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
So I thought

423
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Best to wholesale

424
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
And

425
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
See who's interested who wants it and then

426
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,943
I could have them pay for half of the order I could import the product

427
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
Which I didn't

428
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
My garage in Potrero Hill

429
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
And then

430
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
Have the retailers who wanted it

431
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Pay half up front

432
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,695
Then I deliver it and get the rest of the money to let

433
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
That's what I did

434
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
Alright so you go you're back in San Francisco

435
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
And by this time like

436
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
A 1992

437
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
You got a five year old

438
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Kitten

439
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
Are you and Brad dating yet or not yet

440
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,431
We weren't really dating I think we were still good friends I think Brad had a girlfriend

441
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
And we would spend more time together because he was

442
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
I was in the neighborhood

443
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
And I was working out of my garage

444
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
And then he would

445
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Brightest bike

446
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,047
Open the garage door and I have a little teeny office in there he would help with business plan and we would commiserate about

447
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
He was he was still in the clothing

448
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,935
And you were essentially trying to make this

449
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Import

450
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,311
Business of essential oils work in Brad you remember like what

451
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,455
What did you think about this idea did you think all this is a no-brainer or you just like that one help don't help

452
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Cuz I like her

453
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
It didn't happen that

454
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Quickly

455
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
You know Susan had no money and I had left

456
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,975
What really I think sustained the relationship and made it

457
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Exciting is

458
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
That

459
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,375
It was never a no-brainer and it still isn't after

460
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
30 years

461
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
But I was full-on in my clothing company and

462
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
We wanted to help out each other

463
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
And how did it work with rummy

464
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Frasier

465
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
And you'll see our did you have to

466
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
Pay her up front and then she would ship you the oils or

467
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,343
Was it like a partnership or she just shipped it to you and didn't charge you

468
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Place the bad like how does that work

469
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
We had Net 30 Terms

470
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
3 days

471
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah

472
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
I think maybe in the beginning it was 60

473
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
So she was basically selling you

474
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,167
The oils at that cost a little bit above cost

475
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,727
You were then marking it up a little bit and

476
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,055
And that was it was really was like a distributor

477
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Relationship you weren't you weren't like

478
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Equity partner

479
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
No

480
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
It was it was a separate entity and

481
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Finances where

482
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,039
Completely separate

483
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
So how are you

484
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
Keeping us afloat meaning

485
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
You have to pay

486
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
Neal's yard in 30 days

487
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
How are you making out

488
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Well I am

489
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
I raised a little bit of money

490
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Come friends and family

491
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
So we'd have a little bit of a

492
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Cushion

493
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
And also

494
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Be able to increase

495
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Inventory and AR accountant

496
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Eventually had to get a space

497
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,175
In the same building where Brad's company was

498
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,551
Yes and so you running out of there and bread were you helping her with it

499
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,927
What kind of what was happening it on my side of things is that we

500
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
Decided to

501
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,071
Shut the business down Maniac Mania

502
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
And then that

503
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Opened up

504
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
A pocket for me while you know what am I going to do and

505
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Where we dating at that time

506
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Probably yes

507
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
And

508
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
I had

509
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
Two or three opportunities

510
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
One was

511
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,015
I was going to open up a bungee jumping site in downtown San Francisco

512
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,879
And right and another opportunity was working for a

513
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Sock company out of

514
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Japan

515
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,840
And the third was working with Susan and and so our relationship started to develop

516
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
And

517
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
There just were opportunities

518
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
And we were good

519
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Together and so that's

520
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
How

521
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Our relation

522
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah we were selling Neal's yard and we had that we were making a few products

523
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
Neal's yard

524
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Because it was

525
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
We wanted to learn how to make stuff

526
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
Right so we would make bath salts and

527
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
Anything that you could cold Max and then poor you were making it in a garage in San Francisco or you were

528
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,840
Place organisms well in the warehouse that we rented we have a small lab there and we are making

529
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
Do you think you and other people or will you by yourself

530
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
I had to employee

531
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
And a part-time book

532
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Cuz we had

533
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Several accounts by then and

534
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Tell her

535
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
So we were learning how to make things

536
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
By hand

537
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
And I knew

538
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,528
Someone introduced me to the marketing person at Birkenstock

539
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
And she said why don't we do a little foot care kit like gift with

540
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
Purchase of like a little foot

541
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
Put salt and little foot soak

542
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Until we did a prototype

543
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,864
And she gave us an order for $32,000

544
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
It was

545
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
320 for each gift box

546
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
Which meant

547
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
I had to

548
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
10000

549
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:41,664
And then Brad came down the hall and I'm like how are we going to do 10th

550
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,504
You was like such the I Love Lucy show when you walked into her

551
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,064
Warehouse and

552
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
You know of course I saw the numbers

553
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
As well and I didn't know anything about it

554
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
Natural oils really I like how they smell

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
I know how to really make anything yet I can

556
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
How to figure out the most

557
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
Thanks you know with Maniac we

558
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Made our own

559
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Products and so I learn how to sew and

560
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,056
Learning these things from a Mechanicals aspect

561
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,408
Was pretty straightforward for me in terms of like okay well this is Jay

562
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Just what you do

563
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
But just put them together

564
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
Let's make these 10000 kit

565
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Yeah

566
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
He said

567
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,648
If we're not going to Phillies by hand we're going to you know jerry-rig this

568
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,696
Way to gravity feed and then will

569
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
Zelda bottles that way and

570
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
He had made gravity feed

571
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Describe

572
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,192
What did what did that look like was it like a giant funnel that you just pour the salt in

573
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
You know really what we did is

574
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,800
We started from hand pouring

575
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
Into bottles

576
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
2 adding equipment

577
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
And

578
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,016
You know gravity feed is one of the ways but yeah it's really taking it from the funnel

579
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
And moving it to a machine

580
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
And then instead of one a minute

581
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,416
You have the ability to do a 10 minute or 10 minutes

582
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
And that was presumably game changer

583
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
For you

584
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
We never would have been able to

585
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,840
To fill that order now

586
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Just like sprinkling it with little shovel I guess

587
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Scoop

588
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
It wouldn't work because low

589
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
That wouldn't work now

590
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,080
Just a dressy me today if you want to figure out how to make

591
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
You know bath salts

592
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,272
What was it that you just go online right in like 1993

593
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,648
How do you figure out how to make this stuff like you just buy a bunch of salt and add essential oils to it

594
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
But we did learn a lot

595
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
From Neal's yard cuz they were small

596
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Picture so

597
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
We could

598
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Suss out the processes

599
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
I was very

600
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,984
Interested in studying aromatherapy with a bunch of different people

601
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
So I understood the

602
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Properties of essential oils in the blending of essential oils

603
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
TheCHIVE

604
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
I understood how to do that

605
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
If you go online right now you can

606
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:57,088
See where the at home person can

607
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
Create sort of the easier

608
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Thanks and that's what we stopped

609
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
Too so we make bath salts we made lip balms

610
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
We made massage oil

611
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,888
How are you getting the oils in 1995 where were you where were you

612
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Well through

613
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,104
Various Distributors that we had started working with we learned a lot about essential oils and distribution

614
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
Also from Neal's yard in from taking aromatherapy classes

615
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
And then you would ask around

616
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
You know and then

617
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
Play I don't have a lavender

618
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
This person has a Labrador or hey I need an orange

619
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Where is Orange grown

620
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,280
Alright it's grown in Florida so then you would you know go through the Yellow Pages

621
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Threatened

622
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
Essential oils actually aren't oil

623
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
They're called essential oils cuz the it's heavier

624
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Then water

625
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
So

626
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,080
Any talk about lavender lavender grows

627
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
Many places but the best lavender

628
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Is from France and

629
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
You know there's a certain taste level just like with food and wine

630
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,112
How about you know what smells best what's the best quality

631
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
Can you source that can you

632
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,744
Make that a consistent part of a formulation

633
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
Because essential oils are finicky you know the reason that people stopped using them and went to synthetic

634
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
Pregnancy no

635
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
Was because it was way less expensive sure and it was consistent

636
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,432
And was like being delivered to your little I don't know where house

637
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
That you guys are running like in 10 drums or in like the last charger and red giant bags of

638
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
Wright glass and

639
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Aluminum

640
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Bottle

641
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,768
And there were some local distributors

642
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
It is well

643
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,584
That even though they charged

644
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
A lot

645
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
We had access

646
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,752
Choose your beer basically running this little

647
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Company that is

648
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,616
Trying to make a go at it with essential oils

649
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
I'm out how are you guys doing financially for you

650
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Is it sustainable

651
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Yes or no

652
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
I mean

653
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
Sustainable as in

654
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
Raise a little money we could pay the rent

655
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
But you weren't making a ton of money

656
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Oh no no no

657
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
They are scraping

658
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
Ride along with that stress

659
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Was

660
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
The question of

661
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
What else would I be doing

662
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Got me now there was always like

663
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Yes you're stressed

664
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Stan okay what do you want to do about it you want to get a job

665
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
No

666
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Do you want to do something else

667
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
No

668
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,968
And then it would sort of just settle into this is

669
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
What we're doing

670
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
You are because you are basically

671
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
The distributor

672
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
For Neal's yard right

673
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
Yes and doing that alone

674
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,536
Was not going to be enough just selling Neal's yard

675
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
You know it wasn't and it was

676
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Because you know we were

677
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
Importing so we were basically

678
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,264
Slapping glass bottles halfway around the world and then

679
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Reshipping them

680
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
Two other stores

681
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,152
And we got it up to a certain level of sales at

682
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
I think it was half a million in the US

683
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
But we could still see how we could do it

684
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Ourselves

685
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
And do it for

686
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Less money because

687
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
You know all of that shipping

688
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
And do it our own way

689
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
So we

690
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,352
Gave them six months to find a different distributor and gave Neal's yard 6 months

691
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
You figured

692
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
We got a

693
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Do this on our road now

694
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,216
Yes

695
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
Well I think one of the early on indicator

696
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
It's Rusty around that

697
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Time

698
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Essential oils

699
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
And higher-end

700
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
Personal Care bath care products started

701
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Take off in the gift

702
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
And

703
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Susan head created

704
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
An access point

705
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
To a lot of

706
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
Retailers or folks that wanted us to make

707
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Make the products for them

708
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
And

709
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
There was some demand

710
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Cuz it just weren't that many companies that made essential oil based and more natural

711
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Body care products

712
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
So who just accuracy who was buying

713
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Essential oils

714
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
At the time the early 90s

715
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
Mid-90s

716
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,808
People would put it I guess you could rub it behind your neck or

717
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,416
You could use it as aromatherapy or use it in in a bath

718
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Like what who are your customers

719
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
So

720
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
In 1995

721
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
Bloomingdale's card

722
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
And said will you

723
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
You make us

724
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
For essential oil blends

725
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
4r

726
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Holiday Cash

727
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
That's a big deal

728
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
I know you said sure

729
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,176
And we had to think of a name for the company then

730
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
And

731
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
These were very small bottle

732
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
So

733
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
And we didn't have a lot of room on the label

734
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,416
And aromatherapy just seemed like way too long of a word

735
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
So he just came up with

736
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
The initials EO

737
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
And then we did for Blends for Bloomingdales and that

738
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Started

739
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Company

740
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
Okay so 1995

741
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,544
You guys decide to launch own company you call Danny O products

742
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Which stands for

743
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Essential oil

744
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Millions of dollar

745
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Dollars

746
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,392
It was I think of $15,000

747
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Yeah

748
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Butter

749
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
We still had to

750
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Salata bottles

751
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,840
In a relatively short amount of time and come up with the formulation

752
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
And then it was sort of like okay now what

753
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Again 1995

754
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,384
It is so easy now you can just get Shopify to put your web store online you can

755
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,016
Easily find a company online that will make labels for you they will even do fulfillment and shipping

756
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
However example did you

757
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Play Closer to slap labels on these

758
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:55,744
A little bottles and it had to look nice cuz it's Bloomingdale's you cannot mess around how did you do that

759
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
For example

760
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
You know we're very good at

761
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Doing

762
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
We would just

763
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Figure it out in our Pace levels

764
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
Have always been

765
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Hi

766
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
And I

767
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
When you look down at products in

768
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,200
More natural products and natural food stores everything had a leaf on a flower

769
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
You know really bad type and not very nice colors

770
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
So we just

771
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Went very minimal

772
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
And

773
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
Chose a beautiful typeface

774
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Which was

775
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,072
Dido which is similar type paste in Vogue actually

776
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
In the products had to smell

777
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Exceptional

778
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
And then they also had

779
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Form which was

780
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
A little bit of a hurdle

781
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
And

782
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,688
Our idea was it for using these expensive very beautiful

783
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Essential oils we're not going to ruin it

784
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
With

785
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Harsh

786
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,368
Chemicals and so there was a high bar

787
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
That we set

788
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
Right off the bat

789
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
And I guess

790
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
So at this point Brad you are

791
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
Working with Susan you are

792
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
To feed an

793
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,680
After a couple years of dating and working closely you you really are in love

794
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,264
And you guys get married in 1995 in the middle into the midst of all this

795
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
That's right

796
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
Oh yeah we were gravity feeding and

797
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,248
By the way out of the Abyss like a line of

798
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,064
Essential oil sale at Bloomingdales

799
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Do they sell out

800
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
It crushed it but

801
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,952
But crushing it from the other side I think they ordered once

802
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
And that was it

803
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Yeah

804
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,072
However it was a springboard

805
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
To add something here

806
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
1996

807
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,472
Suzanne you had a ten-year-old you guys were married

808
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,312
And you just had another baby you guys had your first child together

809
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
Lucy

810
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,408
So you're a ten-year-old a newborn baby

811
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
You're launching a business

812
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
To get together

813
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
Was that crazy was it just like

814
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Insane

815
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Yes

816
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah it was

817
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
And

818
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
The financial pressure was in there was a lot of Finance

819
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Because just

820
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
You weren't

821
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Selling as much as you

822
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
He wanted to sell

823
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
You know we did not have

824
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
We didn't have money really

825
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
For the first

826
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
15 to 18 years

827
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,848
Come up alot in this conversation yet

828
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
It didn't really come up

829
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
Much other than

830
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
You know I want to swear a little bit

831
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,808
Airgas why won't yeah

832
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,856
It was a struggle in so

833
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
We

834
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,488
We love what we were doing yeah and we're very Scrappy

835
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,536
Yeah and we just made

836
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,120
Work and that was that was really the reality of it all

837
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:47,264
Were you guys interested in becoming rich I mean was that important to you to make a lot of money

838
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
I got make a lot of money

839
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
Here's something

840
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
That I kind of learned from my

841
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
Early thirties when I lived in Pacific

842
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Height is that

843
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
Money is not

844
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
The thing

845
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
And I know a lot of

846
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Really rich unhappy

847
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,584
And I know that money in and of itself

848
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
Army wasn't

849
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
The key motivator

850
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
And I already knew that that was not like my

851
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
Path to happiness however paying our rent was important in our bills and survive

852
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
Driving a little bit past survival was important because otherwise it was a lot of prey

853
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
Pressure so the question wasn't when we going to get rich the question was when

854
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,792
When are we going to make payroll

855
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
When we come back in just a moment

856
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,144

857
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472

916
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,376
It's 1996

917
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
And your products is

918
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
To say the least

919
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728
Having some problems

920
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,312
But around the time they get a lucky break

921
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
A big order from a West Coast department store called Mervyn's

922
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,736
That order is enough to help them keep the lights on

923
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
And also take on a new challenge

924
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,832
Try and get their products

925
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
Into Whole Foods

926
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
We went to our local

927
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,256
Whole Foods in Mill Valley and they turned us down

928
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
And then we

929
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,888
Did some guerrilla marketing we would like all Whole Foods and say

930
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Hi do you have to

931
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
You'll be like no

932
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
Relyco you should carry it at

933
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,824
It probably would just call up and just the two of you do this

934
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
Hora local Friendswood going to the Whole Foods at Whole Foods

935

936
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
What did that just sounds like a totally like

937
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,904
Transparently obvious campaign like didn't they know

938
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
That you guys were doing this

939
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,840
Well you know we have a lot of friends are kids were in school and then we had people who wrote notes on the community

940
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,680
Bulletin board you know asking do you have EO products

941
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,776
Yeah or what why aren't you carrying your product and they finally

942
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
He finally started carrying

943
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Hair products

944
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
And then

945
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
When Whole Foods led to the next

946
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
So

947
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,832
I think maybe the buyer changed it Whole Foods and you know it was very sort of

948
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Biocentric

949
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,184
If they liked you and they wanted to carry you that was their decision

950
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
And I tell Whole Foods Rand yeah

951
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Alright song 1997

952
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
You can add Whole Foods kind of a big deal

953
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,912
Seems like you guys are really turning a corner

954
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
By guess

955
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
Like later that year or around that time

956
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Like your biggest account

957
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Mervyn's

958
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
They kind of look like

959
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
We always think we're going to

960
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Stop buying from you

961
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
What was that is that

962
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
True that happen

963
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
What a nightmare that was

964
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Butter

965
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
The buyer changed so the buyer that knew us and loved us

966
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Left

967
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,232
And there was a new buyer

968
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,840
Who didn't really like aromatherapy and didn't really like essential oils

969
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,144
Susan tell guy about that meeting

970
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Went to with loose

971
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
So the meeting that we went to with the new buyer

972
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
The first meeting

973
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Fright with the first meeting I think I was nursing

974
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,432
Boosie I remember being in that room presenting

975
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
Having a baby

976
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
This woman was

977
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
I don't know in your late twenties and

978
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
She was not responding

979
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,904
To anything that we are saying

980
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
In a positive manner

981
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
And without them we were sunk

982
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
So it was a hard meeting

983
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
I mean when you say you were sunk

984
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,120
You lose mervin's you lose this account

985
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,960
What does that mean how close were you to the business just like

986
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:15,360
You know that's not such a big deal because you know we were on the brink of crumbling for many years

987
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
Well you know that device Inc

988
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
That this was a

989
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
This was a

990
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
This was

991
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
Should I get a job

992
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Should one of us get a job

993
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,976
To just smooth out whatever was coming

994
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
You know

995
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Minar account was like

996
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,584
You know

997
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,632
He did he did advise us to

998
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
Baby folding

999
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
Get a job

1000
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:45,312
Cute you're counted after this Mervyn's thing said maybe you guys should just like

1001
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
Call it a day

1002
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah that's when your account is telling you that the person knows your finances better than anyone else

1003
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
That's really bad

1004
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
It was bad

1005
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Butter

1006
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
We didn't think about

1007
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,440
Wedding we just thought about how are we ever going to get through this

1008
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
To get to the other side

1009
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,584
And was there anything that happened that

1010
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
Kind of throw you a lifeline

1011
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Yes

1012
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
You got a $65,000 order from

1013
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
TJ Maxx

1014
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
Bam

1015
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
Just out of the blue

1016
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
Well

1017
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
They came to our place of business and

1018
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
At that time

1019
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
We had a 3000 square foot to

1020
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Space

1021
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
And they came to visit and they just couldn't really believe that we are manufacturing everything there cuz it was you know

1022
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Square feet right yeah

1023
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
And they still gave us an order

1024
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
All right so you kind of get a Lifeline from TJ Maxx

1025
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
Thank you TJ Maxx

1026
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
Thank you TJ Maxx forever and you're in Whole Foods

1027
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah if you were to walk into a hole

1028
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Foods in two

1029
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384
And you saw a couple of EO products

1030
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Available

1031
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:59,807
People walking the grocery store Stacey like a product available at most people assume all that's a big company or

1032
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,903
You know the people involved in that company must be doing really well

1033
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
In in 1999-2000

1034
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,791
Were you guys able to pay yourselves really good salaries

1035
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
No

1036
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
But we were able to buy a

1037
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,287
Small private label manufacturer like a factory

1038
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Yeah they had

1039
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
1

1040
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,431
Thousand gallon tank and a couple of other tanks and

1041
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,223
Fort Clifton

1042
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
Everything you know

1043
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
Was set up and ready to go

1044
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,671
This is a private label that was making soaps and Beauty Supplies

1045
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
Yes for other company but not organic necessarily

1046
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
No and it was pretty run down

1047
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
And and how much did you guys pay for it

1048
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
250000

1049
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
We didn't

1050
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
But

1051
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,799
There was a very Progressive small Bank

1052
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,359
Our accountant knew those guys

1053
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
And they ended up

1054
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Lending us the money

1055
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
So at this point have a factory

1056
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,903
How many products around 2,000 how many products different products were you making

1057
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Chris 835

1058
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:16,607
So like soaps in hand soaps and shower gels and shampoos and when what else

1059
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
In conditioner bubble bath

1060
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Lotion

1061
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Baby lip balm

1062
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,775
So that's a big product line

1063
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,383
You guys just working like crazy was it like all the time

1064
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Yeah

1065
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:35,039
So the way that it was working for I don't know maybe it was years is that I would get up at

1066
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
The crack of dawn and get to work

1067
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Between 5 and 6 +

1068
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Susan with

1069
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,487
Take care of the kids in the home in the morning and she would come in

1070
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
9 or 10 and then I would

1071
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Pick up

1072
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,375
You know what three or four and Susan wood

1073
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,191
Stay until 6 or 7 and that's

1074
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
Really what the routine was

1075
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
Since you are still super pretty small right now

1076
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,407
I think I'm like 2,000 2002-2003 for like

1077
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,271
You're probably doing what a million dollars $2000000 in gross sales

1078
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,087
2002

1079
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
2 baby

1080
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Yes

1081
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,671
Are you never really raised

1082
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
Massive amounts of money you always

1083
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,999
You always kind of

1084
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,071
A hundred thousand two three four hundred thousand there

1085
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,143
$1000000 at one point but you never one for like

1086
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,471
Series a series B series C

1087
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
No

1088
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
First of all

1089
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
Either we had companies on the show

1090
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
That you know that have gone to BC

1091
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
And I

1092
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,783
Because they think they want to scale fast and they want to be first out the gate and they send you the money to really grow fast

1093
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,111
And I have to assume then and maybe even now you could

1094
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
Pretty easily get that money

1095
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,695
I was your reason why

1096
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,791
Yes because everything I saw and that we saw

1097
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Companies that took

1098
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,679
Private Equity money and especially if they sell the majority

1099
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:02,079
They didn't have control anymore and I we always joked that the first thing they would do is take that rose essential

1100
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,991
Cuz $850 a kilo that we use you know very very sparingly but very beautifully

1101
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,039
And they would take that out right away

1102
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:17,183
Getaways watch the consolidation in Personal Care in a natural Personal Care over the years

1103
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
And that's

1104
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Been a consistent

1105
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
Sing of

1106
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
Changing the product slightly or not really taken care of the brand and its original intention

1107
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
And there were a lot of unhappy people and not a lot of

1108
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Success

1109
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,663
All right so you guys have this really cool business

1110
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
You started together

1111
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
You're raising two

1112
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Kids

1113
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
Growing up 30

1114
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Byproducts yeah you still small but

1115
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
You can see where this is heading

1116
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
And how did you guys do as a couple how are you how is your relationship going

1117
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah it was very tough

1118
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,263
He married raising kids being under Financial

1119
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Pressure

1120
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
That takes a lot and it's

1121
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
We sort of we lost our way

1122
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
We lost our way but

1123
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
And

1124
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
We really cared about

1125
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Did you go

1126
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
To Kaplan

1127
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Sure

1128
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
And

1129
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
It was helpful

1130
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
At times

1131
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
And I think

1132
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
It was definitely helpful long-term

1133
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Because we can still refer back to

1134
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
How to work things out and how to smooth out our differences

1135
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
We also I think

1136
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
Individually did a lot of personal work

1137
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
And

1138
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
You don't got to a place where

1139
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
We couldn't make it work

1140
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,783
And so we separated and then divorced

1141
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
Thank you for hearing that

1142
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
Can I just be shocked

1143
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
You guys are sitting there

1144
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Together

1145
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
Talking so wonderful

1146
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Finally about each other

1147
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
And your divorce

1148
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
2007 Yukon

1149
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Divorce

1150
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Yeah

1151
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
I've never heard of a story like this my life

1152
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
Not only are you

1153
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
Business but you eat I guess so you

1154
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
You divorce

1155
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
And you guys decide what you say

1156
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
You know this business is going well it's a

1157
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,295
Keep it going is that

1158
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Is that what happened

1159
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
I think we decided

1160
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,439
There's no reason to like you know

1161
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Take down the house

1162
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Jelly Bean

1163
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Personal relationship

1164
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
Wasn't thriving our business

1165
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
Is

1166
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,423
Our kids are

1167
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,215
So what is

1168
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
The best way

1169
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
You know

1170
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
And

1171
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,847
We we understood our options we could have

1172
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
So we could have

1173
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,479
But each other how we could you know we had options

1174
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,599
So I mean this was a very conscious Choice adult

1175
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,135
Immature decision

1176
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,487
Like it speaks to the kind people both of you are just wondering like

1177
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,095
What is the people in in the office feel like I what was the atmosphere was intense

1178
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
What people like

1179
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,959
This is weird I got out of that employers respond

1180
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,031
Well the first two years were

1181
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
We're tough

1182
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,383
And certainly you know the first 6 months were the hardest

1183
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,199
And absolutely they said that

1184
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
And yet

1185
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,807
For me it just never got

1186
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,695
That bad like there was a lot of Demand on me to make it that bad.

1187
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
Family or culture

1188
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,607
You know what have you oh my gosh you got divorced yeah it's this is the path

1189
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Did you go down yet

1190
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
If all you're doing is you're looking

1191
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,239
To get through this day as

1192
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
Best you can

1193
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,335
It does shifted perspective a little bit

1194
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
The other thing I

1195
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,455
I think that's important is that there was no

1196
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
No other person involved

1197
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:57,343
So we didn't have to navigate that tour divide Trail

1198
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
So

1199
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
I think that

1200
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,463
Because we were parents that

1201
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Didn't alter

1202
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Life

1203
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Daily life

1204
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
That much

1205
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,935
If you're officially divorced

1206
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
And

1207
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,263
Reasonably that it's still not

1208
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Easy

1209
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
But the business really starts

1210
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,639
Take off I guess around this time

1211
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
Walgreens

1212
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
CVS

1213
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,527
Walmart start to express interest in carrying your products and

1214
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
Like what what explains that

1215
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
The timing

1216
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
I think that the timing really

1217
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
Was on our side we were kind of met because we were always ahead of the Curve

1218
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,815
Yeah we were on

1219
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
You know sort of the parallel path

1220
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
With

1221
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,959
All the natural food stores Whole Foods was growing

1222
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
Had a really Hefty clip

1223
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,311
That was such a natural venue for us

1224
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
Because

1225
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
People were

1226
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,407
Buying into the same beliefs

1227
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
About health and wellbeing

1228
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,039
When you started to get into places like Walgreens

1229
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Walmart

1230
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Target

1231
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
What is that

1232
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Infor

1233
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
I'm just like

1234
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
You meet the demand of in the world

1235
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,767
Even with your small little place

1236
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:13,375
Well that that really didn't happen in it in a big way until

1237
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,423
We launched our second brand

1238
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Everyone

1239
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
And that was an

1240
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
2012

1241
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,079
That was sort of a consumer

1242
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,871
Less expensive

1243
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,455
Everyday products like shampoo and Ryan

1244
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
George Allen

1245
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
Yeah it was a larger format

1246
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
Product and

1247
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,647
I send in a band in the Band came home and

1248
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
They had all these

1249
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
Really awful products

1250
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
In the bathroom when I went in

1251
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,631
And I was like have we taught you nothing like you know what are these products and

1252
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
They be like Eros too expensive and you need

1253
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,495
Indian Peaks open

1254
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,567
And then at the same time Brad was hearing from

1255
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
A lot of Whole Foods buyers that we

1256
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
You know

1257
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
We needed a large size value sort

1258
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Proposition

1259
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,063
So we we started a second line called everyone

1260
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
And that really

1261
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,439
Took off and how are you making it less

1262
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Expensive

1263
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
Expensive

1264
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Ingredients of how are you able

1265
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
How to make a more budget-friendly Prada

1266
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,447
We use many of the same ingredients however instead of using a rose

1267
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
Essential oils we may keep it to Citrus

1268
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103
Or instead of putting in a lot of extracts

1269
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,895
Text which are expensive as well

1270
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,199
We would you know Duo

1271
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,015
Much smaller amounts will be simplified

1272
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,343
Formulas in addition our margin is less

1273
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,719
Twin over the years you've raised very little money so you most of the company

1274
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
You guys are

1275
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Right

1276
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Yes

1277
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
I have to imagine

1278
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
Last year

1279
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
You been approached

1280
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,727
Buy all kinds of big

1281
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Beer companies who want to buy you

1282
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,311
Yeah and

1283
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
You said

1284
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,895
Right now

1285
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
Is there a reason why you wouldn't

1286
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Want to do that

1287
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
You know

1288
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551
The idea wasn't to cash out

1289
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,855
The idea was to

1290
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
Building Company that we wanted to work

1291
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
It provided

1292
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Opportunity

1293
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
For as many people as pause

1294
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
You know the other part of this

1295
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Is

1296
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,167
The business is part of our life

1297
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
But it never was

1298
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
Separate and so

1299
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,335
You can look at the success of the business

1300
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
And you can also look at the success of

1301
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Our relation

1302
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
Our family so

1303
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
It really has enabled

1304
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
The best

1305

Like life is pretty good

1308
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,023
To do both of you or both of you in

1309
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
New relationship

1310
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
What's today

1311
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,399
I am and have been for the past 5 years

1312
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,215
No Bradley still looking

1313
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
And and end with like

1314
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,079
It sounds like you still consider yourselves to be

1315
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
Really close maybe like almost best friends

1316
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
We are

1317
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,991
Yeah it's it almost it almost takes things

1318
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,087
Two whole different level you know you have really special relationships with

1319
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
Your siblings Brothers

1320
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Sisters and

1321
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,951
You also have some close friends and

1322
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,095
I think that we've kind of taking some of those Concepts and put them on steroids a little bit I mean imagine

1323
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,167
Choosing to engage on a daily basis

1324
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,703
Is with the person you divorced

1325
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Knowing all of the good things and all of the bad

1326
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
Thanks and it's still choosing

1327
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,359
To be together it's a wonderful

1328
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
Xperia

1329
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Yeah

1330
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,967
And we just mean we get along all the time

1331
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,807
So it's not that we don't get in a fight but we do tend to get out of fights

1332
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,159
I'm going to ask you some questions Susan first you

1333
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
What do you think it is about

1334
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Brad that enabled

1335
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
The store

1336
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Like

1337
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
What is about Hamlet that allowed you guys

1338
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,143
To stay friends and business partners and

1339
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
To work through the

1340
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Painting stuff like

1341
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,055
He has a brilliant capacity

1342
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
To be

1343
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
Irreverent

1344
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
And kind

1345
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
And

1346
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
Open

1347
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
And dumb and stubborn

1348
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
With all of these qualities

1349
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,367
We always come out aligned on

1350
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,159
What's most important

1351
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,511
Bratz but what is it about Susan that allowed for this to happen

1352
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,815
Her perspective

1353
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Her capacity

1354
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,703
To have compassion and

1355
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
There was a there was a

1356
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
A guy that came into our office

1357
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
The other day and

1358
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,151
Are there was someone sick in his family and

1359
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
The way that she

1360
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
I dressed him

1361
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
And engage

1362
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,295
With him he was met

1363
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
It was it was beautiful

1364
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
And

1365
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,951
To be able to be this close with someone and not be

1366
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,999
Involved romantically

1367
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
He gives me

1368
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Such a great opportunity to be a better

1369
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,935
What do you what do you attribute your success to success of this business at 2

1370
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,775
All the hard work you put into it in the Blood Sweat and Tears or or

1371
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
Your intelligence or just

1372

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,431

We're not such great business people will really great not going out of business people

1375
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,111
We haven't had the luxury to go out of business

1376
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:22,879
What not to make

1377
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
Work

1378
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
There's never been a choice

1379
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
Not to be

1380
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
Successful not to make it

1381
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279

And it's a beacon

1391
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,503
To show that it's very possible

1392
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
If we can do it

1393
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063

Hey thanks for sticking around

1425
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:27,039
Time now for how you built that and today our story starts in the cold Northern Waters

1426
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,623
Juneau Alaska are surrounded by the ocean on one side

1427
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,951
And then on the other side were surrounded by Ice fields and

1428
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
Which mountains

1429
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:41,631
This is Leah Heifetz and for years she and her partner Matt would get into an aluminum skiff and gopher

1430
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
Fishing out

1431
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:49,055
In the Pacific we be trolling for salmon or maybe we'd be fishing for halibut and the fish were

1432
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,615
Biting that day and

1433
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
Rather than go home empty-handed

1434
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,527
He was stopped at a kelp bed a bed of bull kelp to be exact

1435
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
Twisty brown seaweed that looks like a bullwhip a 5 gallon bucket full of

1436
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
And

1437
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,327
Be able to bring some Bounty home

1438
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,215
Because it is totally edible by then do it raw and it has the consistency of a bell pepper

1439
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
It's salty and crunchy

1440
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
And Heather deep

1441
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,407
Umami taste flavor are Savory bass flavor that makes everything in it tastes

1442
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,967
More like itself that's what your mommy does

1443
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:33,087
And it turns out full kelp can also be pickled or cooked into salsa

1444
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,879
So what I really am at right now

1445
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
One of those 5 gallon buckets home

1446
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:43,327
Call up some friends to grab some other ingredients so we would sometimes make a green salsa

1447
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,375
That had tomatillos

1448
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
Made a variety of other sauces that

1449
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,495
Add tomatoes and onions along with the couch

1450
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,895
Emollient that discovered a few years ago is that kelp was actually getting some attention among Foodies

1451
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
National scale

1452
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:04,575
There's a lot of Whispers in 2016 about helping the new kale

1453
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:10,463
Pull up nutrition into all kinds of things like pasta and jerky even butter

1454
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
Open Juno

1455
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
Leanne that started to sell their bull kelp salsa and pickles at farmer's markets and people kind of took

1456
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,727
Selling it locally for the huge

1457
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,311
Jump the consumers in Alaska

1458
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,895
A lot of them are familiar with it as a food

1459
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:35,295
Slowly try to expand their products House of Alaska has taken

1460
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,855
Some more education and

1461
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:43,487
A lot of demoing so people have the opportunity to try it and it makes sense to

1462
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:49,887
You salsa is kind of a gateway to get more people to eat kelp

1463
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:53,983
Martina try the salsa and they say it tastes pretty good

1464
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,543
The slight aftertaste of the ocean

1465
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:03,199
Anyway soon after they launched Liam at 1:40 thousand dollars in a startup competition and use that money

1466
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:09,599
I need to get their products into some Regional grocery stores on the west coast but doing all of this from Juneau Alaska

1467
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
It's

1468
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,671
Treetop we're not on the road system

1469
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,999
We are surrounded by the ocean and mountains

1470
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,303
And that requires some

1471
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
Real Innovation when it comes to Logistics

1472
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,007
Which means when they want to get their salsa and pickles out of Juneau usually involves

1473
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
A barge

1474
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,615
I'm sometimes a fairy and then

1475
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,431
Talking once it hits the road system or are afraid

1476
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
Slapping a pretty

1477
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,319
Immense challenge but since they went into business three years ago

1478
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:44,927
Tiamat and their other partner have been able to steadily grow the business

1479
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,511
There now harvesting canning and cooking bull kelp full-time

1480
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,607
They sell it online and in about 150 stores and guess what

1481
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:57,983
Last year they made $350,000 in Revenue

1482
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,823
Selling bull kelp sometimes I think I'm sick of it
