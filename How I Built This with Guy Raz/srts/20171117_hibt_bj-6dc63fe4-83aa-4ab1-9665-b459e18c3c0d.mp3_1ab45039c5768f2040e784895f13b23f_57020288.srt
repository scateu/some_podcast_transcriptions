00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Thanks

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,120
Who are 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,984
An email marketing platform used by more than 250 thousand cost

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
With mobile-friendly email Tim

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
A drag-and-drop email Builder

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
And customer support 7 days a week

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Campaign monitor.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Pillsbury

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Went to Independent ice cream distributors and you know till then

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Those Distributors continue to deliver Ben & Jerry's that they wouldn't sell them

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Haagen Dazs anymore we recognize that Pillsbury was controlling

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
The marketplace and they were using their power to keep competitors out so would you do we took our k

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
To the people we decided to go after the Pillsbury dough

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
Doughboy the most beloved

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
Food mascot in the country budgie little Doughboy but

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
This particular case it was a matter of survival

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Ramen PR it's how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories

18
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
And the movements they built

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
A two hippies named Ben & Jerry turn their small ice cream shop in Burlington Vermont

20
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
One of the most iconic ice cream brands in the world

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
I don't know about you but

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
I have a feeling that most people

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
At some point

24
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,480
I've spent a quiet evening in front of the television with a spoon and a

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
Chunky monkey Cherry Garcia

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
New York super fudge chunk

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Chocolate chip

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Cookie dough

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Because there's something

30
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Really comforting about

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
Pint of Ben & Jerry's

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Even though it's

33
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Full of sugar and saturated fat

34
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
It somehow feels okay.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
Maybe it's the fair trade symbol on the front or the

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
We buy from local Vermont Dairy Farmers on the side of the

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
Or most likely

38
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Seeing Ben & Jerry's photo on it

39
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Because

40
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
Kind of know they're good guys

41
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
That their hearts in the right place

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,344
And the thing is all that peace and justice

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
Quality stuff Ben & Jerry's

44
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Tied together with their brand

45
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,816
It's really wasn't a gimmick it wasn't a strategy designed to attract

46
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Customers because it's who they are

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
There weren't social Enterprises

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Is back when these guys started then they certainly never

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
I am to get rich

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
But they did do well at

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
They did

52
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Do good

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,712
And they're amazing story of building one of the most beloved ice cream brands

54
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Actually begins almost

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
60 years ago

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
When Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield

57
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
We're at the same middle school on Long Island

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
The New York

59
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
We were both fat

60
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
S kids

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
We were both

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
You know nerdy

63
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Not

64
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
Not in the mainstream socially

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
You know we were the two slowest fattest kids in gym

66
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,592
You know if you're running around the track and you're half a lot behind everybody else

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
There's another guy there beside you

68
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
You know you get

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Pretty friendly with

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
And did you end up going to the same High School

71
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Weekend

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
Yeah we went to Calhoun High School we

73
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Graduated

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Better

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
I was in debate

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
I lettered in debate

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
Alright so you guys grew up in Long Island you finish high school there and and did you

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Where did you go

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
Where did you go to college then where'd you

80
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
I went to a lot of college

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
I went to

82
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Colgate

83
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Skidmore

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
NYU

85
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
The new school to the circus

86
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
I dropped out of

87
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
All right and then I finally joined the university without

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
The most

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Unstructured College

90
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
The idea was that the whole world was your campus when you go out

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Learn whatever you

92
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Little Learning when you come back

93
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
To this administrative body

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
True that you learned it

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Greek

96
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
I dropped out of there

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
So

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
That was my couch

99
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,231
Still too much structure for Bend yet I like to tell people about you

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,607
I went to Oberlin College in Ohio I did 4 years straight

101
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
I was

102
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Pre-med

103
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
And

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,055
Applied to and got rejected from lots of medical schools on two different occasions

105
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
So

106
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
So you guys were I mean

107
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Visalia

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,855
But with what happened after you graduate how did you guys win

109
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
K'Nex

110
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,023
Well I I was working out of school for Disturbed kids in the outer on

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
I was teaching pottery

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Learn

113
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,055
Try to be a real Potter you know those who can't teach those who can't do while I tried doing it

114
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Nobody would buy my

115
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
So I left

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Deodorant

117
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
New York

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
In order to get

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
You know there's some more

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
Other influences on my pottery

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
It was so expensive

122
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
If you are

123
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
I needed to spend all my time

124
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Making rent

125
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Driving cab

126
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
So I had this apartment

127
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Pretty grungy

128
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Jerry

129
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Showed up in New York and moved into Ben's apartment or you just you just end up

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
I did say this after I graduated college and after my first bout of medical school reject

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
I moved in with Ben in New York

132
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
City and then

133
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
I left

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
And went to North Carolina and after my second bout

135
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Medical School directions

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,399
I connected with Ben again and it was at that point that we decided to

137
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,287
Put our fortunes together and open up a little shop witch

138
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,639
Yeah which turned out to be an ice cream cuz we didn't exactly think of it as a business

139
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:47,039
The Swede we thought of it as Adventure like listen to something because we're not right right that's exactly right

140
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Let's do something for a couple of years and then

141
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
After we do that let's do something else we we talked about becoming cross-country truck drivers after we did this ice cream

142
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,655
Seokjin was ice cream. The main idea was that we were going to do from the beginning cuz cuz I read that

143
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
That you weren't really sure what kind of shopping

144
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
You can do

145
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Yeah we thought we would do something with food

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Because we'd always liked

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
To eat and

148
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
We wanted to live

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Ana College

150
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
So we thought about

151
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Picking

152
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Food

153
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
That was

154
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Becoming popular

155
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
In big cities but had not yet been brought to a college.

156
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
And at that time

157
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
The foods we thought about where Bagels

158
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
And homemade ice

159
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
So we we went to a used restaurant

160
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,591
Rock supply store to price out Bagel making equipment

161
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
This was G&G Restaurant Supply in Albany New York Louis there Louisville

162
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
Old guy with a gold chain around his neck and a big cigar in his mouth and

163
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
He he told us we didn't have enough money to buy bagel

164
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
Equipment

165
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
He also told us

166
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
I wouldn't screw you Life's too short

167
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Guys were

168
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
I am in twenties and and did you sit down like

169
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
Hang out late nights

170
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,247
Putting out a strategy thinking Unisource card to

171
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Think about different ideas you could do together and were you

172
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Meeting and in cafes during the day or was it

173
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
I can't even

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
How did you even

175
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Started

176
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Develop this idea was it just much

177
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Bless it was much more

178
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Dialysis do this

179
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
This was in the old days

180
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
Four Cafe

181
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
No we did not mean caffe

182
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
But we did discuss it quite a bit

183
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,295
And we researched it quite a bit we sent away for

184
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
30

185
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
SBA pamphlets

186
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
That cost

187
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Between

188
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
$0.15

189
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
$3

190
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
/

191
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
On all the different aspects

192
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:15,519
Running a business just like a pamphlet from the from the small business administration that you I guess we're available

193
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,639
How to how to calculate your break-even point

194
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Pretty pretty basic stuff

195
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Yeah

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Our goal when we open

197
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
When was to make

198
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
20000

199
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Dollars a year

200
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Which was

201
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Which was pretty good in the late 70s right

202
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
No it was shity money

203
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
It's a long time to achieve

204
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
So when you were in New York have

205
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Think about what you could do how did you settle on

206
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,759
Ice cream shop in how did you settle on

207
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Burlington Vermont

208
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
Well we settled on ice cream because

209
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Bagel twin was too expensive

210
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
And we settled on Burlington Vermont because

211
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Originally

212
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,631
We settled on Saratoga Springs

213
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
We actually moved to Saratoga Springs

214
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
To get ready to open up

215
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Spending most of our time working on this

216
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Business

217
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
For an ice cream shop

218
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
Doing a lot of research and we took this correspondence course and how to make ice cream we were doing the car

219
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Of course

220
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
Big college textbook called ice cream by

221
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
William S Arbuckle

222
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
Thank you father of modern American ice cream

223
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Jerry could understand that

224
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
Very complex text

225
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
Because he had this biochemistry background

226
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Medical school

227
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
So there was some other

228
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Ice cream shop that opened up

229
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
In Saratoga Springs

230
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Beforus

231
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
It was called Afternoon Delight

232
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Did Disney make good ice cream

233
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
We don't know we left town before they opened up

234
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,863
Didn't want to compete we figured we had a better chance of success

235
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
We opened up in a place where there wasn't much

236
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Competition

237
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
Originally we were looking for Warren rural college town

238
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Already had ice cream

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Yeah

240
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Analyze we win

241
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
Further north than the only Town left

242
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
That we knew anything about what

243
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Berlin

244
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
It was an hour and a half South the Canadian border is out cold.

245
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
There wasn't much ice cream

246
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
Which one applies for a sec because

247
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
I think a lot of

248
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
People hear Ben & Jerry's in saying

249
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,655
These guys were hippies which is true and they're you know they're sort of

250
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
An activist in end

251
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
But that was just kind of

252
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,615
Slap SP you guys really did actually it mean there was a method to this Mew research

253
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Do you actually scoped out

254
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
Possible locations I mean this wasn't you were really actually

255
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
Trying to do this in a nautical way

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
We're very hard worker

257
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,975
When you describe it

258
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,583
Your you're and yes all those things happened but the way you're describing

259
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
Is putting a lot more

260
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
And planning into

261
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Then

262
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Then we actually did I mean we we just took one step at a time and we did whatever the next thing was

263
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
In front of

264
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
I think it was near that time that we

265
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Kind of realize that

266
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
You know the word business

267
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
Essentially kind of a

268
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Busy nurse

269
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
That is mostly common sense

270
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
And a lot of work

271
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Yeah

272
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
And I mean

273
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,911
This is pretty internet so you couldn't just go online and type in how to make ice cream with you could do today or

274
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Where do I buy restaurant quit

275
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
You had me things took a lot longer

276
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
The Yellow Pages

277
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah it's been a lot more with the phone book in the yellow vase

278
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah I mean you know what when when Ben and I talk to people today about taking

279
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Correspondence course

280
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,623
Correspondence courses don't exist right I mean the closest thing would be an online

281
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
Find course but the idea that

282
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,231
That somebody would mail you a text

283
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
And then you read through these text books and you

284
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,911
Fill out answers to a test and you mail it back to your

285
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,799
Effexor and then they grade it and then they mail it back to you and you find out how you did on your test

286
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,711
It's a quaint idea

287
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
$5

288
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Wow we split one between the two of us

289
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
When you decided when you when you told her no friends or

290
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Parents are family

291
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
We're going to go to Burlington

292
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
Vermont and where can I open up an ice cream shop

293
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Realize that you know

294
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
Baby 7 months out of the year

295
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Billy Colbert and and and

296
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Just

297
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
Might not make a whole lot of sense or did we do that covers

298
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
My parents were really happy

299
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Finally there's Sun

300
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Was

301
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Giving up the idea of

302
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Being a Potter

303
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
Finally becoming a businessman

304
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
This really

305
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Turn them on and

306
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
They were so

307
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Supportive of

308
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
I started

309
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Thinking

310
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Oh I must be

311
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Be doing the wrong thing

312
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Yes of course we

313
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
I thought about you

314
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
The cold weather

315
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
Jerry even came up with this idea of

316
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
A promotion that ended up in the business plan for pops at this week

317
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,647
Penny off per Celsius degree below zero winter extravaganza

318
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,279
Slowly Pops in the penny offer Celsius degree below zero winter extravaganza

319
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
You can say I'm slowly if you want credible and how did how did it work

320
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
The more you saved

321
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,775
Every degree below zero Celsius

322
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Which is 32° Farrah

323
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
You got a penny off the price your account which

324
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Was significant at the time because of cone cost $0.52

325
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,623
Cars you get to Burlington Vermont and lend you start looking around for the

326
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,183
The perfect place to open up your ice cream shop

327
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Well we got one of those clickers we did customer accounts

328
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Superiors corners

329
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,423
We didn't know exactly what number we were looking for but we did cut

330
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Did you really used to corner with a clicker

331
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
Creeper and you

332
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,871
Just clicks yeah and you would just click as people pass so you would know how many people pass a location every hour

333
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,479
Yeah ice cream is an Impulse I don't need to

334
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Money of the passing traffic

335
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
I mean I'm going to just

336
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,415
Just because that again like that is a pretty sophisticated

337
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Technic all in the SBA

338
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,703
Corner of the clicker and click

339
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Open your shop

340
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,871
You know I am going to interrupt your because I haven't been giving been enough credit

341
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
All these years been actually

342
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Does think a lot of

343
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
These things through

344
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
I think

345
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
I think it was me who I something

346
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Robot

347
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Yeah I think Ben's a very thoughtful

348
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Person

349
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
So after after all that research

350
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Where was Alec

351
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
It wasn't on the main drag was block off the

352
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
But it happened to be

353
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
You're right across from City Hall Park

354
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
It was a great thing for

355
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
And ice cream parlor

356
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Catacombs

357
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,711
The park and it also was an old gas station

358
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
It was totally dilapidated

359
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
It was falling apart

360
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Nobody wants

361
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Rent it

362
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,879
And it had some parking space

363
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Susan trunk

364
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Or the gas

365
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Which

366
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Who is also a

367
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Bloom for

368
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
And ice cream shop in a city

369
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
To have some places where people could

370
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Car jump

371
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Going to scoop

372
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
How much money did you have to have

373
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
To sign the lease and then also buy the equipment and

374
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Vino get the store ready

375
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
For customers

376
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Ben and I

377
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Each had four thousand

378
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
And that you saved I wrote

379
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Then actually borrowed

380
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
2 out of the forehead

381
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Father but that was fine

382
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Cuz that was our commitment

383
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Each other that we were

384
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
We are each going to come up

385
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
What's $4,000

386
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
And and then

387
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
We wrote this

388
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Business plan

389
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
In order to try to borrow money

390
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
From the local bank

391
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
You know we wrote A business plan only because

392
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
We felt like

393
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
It was the only way the bank

394
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455
Was going to lend us money

395
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Projections

396
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,551
Like five-year projections showing revenue and profit and loss

397
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
It it had projection

398
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
I can't remember if it were

399
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
Was five years I mean I probably was

400
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
In five years the beautiful thing about the business

401
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Show

402
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Then I didn't know how to write

403
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
But we we have a friend

404
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Jeff Furman who

405
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,543
Is mentioned off and then and Jeff used to work for the small business administration

406
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,383
In New York City and Jeff got us a copy of a business

407
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,967
That was from a pizza parlor in New York

408
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
So Ben and I pretty much copy that

409
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Except

410
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
Every place where it said slice

411
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Pizza

412
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
We we crossed it out and we wrote in ice cream

413
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
The other great thing about

414
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Was when we first rode out

415
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
And figured out our praise

416
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Projections

417
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
For how much ice

418
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Salad how much

419
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Cost

420
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
The projections told us

421
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Bat

422
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
We weren't going to sell enough ice

423
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Cream to stay in business

424
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
So

425
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
We just change the projector

426
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Kind of like the government and I think that's the way everybody

427
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,743
You just make it out I got to have this idea

428
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
That people come up with these projections and they're based on something and they're just made offer true

429
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
You see it all the time

430
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Silicon Valley

431
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Brighten it and if they don't work

432
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
You makeup different one

433
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
Brilliant

434
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
What is a first or look like

435
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Was it was it sort of

436
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Verizon in

437
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
What's the clouds in the

438
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Painted on the walls

439
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Cows

440
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
No but it was beautiful

441
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
I mean

442
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Ben says it was beautiful and it was beautiful

443
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Most people would have described it as

444
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Pretty funky

445
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Which is probably right

446
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
What's the aesthetic of what

447
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
What you were

448
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,455
Selling anyway right yeah homemade ice cream very much looked homemade

449
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
And it was very low budget as well

450
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Yeah how would you

451
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
When you open that first shot how what

452
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Flavors what are you

453
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Remember

454
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
Jerry probably remember

455
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Number spinner

456
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Vanilla

457
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Chocolate

458
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
Strawberry iced coffee

459
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Pretty pretty nice

460
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,031
Yeah the two unusual the first two flavors that we did that

461
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
You are not your normal one

462
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Oreo mint

463
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,783
And I mean ever that Jerry you are so that she can make her and Ben

464
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
You were the taste and I remember reading a long time ago that you had like

465
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Some you couldn't taste things because of some

466
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
You know China strike a number what

467
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
Things that you dealt with a hadn't ended so

468
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
You would have

469
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Focus on the

470
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
You love the ice cream is that true

471
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Yeah

472
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
I have a very very poor sense of smell

473
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
What's the term for that

474
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
Cold anosmia

475
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,199
It makes a lot of sense of and in some ways

476
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Not having a sense of smell

477
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:14,623
Was just kind of hidden blessing right because you had to rely on other senses that maybe

478
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,464
Competitors were thinking about they were focusing only on flavor

479
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Or

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Sore smell rather than

481
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Deal of ice cream

482
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Right

483
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,424
How did you I mean I remember the first time I tried Ben & Jerry's in the

484
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
I grew up in Los Angeles so not until

485
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
The late eighties

486
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,336
I'm but it was it was so different cuz it was chunky ice

487
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Big chunks in

488
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,504
Was that completely different in 1978 was what other people making ice cream like that

489
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,832
No they weren't they weren't Packaging

490
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
Ice cream like that

491
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
Came out of the homemade ice cream

492
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Genre

493
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
Like with big chunks in like

494
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,424
Right right right right because a lot of them

495
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,264
Our shop and a bunch of other homemade ice cream shops

496
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,896
You're making ice cream essentially in overgrown

497
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Homestyle ice cream maker

498
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
So

499
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
It's really easy

500
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Tube

501
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Put in big chunks

502
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
The difference

503
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Is that

504
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
No commercial ice creams were packaging ice cream like

505
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
And

506
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
As we discovered

507
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,192
The reason why they weren't doing it is because the machinery

508
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,032
The commercial ice cream Machinery was not designed to be able to

509
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
The handle large chunks

510
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
So all you would get would be visible itsy bitsy pieces that would flow through the Machinery well.

511
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,552
You didn't get the requisite

512
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
Mouth feel dry

513
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
I was making the ice cream

514
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
And it was no picnic

515
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Speedos big chunks

516
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
And Ben and I had many

517
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Discussions

518
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
About it

519
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Discussions like

520
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Like what

521
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
So I was

522
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Arguing

523
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
For having

524
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
A larger number of smaller chunks that were well distributed

525
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
Throughout the eye

526
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
And you know Ben was saying

527
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Know what people want

528
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
And this is what Ben Moore

529
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
But what people want is

530
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Really big

531
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
And they don't care if

532
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
They get a chance

533
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Free fight as long as they know

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
There's a really big chunk coming up next

535
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Hand

536
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
It turns out that was right

537
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
People love it

538
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
What happen if you open the first or what

539
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,312
Huge hit in Burlington right away

540
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
No

541
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,128
No we

542
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
We were hit in the summer

543
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
The first summer was great

544
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
And then

545
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
First winner

546
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Was also a revelation

547
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,928
I can get very slow and

548
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
One or two

549
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,352
Probably a few more than that but you know it's very slow and it and it was actually during that

550
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
First winter when

551
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Ben and I came up

552
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
With the idea of free cone day

553
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Dad

554
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
If we were still in business

555
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
After a year

556
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
We would celebrate

557
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
And treat all our

558
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Smurfs by giving out free ice cream

559
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
Because we thought it was so unlikely that

560
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
We would still be in business and

561
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
And we recognize

562
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
Show clearly that if we were still in

563
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
It was going to

564
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Because of the

565
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Support

566
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
Power custom

567
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Was there any tension between the

568
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
The two of you at that time

569
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Just about the size of the chuck

570
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Ben and I have a lot of trust

571
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Each other any

572
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Each other's judge

573
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
So we were never doubting

574
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
What the other

575
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
The person was doing

576
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,528
So there was that and then and then I think another thing was we had very different

577
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
Skills and interest Benes

578
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Tremendously

579
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Creative

580
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
Very spontaneous

581
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Very entrepreneurial

582
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
And I

583
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Like a manageable

584
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Agenda

585
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,728
Shuffle you notice it made sense the pain would come up with all

586
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
All these flavors and

587
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,640
Do all the marketing and I would sit back and make the ice cream because I start a new what I

588
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
So what

589
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
What was the Turning Point how are you able to survive that

590
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,512
First year we we ended up getting a SBA has this

591
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
Service called score

592
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,888
The service Corps of retired

593
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,448
You know if your

594
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
If you're a little business

595
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,056
You could get in touch with the SBA and say hey I

596
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
I'd like a

597
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
A mentor

598
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,432
And they would set you up with some retired business

599
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Vons USB inventor

600
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
We

601
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Ask for one

602
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
And we got more

603
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
And

604
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
It was in the middle of the winter and we were losing our shirt

605
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Couldn't make our alone time

606
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Again

607
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:15,936
He says all you know that's no problem just go to your task for a moratorium on your loan guy

608
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Maddie

609
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
He was an old guy named Manny

610
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
He said well

611
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
Just tell him you can't pay your loan right now that you can pay it you know when the weather

612
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
You know the old

613
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,528
Look up the light just let you pay entry

614
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
And we went to the bank and we said that and I said sure no problem

615
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Stay interesting

616
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
Extend the loan

617
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
That got us through

618
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Wow

619
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Images only in Vermont

620
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Yeah yeah

621
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
The shop opened in 78 and then I guess it was it was 1981 when Ben & Jerry's

622
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
What happened to be

623
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
An article in Time Magazine

624
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,432
Hugely influential Max at the time warp

625
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Words that mean when you

626
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Is that what they call you at the time

627
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,952
The best ice cream in the world the best ice cream in the world is incredible

628
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,816
You expected but not only that it was the cover story

629
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,400
Of time Mags out and that was the first sentence

630
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Undercover story

631
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
But you must understand at the outset

632
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
Is that Ben & Jerry's in Burlington Vermont

633
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Is the best ice cream in the world

634
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,480
That was all we needed to read if you read it on

635
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
It continue to say that

636
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
You know blah blah blah ice cream somewhere else is the best artist in the world

637
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
You know who needed to go any further than that but you know you know

638
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Prior to that article coming out

639
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,192
I started to realize that you know all these

640
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,544
You know reviews that you see for Broadway shows

641
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
You know where they say this is the best play ever all you'll laugh your ass off and whatever it is

642
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
She only one play this year

643
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:11,392
And then there were all these little excerpts from an article that was you don't like to

644
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,976
You know a page and you know the page went on to say

645
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,584
I really wasn't that great but you know there was a moment where you laughed your ass off

646
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
If they can do it I can do it when we come back once the Laughing guy down

647
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,808
How Ben and Jerry got a taste for the ruthless and competitive side of the ice cream business how the Pillsbury dough

648
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
I tried to take a bite out of the company

649
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And how Ben and Jerry

650
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488

NPR

Gyros

683
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
In the early 1980s

684
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
Ben & Jerry's was just

685
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Wine shop

686
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
In Burlington

687
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
And it was doing well

688
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
Ben & Jerry gave up

689
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Big

690
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Generous scoops

691

Ice cream

692
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
That happy customers

693
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
But they were pretty bad and doing all the things that took two

694
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Run a business

695
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
We weren't making a profit you know

696
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,664
16 hours a day that we were open 7 days a week

697
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,528
The standards that we had for ourselves

698
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
In terms of

699
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
How retail shop should be wrong

700
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
How to achieve

701
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,280
We were really good at creating

702
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,120
An atmosphere in the shop that was welcoming

703
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
On

704
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,032
Less than excellent at hiring people at supervising people

705
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
And

706
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Most of all

707
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
We were

708
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
Really bad

709
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Porsche Macan

710
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
You were giving away too much

711
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
Yes we

712
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
You know when you when you scoop out a nice big

713
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
Scoop for a customer

714
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
You get this

715
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,512
Beautiful smile and really warm response and it's

716
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,608
It's really positive reinforcement for over scooping

717
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
And you know better and I we wanted to make people happy

718
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,008
And also we want to keep our prices really low

719
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
You know in terms of the food service

720
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,176
In every business except for ice cream

721
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
The portions are controlled

722
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
In the back

723
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Out of sight

724
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Of the customer

725
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
When you're scooping ice cream

726
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:03,584
You're supposed to control the portion inside of the customer at the scoop is too big you're supposed

727
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
Take a little off in the customer

728
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Heat

729
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:13,056
One of the reasons we started packaging our ice cream was because we weren't so good at running a shop and

730
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,456
One of the things we thought about was well maybe we can't control how much ice cream were putting on a cone but

731
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
You certainly

732
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
Can control how much ice cream you're putting into a

733
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
Pint container because it only fits so much

734
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Right so

735
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
That was

736
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,560
That that was a big turning point for you or you when you decide to let the package of stuff before it before that we decided to

737
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,864
Actors in two and a half gallon

738
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Tugs and sell it to other people and let them figure out how intro the portion in Beijing

739
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,920
You know I mean I was the guy who is going around selling the ice cream

740
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
To these restaurants and

741
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
The restaurants would say

742
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,600
No I'm not going to carry your ice cream anymore because

743
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
My employees are eating it a lot of our problems would be solved if we made the ice

744
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
Scream

745
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,400
Shittier

746
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,824
You guys start sit to sort of getting more attention and into distributor ice cream

747
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
In pints I guess

748
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Pillsbury

749
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Distributing other brands like

750
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,856
They threatened other Distributors they said stop Distributing Ben & Jerry's

751
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,416
To the shops right yeah well Pillsbury had

752
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Haagen Dazs so they own them

753
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
And may they went to

754
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
Independent ice cream distributors

755
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
Who were Distributing all sorts of

756
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Brands of

757
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
AB ice cream

758
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Sand

759
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,264
You know told them that if

760
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
Those Distributors continue to

761
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
Deliver Ben & Jerry said they wouldn't sell them Haagen-Dazs

762
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
Did it start to cut into your sales

763
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Well

764
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,112
You know we we recognize that this was a real threat

765
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
Plus it it seems like it was illegal

766
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
That

767
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
That it was a restraint

768
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Crate

769
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,072
The Pillsbury was controlling

770
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
The marketplace and they were using their power to

771
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
To keep competitors out

772
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
But you couldn't sue them

773
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,800
Right in the Europe for million-dollar company and they were multi

774
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Milly maybe billion-dollar

775
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,920
Well I think we I think we did

776
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:32,576
Have a legal case but we realize that that was not really going to be the best place for us to fight them

777
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
Because they were so enormous

778
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
So what you do

779
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
We we took our case

780
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,096
To the people we started the what's the Doughboy afraid of

781
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Campaign

782
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,520
We decided to go after the Pillsbury Doughboy which

783
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,080
Was the most beloved

784
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Food mascot

785
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
In the country

786
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Pudgy little Doughboy

787
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Peggy glass from

788
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,064
Well if it was started by me going

789
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
2

790
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,672
Minneapolis to the Pillsbury world headquarters

791
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
I would say

792
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
A one-person picket line

793
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,632
The sign said what's the Doughboy afraid of it was a hand-lettered sign

794
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
Yeah I've never really done anything like

795
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Before

796
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:27,360
And did anybody else break come out and say okay we'll meet you or did they just ignore you like your this crazy man

797
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
Protesting in front of their headquarters

798
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
Nobody had any idea what I was doing there

799
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
I guess it was a fight for us I don't know if it was a fight for them yes it was a fight for survival from us.

800
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Nobody knew what was going on

801
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
So did they eventually drop

802
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Trap there

803
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,584
Restrictions and allow Distributors to prison be allowed to get

804
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Stop

805
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Forcing Distributors to

806
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
To not carry Ben & Jerry's right

807
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
Well they were there were a lot of

808
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
Steps that we took escalating the the pressure on Pillsbury

809
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
You know starting with a

810
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
Small classified ad in the back of Rolling Stone magazine and we flew aerial banners

811
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,696
Around the sports stadiums in Boston and we

812
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:19,840
We took out signs of the on the signs of the transit buses in Boston and we had a

813
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,680
And in the sleeping in the science of the same thing what's the Doughboy afraid of

814
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,056
This is the sign of on the side of the transit buses had these two

815
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
Pudgy white hands squeezing a pint of Ben & Jerry's I think it's

816
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,040
Don't let pillsbury's dollars strangle Ben & Jerry's

817
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
Something very provocative

818
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,440
It's amazing cuz it just doing that is a lot of work like

819
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,792
Organizing that campaign you were also running a business and

820
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,888
And trying to sell ice cream

821
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Constantly working all the time

822
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Yes but this particular case it was a matter of survival

823
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
You know this was like

824
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
You're either going to get shut down

825
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,712
And you you can't get your ice cream out

826
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
The people

827
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,296
Or you do whatever you can to

828
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
To get it out there

829
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Do you remember that

830
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,160
Remember working all the time

831
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,792
Yeah I certainly felt

832
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
During many of the times at Ben & Jerry's that

833
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
The experience was like

834
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,288
Falling down the side of a cliff trying to grab onto whatever Branch was

835
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,104
There you can hold onto

836
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
So you know in that situation

837
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
You know Folia

838
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
Tailgating at the branches you're not really thinking about well I might have a good time at the

839
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,584
But you know you're you're you're energized you know you're using all the Spells you have eaten

840
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,728
Doing everything you can to save your life and you know it's it's

841
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,288
It's really interesting its it's

842
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
It's a peak experience

843
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,784
Did you guys as you start as you as you grew and grew it was it was

844
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
Claim the obvious that you are

845
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
You can both make

846
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,744
A decent amount of money from from this are you okay with that I mean I mean

847
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,144
Did that did that conflicted with your own values or were they able to come say alright you know whatever where I'm at

848
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
I mean

849
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
So for me

850
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
I think it was something I needed to

851
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
Grapple with

852
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
I mean

853
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:46,016
Part of the thing for both Ben and me was that we never really saw ourselves as bosses

854
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
You know from from early on we were scooping ice cream

855
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,048
Right next to everybody else who was scooping ice cream right we were mopping the floors at night

856
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
And

857
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,984
We didn't have a very good boss mentality we we had a good worker mentality you know Dennis the most

858
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Anti-authoritarian person I've ever come across and here he was being an authority I mean it was laugh

859
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Affable

860
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
You were the CEO I was

861
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
And how do you feel about that

862
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Did you

863
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Did you ever feel like

864
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
This is weird but I'm a businessman never signed up for

865
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,976
Yeah there was a time when when

866
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Jerry and I both

867
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
Turned around looked at ourselves

868
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
Said to each other

869
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
You know we're not

870
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
Ice cream man anymore

871
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Spending our time

872
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,824
Being bosses and hiring and firing

873
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
So much of what we were doing was in order to

874
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
AR loans back to the bank and

875
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
We felt like

876
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
We were becoming just another

877
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
COG

878
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
In this economic

879
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
Machine

880
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
Reaction to that was towed to sell the business

881
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Somebody actually

882
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
We put it up for sale

883
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
This was early on this was

884
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
In the 80s

885
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
And then

886
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,544
I ran into this older

887
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
Restaurateur

888
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Oh that I had

889
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Come to know that

890
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
I explained to him

891
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
That we were

892
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
Planning to sell the business and he said

893
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
How could you possibly do that

894
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
The business is your baby

895
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,696
Has so much potential ahead of it

896
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,024
And I said Maurice you know what business

897
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,072
Those it explodes the community attic

898
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,144
Employees exploits the environment

899
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
He said that if there's something

900
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,776
But you don't like about business why don't you do it different

901
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,896
That was when we decided to

902
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
Conduct this experiment

903
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
To see if it was possible

904
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
That business could be

905
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,136
A tool for improving the quality of life

906
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
People

907
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Supposed to

908
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Making

909
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
People's lives worse

910
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
What are the things you guys you guys did was you had a policy where

911
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,776
Highest paid employee couldn't earn more than five times as Hillary of an entry-level worker

912
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
You also had like they care and

913
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,920
Heated College tuition a in bunch of things

914
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Profit sharing

915
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,064
Is that what you mean when you say you wanted to try to do business differently

916
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
That's part of it but

917
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,904
I think the more critical part of it

918
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Is

919
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
Using our business

920
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
To address

921
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
Social issues

922
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
Through the very

923
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Fabric of our business

924
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
So that man like

925
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,544
Taking very very vocal positions on

926
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Hot button issues but also

927
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,640
Doing things like

928
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Like

929
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Working with

930
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Former prisoners from former employer

931
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Felons right who were making brownies in the

932
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
Bakery in New York

933
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
That that that's

934
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:09,023
Our project with the greyston bakery and and deliberately choosing to

935
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
Use this

936
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
Ingredients supplier

937
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Because

938
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
This particular ingredient supplier

939
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Was driven by a social mission

940
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,639
Providing employment opportunities for formerly

941
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:31,039
And that's a very good example of how Ben & Jerry's demonstrated that

942
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:37,439
Able to make a profit and address social problems at the same time

943
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:43,839
So after all your success

944
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
And then in the 1990s

945
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
Eventually Ben & Jerry's

946
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Did end up

947
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
Consulted to Unilever

948
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,359
Which is this huge multinational right its hold I think in mm

949
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
And it was sold by the company's board

950
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Without your permission

951
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
That's correct

952
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,575
How did it happen I mean how was your company

953
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
Sold without your consent

954
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,207
Well it was it was a public company

955
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Which meant that

956
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Call anybody

957
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
Could own shares

958
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
And I

959
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Unilever

960
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,191
Ended up offering so much money that

961
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
The board of a

962
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
The company

963
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
Couldn't find an alternative

964
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
For the shareholder

965
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
That they thought was acceptable

966
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
Did you guys see the board can't do this

967
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,759
I can't do this for over. I Need You To Survive desert Wednesday

968
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Definitely can do

969
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,879
Well eventually we we had to go along with it

970
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Why were you opposed

971
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,023
You know I think that the thing that was most important

972
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Was to

973
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
Maintain the

974
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
The social mission of the company

975
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,959
We felt like

976
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
Another company where to buy Ben & Jerry's

977
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,687
They would not continue those cutting-edge social Mission activities

978
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,551
What does it mean practically for the two of you didn't mean that you were slow

979
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,111
Done going into Ben & Jerry's

980
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
Is the offices everyday

981
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:18,047
You know I think a lot of it was up to us about what it meant

982
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,631
That was going to continue to be an independent board

983
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,775
In the new entity that oversaw the social Mission and I think Ben and I could have

984
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,591
Remained on that board

985
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,407
And we both chose not to

986
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,503
Well I can't speak for Ben

987
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
You know I had no idea what was

988
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,879
Going to happen to the company and

989
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
I mean quite frankly I just didn't want to be part of it

990
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
But at that point

991
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
What did she want to be on the board

992
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,303
You know I don't like

993
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,471
Lost in a major battle in terms of trying to keep the company independent

994
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:02,591
I didn't want to continue under the ownership

995
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Of of Unilever

996
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
So

997
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,199
Did you both

998
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
Kind of just mentally

999
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,783
Checkout

1000
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
I totally checked out

1001
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,207
Damn it's a good way to put it were you sad

1002
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
A lot of people who found the show in a lot of people listening would say oh my God they think they walked away with millions of dollars like

1003
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,703
What an incredible achievement they started this little shopping Burlington in

1004
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,799
An innocent International brand and it's done all these amazing things like

1005
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:38,687
This is their moment to shine and to take to do a dance and but but it sounds like you guys were real

1006
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Depressed about the

1007
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Yeah

1008
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,831
You know if the goal was to

1009
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Make a bunch of money

1010
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Then I guess

1011
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
You know

1012
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
It would have been a different reaction

1013
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
Wasn't really the goal

1014
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
Bright

1015
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,351
You guys were very vocal about

1016
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
Your positions on

1017
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
Guns and on

1018
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Obviously

1019
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Socially liberal

1020
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,335
The company still does that today I'm even though you're not

1021
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Owners of it

1022
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
Is that a surprise you

1023
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
But they still do that

1024
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Well it's

1025
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
It became

1026
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
Intertwined with

1027
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
The brand

1028
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
You know if Unilever

1029
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Bought

1030
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,767
A brand and bought the Goodwill that goes along with

1031
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Brandon bought the wreck

1032
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Mutation

1033
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
That goes along

1034
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Jaden

1035
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
Need to

1036
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,007
Continue those activities

1037
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
In order to

1038
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Keep that brand strong yeah I'm I'm

1039
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Very pleasantly

1040
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
Surprised

1041
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,735
And proud of

1042
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
What company does I mean

1043
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Company

1044
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Came out in

1045
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
Port of

1046
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
Occupy Wall Street a few years ago which was amazing because that that was essentially in

1047
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
Anti-corporate movie

1048
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,887
Ben & Jerry's night. Unilever

1049
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Yes

1050
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,239
And within the last year the company came out

1051
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
Weather statements

1052
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,567
Support of black lives matter

1053
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
I mean the company

1054
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
Does not shy away from controversial issues and that is a really difficult

1055
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Book called thing for a business to do it which is why you don't see businesses doing it and yet Ben and Jerry

1056
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
It is

1057
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,815
Courageous enough to to wade into those areas

1058
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,191
You guys see each other

1059
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Rudy Ruettiger

1060
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
But you hang out a lot

1061
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,735
If there's one thing about your story is more interesting than anything else is your friendship I just

1062
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
It really is a

1063
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,391
Powerful part I know it's torrential sensor is happy and I don't mean to like make make you guys

1064
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,463
Feel uncomfortable it is amazing it's really

1065
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Impressive that you

1066
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
That you really like to hang out with

1067
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Good friend

1068
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
You know

1069
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
People say that

1070
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
I don't

1071
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
I don't really understand it

1072
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,799
I mean you know lots of people

1073
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Friends

1074
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
For most of their

1075
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,711
Well I I do appreciate it more and more the older I

1076
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
I must say

1077
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
You know I'm sometimes

1078
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,391
Recently been and I have been talking about how we're a little bit like

1079
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Fred and Barney

1080
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,815
Could we drive places together a lot and

1081
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
I think we just relate like that

1082
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,215
Is it strange to think that this little ice cream shop

1083
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
You started as a

1084
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
500

1085
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Million-dollar

1086
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
Well it's it's strange to I mean to me it doesn't

1087
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
Feel like the same

1088
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
They're just not the same

1089
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
The company has taken on a life

1090
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Yeah

1091
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
You know the ice cream shop

1092
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
Will always to me be

1093
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,719
Ben and me in the store

1094
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:08,095
Make an ice cream scoop and ice cream Ben behind the stove

1095
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
Cooking up food I mean that's

1096
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
That's what the ice cream

1097
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Friendship quotes

1098
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Yeah

1099
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
Your name Ben Jerry and

1100
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Tibetan a managerial

1101
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,359
Like it's you and end in will be forever it's like

1102
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:26,015
Italian paranzino Worcestershire sauce a coolie whose parent the right place someday who's hog

1103
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:31,135
Who's that who's that

1104
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
Is it going to call Ben & Jerry's like you're not going to

1105
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Think about the people behind it right I mean

1106
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Yearning

1107
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Yeah I know what you mean

1108
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
I mean half the people think we're dead

1109
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,543
You know when we get credit for I mean think about the guy who invented vanilla

1110
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,895
Yeah who was that he don't get credit for now

1111
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
To me it's amazing

1112
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
To the degree that the company continues to be outspoken about Progressive issues

1113
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,879
And Progressive as it's not

1114
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,743
Its of no interest to me to have Ben & Jerry's be thriving

1115
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
And whatever

1116
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:14,911
If it's just selling ice cream I mean who wants to be part of that

1117
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,007
What do guys think about

1118
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,079
This incredible thing that you felt

1119
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
How much of it was

1120
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,199
It was because of all your hard work and

1121
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,783
Allen and her intelligence and how much of it was just

1122
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Because you were lucky

1123
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
There is

1124
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
A very big part

1125
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Good Fortune

1126
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Involve

1127
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:44,607
I think there's a lot of people who work really hard who have really good ideas who are really committed and

1128
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
And they don't

1129
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,679
Have the same level of success

1130
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
The Ben & Jerry's

1131
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,311
Yeah I mean I guess originally we were going to open our ice cream shop in

1132
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
Saratoga Springs New York

1133
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:03,295
Some other ice cream shop opened up before us and we didn't want to compete so that's what brought us to Vermont

1134
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
I think if we had

1135
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
Started in New York

1136
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,023
We never would have gained the local

1137
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
Following that we gained in Vermont

1138
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Vermont

1139
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
If we could be

1140
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,935
A bigger fish in a small pond

1141
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,239
Teacher did either of your parents

1142
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
What was either of them ever get to see

1143
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
What Ben & Jerry's became

1144
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Yeah

1145
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
Mine were still alive

1146
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
Probably through the

1147
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
1980s

1148
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
Yes I'm from IP

1149
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,879
Were they proud of you

1150
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,999
A whole lot prouder than when I was trying to be a Potter

1151
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:57,823
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream

1152
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,479
Play there was a study done earlier this year by the international Dairy Foods Association people to name their face

1153
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,783
Favorite ice cream unless you can imagine

1154
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:12,927
The Usual Suspects turned up chocolate vanilla mint chip but right there right near the top was

1155
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
Cookie dough chocolate chip cookie dough

1156
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
Which

1157
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,839
Okay may not be all that surprising because everybody makes cookie dough right

1158
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,935
But it wasn't always a classic flavor because in fact

1159
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
It was invented by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield

1160
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
In that

1161
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
Tiny little shop in Burlington in the 1980s

1162
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
And to this day

1163
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
One of the most

1164
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
Popular flavors

1165
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,575
What elephant did Cherry Garcia enter into

1166
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Ben Jerry's

1167
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,463
We got a postcard and Anonymous postcard

1168
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
We're both

1169
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,423
Deadheads and we're also Ben & Jerry's fans

1170
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,287
You think you want to come out with a flavor called Cherry Garcia because

1171
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,895
Amazing your real who for the fans and dead paraphernalia always sell

1172
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,943
What did Jerry Garcia think of it

1173
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Well

1174
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
There was one

1175
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
That was reported saying

1176
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
Well at least they didn't name a motor oil after date

1177
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,287
And stick around because it just a moment we're going to hear from you

1178
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
U of A

1179
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that

1189
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,567
And I'm just going to say one word right now may bring back

1190
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
More of a memory

1191
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
For some of you the word is

1192
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,527
Sex and the future of plastics is not particularly great I mean

1193
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Think of all this

1194
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,135
I need pellets from plastic cups and straws and plastic bags and all of it

1195
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:23,487
Swirling around in this giant Vortex and washing up on our beaches

1196
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,815
And that's where David Stover and his friend been coming

1197
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Their Avid Surfers

1198
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Percentages

1199
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,519
Seeing all of that pollution so we started researching all the types of plastic there getting into the ocean

1200
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,615
And we kind of stumbled across this issue of discarded fishing nets

1201
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,943
Most commercial fishing nets are made of this

1202
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
Belief

1203
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,527
Plastic and when those Nets get old

1204
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
They just kept

1205
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
Runaway

1206
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:54,975
Then that's can be left illegally in a landfill they can be burnt on beaches which happens quite often in unfortunate

1207
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,023
In many cases the Nets can be left in

1208
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
In the ocean

1209
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,119
Dayton bandsaw set backgrounds in engineering so

1210
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,447
A few years ago they decided to run an experiment

1211
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
And what they did was

1212
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
They collected a bunch of old men

1213
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
From fisherman in Massachusetts

1214
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,175
And I found a plastic slab where they could melt the nest down

1215
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
You know maybe repurposed

1216
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,319
And the Nets are melted into it's kind of like a spaghetti string it's chopped up

1217
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:24,927
Like the end of the spaghetti is chopped up by little blade and put into these little pellets

1218
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:30,815
You know it's it's very similar to like putting your hand into a bag of rice when you put your hand in the bag of pellets

1219
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,351
Okay so the question is

1220
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,655
What can you actually do with a bunch of

1221
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
Plastic pallets

1222
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:42,335
Will taking a bath actually figure that out when Ben was working on a project in Santiago Chile

1223
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,407
He was at Park watching a bunch of skateboarders

1224
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,711
And kids kept riding by on these

1225
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,783
Cruiser skateboards and he called me like that day and was like

1226
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,575
I got it like why don't we just make

1227
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,903
Skateboard decks from the plastic like it's terrible with strong and

1228
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,975
We gonna turn that idea over to Kevin and our team who is

1229
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:04,351
Had worked for Boeing and he started playing around with designs of a skateboard deck from the fishing nets

1230
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
Okay so 8

1231
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
Total Stroke of Luck

1232
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
Turns out that that

1233
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
Berries and Thyme

1234
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,359
The Government of Chile was giving out grants to fund all these different kinds of startups

1235
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,127
So David

1236
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Act up

1237
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,967
Move to Chile started collecting fishing net

1238
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:26,111
And found a factory in Santiago to work on turning those old Nets into skateboard deck

1239
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:32,511
The first couple of times we made board they were not pretty in and not writable and we had to kind of adjust

1240
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:37,375
The temperature of the molding and how the material is processed and that took

1241
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
You know the better part of six to eight months of going back and forth finally settled on a design that held

1242
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,335
Shape and actually look pretty good

1243
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,711
We designed the board like a fish which is a shape of a skateboard that has kind of a fishtail and

1244
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,527
We put a fish eye on it and fish scales and

1245
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,855
It was just something that you know grab people's attention

1246
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,951
Davis company is called borello and since it's launch three years ago

1247
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
It's repurposed more than

1248
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,559
300000 lb of old fishing nets

1249
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Consoled about 8

1250
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
Thousand skateboard

1251
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,191
And David says they hope to turn a profit by Nick

1252
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
The biggest question you get asked from everyone is

1253
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,663
You know what are you guys going to do when you run out of gnats but are are kind of clever responses always been well but if we run out of fishing

1254
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,503
Not tonight then I guess our job is done and we can sleep easy at night

1255
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,087
