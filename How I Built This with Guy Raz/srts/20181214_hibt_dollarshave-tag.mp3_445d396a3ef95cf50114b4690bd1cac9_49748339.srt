Improv comedy and video marketing into the Billion Dollar Dollar Shave Club

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Billion dollar companies

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
You said

61
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Even exist

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
10 or 50

63
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
18 years ago

64
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,840
Companies like Airbnb or lift or SnapChat or Spotify or Hulu

65
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Pretty incredible he's sick about it because

66
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
There's a pretty good chance that today

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
You use at least one if not all of the

68
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
EServices

69
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
And even if you don't like what

70
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
These companies offer

71
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Can't deny that their innovative

72
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
That they all offer a new way to do something

73
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Getaround

74
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
Find a place to crash or listen to music or watch TV

75
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
These are some of the sexiest startups

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Years

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
But now imagine a complete

78
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Wheatley opposite idea

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
A business that not only offers a boring product

80
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
Funny product that is dominated by one big

81
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Company

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm talking about men's razors

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
And just a decade ago Gillette

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Owned

85
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
70%

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
The US

87
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Shaving Market

88
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
But today

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Gillette overall market share

90
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Closer to 50%

91
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
And that

92
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
Partly due to a company called

93
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Dollar Shave

94
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
It's a company

95
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
But decided to take off

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Start by offering a better razor

97
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
But by offering

98
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
A better story

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
The story of how Dollar Shave Club went from a scrappy website

100
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Billion dollar exit in just

101
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
5 years

102
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
Is more about Michael dubin's instinct

103
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Fashion marketing job

104
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Santa Isabel

105
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Anything else

106
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Because for almost 8 years

107
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Before he launched Dollar Shave Club

108
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
Michael Dubin was doing two things that would help him figure out how to

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Penetrable Market

110
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
What are those

111
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Things was creating videos for corporate client

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
The other

113
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Probably more important

114
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Was taking

115
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Improv classes

116
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Night

117
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
Those two skills would help Michael

118
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Create one of the most

119
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Successful guerrilla marketing campaigns

120
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
In modern history

121
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
But long before any of that happened

122
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Michael hadwin

123
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Because a pretty normal childhood

124
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Suburbs

125
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Philadelphia

126
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Dad was a lawyer and his mom was a

127
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Teacher and then later work

128
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Real estate

129
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,671
Earlier this month at the theater at Ace Hotel

130
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Downtown LA

131
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Shutdown cycle douban in front of a live audience

132
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Find out why

133
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
On snowy days

134
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,703
His mom used to force him and his sister to stay inside

135
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Unsolved math problems

136
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Not right

137
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Welcome Michael

138
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
Thanks for having me is that actually true that on snow days your mom would make you solve math problems or said apocryphal

139
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
You weren't allowed to

140
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
You know it was like you can have fun but

141
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Before you have fun

142
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
You're going to

143
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Be productive

144
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
I think we carry that with us wherever we go there's like

145
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,095
A little bit of guilt that we have whenever we have fun somewhere yeah you like I should be doing math problems

146
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,447
Yeah exactly is a good lesson to your work first have fun later

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
I might see you grew up mainly I guess in in

148
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
The suburbs of

149
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
I'm curious

150
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
And this is a little bit of foreshadowing

151
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
You're so don't get too ahead of ourselves here but

152
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
As a kid or is it

153
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Teenager were you into

154
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Theater or

155
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,415
Acting or school plays dramas did you do that kind of stuff I did I was always in the school play

156
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,255
I was in the I was the lead in the school play in

157
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
Fourth grade it was called Peace Child

158
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
NP child was all about

159
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
Preventing a nuclear Holocaust through song

160
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,847
And literally no truly there was a song that was called I want to live

161
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
I want to live in something like

162
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:17,087
I want to live the right to live my life I don't really like

163
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
I think you know why Messi

164
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
The theater cuz we'll get to that later

165
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
What about General academic

166
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Text me

167
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
Did you feel like you were a good student

168
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,679
Did you become a good student I was not a good student I was not

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
A horrible student I was good at

170
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
At the subject

171
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
That I was

172
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,895
But if I wasn't interested in the subject matter it was really hard to get me to pay attention I'm also

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
I was probably one of these kids that went undiagnosed

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
Add to it but

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
Yeah I don't think I was much of a student I did okay

176
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
Good enough of you went to a

177
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Pretty good school you went to Emory University

178
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
And you studied

179
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
3 they're right she started out as a poli-sci major

180
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
But I flunked poli-sci 100

181
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
Actually twice by fun in class twice

182
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,615
In back-to-back years which goes to show you what kind of student was my freshman and sophomore year

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
And then can do that anymore so I began history major

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
Because I always loved

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,063
History and I love reading about history and studying history so she did fairly well at that

186
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
I had a killer internship with a

187
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
With a company called Bright House

188
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
Now she got super into my internships at CNN

189
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
So I actually did more X

190
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Security I think in college

191
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
And it got really into those things in that helped set me on my career

192
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
So you graduate college

193
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
And what did you what did you do

194
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
So I

195
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
Peking of page of the NBC page program like Kenneth

196
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,223
Correct the page program

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Kenneth Rosenberg

198
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
So

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,391
So yeah it was a page program which for anybody knows of the page program as you get to

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
It's 50 kids that they take right out of college

201
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
And

202
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
You basically have the keys to the castle

203
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
You run around NBC Rockefeller Center

204
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
And the studios and you see the audience's for the shows you give tours of the studios and the trade-off is that they give you

205
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Opportunity to take mini job

206
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
In different departments

207
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
And so does many jobs can be with Saturday Night Live or Nightly News or you know that's on the Rosie O'Donnell show

208
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Still on the air

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
And you do those mini jobs

210
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
We're Simon's for 10 weeks each so I had some pretty cool

211
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Assignments

212
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,255
And it was just I mean I've said this before but outside of this job at DSC

213
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
That was my

214
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
So

215
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,423
Was that your idea that you would stay in journalism or media like was that

216
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Were you start to think

217
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
And this is what I do

218
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,615
Yeah I was super passionate about it and went to work at NBC and

219
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,199
Then went to work at MSNBC first as a PA and it's a writer and I

220
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
I thought that I would have

221
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Career in the media

222
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
And maybe even in journalist

223
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
But I think it a certain point the 24-hour news cycle

224
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
You work all day to build a story and a narrative

225
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
And then it 5 p.m. right before your Show are there

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,887
They would know there would be some breaking news and all your work would get thrown out and

227
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
And then I also felt like

228
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
It was right around the time that I started thinking

229
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Like I really want to be in marketing Robert

230
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
I mean how did you make that leap

231
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,991
Edu expose marketing and advertising or did you just think this could be interesting

232
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
What I had

233
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,903
I had I had this really performative internship in in Atlanta

234
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
And I got an opportunity to love

235
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
A friend of mine

236
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Cousin who ran a small

237
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Marketing

238
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
King firm in New York

239
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
City that was doing you know client service work for a couple minor league sports teams and the main project that I worked on was I

240
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
We're done early website print alarm company

241
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
And then I left with the one of the partners at that firm to go over to time Inc

242
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Yeah and

243
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Life magazine in the relaunch of

244
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Life Magazine

245
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
2005's

246
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
And

247
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
I spent a couple years at life and then I spent a couple years ago

248
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
Sports Illustrated sportsillustrated.com and networking General was

249
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463

People might remember the term microsite I build microsites for some of the Big Brand advertisers at life

251
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
And for Sports Illustrated

252
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
Yeah there's could have been for Gatorade or for Sega learning how to do this on the job

253
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Build a micro website or

254
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Make a video or something

255
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
For these Brands just figuring out what would be interesting to a user

256
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,831
How to present visual information with some copy in a way that's digestible

257
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
How would I layout

258
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
This website and you know I've always been a bit of a visual finger so it's fun it uxu eyes

259
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Maze

260
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
For a puzzle

261
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,167
That's what great Architects do that's what great Zeus restaurant designers do when they lay out of spacer

262
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Designer hotel lobby

263
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,311
What great product designers do ux UI designers do they create

264
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
These

265
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Mazes

266
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,735
For people to go in and that's enormously satisfying when you can watch masses of people

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Follow your

268
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Read yeah

269
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
All of this

270
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
This is happening

271
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm in New York or New York in the early 2000s and

272
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
You decide to

273
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Take improv class

274
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Almost 8 years have that

275
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Startup

276
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
Was it just something you want to do for fun

277
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
July

278
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
I've always been passionate about comedy and

279
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,823
I'd heard when I worked at NBC that all of the great comedians that were on SNL

280
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
I trained and Improv

281
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
And a lot of them had trained at the Upright Citizens Brigade

282
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
Which of the time they only had one studio in the in the West Village

283
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
And

284
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
I was just

285
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,671
You know I said what up I want to do that you know just sign up just

286
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
Pay the fee a hundred bucks take the entry-level class and see how you do and it just stuck

287
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,679
I felt totally in love with it before too long I was taking sketch classes as well and you do this like weekly

288
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Clear yeah you take a couple classes a week

289
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
It is sketch class you have some homework to do you have to write comedy sketches

290
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
If you going to practice improv at night with a bunch of people that you've never met before you I'll run some weird Studio space and you make

291
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Jokes at 9 p.m. and it's

292
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
You know very bizarre

293
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Experience

294
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
So you had you had this marketing job during the day

295
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Making videos and

296
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
And then at night you were

297
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Doing it

298
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
And I was also trying to start my

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
My first startup

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Which is a social network for travelers so yes I was busy

301
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Happen to the social

302
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
For travelers

303
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
So yeah

304
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
But I'm trying to stand I mean

305
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
There must have been something about improv like

306
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
I have to imagine in your mind you're thinking

307
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
Maybe I have a shot at being a comedian or being on SNL or was that

308
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
What you were thinking

309
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
I would never admit that but yes

310
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Got it

311
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
Yeah that's right right because why would you take improv classes

312
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
4 years

313
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Amelia Amelia

314
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Is Brigade

315
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,911
Two three nights a week and just watch the most

316
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Amazing comedian

317
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
People that have gone on to have amazing careers

318
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
People like Donald Glover

319
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
You know I went to go see Donald Glover win

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
He was doing these shows in the air in a basement in Chelsea under groceries

321
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
And

322
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
You watching six

323
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
210 people on a stage

324
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,135
Pull ideas out of thin air and weave them together into a

325
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Story

326
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,999
That that makes you laugh and comedy is one of the hardest things to do.

327
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
There's a setup

328
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
And then there's

329
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
The equal sign

330
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Right it's a plus b plus C equals

331
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Hahaha

332
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
That takes magic that takes real talent and so it's addictive

333
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
And when you get it right and when you do it well

334
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
It's a high

335
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
And I also

336
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,199
It was such a great way to blow off steam in the evening as well because

337
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,063
You have these really hard long days at work where you're getting grinded by your boss at work

338
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
And you know you're trying to start this social networking

339
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
For travelers

340
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
In the margins

341
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
You know then it's like

342
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
You know you can go to the gym or you can go to

343
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
Wheatley blow your mind and do some Improv

344
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Was there any

345
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Part of you that thought

346
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
This can help me one day

347
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
If I want to start a business

348
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
This was that

349
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Even a journal of a thought in your mind now

350
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Cuz right now today you was saying okay

351
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,223
In your twenties do some improv learn marketing and that can help you

352
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Sell razors on the internet

353
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
So you are in your 20s

354
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
You're in New York and I guess your by this point

355
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Approaching your early 30s

356
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
And you decide to leave you decide to just

357
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Go and move

358
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Go to hear Los Angeles

359
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,591
Why I mean quit your job in marketing in New York improv troupe therein

360
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
Come here what yeah well I got laid off

361
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
So that I'd like a lot of

362
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
There's no hero story there

363
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,391
Sorry sometimes life happens on you

364
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
So yeah I got laid off

365
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,327
I was dating a girl at the time and in who lived in Los Angeles and

366
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
I always wanted to live in California at some point

367
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
So you know life

368
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Happened on me

369
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
And I said Now's the Time like you know

370
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,847
I've got nothing to lose so no plan no job

371
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
You just came out here

372
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
No plan no job just came out here

373
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
And what did you

374
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Did you start to do

375
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
So I

376
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,087
Through a friend I was able to get a job at a small

377
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Video marketing agency

378
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
And what they were doing is they were

379
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Helping brands

380
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Develop and distribute

381
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Videocon

382
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm in this was probably 2000-2010

383
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,959
So simple customer.

384
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Doing work for big Brands putting it online but

385
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
Doing it in his face that was you know

386
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Pretty squarely in video

387
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
So I'm curious to finalize I guess

388
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
It's her

389
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Somewhere near the end of 2010

390
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
This is a fateful moment for you because you meet somebody you are a holiday party

391
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623

00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671

At this party who is Mark Levine

So Mark Levine is my friend's father

00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
The businessman has had a successful career

00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287

00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343

And cellulite

404
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
So

405
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah we've been trying to get connected for a while

406
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Because

407
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
He had heard that I had worked in

408
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
You know where

409
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
In the internet

410
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Inside the internet

411
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
And he wanted me because he had all this stuff in a warehouse

412
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
That he was looking to you know

413
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Unload

414
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Like when you say

415
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
Stop like he would just you just import whatever

416
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Stop by the two things that he approached me about where

417
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
He was like I've got

418
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Razors

419
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
I got my 250000 razors

420
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,303
Okay

421
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
He also had

422
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
A couple thousand cake slicer

423
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Cake slicer

424
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
Yesterday no Warehouse slicers were called

425
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Piece of cake

426
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
The slicer themselves was shaped like

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
A wedge

428
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Piece of cake

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
Yeah so you know

430
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
Forget about the worry of having to slice twice

431
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
When you want a piece of cake

432
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
Now you lace to take your piece of cake

433
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
And you put it over the cage

434
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Wow and outcomes the perfect slice of Cape I need to know why we are not talking about.

435
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Cake Club

436
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
How how was that

437
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,127
How is that not the product that you said to Mark oh my God amazing the cake slicer yeah

438
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm in

439
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
I just I knew that

440
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,039
You know gluten-free was going to be the next thing and

441
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
I just wasn't going to be a market for it

442
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,255
All right so you are at this party this holiday party and he's like yeah go Warehouse of 200,000 razors and

443
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,863
Thousands of cake slicers are you in is that what he said he was like he was like

444
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
You know yeah

445
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
What do you think and I was like

446
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
Let's give him a try and we'll see what we can do

447
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
So what happens if you go home and then you call him and say okay want to go check out these razor so I knew that I wanted

448
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
To the razors because

449
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,783
I'd always bristled at the price of razors and I had always

450
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
There was a time and I remember this specifically

451
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
When I was living in New York

452
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,975
I would walk right past Duane Reade on my way from Rockefeller Center

453
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
To the subway on the F train when I go downtown

454
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,911
And I would need razors and I just wouldn't want to go into the store to buy the Rays

455
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
Because the razor Fortress is always locked

456
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:56,127
You have to find the person with the key they're always doing something else yet and you actually feel like you're inconveniencing them

457
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,783
For piano helping you get a product of the only product it's like that or one of the only products it's like that in the store

458
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
And I didn't in 2006 save this is a problem that I'm going to go soft but at that party he said

459
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,023
The razors are grade what do you want to do with them I had the idea for dollars

460
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
All right so you go and you what you go check out this Warehouse to the razors are in a warehouse in San Bernardino

461
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
Bernardino or Rancho Cucamonga which is like an hour east of

462
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
And I get out there and

463
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
There's a guy there and I'm like

464
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
Hello I'm Mark Levine

465
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
You know partner and

466
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,759
I'm here for the razors and he's like oh

467
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Jamaican inspired

468
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Yes yes I am

469
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,695
You're like great you got to go to get me $700 or these Rays I'm about to throw these razors out

470
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Tell the razors have been ever so long in the bill hasn't been paid like I'm sure that marketing

471
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,679
Rent storage space like I'm sure that he had almost forgotten about these

472
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
So I had to go get $700 sight unseen and give it to the guy

473
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
So that he didn't ride the razors and I could have asked

474
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,383
Sego nuc The Razor's Edge

475
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
And go and see the razor's I look at them and I

476
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
Mercedes look like razors that I would use

477
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
I take them home I shave with it and I knew that we

478
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Well

479
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
She get home and and you call him and you say

480
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Hey

481
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
I think I can sell these nieces great

482
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Go deck yourself out

483
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,095
More or less yeah he was like what do you want to do with them and I was like

484
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
Well I mean I want to put them online and I think that the best way to do it is to

485
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,823
Create a subscription mechanism where people don't have to go to the store to get them they come automatically and

486
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Yeah

487
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
How is it at that very moment

488
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Cuz it sounds like that's what

489
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
What you're saying

490
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
You were thinking

491
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
This is the business I'm going to do

492
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
I'm going to drop everything I'm going to focus on

493
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
What

494
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
What was it about

495
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
$50 razors a warehouse in Rancho Cucamonga

496
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
That inspired you to

497
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
The thing like that

498
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
But because I knew there was a problem

499
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
And

500
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
I think that

501
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,959
A lot of an entrepreneur's will tell you that

502
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
You know they trust their gut and I trust my guy

503
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:05,663
And my gut told me that the problem that I had observed back in 2005-2006 when I had that feeling

504
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,503
About wanting to go into the store because the razors are overpriced in the buying experience

505
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Super frustrating

506
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
If I had that feeling I knew there were other people like me that would

507
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
Have that that that were experiencing that same frustration

508
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
And I knew that there was an hour

509
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Opportunity and

510
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Like also like a lot of entrepreneurs

511
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
Once you become

512
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,192
Focus on an idea and you've identified a problem that need solving or thing you want to bring into the world

513
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,008
It's really hard to get that out of your head

514
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,336
I believe truly that there was a problem worth solving here

515
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
And I certainly didn't think that it was going to become what it has become but I knew that there was enough there to

516
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Tell you no

517
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
Make a couple bucks

518
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
And and what about the name how did you

519
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,160
Was the name also part of the idea from

520
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
Within a few days of meeting mark

521
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
I wanted the

522
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Function of the business

523
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Come through in the name

524
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
And I think if you know where to plug somebody off

525
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Street and say

526
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
What does a company called Dollar Shave Club do

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
You should probably be able to figure that when I got

528
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
So if I was

529
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
If I knew you then

530
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Right and I

531
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
I probably would have said two-and-a-half to imagine other people

532
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
People said to you

533
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
Michael you're like a 30-something dude and

534
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
You weren't try to answer one of the most

535
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Penetrable Market

536
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,208
Razors and shaving in America I mean

537
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
Gillette Schick

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,816
Did anybody in your family or anybody say to you

539
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Razors

540
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
This is like

541
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
This Market is dominated by like

542
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Two or three company

543
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
Yeah I I don't know that anybody

544
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Flight phrases

545
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,080
Like that

546
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Wisconsin

547
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480

A typical trade show is

586
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
Suicide how can we take it offline how come we let people talk to each other

587
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,200
I have some fun and we built off the buzz of the escape room trend

588
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,784
Where people are locked in a room and it was solve a series of clues in order to get

589
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
And we called it escape the office

00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
The reason we created

591
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Do we do

592
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,488
Is because relationships are at the heart of everything that we

593
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
We aim to build

594
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352

So the goal of the beta site was really to test different pricing models test different forms of

And either the first brand that we launched was not what it is today it was really just you know what we have all come to know as

Leslie at 8

And in this really comes to a head in March

666
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
The date was March

667
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
6

668
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,704
2012

669
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Your background

670
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Video India

671
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Your background Improv

672
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Magically come together

673
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Unplanned

674
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
When you release

675
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
A video what was the

676
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
Story about that video how does that come about

677
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Yeah

678
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
So

679
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
I knew that

680
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
This was a fairly simple story

681
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Razer overpriced

682
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
You're overpaying for the technology

683
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,536
And you can get a great shave from having to pay such a high price

684
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
And

685
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
I knew that if you just told that story flat

686
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
It would sound fly

687
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
So I wanted you to be a part of the brand

688
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
And I wanted to make a video

689
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Oh and I knew how to write

690
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
And I'd sort of knew how to act

691
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,384
And I called up

692
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
A friend of mine Lucia Creator director of Broad City now while but she was met her at the at the end

693

695
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
One of the shows that I was in

696
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
At one point

697
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Community can you ask for help

698
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,792

699
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560

A video advertisement that tells a story it's going to go on the homepage

701
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400

00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:27,008
You know I wrote a script will you meet me for coffee and end like giving those on the script and

703
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
And then help me film it till we met for coffee

704
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
She looked at the script

705
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
She says I really like it added a couple of jokes

706
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,736
Set the line are blades any good

707
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
No they're great

708
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,600
Used to be our blades any good no

709
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,696
And then some other bad joke and she gave me that line so I should know that

710
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,976
After that to Luchia

711
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,816
And we rented out the warehouse that we were fulfilling packages in out for the day

Through this warehouse and we meet

717
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
Toddler shaving the head of a grown man

718
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
We see a bear of a nano SIM

719
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
One in the bear costume

720
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
You've got one of your

728
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
On March 6 2012

729
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,240
Was there a reason why you pick that date or that time of year

730
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
To release the video

731
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:38,688
So we were ready to launch we just raised about a million dollars in in in venture capital

732
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736

To our first investor was a company called science around Santa Monica they gave us $100,000 check

734
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
Tyceno they gave us $100 check

735
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
By accident

736
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
And I got all the way to the bank

737
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,584
I literally I got to the bank and I was like yours my check for a hundred as I ask you to fill out the

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
The form that said

739
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
$100,000

740
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,704
I fill it out and the woman looks at me and she's like

741
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,616
But who were the Amin I have to assume they were some invest

742
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Stars are made

743
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
This idea and said

744
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm not going to get in

745
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Into the razor

746
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Honey

747
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
So what was the pitch that convinced those who

748
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Agreed

749
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,928
To our road you know we said yeah she see money

750
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Before You released

751
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
So that was

752
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
How you

753
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
We're able to convince those initial investors

754
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Yep they were like

755
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Well you want to do this

756
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Spending a day with a person

757
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,192
All that stuff about you can do it

758
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
And I said they're like how you going to do it

759
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,384
I'm going to build a brand-new like yeah but what do you mean I was like twelve and I try to explain as I do know what

760
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Just watch this

761
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Usage

762
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Just watch this video

763
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,272
Instantly many of them last I was funny and throws

764
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,368
Creative and I believe in you

765
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
All right

766
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
So you erase

767
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Receive money

768
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
March 6th

769
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
2012

770
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Why was that date or that time of year

771
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Significant

772
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
Side spend time in the media

773
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
I knew how the media

774
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Would think about

775
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
Using a video like this

776
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
To tell the story of our fun

777
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,640
And so I wanted to make sure that we announced our funding at the same day that we launched the video

778
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,944
We also chose that day because

779
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
There's a nice low

780
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Right before South by Southwest

781
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,112
People get really excited right before South by Southwest at least it did then

782
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
Do they look for a big

783
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Text story

784
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,560
They hope something's going to break the way Twitter did in 2006 or whatever when you know and that was when Twitter kind of had a big moment

785
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Was at South by

786
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
And it became a thing so there's a lot of answers

787
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
Dissipation in the air and people are looking for

788
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,288
Something exciting attack space so

789
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
I wanted to do it before the festival before that got nose you thought

790
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,176
There's not a whole lot of noise out there right now

791
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
Now and then maybe this will get some traction if I do it

792
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
In this window

793
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
Yes exactly

794
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
So you guys put out the

795
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880

799
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Light the Night

800
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Before and in

801
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
How do you get

802
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
All to know about

803
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Click on the weather journalist at you

804
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
Targeted therapy

805
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,800
People that you went after we had done around a press

806
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
You know to Nassar million-dollar

807
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
C-Tran

808
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
And we talked about all The Usual Suspects

809
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
Techcrunch's of the world the Bloomberg's

810
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Etc and

811
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,088
All the stories went live at the same time

812
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
And first the techie goes to

813
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
System pic

814
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Annies video which

815
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,560
People found funny and engaging and also that it was promoting a real business

816
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
Was turn of the unique combination for people

817
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah I don't think there were too many examples at that

818
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Time of

819
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
Direct-to-consumer business

820
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
That launched

821
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
With a video

822
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
That was funny

823
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
And good

824
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
And I think it's at

825
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
Tech Community

826
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Surface it

827
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
And then from there it

828
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
It sort of caught while

829
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
And what happened

830
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
That day the sick

831
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
I mean were you

832
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
Surprise for you

833
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
A lot of people

834
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Watch that video

835
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,536
Yeah I

836
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
You never build anything like that and think it's going to go viral anybody that tells you that they can build you a viral video or

837
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Don't don't believe them

838
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
I did not have

839
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Huge hopes

840
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
For this video

841
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
I just thought that this was a really compelling way to tell the story of what are busy

842
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
This was

843
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
And we launched

844
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,760
And I woke up at my normal time is 6:30

845
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
On March 6th

846
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
And I looked at the site

847
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Insight wasn't there

848
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
And I was like

849
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Oh my God what

850
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
What's wrong why is the site

851
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
Then I saw some text messages

852
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Anderson my friends that were up on the East Coast earlier they were like

853
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
You know

854
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Dude amazing video like

855
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,568
Put the site that I can order my razors and you're sitting there and I'm literally in bed and every on

856
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
Entrepreneurs Had A Moment Like This or a hundred moments like this

857
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
They look at their phone first thing in the morning and they're like

858
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Oh

859
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Whatever

860
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,576
And that was one of them so decided crashed

861
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
I had to go figure out how to get the side back up

862
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Online

863
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
Eventually we did and then we sold out

864
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,536
And Vine

865
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,864
You cleared that warehouse

866
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Yeah we had some other reason other razors as well we had we had some twin razor the first Racers worth

867
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,384
Then we had some for Blaze and we had some 6 by so and so

868
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
They sell out and

869
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
You know you're now you're like

870
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
What do I do

871
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
What do I do in this moment do I get no pull down the clothes shade and say sorry like we'll be back in

872
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
A couple months what must we can make more razors or do we keep selling put up a note that says hey you know

873
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
We're going to sell these razors to you

874
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:48,704
Eventually eventually will send you these razors

875
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,104
And people thankfully you know we're okay with that mean some people

876
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
Is the lady in the razors but

877
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
You know Dave they hung around because

878
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,736
Because the proposition was resume

879
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,088
And we actually had tapped into something we'd solve the problem

880
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
That many many people

881
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Hat

882
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,744
And we did it in a way that resonated with them and they wanted to

883
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Give us a chance at this point

884
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
Dollar Shave Club

885
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Still you and

886
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Anyone else

887
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
At that point it was so

888
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
Soap science was our first investor

889
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
We had

890
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
I was the only full-time in

891
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Employee

892
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
But science had a studio of

893
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
Folk dancing designers

894
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
Dinner is a tech team that will third-party techshop that did all of our engineering

895
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,832
But I was the only full-time employee

896
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,136
And where were you sourcing your razors

897
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
Manufacturer in South Korea

898
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
You see these bags right

899
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
For Gillette or whatever

900
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Razor it is and I

901
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
They talk about the sink

902
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Technology as if it's like

903
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
You know something that NASA invented

904
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
If Gillette was selling

905
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
You know a 4-pack of Razor

906
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Let's say 4

907
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
Four or five

908
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
Times the cost that you were offer

909
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Which was a Dollar Plus

910
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
$2 for shipping and handle

911
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
I have to assume that

912
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
You were this is a last leader

913
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
That you were not going to make money off this for awhile

914
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
On that twin razor

915
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
On the other ones yet

916
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
And so

917
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,864
Explain why I mean we've talked to the guys who founded Warby Parker and they explain why

918
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Frames

919
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
We're so excited

920
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
It was essentially Monopoly

921
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
And they said there's no reason why

922
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Is it wasn't

923
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Same with razors like why

924
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Why were razors

925
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Could buy it at a pharmacy

926
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
So much more expensive than the ones you were selling

927
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Right well you know you think about

928
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,112
It's a very small community there not that many people in the world that make gravy

929
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
And you think about the science involved for such an old-school sort of

930
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:51,584
Product has been around for a long period of time there's an extraordinary amount of science

931
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
Stickers into

932
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Taking

933
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
You know raw metal

934
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Then finding it out

935
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Then

936
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Creating a blade Edge

937
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
Then then coating a blade Edge

938
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
You know that can actually slice

939
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Hair after

940
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
And not skin off

941
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
There's a lot that goes into it

942
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
You can do it

943
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
People do it and so

944
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
But it's hard

945
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
And that's why there's not that many people that do it

946
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,160
How are you fulfilling those those orders in that after the video came out

947
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
What's it like you and I

948
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Do people like

949
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Packaging them up and

950
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah we had printers wait a couple printers hanging around the office and we know we were

951
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,168
Reading labels and you know it's so frustrating cuz you had thousands and thousands

952
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
The borders and its label printers like

953
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,896
So like the only answer is get more labor

954
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Cell

955
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,040
Label printers and you know where we're fill out these roles of labels

956
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
And then we put them in these big trash bags

957
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:51,232
And we drive them down to the warehouse where we shot the video and there was doing our fulfillment center this is not an e-commerce

958
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
This is a place that like

959
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
On Monday they're feeling like

960
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Windshield washer pellets in this

961
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
YouTube

962
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,776
On Tuesday they're putting vodka bottles in crates and on Wednesday they're filling order for Dollar Shave Club

963
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
And like

964
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,104
But if we have to go over there take the big bag of

965
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Of labels

966
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,920
A big trash bag throw them over the fence

967
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
And hope that in the middle of the night nobody comes by and steals the big bag of

968
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
Which would be crazy if they did that but

969
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
But that's yeah that was how the operation work

970
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
So after

971
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
So I mean after you kind of

972
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,376
Be right broke through an end and start to get attention and start to get

973
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Scribers

974
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
Did it become pretty easy for you to raise

975
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Money at that point

976
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,568
Raising money has never been easy

977
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
For us and I think four

978
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Unless you are

979
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
Snapchat Circa 2000 whatever

980
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:49,088
You know it's hard to raise money for any kind of company and end for all the reasons that you pointed out in the beginning

981
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
You know what

982
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
How do you think that you

983
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
Are going to have you know

984
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,744
Take on these Giants that have been doing this for

985
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,328
You know over 50 years and and are they going to squash you aren't they going to copy

986
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,400
It was never easy for us yes there was always

987
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
You can always raise some money for

988
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:09,312
I'm some portion of the people that you want to raise money from the smart money so to speak the smart money asks

989
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
The smart question

990
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
And they asked all the

991
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
She said that they should

992
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
And it was never easy

993
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
Steven you know into our series d

994
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Yeah once you start to gain traction obviously

995
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,648
The competitors came in Harry's Razors for example

996
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Do they make you nervous when when

997
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
You start to see other

998
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
People who are also using the subscription model

999
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Yeah I mean I think

1000
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
Of course anytime that you create something

1001
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
And

1002
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
You put it out there

1003
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,312
And it's naive to think that people aren't going to copy your

1004
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,896
Great idea and I think that for your first reaction is to be like

1005
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
But

1006
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:52,832
I think what you learned over time is that the presence of competition pushes you to Define yourself

1007
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
More specifically

1008
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,184
And focuses you on the things that you want to do

1009
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
And

1010
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
You know

1011
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,536
Definitely makes you work a little bit harder so that you know

1012
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:06,912
Most people when they first start a company and then they experience competition don't think that's a good thing

1013
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
I think it's a wonderful

1014
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
We've benefited from that in some ways

1015
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
It's been validating in so many ways to

1016
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,640
Did you have to do a whole lot of advertising over those viral videos cuz

1017
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
Chris Moore

1018
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,224
Was that really driving

1019
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
The customers was that bringing in Newcastle

1020
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Yessir the virality wear off

1021
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,184
For sure and then it was you no jump into the paid marketing game

1022
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
End

1023
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
Yeah we we shot our first

1024
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
Television commercials

1025
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
I believe in mm

1026
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:41,472
13 we did another video for our one wipe Charlies which is are butt wipes for men

1027
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Weight for men

1028
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Do you want to talk about that

1029
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
Well I mean sure

1030
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,200
What is 2013 to diversify

1031
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,808
Satisfyer first expansion was one wipe Charlies it's a butt wipe for men

1032
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
It's a moist towelette that you use

1033
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Some people like to

1034
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,696
Not before they sweep some people liked

1035
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
Sweep before they mop

1036
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
It's a better way to do it

1037
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
And

1038
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
You know anybody

1039
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,240
Unless you're very flexible you know you're not spending any time back there

1040
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,312
But other people that that care about you might

1041
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,688
Might be

1042
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:29,600
And so that might be a that might be a service that you provide not for yourself but for your loved one

1043
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
A couple of things happened

1044
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
To you guys at that are knots

1045
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Surprising because it happens to

1046
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Successful startups

1047
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
The first is

1048
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
The big players

1049
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Godzilla game

1050
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
Description game the chillaxing and the other companies

1051
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
They are

1052
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,247
Much bigger that time certainly

1053
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Or much much bigger

1054
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
In terms of the

1055
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
The capital they have a

1056
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
The cash the marketing dollars they had

1057
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,463
Was there ever a concern when they got into the

1058
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Into that game that

1059
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,023
They could actually

1060
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Crush you

1061
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Any smart on

1062
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Entrepreneur

1063
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Smart CEO business

1064
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
In person

1065
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
Should absolutely be afraid of

1066
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,407
When something like that happens and you should be doing the chess on on how to make that not have

1067
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,223
So yes of course when any competitor

1068
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,271
Launches and many have

1069
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
You have to

1070
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
To think how are we going to be different how are we going to send this off

1071
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
If you don't take competitive threats

1072
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Seriously

1073
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
That's foolish so we absolutely took

1074
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Of course is that Gillette

1075
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
Suju for patent infringement

1076
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:48,447
I'm as your view began to take away market share from Gillette

1077
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
It's still pending but

1078
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
Did that lawsuit freak you out when that happened

1079
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,151
Well yes or no I mean you know it was the first time

1080
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,943
I think that we have gotten sued

1081
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
And

1082
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
You know your first

1083
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,039
First time he get sued your like

1084
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
What do you would how do you react to something

1085
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
But I think it's at a certain point you

1086
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
People have been telling us along the way to expect

1087
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Because that's a Playbook

1088
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
That big competitors big incumbent

1089
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Competitors can do

1090
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
Make you look unattractive

1091
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Give two

1092
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,471
How to make you look on a tractor

1093
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
If two potential

1094
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Acquirers

1095
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
And show

1096
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,895
For me you know like look you take everything very seriously as a CEO

1097
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
But

1098
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
You also say that

1099
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
There was a business

1100
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,063
Calculation to and also that made a lot of sense

1101
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
From there

1102
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
So

1103
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
You put it all together

1104
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
410 and rationalize it

1105
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
So you guys

1106
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
I think a certain

1107
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
What movie was 20

1108
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
15 by 20

1109
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
15 or 26

1110
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
16

1111
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
You get about 3 million subscribers

1112
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Remember what percentage of this

1113
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Subscription Market

1114
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
You guys have that point

1115
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Of the

1116
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,567
Online razor subscription Market

1117
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
I mean most most

1118
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
I don't know the exact Market

1119
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
The chair numbers off the top of my head

1120
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,759
But I think that

1121
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
You know as of now there's about

1122
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
22 25% of

1123
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Of the men's

1124
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
Non-disposable razor Market

1125
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
That we have

1126
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Do you remember when he became prophet

1127
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
No comment

1128
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:26,495
We run by a very big company and we're not allowed to disclose your financial information right

1129
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
2016

1130
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Dollar Shave Club was it

1131
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
Acquired by Unilever

1132
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Reportedly for a billion dollars

1133
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Okay

1134
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,343
I mean it's a mind-boggling astounding amount of money

1135
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
Were you looking to sell or did they come to you how did that happen

1136
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,511
TriMet I met one of their Executives at a dinner in New York

1137
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
And

1138
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
We just started talking about where I wanted to take

1139
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
The company

1140
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,911
And he was telling me about some of the things that

1141
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Unilever was working on

1142
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
And

1143
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
That Men's Grooming was

1144
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Priority for them

1145
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Strategically

1146
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,407
And the conversation really just started out as a hey how is there a way that we can

1147
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Potentially help each other

1148
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
And the conversation you know

1149
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Took another step and then another

1150
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Then we ended up

1151
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
Property acquisition I know that there was a lot that

1152
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Proceeded

1153
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
You know

1154
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,487
The founding of the company and there's let the wind into it and a lot of

1155
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Stress

1156
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
And hard work but

1157
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
You just put into perspective

1158
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
5 year. From the time you found it

1159
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
The time Unilever bought it

1160
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
I mean

1161
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
What do you think about that

1162
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
Are you astounded at that are you I mean do you just think

1163
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
5 years

1164
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
And this is what

1165
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,223
What we built it is pretty mind blowing

1166
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
It is mind-boggling

1167
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,367
It was a huge moment in the companies

1168
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Life

1169
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
And history

1170
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,719
And certainly a huge moment in my life

1171
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Incurrir No Doubt

1172
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
But I knew that all the hard work

1173
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Was really yet

1174
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
The acquisition in and of itself

1175
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,703
Is a nice moment and an acknowledgement of the progress that we made

1176
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
But there was still so much

1177
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
To do

1178
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,103
That you know I didn't spend a lot of time sitting around being like

1179
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Let you know

1180
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,943
Popping a lot of champagne glass because there's just

1181
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,783
It's just used to run the company or the CEO correct you work for Unilever

1182
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,183
My Paychex

1183
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Is it yes my boss is Unilever

1184
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
How

1185
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
How does I understand that

1186
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,191
You and and you'll ever really wanted you to stay at the helm because

1187
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,031
It was your vision and your imprimatur has on it

1188
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,151
Plenty of stories I mean Instagram is an example where you know the founders eventually left

1189
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
But had a lot of autonomy for a long

1190
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
On time

1191
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
Has it

1192
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
Let you know what when a big company like Unilever

1193
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Comes in as a

1194
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
The parent company

1195
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,159
In your experience has it changed

1196
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
A lot

1197
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
At Dollar Shave Club do you feel like it

1198
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
The same exact place

1199
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,351
No it's not the same exact place but not because of the actress

1200
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
Yeah we've gone through an enormous transformation

1201
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Company over the last

1202
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Last two years

1203
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
That we have had to

1204
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Change the way that our entire Tech

1205
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Technology stack is built

1206
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
It the way that the consumer interacts with it

1207
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,967
Packages that were selling people we went from

1208
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,295
Selling razors once a month to selling everything that you need

1209
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
A couple times a year

1210
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,159
And and that's working out really well but just to get

1211
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
To that point

1212
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Required

1213
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Transformation in advertising

1214
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
And frankly transformation of

1215
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,143
A Personnel I don't know the number off the top of my head but something like

1216
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
You know

1217
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
80% of

1218
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Avari

1219
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
300 employees

1220
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Are new

1221
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,079
That within the last 18 months

1222
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
And that's what you have to do to you know

1223
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,455
We had a great First Act and now we want to have a great second act

1224
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
And so

1225
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,807
It did the company is is actually quite different than it was

1226
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
And that's the way that it should be

1227
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,487
All the people here tonight who might be in your position in mm

1228
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,535
Tanner 2011 he might be starting

1229
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Something up for

1230
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,679
If you were in this audience then and you're watching somebody like you what do you wish

1231
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
You knew then that you know now that

1232
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Would have been helpful

1233
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,431
I think there's a lot of times when uses the starting a company and you're faced with

1234
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Certain death

1235
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
Or near death

1236
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
You have a near-death experience which will happen a lot

1237
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,903
It's never as bad as you think it's also not as

1238
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
As you hope it will be either

1239
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
End

1240
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,839
You know yes there are sometimes when the worst possible outcome happens

1241
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
But it's really rare

1242
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
And that you go through enough

1243
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
Start of crises

1244
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
And near-death experiences

1245
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
When you come out on the other side

1246
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,359
And you kind of like in your mind you said yourself

1247
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,479
Okay I know what it's like to be chill on the other side of the crisis

1248
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
I'm just going to put myself there

1249
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
And know that like

1250
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
8 out of 10 times

1251
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:03,743
It'll be true and 2 out of 10 times it's not and it helps you I think get a little bit less scared because

1252
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,023
Starting a business

1253
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Is is

1254
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Scary

1255
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
Michael is a question that

1256
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
I asked everybody come to the show and

1257
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
And if you've heard the show you've heard me ask a question on curious

1258
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
Premier Pineview how much of what happened to you

1259
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,895
Do you think is because of like and how much do you think is because of

1260
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,711
Your hard work and your intelligence and

1261
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Your skill

1262
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,039
I think that anybody that so

1263
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Successful in

1264
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
This has benefited

1265
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
And

1266
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,671
Anybody that tells you that

1267
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
They haven't

1268
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Or don't

1269
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Is not being true

1270
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
Luck plays a role in everything

1271
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,143
Thing and I think that you continue to get lucky

1272
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
Throughout your career

1273
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
End end

1274
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Throughout our visit

1275
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,543
Yeah we've gotten lucky in many ways

1276
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
Some sometimes

1277
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Good luck

1278
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
What is a manifestation of hard work

1279
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,991
And sometimes luck is just luck

1280
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
I like to think that

1281
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
A lot of other people
