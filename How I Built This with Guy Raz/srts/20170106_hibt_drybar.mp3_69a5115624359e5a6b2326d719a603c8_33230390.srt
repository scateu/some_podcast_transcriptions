That first day was bananas I mean women were like lining up women were pissed because

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
They were coming and every like it said use a walk-in I'm like

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Blow out to the first chair and I was running the front desk and I was I was I was there around the clock probably for six months before I took

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,056
The day off because I just couldn't leave it and it was so fun

13

16
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Dry salons

17
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Call Drybar

18
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
When I was a kid growing up

19
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
In Boca Raton

20
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Southern Florida

21
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
School Bus

22
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Really her thing

23
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
No intentions goal wasn't very good at it

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,720
I was kind of dubbed the underachiever of the family I was like what the hell is Allie going to do with her life

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
She eventually went

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Collagen

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Everybody year

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Dropped out

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
Set adrift

30
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
She lived in New York for some time and then she

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Back to Florida and live with their parents

32
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
But her older brother Michael

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
I seem to have it all together

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
He was like the overachiever of the family and he was like naturally good

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Student Lake

36
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,552
Graduation he had a bar mitzvah while I was like there's no way I'm going to

37
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,904
But he did it and he was right he wasn't even like the smarty-pants of the family

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,488
So well Ali was sort of floating around in her early 20s

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
Michael was doing pretty well for himself he was moving up the corporate ladder

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
And in the mid-1990s

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
Started to have this idea of what

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
She wanted

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
What to do with her life

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
TS Michael

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Or vice he was the first person I talked about and I said you know I feel like I really want to go to beauty school that is

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
I really want to do and my parents were kind of like

47
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
They didn't get it and they have these little old lady clothing stores in Delray Beach

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Boca

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Next to every one of them with a hair salon

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,464
And everything's like little old ladies getting their hair done are like

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,792
That's what you want to do I know that is not what I want to do

52
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
New York City

53
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,424
Shows and I want to do a tutorial and you know what I had like gran

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Dreams of what I would do in the Heritage way my brother

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
We had always been very very close to my parents were sitting here they would tell you that

56
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Itchy raised

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Keep your very very very close

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
He was

59
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
Really one of the few people who really believed in this little dream

60
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
That I had

61
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
So is it was living in Boca

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
And I enrolled in the local Beauty School

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
And I love

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Every second

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
From the moment I enrolled I was like

66
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,376
These are my people I thought I loved and I loved the environment I'm so happy

67
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,704
And I soaked it all up and while I was in Beauty School I was working for

68
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
A guy who owned a local salon

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,336
And he was amazing and he taught me so much and again

70
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
I wouldn't have known it at the time but

71
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
Because he own this line I really saw how he

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Managed

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
With an education I was getting married

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Even know I was getting in

75
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
For your Emmy at that point your your ambition in life was to

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
What's working at Salon

77
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
What to do hair

78
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Although

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Which to get back to me

80
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
I was also a huge fan of John suhag who's

81
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
Sadly not alive anymore but he was like the Pioneer dry cutting wood

82
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
I'm not sure if I'm assuming like instead of cutting wet hair you you can cut it when it's dry

83
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
John

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
And he was like

85
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Sweet like what

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,808
Like what made him hit like Moses he had one Salon in New York on Madison Avenue

87
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Rock and roll kind of

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Cool guy

89
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Greyhound that likes at NEX

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Find it I had it in my head. The only person I wanted to work for her so I moved to New York

91
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
And I remember like it was yesterday

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
Done interview and I walked in with my leather pants on inside tried to escape

93
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,359
And I remember him like looking at me and making eye contact and I was like I know I'm going to get this job

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
He was like an assistant job it wasn't like the world's greatest

95
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,319
At the salon and I was assisting him a little bit I was assisting the other stylist in the shop which meant

96
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
I was the person watching and blowing the hair

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,023
And it was a great education I was still very very new in Industry even though I had my license and was on the floor

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
And I've learned a very different ball game in New York

99
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
So I mean I used to do all of John's clients

100
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Girlfriend

101
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
And it was like the best

102
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Training

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,847
You could ever imagine that sound sounds like you had a great time

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
You will laugh you'd like dropped out of of like

105
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Hair

106
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
And you went to become a publicist

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Is that right

108
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Well not even I became like an assistant to the guy who's running the music department at Rogers & Cowan like one of the big ones in New York

109
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Represent everybody

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
A pretty awesome job me he represented Paul McCartney

111
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Janet Jackson Jennifer Lopez

112
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
So now I'm like

113
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
I don't know 2526 and then I started to get

114
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Auntie again but that was like

115
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
To find my husband

116
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Get married

117
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Bug and

119
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,407
During this time I did meet my husband and

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,783
At a bar named Hell in the Meatpacking District in hell you better than hell says we are a match made in hell

121
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
I like a dive bar in them

122
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Meatpacking District that

123
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Obviously

124
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Seymour today

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
I guess you met this guy

126
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
What was he doing at the time

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
He was in advertising

128
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,679
So we started dating and every. Very it was like love at first sight and it really weird together like everyday since

129
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
Practically moved in with each other like right away

130
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
So we

131
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
We were we got married we got engaged a year after we met and then we got married

132
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
2 years after MSN

133
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
I I think I was out here but having grown up in South Florida the winters in the yard were starting

134
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
I got to get out of here

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
And Zoe

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
Decided to move to LA and he

137
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,415
For him and advertising it's like he needs to

138
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Being a big city so

139
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,767
So you decided to move to LA just cuz you wanted a change of scene

140
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
He thought

141
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
And you figure it out for yourself

142
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Well that's when I was like really

143
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
A year we got pregnant and

144
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
My First Son Grant was born in 2000

145
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
+ 5

146
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
And I was like

147
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,711
As happy as can be and I thought I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom forever I loved every

148
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Second of it

149
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
So great

150
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
And then we had her second son in

151
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Ninja kids

152
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Yeah

153
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Yasso

154
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
It was like you got a lot of hard surface is to

155
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
And after being at home with a stay-at-home mom for 5 years

156
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
I got really antsy again

157
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
The bike

158
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Can go to the park every day I remember my husband music

159
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Home from work and I'd be like

160
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Kids all that and I felt like

161
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
Man I need to do something for myself again and that's that's that's what initially started and then I was like what am I going to do I'm going to go back to work

162
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Hair salon

163
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
I have two kids now what I want to do and

164
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
And because

165
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Blowouts and doing hair was always my thing is my girlfriend

166
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
But ask me to go out there all the time

167
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,583
Good hair and so they would always ask me

168
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,471
No no I was just do it was especially if it was like for a party or an event or while you're something I just did everybody's hair

169
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
And I was good at it and so I remember that I

170
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Sitting in my living room my best friend that are like babies crawling around and

171
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455

173
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Blowout like

175
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
My mommy friend

But I was very Emerson like

177
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
The mommy community

178
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415

179
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
So I posted on

180
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
This mommy

181
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Group called

182
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Headwear

183
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
It was like a Yahoo group

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
It was this resource for Mom

185
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
There's like 5000

186
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Moms in LA

187
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
And they all went to the site

188
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
So I posted on there one day when I have this idea popped in my head I said I'm I'm a longtime stylist I'm thinking about starting a mobile

189
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Would anybody

190
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Out there Beyond

191
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,295
I got flooded with you like yes I'm interested

192
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Set for blow dry

193
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
Pretty much so I started getting emails so then my husband was like any of this is such a great idea

194
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
And he said but

195
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
You need to keep website if they think

196
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
But at this point you're thinking

197
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
It's going to be like my side Hustle

198
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
What do you think about getting a van

199
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
No no I was like I thought about putting all them

200
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,871
To the head in a duffel bag and heading out the door that with that car

201
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
In my car

202
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
And so you would blow dry

203
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
At their humps

204
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,623
I like while your baby sleeping because like we are all like when our baby is napping with you until we can do any

205
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
I'll come to your house and blow dry hair

206
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
I mean this is not a very liked

207
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Thought-out plan that was

208
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
So basic

209
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,399
And honestly we came up with $40 because it was like cheap and easy as I 220

210
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,519
Done like you put this out there on the website and all of a sudden

211
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Yep

212
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
We want this

213
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Calendar

214
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,967
Yeah they started doing this but and of course like I said to pick up my kids from preschool at like

215
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
2:00 or whatever way

216
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
But I really wasn't about the money it was much more about

217
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,791
Getting out there in like talking to Dothan just like doing something for myself and being able to kind of

218
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
You know satisfy that

219
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Desire in me

220
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Need to do something for myself again so you start

221
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Doing this you start driving around

222
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
The westside of LA and I got really busy really fast

223
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,151
And it was very word-of-mouth like I'd go and do one mom and then she would tell like six of her friends

224
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
It was such a thrill

225
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
And I got to the point where I was saying

226
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
No

227
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
More than I was saying

228
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
And so that's what I like

229
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,439
You know this is interesting and I think that's been I started asking my clients

230
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
I said what what do you do when I can

231
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Well

232
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:14,143
Either like begrudgingly go to my cut and color Salon where they overcharged me and want to cut my hair and there's all this pressure

233
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Or I go to the bike

234
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Discount chain down the street

235
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Kind of toxin

236
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Experience is bad in bad lighting and

237
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Has like

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
There really is too bad choices are there and that's it

239
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
And so that's when I think the idea started

240
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Percolating for me and

241
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
I was like huh

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
You know there's no place like in the middle and that's when I went to my brother

243
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
And he was working for Yahoo

244
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
I'm also on Yahoo is

245
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
In like

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
He's like the thing

247
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Really successful end

248
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
He's watching my little business from the sidelines and he

249
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Interesting idea but

250
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Nothing beyond that

251
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
So I told him that I thought I should turn

252
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,359
My little mobile blood drive business into an actual brick-and-mortar so instead of me going to my clients they can start coming

253
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
I asked him to have basically help me and help me

254
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
Did it at any point

255
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Any anyone

256
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Tickly a thing man say to you

257
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
Wait you want to start a store

258
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
Blow dry hair and

259
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
What was like why would anybody pay

260
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887

261
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679

What

263
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,103
Although my husband always had this interstate inside because he knows what my hair looks like naturally and he always would say

264
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
You get your nails done but I never notice it when you get your hair done I notice it and so he was like I think this is the neck

265
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,623
Nail salon I think this is going to kill it let's do this

266

It's how I built this from

310
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
NPR

311
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Gyros

So Alli Webb

313
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
How does idea for a business where you just

314
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
Blow dry people's hair no cutting no coloring

315
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Just blow dry

316
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
Brother Michael and her husband

317
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
The Cameron

318
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
They were on board

319
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
So to start the company they cashed out Cameron's retirement account and Michael put in a chunk of money he made during the.

320
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
Icom Boom at Yahoo

321
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
And the three of them they tried to get to work trying to figure out the details of what tribe are would be while at the same time

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
I'm still holding their day jobs

323
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
That's when they were like the Moonlighting phase when I was so ready my mobile businesses near my kids my brother had a real estate marketing

324
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
And Cameron was a creative director in advertising agency which is like

325
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,879
You already been working crazy hours so

326
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
What would happen if

327
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Every night Wednesday

328
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
The kids were asleep

329
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,583
My brother was at his house Cameron was home we all be like on our laptops in bed and

330
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,471
We be working and drive aren't the Cameron at night started developing The Drybar website and building out the website

331
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,079
How do you really knew that you never built the website but he was the designer so he could do all of that

332
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
So

333
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
In the wee hours of the night for weeks we started developing the website and Michael and I started looking at real estate and trying to figure out where this

334
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
Shoppers going to go and talking to landlords and all the side crazy stuff and I was on the phone with the cosmetology board like around the clock

335
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Trying to figure out

336
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,047
What I needed to open these this job in and then how it all started

337
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
What are you nervous

338
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Did you feel like it

339
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
This will be okay or was like

340
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Part of youku

341
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,775
Like this is a lot of money that we put into this

342
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,615
They were more nervous than me my brother should probably the most nervous cuz he had the biggest

343
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Faking it financially

344
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
But I had a really good feeling

345
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
A it was like one of those things in my God I was like I know there's enough women out there like me that's when we'll make one job

346
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647

And there's a couple status

359
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
It's at work for us who remember this like ice have sizes

360
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Come to my house and go out my hair

361
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
That was there

362
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Are you know I would make sure they were nice

363
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,631
And then they did a good job

364
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
And I only hired like

365
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
I don't know about 15

366
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Stylist and I wasn't

367
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
Sure when things I wasn't sure about is if

368
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
There was enough Silas out there like me that

369
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
That was interested in

370
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Jeff the sailing part like I was

371
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
What was it that was going to be your like

372
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
Competitive Advantage like what was there is no competition

373
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,487
It was snowing

374
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,839
Nobody thought of it there was nothing but you owe you found a spot and where did you

375
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Open the 1st

376
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Location

377
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
So I was living in Santa Monica and

378
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
The first location was on

379
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
San Vicente

380
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Which is a thoroughfare so

381
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
If you came off the 405

382
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
You were going to Santa Monica

383
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
The Palisades

384
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
Had to take that that route

385
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
And also I should tell you that my brother having worked on other big projects

386
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
He met this guy

387
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Signing Josh heitler who's an architect

388
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
And so my brother

389
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
One of the many many thing

390
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
Can see price today but when I had this idea to have a

391
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,327
He went to Josh and I do want to build a hair salon for my sister and Josh

392
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
I was like

393
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Sure and

394
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
Baton we offered him some Equity to get involved in

395
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
That was again I don't even know if I would have thought of an architect

396
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,055
Hanging out with my brother

397
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
What was your vision like what was

398
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
When he came to talk to you what did you

399
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
You say like how did you want it to look

400
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
Well and you wanted it to feel like a bar

401
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
And

402
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
I remember

403
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Explaining to my brother

404
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
And to Josh

405
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
That

406
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
If

407
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,279
That's something that happened in my mobile blow dry business that when I would go to my client's homes and do their blowout there's usually like in their living room

408
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
I was never

409
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
In their personal bathroom in their home so I do it in her living room

410
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
Vacancy

411
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,727
Blowout when it was happening and when I was done with a blowout

412
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,311
Are they okay I'm now I'm ready for you to look beautiful get it

413
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,711
And so to go from not seeing your hair to see this amazing gorgeous hair was like kind of a powerful thing in ice

414
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
Play Nazi Josh into my going and so that was kind of a task for Josh like how do we incorporate

415
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,671
Great. Into the design of the shop

416
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
The Wii

417
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
The mirrors are behind the stations and that's very intentional that when you're the client is done stylist

418
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Center around

419
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
I totally game for my

420
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
My love is this

421
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
So

422
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,359
Daddy was at the experience was going to be different

423
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Everything that I had accumulated in

424
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
In all of my years is being a stylist and saying like I'm just going to do it the way I want to do it not the way

425
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
It's always been done

426
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
Of course it was like a bar and I wanted

427
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Ittefaq screen TV

428
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
I thought that would be like

429
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
A fun getaway for women in leg

430
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Polygon chick's legs

431
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
All chick flick movies that you probably wouldn't watch a movie you see them and they have subtitles you get really John in I mean I said

432
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Sometimes it on Mike

433
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
I love this

434
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Sleepless in Seattle

435
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
All of it and Michael my brother had the idea to

436
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
Charging stations for your iPhone that everybody's like

437
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
We got so lucky the fact that

438
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
My brother and

439
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
My husband and Josh

440
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
And me

441
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Big storm of all these people that

442
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Came together

443
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
To do that send that had

444
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
The perfect skill set

445
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
We were this like power has it nobody had to pay anybody to do

446
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Artsy open

447
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
The first location in Brentwood in

448
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
In 2010

449
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
And what's

450
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
What happens if you

451
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,711
So I don't know if you remember dailycandy thing about

452
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
About fashion right

453
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Yeah well it back and it's like

454
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
Original state dailycandy was

455
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Dislike

456
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Websider

457
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
And you get emails from them and they would be these like

458
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
Places you've never heard of nude break like business

459
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Crazy Cathy like nuggets

460
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Of information that nobody knew

461
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
And we got dailycandy to write a story

462
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
About dry bar comedy

463
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
That was ceramic

464
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Three or four days

465
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
Before we opened remember sitting at lunch with my brother

466
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Are blackberries

467
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Before iPhones and

468
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
And we used to get

469
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Appointment

470
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,551
Alexander City unless your phones are going crazy and all these appointments are became like

471
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
We fought like they can

472
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,159
We've had that like the system was broken really what is going on

473
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
And then someone

474
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Centos the Daily candy somewhere like

475
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Oh my God it's

476
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Candyman say and so

477
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Everybody started booking appointment

478
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Before we leave

479
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Open

480
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,959
And so that very first day we open to a very very. And so

481
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
That first day was

482
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Banana

483
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
SME women were like lining up with

484
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
Past because they were coming and they were like it said you could walk in and I'm like

485
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,711
We don't have anywhere chairs and I was I was doing

486
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,343
Blow out to the first chair and I was running the front desk and I was I was I was there around the clock probably first

487
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Before I took a day off

488
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
So you guys were incredibly busy like right from the beginning so so were you making a profit in that first year

489
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,751
Well even within that first year we turned

490
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Everything back in

491
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
So not really

492
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
You know me we were buried

493
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,431
Putting anybody for ourselves and it within six months we opened our second store

494
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
And it just kept going away that how did you scale it up

495
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Obviously

496
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
How did you begin the process of scaling up when you

497
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Have a whole lotta cash

498
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,488
Well that was that was a challenge and that's where it's like thank God for Michael

499
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
To cam and I would like to create a zoom we're like

500
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
What now you know we really didn't know it

501
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Books for business

502
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
We all knew we had something on her hand and we used

503
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
I said women coming in being like

504
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:38,176
Can you get these Beverly Hills women their own chop it was like we were the cool Club you couldn't get into but that's not very cool

505
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,344
And did your husband at this point leave his job he couldn't leave cuz I wasn't taking a salary I was like you still needed his

506
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
His salary so he was but he was still doing a lot of work

507
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Flashlight app for husband

508
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
He was basically working to

509
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Full-time job

510
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
It was crazy

511
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Such like a life

512
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Slap and it was

513
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
You know we just didn't

514
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
We couldn't believe

515
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
Yeah and I Cameron

516
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Stayed

517
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
I think it was about a year-and-a-half

518
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Before he actually left

519
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
What is job

520
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
To be able to

521
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Take him to drive off all time

522
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
So as you started to scale up

523
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
Did you have to go

524
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
Find Outside investors

525
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
So that again I knew nothing about raising

526
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Michael started to say hey I think

527
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
I think we should franchises

528
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Mob the franchisor

529
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
Remember like we had

530
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Of our first meeting with like a franchise

531
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Consulting Group at Cameron's

532
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,472
Office like his day advertising office definitely pleased that we had in the office

533
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
To the conference table

534
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Crystal.

535
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,896
That's why I fight so we started getting like our documentation and

536
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Together so we could franchise

537
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Ascenso

538
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
I was a little like

539
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
And not like super excited about franchising cuz I didn't I didn't want to give it away is how I kind of felt about it

540
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
Imagine that you would be freaked out that

541
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
You know some franchise couldn't

542
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
Equality that you wanted

543
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Oh yeah

544
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
Wake me up at night and then we

545
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
We are very very bad

546
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
Particular about

547
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,520
We franchise with and made sure that they understood

548
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:13,664
The importance of all of that stuff and then like I said they're there was that fear and there still is that fear today but

549
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Is great and it really did help

550
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Spread our name

551
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
Much quicker than we could have if we

552
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Franchising and then we're raising money

553
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
You guys opened

554
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
I your first store in 2010's is crazy

555
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Locations do you have

556
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Today

557
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
67-68

558
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
As of tomorrow

559
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
And saying that you go from

560
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
Being stay-at-home mom

561
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
To running a

562
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
Open executive multimillion-dollar

563
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Company in like

564
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
2 years

565
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
How did you

566
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Mentally make that transition

567
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
It's still

568
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
So my going to all of us that it

569
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Took off and happen the way it has

570
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
It's been such a ship it is it was

571
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
It's hard and still hard to say balancing it all with the

572
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Kids and

573
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
But I think we all kind of grew into it pretty naturally in it

574
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
There's so much

575
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Passion

576
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
Behind what we're doing we all love it so much that

577
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Just probably my adrenaline Rush that

578
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
It was a lot of

579
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
Figuring it out as we went along

580
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
But we did

581
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Do you work

582
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,968
More now or do you work less now than you did when you start it

583
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Different kind of work

584
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
In the beginning I was in the stores

585
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Non stop offer

586
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
All the time

587
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,208
And I I remember so well when it went from like 3 to 5 to 7

588
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Stores and being late

589
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,352
I can't be in all the stories I don't have one time anybody I used to be able to remember we had

590
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,656
Brentwood West Hollywood

591
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Palisades

592
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
NCS City like I could hop around

593
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Those are pretty

594
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
Easy for me to get to

595
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Thrift store to store

596
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
And then as we started to grow

597
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,200
You know I slowly but surely like started bringing in people who

598
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Regional map

599
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Manager

600
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,136
Is the regional manager and any kind of kept going like that and that way and now

601
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Now we have

602
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,720
Massive infrastructure now

603
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Welders

604
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
Dada 3000 stylus

605
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,400
About an hour maybe seventy 80 people in our Support Center

606
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
So

607
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
It's pretty massive now and so now it's like

608
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
I don't have to be in to be

609
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Everyday was I tweet

610
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
Good but then it's like

611
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
There's days that I'm like

612
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
Decisions get made and things get me that I'm not involved in any more which I used

613
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
To be involved in

614
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Watching

615
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
You know it's like

616
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,624
Very hard for me to walk in for the walking tours and I see everything that he's

617
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Change

618
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Yeah where

619
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
I don't get to enjoy that much the way most quiet

620
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,792
Does that not only drive you crazy

621
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
People in the storks

622
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
When I come in

623
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
I think

624
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Eating it makes everybody nervous

625
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,496
So weird to me why are you mad

626
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
But it does and that is

627
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Truly the weirdest thing in

628
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
Courtney Garfield

629
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
Director she's like why don't you understand that

630
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Understand

631
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
What

632
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Have you learned about

633
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
You didn't have

634
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,744
Business Degree you didn't have to cut through the managerial Express

635
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Trains do I need to soak

636
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,168
What are some of your strengths that you learned about and your weaknesses you learned about as you had to kind of take on these roles

637
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Strength is

638
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:22,592
Was the confidence that I knew this business really well nobody can tell me I didn't know this busy

639
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,176
How to treat customers and Silas I knew how to make this business

640
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,480
I knew how to talk to people I think from

641
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Being in PR you know everything I had done

642
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
I always felt like

643
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,928
It's so cheesy bites everything like led me to this moment in my life and I felt like

644
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
I had what I used to have to run the store

645
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
And then there's things that I didn't know

646
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,168
That that's where Michael and cam came in and Michael new to hire like me needs a president of retail is like

647
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
Even do that was a thing like I eaten so there was

648
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,848
So much of like the things I didn't know we're filled and I think that that was one of my biggest learning

649
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,664
Experiences you need to bring on people who know which

650
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,504
What is a lot of people listening would say

651
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
I would never be able to

652
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Twerk as my partner in a business

653
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Like it's a really

654
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,904
Hard but it sounds like you guys have

655
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
A really you know

656
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Functional working relationship in a great marriage

657
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,352
Is that is a true wizard attention attention

658
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,472
Yes I mean they're there is a mean my husband and I is certainly a struggle and

659
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
And yeah I definitely comes in

660
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Challenges but

661
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Figured so much more outweighs the bad and we

662
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
We have especially now we have different teams at work under us and so we don't have to like we don't work nearly as closely as we did in the beginning

663
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,088
There's so much trust that you have when you're working with

664
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
Your husband and your brother that

665
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
It's

666
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Everything I

667
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
If I said to you

668
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
7 years ago when you were

669
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
No driving around in your

670
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Nissan

671
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Tara

672
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,680
Disable songs blow drying hair

673
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
In 7 years you can have 70 stores all across the country and you can be doing a hundred million dollars in Revenue year which

674
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
You be like

675
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
You're out of your mind

676
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
Pretty much I mean I could not see

677
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
That far down

678
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
And I remember people asking us

679
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
You know what's next for you guys and I was like

680
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
We're going to keep opening stores in

681
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
I think it was

682
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
To be at sea

683
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
67 I mean

684
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
It's okay because it wasn't premeditated like

685
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
We didn't have a business plan it wasn't like

686
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
This is our goal this is our trajectory

687
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,216
There was not a bad it was all this very

688
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
Organic and we're on to something so we're going to figure it out and keep

689
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Keep growing it

690
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
And it's very

691
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,944
Very rewarding for me personally because I was the one in the family that I really like

692
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,528
Oh God was Ali going to do and it's so it's it's

693
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
Particularly gratifying

694
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
My brother and I

695
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
Be together in business and we love that were able to be closed

696
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
On another level for the business

697
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
What is pretty special

698
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
Alli Webb founder of Drybar accompanied by the way is planning to expand internationally very soon

699
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
Going to Canada and also into Europe

700
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
Allie just published a book all about blow drying hair it's called The Drybar guide to good hair for all

701
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,576
Delete it if you met her or suffix remember but Ali's hair is actually naturally curly

702
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
I guess I should start that you are very

703
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:20,768
On curly hair right now but this is like a very carefully Style

704
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
Well I am a professional stylist myself and I happen for 20 years I actually did my own hair this morning I know how to

705
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,056
Baidu

706
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384

707
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664

00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Supply

722
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay we're now at the

723
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
Part of the show we called

724
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
How you built

725
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
This week

726
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
We have a story out of Nashville Tennessee

727
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
My name is

728
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Dr Mike Butera

729
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
I'm the

730
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
Founder and CEO of artisan makes musical instrument

731
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,488
Switch was a natural mood for Mike

732
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Because he plays

733
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
Spike a few dozen instruments himself

734
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
At a dinner party with a bunch of musicians

735
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
And after dinner we wanted to play music together

736
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
But we didn't have any instruments

737
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
We just had

738
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
The phones in our pockets

739
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
So they hooked up their phones to

740
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Computer speakers

741
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,992
Launch some music making apps

742
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
And they started the jam

743
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
But we were just

744
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Staring at our screens

745
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,184
We really wanted to interact with each other or

746
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,512
Get lost in the Music close our eyes

747
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Keith Richards music

748
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
But as friends

749
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
They felt kind of pathetic staring at their screens

750
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Dinky little speakers

751
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
And then

752
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,312
Mike had an idea

753
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
I thought

754
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
What is the speaker had a guitar neck

755
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
What is this speaker had

756
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,736
Keys on it what if it have a little drum pad

757
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
I just wanted the speaker to be

758
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Become

759
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
A musical instrument

760
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
So am I called up some of his

761
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Is engineer friends and ask them

762
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Talon build one

763
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
This is what they made

764
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,632
The digital instrument that looks kind of like the neck of a guitar

765
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,912
Sounds like

766
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
Well like almost every instrument

767
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
You can imagine

768
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
It has a fingerboard and a row of buttons like

769
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Bistro

770
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Or tapping

771
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Can hold it like

772
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Guitar

773
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,672
You can hold it upright like an upright Bass

774
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,720
But you can also set it down on

775
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
On the table

776
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Or your lap

777
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
And play it like that

778
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,840
Piano or drum pad

779
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
And when you put it on the violin setting

780
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:12,800
You can play it like a violin you can actually hold your iPhone out

781
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,872
And move your iPhone around in the air

782
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,224
And that will act like a bow

783
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Mike says

784
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
It took them

785
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
6 years together

786
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
The way they wanted

787
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
Which isn't necessarily A

788
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
Silicon Valley Style

789
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Way to do it

790
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
It's

791
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
What's more

792
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
In our case of Nashville hey

793
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Which is going to

794
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
Studios with musicians in

795
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
And see what works

796
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
And go back in

797
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Refine it and

798
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
And really look at the craft

799
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
A building

800
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
And to get it off the ground

801
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Mike and his Partners actually raised

802
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Over $1000000 on Kickstarter

803
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,248
They call it the instrument one

804
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
For about 400 bucks

805
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
Really I wanted this idea to be something that

806
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Anybody could use

807
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,976
Rather than just making a musical instrument for musicians

808
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
I wanted to make

809
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Fun for everyone else

810
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,864
