In America

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Blakely was growing up

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
In Florida

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Exactly

46
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
Dream of Designing ladies

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,320
60 want to be a lawyer but when she took LSAT

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856

00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,696

She got another job

53
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Who's selling facts

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Door to door

55
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Feeling

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Demoralized

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
With all the rejection and the

58
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Right here where you at

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
It was like water off a duck

60
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Oh my gosh no I

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Would feel very defeated and many times I would

62
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,064
Get in my car and drive around the block multiple times you know just trying to convince myself

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
To walk through the door

64
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
And sometimes I'd walk through the door and they were small offices where the whole office would turn and look at me at the same time

65
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm something to completely lose my nerve and just say oh sorry I'm I'm in the wrong place and turn around and walk out so

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
I stumbled my way through it believe me

67
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
And I know it sounds crazy but what I was selling fax machines door-to-door I

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie you know where's the director where's the where's the producer of this is not my

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
A movie and I was really determined

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
To create a better life

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
So hard-working there

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Like help you discover

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
What it was you were

74
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
That that was

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
When I first started wearing Hosiery daily and I realized him figured out what the control top

76
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Portion of the Hosiery was doing for me

77
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
In my clothes it was really making my clothes fit so much better

78
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848
But I had spent money on a pair of cream pants

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
At $98 on them which for me was a lot of money

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,040
And they just hung in my closet on Warren because every time I would go to wear them you could see the undergarment

81
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
Regular underwear left a panty line

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
The song wasn't a great solution it also left marks

83
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
So you could stay and then

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
The shapewear was

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,328
So it was like the girdles were so second overdone

86
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,472
And I saw an opportunity for something right in the middle that would just create the perfect canvas undergarment

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
For women

88
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
And I guess I should say for people who have never worn Spanx

89
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
It seems like this is an undergarment made out of

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Material that basically

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Smooth everything around

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Button size

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Yes

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
And so

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,672
When I cut the feet out of my own control top pantyhose so I can wear those cream pants the light bulb went off

96
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
And then I started pursuing the idea

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Like how to use an

98
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Started

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Build a business

100
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Did you have any money did you

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
The capital Did you

102
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Wealthy friends

103
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
I had set aside $5,000 in savings from selling fax machine Store to Door and that's what I start

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Spanx with

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
And so

106
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
The first thing I did was started

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
To research if the idea is

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
Existed and I went to the Georgia Tech Library in Atlanta every night after work

109
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
Look for a week and a half

110
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Researching every penny has patent that ever existed

111
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
And then probably on the

112
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
Seventh through tenth day of me being in there some guy came up to me and go to know there's a website called uspto.gov

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,959
POV and I said no what is that I scribbled it out of my notebook he's like you can

114
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
Search you're putting a patent and it'll search for you so that website became one of my best friends and one

115
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Once I determined that there wasn't anything

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
That existed in a patent form

117
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
And then wanted to see if there was any Market appetite for it Beyond Myself

118
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
I literally went and asked one person I went to the Neiman Marcus down the street from my apartment

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Went in and asked the sales associate if

120
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,327
She thought anybody would ever want something like a butler

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Was pantyhose to wear Underpants

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,007
And her face lit up and she goes yes in fact I have lots of customers who've been making their own homemade version of that

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,591
Because there's no right under garment to wear under a lot of their clothes

124
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,687
And so that was my whole focus group guy

125
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,039
That's it okay there's a market demand

126
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
Had you ever

127
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Sound anything

128
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,535
Were you to do a background and desire

129
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Manufac

130
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Your stuff

131
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
No

132
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Did you do how did you get

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Start a stick figure out like what material

134
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
I've never sewn I have never taken a business class in my life I didn't have anybody in the industry or even

135
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Know anybody

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
The it worked in fashion or

137
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Retail and so

138
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,247
What happened when I came up with the idea is I just started

139
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Taking other

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Pantyhose

141
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
And then I went to Hancock Fabrics down the

142
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
The straight and all these different arts and crafts

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Stores and started

144
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
Trying to Paperclip

145
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
Different pieces of elastic to the bottom and different pieces of

146
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
The Blaze

147
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
And you know obviously didn't get very far and my idea actually needed to be made on a machine

148
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
And that's why I really needed a manufactured

149
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
To give me the time of day

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
To see if I could even make

151
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
And in the meantime

152
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
You are

153
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
You still selling

154
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
Yeah because I needed the money

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Coming in in the

156
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,903
The health insurance and all all that comes with that so I was working on my idea at night and on the weekends

157
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,999
And when I kept calling all the manufacturers that I found that were mostly in North

158
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
South Carolina on the phone and not getting anywhere

159
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
I mean no one would take my

160
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
I call or they didn't you know

161
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
I had to learn from my cold calling days you got to be there in person

162
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
I took a week off

163
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Off of work

164
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
And Drugs North

165
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Carolina and Joe

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Just started cold calling

167
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Manufacturing

168
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Showed up and said

169
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Yes

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
So I walked in the door just cold and just said hi I'm here to meet

171
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
See the owner in their life

172
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
And you are

173
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
They always ask you the same three questions it's 8 and you are and it stays terribly

174
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Clear Lake stay and

175
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
You're with

176
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
I'd say Sara Blakely

177
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
Sara Blakely

178
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,799
So you can imagine how that meeting Matt and I must have been more like have a nice day it's great to meet you you know

179
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Were they just not in

180
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Interested in the idea at all

181
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,455
We have the manufacturing plants didn't get it at all and I found it very interesting

182
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Just seemed that all I was meeting with for men and then it kind of

183
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
It became clear to be why they probably been so uncomfortable for so hugs

184
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,415
Because the people that were making them worth spending all day in them

185
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
You know and so and if they were they were not admitting it

186
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,583
So I had a hard time explaining why this product was so important and

187
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
They couldn't wrap their minds around I was basically coming in and disrupting an entire industry been looking at something in one way

188
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
And they want to decline year after year

189
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
They were making Hosiery to be

190
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
As seen on the leg

191
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
And I knocked on their door and set guys

192
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
I just want your hosiery material

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
And I don't need it to be seen anywhere

194
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Actually going to be hidden under clothes it's a newt

195
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Undergarment

196
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Condense a manufacturer

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Take you want to make

198
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Well it took

199
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
A few visits to North Carolina and a lot of

200
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Really persistent

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,983
They all sent me away at first and a couple weeks after I left one manufacturer Highland Mills in

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
In Charlotte North Carolina the owner called me

203
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Ready set Sarah

204
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
It's Sam

205
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
I've decided to help make your crazy idea

206
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
And I just pause it I was about to jump out of my chair and I said really why why the change of heart Sam and all he said is

207
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
I have three daughters

208
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
And so later I found out when I got the chance

209
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
To do it that he had run the idea by his three daughters over dinner and they said Dad this is actually a really good idea we think

210
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
You should give this girl a shot

211
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
And he still didn't understand it or think it was a good idea but he said that my enthusiasm in Like Mike

212
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,591
Confidence and how good this idea was going to be

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Stuck with him

214
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Do you know about what you were

215
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
No so when I came up with the idea

216
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
I kept it a secret for one year

217
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
I did share my idea with people like manufacturers or lawyers are people that I thought could help me bring

218
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
A product to life

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
But I was very careful right away was just a gut feeling I had

220
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
To keep it to myself

221
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
Because I believe that ideas are the most vulnerable in their infancy

222
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
And

223
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,383
It's interesting to turn to your right or left in that moment until a friend or tell your husband

224
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,991
And you know when you do that instantly egos invited into the mix

225
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
And then you end up spending all your time defending it

226
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Leaning it

227
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
And not pursuing it so

228
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't

229
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Turn back no matter what I heard

230
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
I'd invested enough of my time and I had enough Sweat Equity into the idea

231
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,495
That I'd I told people and the things I heard where you know honey if it's such a good idea why isn't somebody else

232
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
It's already done it

233
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,895
And we'll leave if it is a good idea Sarah you know you're going to spend your savings on this and then sick

234
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Six months the big guys will just knock you out of the water and

235
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
That was all coming from a place of love but I feel like if I had heard that

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
The night that I cut the feet out of my panties I probably still be selling socks

237
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Machine

238
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
So once

239
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
You started to

240
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Amethyst

241
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Felt was really

242
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Especially

243
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Did you did you begin the process

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Getting impacted

245
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
I did so I went to three different Law Firm

246
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,663
I couldn't find a single female patent attorney in the state of Georgia and I even called the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and they said there isn't

247
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,063
So I said okay I'm going to do my best to explain his two to three men let's see what happens and

248
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
They were very nice they were

249
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Not super

250
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Impress

251
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,535
Probably with the idea and they they all quoted me between 3 and $5,000

252
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Pot Nets

253
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Syfy

254
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Decided to write it myself

255
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,495
And I went to Barnes & Noble on Peachtree in Atlanta and bought a book called patents and trademarks

256
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
And I wrote the patent

257
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
And then my mom's an artist and so I asked her if she would

258
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Catch me in the prototype for the

259
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
The patent and that is

260
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,503
The picture from the US patent and trademark office

261
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
But I went back

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,647
The one lawyer who gave me a little bit more of time of day than the other ones

263
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
And I said listen Dan

264
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
I have written my own patent

265
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
I have done all of the work except for the claims that is the

266
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
The part that I am not trained for I don't understand how to do that

267
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Please I need your expert

268
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Proteases are any chance you would do it for a discounted price

269
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
And he was blown away cookie Britain basically the entire patent yes

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
For $750 I'll do it over a weekend and I'll write the

271
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
The claims portion of your patent

272
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Soyuz

273
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
So then you got the

274
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,575
Yes but you know there was a moment in this journey that was quite funny I

275
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
When we were in the final stages of the claims

276
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,487
The lawyer said Sarah there is I need to know it's technically in the Garment from a

277
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Fiber and yarn level on

278

00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
And I've been writing

364
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
Names on scrap pieces of paper everywhere I was you know and most of the names are on the back of rental car agreement

365
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
Because I had great thinking and in cars

366
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,071
And I wasn't getting anywhere with that I didn't like any of the names and I knew it wasn't right

367
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
And then I sort of narrow down my thinking at one point in time and thought Kodak and Coca-Cola are the two most recognized name

368
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Cineworld what do they have

369
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,823
In common they both had a strong case down to them

370
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
And I had friends that were stand-up comedians

371
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
And I knew that the k sound makes your audience laugh

372
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
So I just called

373
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
I know I don't know but it said it's a known trade secret among

374
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Comedian

375
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,975
And so I thought you know what I need to have my invention have the k sound in it for good luck

376
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,375
And almost as soon as I neared my thinking down that way the word Spanx came to me while I was in my car

377
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
I saw the word across like in my mind across the dashboard of my car and I pulled off the side of the road and I-5

378
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
That's it

379
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,639
And I went home that night I didn't tell anybody

380
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
And I wrote down spanks

381
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
And I went on USPTO. Govt at I sit and I sat there and stared at it for a while and at the last minute

382
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
My backspace

383
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
And deleted the K in the ass and put him in Act

384
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
I dread that made up words to better for products

385
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And real word

386
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Doing their easier to trademark

387
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,983
And even though it did actually have the cake and it had still the case down and so I felt great about it and the name is just right it's just

388
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
My product was all about the rear end

389
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,407
And it's about making the rear end look better and no panty lines and so the word spanks was

390
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,783
Kind of naughty and kind of funny and a little bit risky and it just all work tonight and I hit

391
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Stand and

392
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
Think about a hundred fifty dollars with my credit card and then a couple months later I got back an official certificate from the government

393
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,767
Saying that I was the proud owner of the word Spang

394
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
OKC

395
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
Got a manufacturer a patent

396
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Anime

397
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
How did you

398
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
My very first account that I called on was Neiman Marcus

399
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
How did you

400
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Even

401
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Get in there

402
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
I called them

403
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Guy I just called them

404
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:32,927
I went in the Yellow Pages and I looked up the Neiman Marcus number in Atlanta and I said hi on Sarah and then to the

405
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,791
Product can I come and show it to you in the lady laughs and goes man we have a buying office and it's in Dallas

406
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
I said oh well what's their number

407
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
So she gave me their number and I started calling them

408
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
And I just kept calling and trying to get to the Hosiery buyer and I called for days at different times and she answer

409
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
To the phone and I took my shot and I said hey a hi I'm Sara Blakely and I invented a product that is going to change

410
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
The way your customers wear clothes

411
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
And if you give me a few minutes of your time I'll fly to Dallas

412
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
And show you

413
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
What you say

414
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
She said

415
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
Well if you're willing to fly here I'll give you 10 minutes of my time

416
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
And I said great

417
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
And I jumped on a plane and I flew to Dallas

418
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
And I was in the meeting with her and she was this

419
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
Beautiful woman impeccably-dressed I'm at the Neiman Marcus headquarters I have a Ziploc bag for my kitchen with a pro

A color copy of the packaging that I'd created on my friends

422
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Computer

423
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
And

424
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
My lucky red backpacks

425
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
From college that all of my friends back to me now

426
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135

00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Eastpak old

428
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,511
Stingy backpack I said yes it's my good luck charm I have to admit they were

429
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Really pleading with me

430
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
In the middle of my meeting with her I could tell I was losing her and I just knew it was my one shot so I said you know what

431
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
What Diane

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Will you come with me to the bathroom

433
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
And she just pause you does excuse me I go

434
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,783
I know I know it's a little bit will you just please come with me to the bathroom I want to show you

435
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
My own product before and after

436
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
And she

437
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
She said okay if you walk down the hall with me and I went in the stall and I had on my cream pants that were the reason I invented this

438
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,143
Without Spanx on and then I went in the stall and put steaks on underneath and came out and she looked up and she goes

439
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
Wow I get it

440
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Brilliant

441
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
And she said I'm going to place an order and I'm going to put it in

442
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
7 stores and see how it goes

443
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,199
I couldn't believe it I got in the car and I was shaking

444
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:38,111
And I called Sam from the manufacturing plant Lego Sam Sam is Sarah I need more I just landed Neiman Marcus

445
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,743
G+ there's nothing on the other end of the phone for a it seem like a minute

446
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Either Sam or you there

447
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Is Tara

448
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Don't take this the wrong way but I thought you were to give these away as Christmas gifts or something for the next like 5 years what do you mean

449
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Neiman Marcus just took it on my memory has just took it and I mean

450
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
Okay so you are

451
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
In Neiman Marcus

452
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Are you thinking all right

453
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,903
Oh my gosh that is the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make that is when the work begins

454
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
Personally I paid people basically friends to go buy the product and create a buzz about it because I was like you know I got

455
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,143
I have these things move off the shelf or the buyers not going to give me any

456
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Any more chance

457
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471
Wait you paid people to buy the

458
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Yes

459
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,615
I called every friend I had in all the Seven Cities that Neiman's sent

460
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
The Spanks to

461
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,479
And called friends that I hadn't even spoken to since fourth grade and

462
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,807
You know kind of like hide Sarah remember me from 4th grade

463
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,159
Do you mind going to the store and buying thanks and I'll send you a check

464
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
And

465
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
It was really tough because I was one item

466
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
In a in a department

467
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,167
And a new brand and I didn't even get a whole row in the Hosiery Department I got a pocket

468
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
So

469
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,775
I needed to do whatever I could to maximize this chance

470
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
And

471
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
I went to the

472
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
The stores and I would have

473
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,455
Explain what the product was I would demo it at shut the before and after picture that my friend took

474
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
And then I would stand in the

475
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Restore from

476
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
9 when they opened until about 5 or 6

477
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Everyday

478
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Yeah

479
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,584
And I realized that one of the biggest challenges I had was that the where my product was being sold in the store

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,960
Door was an issue is being sold in the Hosiery department and my customer was in the shoe department

481
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
And she was in the ready-to-wear department

482
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
And so I started

483
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,176
Realizing I got I have a challenge I've got to get my product out of the department it's supposed to be sold in

484
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Tohatchi how'd you do that

485
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,528
Well I went to Target and I bought stands

486
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
You know free envelope

487
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,720
And I ran around the store and put them at every cash register and everybody thought somebody else approved it

488
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,816
So the cats remember when like Neiman Marcus and moving your

489
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Like piles of Spanx

490
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
To the cash register and they just assumed that that way

491
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Looks like

492
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Some hydros

493
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
So other than that how are you

494
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
Letting people know about

495
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
But you were selling

496
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:12,224
It was a lot of a lot of hard work for me to get the word out I mean I've never advertised

497
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,992
Nice things to say

498
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
18 years old and we've never done any formal ad campaign or anything is so it's a very Word of Mouth brand

499
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
No money

500
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
How to get the word out

501
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
And

502
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
You did things like

503
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Already

504
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Send it to Oprah

505
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Yeah I did I sent it to Oprah with a note and

506
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
Turns out she ended up.

507
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Picking it is her favorite product of the year how did she even

508
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Find it in the

509
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Piles of male sheep

510
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
Well I found out that Andre

511
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Her hairdresser got him

512
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
End

513
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Put them in her dressing room

514
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
She Tried Him and

515
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
Put them on and

516
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Has basically warned them everyday since

517
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
She liked

518
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,464
Cover shipping pantyhose the women or the Spanx all across

519
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
The world basically from my apartment

520
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,632
So that's an enormous opportunity and then another thing I made a decision that was really

521
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
You know unconventional at the time

522
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
I decided to go on QVC

523
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
The Shopping Channel

524
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Yeah and

525
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
Had a lot of people say Sarah your brand is at Bergdorf Goodman to Neiman Marcus you can't also sell on QVC you'll kill your

526
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Brand and I just

527
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
I just had guys

528
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
I'm going to be the one on QVC

529
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
And I'm going to come

530
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,672
Control the message and it's going to give me an opportunity to explain what this is and

531
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
You know I felt confident in that

532
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
And they gave me five minutes of airtime

533
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
And

534
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
I sold

535
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Mm Paris

536
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Banks in 5 minutes

537
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:41,312
And that was after you know a year of standing in department stores across the country and on a really good day I

538
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
I fell between you know

539
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
35 to

540
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
270

541
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Pair in a day

542
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
MN sales muscle

543
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Going up because I read that

544
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Can hear you

545
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Uni like

546
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
10 million-dollar

547
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Yeah

548
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
That feel

549
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
It was great

550
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,376
It was great I never was doing it for the money you know so I wasn't really that ever that

551
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,704
Focused on it I mean I can even remember after a couple years of

552
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
Thanks I'm still in my apartment and my accountant kept trying to convince me to buy a house and I was like nah I'm not interest

553
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
My little brother was always calling and telling me different ways

554
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
And I just

555
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
It was really just for the art of it like I love I love being able to pay my own rent and stand on my own two feet as a woman

556
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
That was a really important thing for myself but

557
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
It was really just I love making the product

558
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Did you have

559
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
Early on did you have people

560
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Listen you got to steal a basket

561
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Any money

562
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
I mean business

563
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Company

564
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Figure this out

565
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Yeah I did I had all kinds of

566
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Things coming at me in the beginning

567
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
And still do you know

568
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
15 years later but I remember one of the most

569
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
Interesting was

570
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
Within the first 6 months I started having several

571
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
People come up to me and say what

572
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,976
And I had no idea what they were talking about cuz I've never taken a business

573
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,792
And it dawned on me that people act

574
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Restart things just

575
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Seldom

576
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Are you still on Hunter

577
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Yes

578
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
You ever think

579
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
No

580
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
I was always nervous

581
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
But I was always so connected

582
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
The product

583
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
When I was so I was so creating this

584
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Before it has

585
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
107 facts

586
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
Pusheen Store to Door

587
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,672
I was I was thinking about it I was writing about it I was visualizing it I was

588
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
Preparing for it

589
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,048
I thought you know I don't have the most money I don't have a business degree

590
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
I have no idea what I'm doing

591
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,400
Emilio factoring a retailer any of this

592
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
But I do care the most so let's see what happen

593
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
When you see this

594
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
See things like you do

595
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800

Play billionaire

597
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Weirdly

598
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
See that

599
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Did you see that number that word

600
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
Yes it's very weird it reminds me of in middle school there used to be these things in the malls where you could go in and pics

601
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
The magazine cover you wanted

602
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,536
Feel like your friends we don't go in the booth and we smile and then we'd be on the cover of Vogue or whatever

603
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
I just does it feels very surreal to me

604
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496

Ideas happen

618

It's never easy and that's why America

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

625
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:10,208
Timer for how you built that and say Russia going to check back with someone who is on the show last fall

626

Arthur the founder of fiendish

627
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,632
Kholoki tender its weight of making new friends

628
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Just a friend based on

629
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Things you both like to do like gardening or hiking or playing music and the moment there are users that have things

630
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
In common with you

631
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:32,224
I will get a notification that you have friends waiting so once you get that notification you can meet them or you can

632
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Keep swiping on other interest

633
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
I just spent several months trying to get friend-ish coded and to work out some of the Kinks and when she fine

634
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,280
Can we put a beta version up on the app store on iTunes last bring most of the feedback she got

635
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Disappointing

636
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,168
The biggest criticism was that there wasn't enough people on the app so naturally

637
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,520
We're Basin Orlando which is where most of our users are but if you downloaded the app

638
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,080
Wisconsin or in Berlin or in London

639
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
There just wasn't enough users

640
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
Able to feel like the apples function

641
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
So we're going to have a bad experience

642
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
Is almost just as bad as in not downloading it at all

643
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
But then about a month after

644
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
We first spoke

645
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
To Chandra

646
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
She got some good news

647
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
She apply to be a

648
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Contestant on a new reality show

649
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,792
Planet of the apps and she got it

650
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,376
It wasn't a typical reality show like The Bachelor where it's like

651
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
20 girls

652
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
One guy

653
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,984
This is the search for the next

654
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Great idea

655
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,056
The show is produced by Apple and

656
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,616
Forecast

657
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,944
You have 60 seconds on the escalator to get them

658
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
Truth be a part of your project you'll know

659
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
Cuz at the end of the risky later ride that either green or red

660
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
And you can probably imagine

661
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
Happens next if

662
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
The show's advisor

663
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Like your idea

664
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Eventually get a big investment

665
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
In your app

666
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,840
Tundra can't tell us whether that happened to her because the episode

667
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Json has

668
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Run but she says

669
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
It was really cool to just

670
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,800
Be on the show you know during filming a lot of people from Apple would be on

671
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Sad or just so you know

672
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,664
Kind of hear back from seasoned professionals

673
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,760
About your app ID and for people to look at your ID in a different way that you haven't

674
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Considered as just it was

675
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Amazing

676
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
Chargers episode of Planet of the

677
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
The apps will drop

678
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
90 weeks

679
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Witches Rock

680
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Play the same time that the

681
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
Official version of fiendish will go live

682
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
On the App Store

683
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
I hope that I'm

684
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,888
Becoming a success story for Orlando Tech assist

685
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
I'm quite happy

686
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704

687
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728

688

689
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
How soon but

690
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
I wouldn't have it any

691
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
