00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,552
I quite frankly thought I was at the very bottom of my Barrel I mean there were days where

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,392
I didn't want to live I mean the internet

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
Defined me the article calling me the most ugly names in the world the people on Twitter

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Ugliest things but through all of this pain and struggle

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
I still had an itch to create and so I kind of sat down and said I can start something right

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
And I can change what I hate

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
That I see in the world

Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
And the stories

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
Behind the movement

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
I'm gay

Hinder

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Aspire to build bumble

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Kinder gentler dating app

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Where women

27
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Make the first move

28
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
It was a time believe it or not

29
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
When internet dating men

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
You were

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Desperate

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Awkward or both

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
It wasn't something you talked about openly

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
But today

35
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
It's the complete opposite

36
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Because the Internet

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
And dating apps

38
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
So much easier and

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
More efficient to meet Lots

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Lots of people

41
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
And it's more less frictionless

42
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Is no awkward phone calls or

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
Courtship rituals are

44
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
To face rejection

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
There's something almost

46
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Transactional about the whole thing

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
And it's no exaggeration to say that

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Even though they've only been around for

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Take 5 years or so

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Dating apps have

51
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Pretty much

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Transform dating

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
And if you love them

54
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
You can thank Whitney Wolfe

55
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,168
Or you can blame her if you hate that because Whitney was part of the dating app Revolution

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
She was one of the founders who helped create

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Tender which is now one of the biggest dating apps in the world

58
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Whitney laugh

59
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Tender under difficult circumstances

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Sansa circumstances

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Can't legally

62
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Discuss but as you will hear

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
It was a time in her life where she came under intense online abuse

64
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,952
And that experience would Inspire her to build bumble

65
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Which is a difference

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Kind of dating app

67
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
And today

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Just

69
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Years since

70
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Launch

71
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Bumble is one of the top dating apps

72
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
In the US

73
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
But the story of how Whitney got into that world at all

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Well

75
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Like many of our stories

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
It starts with

77
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
The little bit of luck

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,224
Right after she graduated from college at Southern Methodist University

79
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
In Dallas

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
I was just

81
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Kind of going day by day

82
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
Flooring and and being okay with that right

83
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
I think

84
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
To my family I almost

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Was

86
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
I don't think it was

87
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Proud

88
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Oh my daughter went on to do that

89
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,864
It's right I was in this

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Weird place

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,728
So I kind of moved in with my mom in California

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
And I went to LA one afternoon

93
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
To visit A girlfriend of mine

94
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
And ended up at a dinner

95
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Where

96
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
I

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
A couple

98
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
People

99
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
One of which

100
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Went on to be the CEO of

101
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Tinder

102
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
This was Sean rad

103
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Yes

104
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,952
And he had told me how he was

105
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Going to be the general manager of this

106
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,328
Incubator that would be launching all sorts of

107
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Alternative

108
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
An apps and they were looking

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,752
At the time they were focused on one app which was a consumer loyalty app

110
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
Call Cardiff I kind of like a digital punch card

111
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
For your favorite coffee shop for your favorite whatever it is and he just told you about this

112
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
At this dinner party yeah we were just at a restaurant having dinner or just a few of us and

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
I said well that sounds really interesting and when he asked what I was doing is that you know I'm really looking for a job I think I could

114
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Probably help you Market your app

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
And he said why do you call me tomorrow and come in for an interview so I called him at 8 a.m. the next day I think he was alarmed and

116
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
Surprised that I actually called him

117
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,727
And end up going in for an interview it worked out

118
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,311
Started working from home right away and then I moved to LA

119
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
For this

120
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Tortoise incubator

121
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Yes for Cardiff I was the

122
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
There been really no talk

123
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
Tender yet and my job is very much focused

124
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
Chordify so I started working full-time

125
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
And while we were getting kardify off the ground you know I spent a lot of time going door to door to door in LA to

126
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Different

127
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Restaurants and

128
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,679
Boutiques

129
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
I struggled with it because there's too many moving parts right and so

130
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
I mean you have to get the store on board

131
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
And then once the store is on board you have to help

132
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
But the customer has the app

133
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
What were the stores interested when you came in but they like it

134
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
No

135
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
To be honest

136
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
A very few people were interested

137
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,511
I think it was really how you positioned it and I learned I learned a lot

138
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
True true that experience

139
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Because

140
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:28,191
You know one pet for go one way and you say something a little different the next time you go in a completely different way

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
And so I really

142
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
Realize that it's not so much about

143
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
The what

144
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
It's the

145
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
The how or the

146
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
Why you should do this right like this is why you need this instead of

147
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,807
What you what you need right and so it was really interesting crash course in

148
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
In marketing and sales

149
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
But you were not

150
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
A cat purrs

151
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Necessarily you just really interested

152
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
I wasn't even interested in Tech I was just interested in the

153
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
The the way it had reach

154
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
The way that Tech

155
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Hood

156
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Expand beyond the walls

157
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Right

158
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
I went through college with no Instagram and so

159
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Instagram really be

160
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Huge right as a graduated

161
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
And then you

162
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
Thoughts of four billion dollars and I think everyone kind of went

163
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
Yeah and this was kind of like a

164
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
And I opening

165
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Moment for my

166
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
My peers

167
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
And so

168
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Didn't I mean

169
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Did you whistle like a sense of excitement.

170
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
Put on something big or did you know pretty soon after

171
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
How do you join that the thing wasn't

172
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Not going to work

173
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,239
No you know I think everyone was really excited and very hopeful and it was a beautiful app

174
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:39,871
I think if we really wanted it to happen and I remember we're all sitting around like we're going to be then let me know next big thing and

175
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,015
And then shortly thereafter I think we started getting excited about this fight project Matchbox

176
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Which

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
With what became tender but

178
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
At the time it was Matchbox

179
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Which was supposed to be a dating app

180
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Yeah I was like

181
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
The flirting app

182
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,255
It was like connecting people to flirt right

183
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
And after we were really unable to get kardify to gain significant

184
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Attraction

185
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
I think we all know

186
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
The first few of us

187
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Kind of like

188
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Maybe we need to shift gear as you know and I was

189
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,895
22 years old I had just come out of college I was thinking very much like

190
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
College students

191
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,039
This will work and I think I was so excited about the fact that they're

192
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
What's something that I and my friends would use First

193
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
If I twitch

194
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Show something I personally would have never used

195
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And again it was not a

196
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,303
New idea you have to think about what existed already

197
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Dozens of dating apps flirting apps

198
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Connecting apps

199
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
I mean there was already the Behemoth which was match.com right

200
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
And we sat on the same floor as match

201
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
In LA

202
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Sosa was

203
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Was building tender

204
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
Like Parvin idea to build like more of these

205
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Dating type

206
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
Products Aurora

207
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
So tender was not my idea I've never said it

208
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,951
Was my idea ever I became a co-founder of Tanner via my marketing contributions in my early

209
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
Involvement in getting it launched and getting it out there

210
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
So

211
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
I've heard about 30 completing

212
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Stories of

213
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,703
What the original idea was Andrew who really cares at this point

214
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,823
I mean it is what it is and it was to connect people around you you know if you

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
See someone that you want to talk to

216
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
2 across the room how do you

217
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
How do you talk

218
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Without

219
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
You know

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Feeling awkward I think

221
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Where we went

222
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,183
In a very unique Direction was marketing at Millennials and I just don't think that had ever been done in a successful way

223
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
And what was the actual product

224
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
What was the app what it look like

225
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,399
It was very similar to what it looks like now is just a very early version of it so you would just

226
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Swipe

227
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Left or right on people that actually

228
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
But I first saw that there was no swipe

229
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,359
It was like a tapping like a card game originally and was it called tender but

230
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,943
No we played with so many different names I mean

231
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
Maybe going to be flirt and then it was maybe going to be

232
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
I mean there's so many different things

233
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
I thought it was going to be and

234
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Tender ended up sticking

235
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
So you're so you're thinking I like this thing has legs

236
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
And so what did you do how did you do

237
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah I remember thinking to myself that it would work at SMU

238
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
And I remember I

239
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Took the guys into a meeting

240
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,567
And I gave them my little sorority fraternity

241
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Roll out pitch

242
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Inside

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,015
I'm going to show up on Monday when you go to chop your meetings going to run to the sororities and fraternities I'm going to get everybody on it

244
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
And then it's just going to take off at SMU

245
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Yes at SMU

246
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
I'm so I got the green light

247
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
Go do that and we had

248
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,095
Very very very very minimal marketing materials I think I had three or four t-shirts

249
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
That we took

250
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:46,751
That had tender on it and then I had to get really crappy so when I landed in SMU

251
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Funny I was talking to my girlfriend about this the other day

252
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,943
My good girlfriend who now does the weather in La she was a year younger than me so she hadn't graduated yet

253
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
And I took a picture of her

254
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
And then I took a picture of one of my guy friends on campus

255
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Drop them into the match

256
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Screaming like a

257
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Tinder screen

258
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,767
And I wrote a big thing on top of it saying find out who likes you on campus

259
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
And I save the file and I took it to the FedEx

260
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Across the street from SMU and we printed

261
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
About the copies

262
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
And I

263
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
Offered a bunch of people around campus $20 bills

264
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Help me

265
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Put them everywhere I mean

266
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
People's windshield

267
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Under dorms

268
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Everywhere everywhere everywhere and then

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
Monday night I rallied all of my friends that were still in school cuz again I just graduated had a lot of friends

270
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Younger

271
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
And we've made our round

272
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
We went to the sorority houses and gave a pitch

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
Got up on chairs and told all the girls

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
You know you have to download

275
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Because

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,983
College is all about meeting people and right now you only have access to

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
The people that you hang out with every weekend and it's a really

278
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
Close minded it be no experience and you guys need to meet all these

279
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,711
Describe people on campus and there's all these really cute guys waiting for you on the app

280
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
We rushed and got all these women to download the app

281
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
And then we ran as fast as we

282
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Because to the

283
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Fraternity Row

284
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
And when

285
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
The Frat houses and said a different pitch and said

286
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Hey guys

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
No other way to access you know hundreds of sorority girls right now

288
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,495
Download the app because they're all waiting for you they've all just downloaded this app and they're waiting for you to like them

289
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
And so

290
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Yeah I know it's so ridiculous

291
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,455
But you have to picture you had to go to work

292
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
You were hustling this thing

293
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
Yes I think that would be an accurate

294
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Representation

295
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
And so the next day I remember

296
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
You know we looked at the download numbers and hundreds of people had downloaded overnight and hundreds was bigger than the downloads

297
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
We got on chordify over months and so you know I'm looking at hundreds of downloads and I'm like we made it

298
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
When the next Facebook right.

299
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Just being

300
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Super

301
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,359
You know a little disconnected from reality probably not that

302
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,199
Distances we would eventually discover so you go back to LA

303
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Like what's the next step

304
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,599
I can't remember if I went straight back to LA if I went straight to Utah because

305
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
I went and did the same thing at University of Utah

306
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Which seems weirdly

307
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,095
Cinderella a new people there you know and it's funny I called this a long time ago I said to everyone on the

308
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
The team I said guys watch

309
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
BYU

310
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
Will be one of our biggest markets one day because

311
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,591
In the BYU at the LDS College in in Provo Utah

312
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
And they're all expected to get married by

313
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
By the end of college like that is the excitation

314
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
That's why I said I promise

315
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
I think BYU will be one of our biggest markets and I think

316
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Half of Utah will end up getting married because

317
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Tinder

318
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Tinder became massive

319
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
In Utah BYU campus oh yeah

320
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Wow

321
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
2013 you know

322
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
Wizard feeling like this is just

323
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
So amazing is so exciting

324
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Are you kidding yes

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
I mean

326
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
I lived

327
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Breathe dreams

328
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
I was in golf

329
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
I mean my friends didn't want to talk to me anymore then I go cash

330
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Contact Tinder again

331
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
No it was such an exciting time and

332
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Again it's worth noting

333
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Tinder was group app

334
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
Right it was not just me it was not just

335
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
One of the guys is not just one of the other guys

336
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
This was really

337
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Teamwork

338
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
So

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
I'm going to do something

340
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
We need that we don't often do in the show which is

341
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
I would you skip over a / 8

342
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
A few years went

343
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Tender was growing in

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Dating app

345
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Millions and millions of users

346
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Because they're legal reasons

347
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Why you can't talk about certain things

348
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
And I'm just going to say I am going to

349
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Explain briefly

350
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
That you left

351
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
10 Durant way

352
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
2014

353
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Under pretty difficult

354
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Is I'm you had been

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
In a relationship with one of the other co-founders

356
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Where's that broke down

357
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
So you

358
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Left

359
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
And it was a sexual harassment lawsuit and that

360
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Settled in

361
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Ask about that

362
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
But all the sudden you were you were all over the tech press

363
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
These people

364
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
People caught wind of this lawsuit

365
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Text message

366
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Pictures that were sent to you

367
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Q70

368
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Republican flodgin

369
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
And all this time you were the public eye in and you were

370
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
I guess liked

371
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Rifle 124

372
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
25 of the time

373
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
I was 24 I turned twenty-five just a few days later

374
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,143
The main target of of a lot of the attention

375
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
So real quick I'm going to jump in in

376
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,567
Just say I have absolutely no comment on anything

377
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Lawsuit

378
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
And I've no comment on

379
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
You know any of the allegations or anything

380
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
But

381
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
The way the people online

382
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Spoke about me

383
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
The way

384
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Both

385
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Reporters

386
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
And complete

387
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Strangers you know internet

388
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Twitter

389
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Comment section

390
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
It was

391
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
It it jolted me

392
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,519
In such a way it it completely robbed me of every last

393
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Sounds of confidence

394
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Ants that I may have ever had

395
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Listen I was not

396
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
I was not

397
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
A famous person in my life

398
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
Salt Lake City

399
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
Parents

400
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Quite frankly just

401
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
A normal professional right like that's just

402
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Who I was

403
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
And to have

404
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
The New York Times calling

405
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Extended relatives

406
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
And to have

407
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,607
The Daily Mail knocking on the back window at your apartment when you're not even there

408
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
And

409
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
To have

410
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Your

411
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Personal

412
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Emotions

413
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,359
Being turned into caricatures on

414
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
Tech blogs and mainstream media

415
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
TMZ I mean

416
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
It was

417
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Really truly

418
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
How did you display get through the day

419
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
I I quite frankly

420
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,327
Thought I was at the very bottom of my Barrel I mean there were days where

421
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
I didn't want to live

422
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
I didn't want to get out of bed

423
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
I felt

424
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Like it was stamped

425
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Across my forehead

426
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,823
And when I say it was stamped across my forehead

427
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
That was fifty different things

428
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,223
That was the article calling me the most ugly names in the world

429
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
That was

430
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
The people on Twitter

431
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Saying the ugliest things

432
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
I mean the internet to find me

433
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
For a moment

434
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
Time and

435
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
I

436
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
I wanted to die

437
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
Yet I had to

438
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Make this

439
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Bigger than myself

440
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Right like this is bigger than me

441
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Meaning

442
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
I have people in my life that I have

443
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Be there for I have parents

444
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Cuz I have friends

445
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:53,503
I need to continue my career I'm 24 about to be 25

446
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
I am not going to

447
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Just

448
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,927
Call it a day at 25 I mean am I you know like there was a lot of that

449
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
And

450
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
After I was able to pay

451
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Take myself off

452
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
The bath mat crying

453
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
I

454
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
I was able to

455
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Through the fog

456
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
See the real problem

457
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
And the problem was not

458
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:21,663
Or the media or the story or what happened the problem was

459
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
The lack of online accountability

460
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
That

461
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
Human beings are exposed to every single day

462
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
And what it made me realize was

463
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
You know whatever I felt

464
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
What's going on online

465
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,047
This is what goes on on a 13 year olds phone all day everyday

466
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
And it scared me

467
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
Was it impossible to ignore that 7 could you have just shut that out

468
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
No

469
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
It was a possible

470
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
It just became this

471
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Obsession and

472
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
It really messed

473
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
With my psyche I mean it and it made me

474
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Really

475
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,503
Not right for a while I mean I didn't really socialize I

476
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
I kind of

477
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Became a Hermit for

478
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
2 years and what I did during those two

479
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
2 years was I work

480
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
My tail off I mean

481
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
I worked

482
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
So hard

483
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
And

484
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
What I

485
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
Had realized was you can't kill ambition

486
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
You can kill confidence but

487
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Can't kill Drive

488
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Through all of this

489
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Pain and struggle

490
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
I still had an itch

491
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Inside of me too

492
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Create

493
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
And I miss

494
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
The feeling of

495
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Creating all day and

496
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Building

497
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
And think something grow and

498
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Engineering it to grow right you know marketing it

499
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
And so I kind of sat down and said

500
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
I can start

501
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Right now

502
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
And I can have an impact

503
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
And I can change what I hate

504
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
That I see in the world

505
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
When we come back

506
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
How Whitney took that idea

507
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
And turned it into bumble

508
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615

Play Welcome Back to how I built this from NPR

531
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Gyros

532
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
24 years old

533
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
Whitney Wolfe had already helped launch what are the world's biggest

534
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Dating apps

535
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Tinder

536
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
But after she left the company in everything that went with it

537
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Online bullying in

538
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Severe depression

539
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
Get away from all that you wanted to get away from dating apps and build something new something

540
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
A little more kind

541
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
So I started working on this concept called Mercy

542
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
What it was going to be was

543
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,111
Female only social network where

544
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
Women only use compliment

545
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
They would no longer be able to

546
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,839
You know comment on appearance or hurt their

547
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Are each other's feelings

548
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
Or use social media to bully right

549
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
So is the antidote to what I

550
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
I experienced online

551
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
And

552
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
I

553
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
Started working on this end

554
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Had

555
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
You know my marketing plan mapped out and I

556
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,319
I was thinking about doing that and I was approached by

557
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
My now business partner Andrey andreev

558
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
And he is

559
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720

00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
So a lot of berries

564
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
Successful companies

565
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
His current very successful company is called Badu and it is the world's largest dating platform

566
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
It is massive

567
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Overseas

568
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
I mean we're talking

569
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
I think I have something

570
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
320 million

571
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,344
I like they're part of that club of only LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram like those

572
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Big big big crazy numbers

573
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,184
And he said

574
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Sorry to connect

575
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,328
You know the summer I know that probably not the best time for you but I'd really love to hear what you're up

576
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
And so

577
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,728
His initial intent was to hire me as their CMO their Chief marketing off

578
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Baidu

579
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
And I said you know I'm flattered that's

580
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Great however

581
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,504
I'm essentially Not For Hire I'm going to start my own business and I want it to be mission-driven and I don't want to work and date

582
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Like

583
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Going to be my future

584
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
And he said okay so tell me about the

585
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
This vision of yours and

586
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
What are you going to do in

587
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,560
How you going to build this into a huge social platform and I told him I vision and

588
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,144
Yes and you could hear and feel my passion for

589
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,704
This platform and he said you know what

590
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,008
You need to build this but you need to do it

591
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
And

592
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:42,944
Ignited I'm not doing yeah and I said I don't think you understood me

593
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
I'm not going back into dating like that's not happy

594
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
And he said no no no this

595
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
This hat.

596
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
What you're trying to do

597
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
Needs to be done at dating

598
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,328
And I thought to myself you want maybe maybe he's got a point maybe dating is broke

599
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Right like maybe

600
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
Maybe connecting is broken Beyond just being a young woman talking to a young woman in junior high maybe this is something that if

601
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Text us at all ages

602
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,384
And so we kind of did a handshake deal instead of here working build a company

603
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
And

604
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,736
We formed an incredible partnership where

605
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,344
I was founder and CEO I could build my own team my own Vision my own brand

606
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,696
But we would have access to his resources Beyond just money and that was

607
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,000
Something that was never going to happen

608
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,072
Twice and you didn't know at this point you didn't know what

609
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
That was going to

610
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
No

611
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,216
It's a really wasn't until a couple of weeks later when we brought on you know

612
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
I called

613
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
Crystals in skin ceramic who had work with that Tinder there really

614
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Really Talent

615
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
The designers and you know in order to build a great

616
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Brandon

617
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,808
And product you have to have a great team of designers and so

618
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
I brought them on board they had their own apt

619
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Times that they wanted to come on as consultants and so

620
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,744
Once we were all kind of together I think there was like 10 of us in the room or so

621
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
We're sitting outside in

622
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
Andre said okay so what is this

623
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Product line

624
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
And I said

625
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
I think I have it

626
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
And

627
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
And I said

628
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
I always wanted to

629
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Text the guy first

630
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
I always wanted to go after what I wanted

631
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,296
In terms of if I saw a cute guy in class I always wanted to talk to a guy but I was never allowed to

632
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Because society and my friend said no

633
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
So I said we're going to reverse-engineer this

634
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
And this is how the products going to work

635
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
You're going to mutually match with

636
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Each other but

637
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Women hats

638
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
If 24 hours to do it

639
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,704
Because it would give them you know

640
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Kind of incentive

641
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
And if they don't the Masters

642
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
And

643
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
This will

644
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Change the Dynamics

645
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
This will put the ball in her Court

646
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
For any same-sex matches

647
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
You follow the same rules minus

648
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Women making the fur

649
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Rights of two women match either woman can reach out if two men match either man can reach out however they do so

650
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,328
Still have to follow that you go first in 24 hours and then you follow with

651
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
24 hours

652
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,472
Like completely different from from everything else that was was out there at the time

653
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
Completely

654
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
And he didn't exactly

655
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Dating apps

656
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
I think I imagined

657
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,664
Are most mostly guys are signing up

658
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Well

659
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
My theory at that time was

660
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368
They hadn't been built for women yet

661
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Let's just look at this

662
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
From from the basic

663
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Men are raised

664
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
From very early age

665
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,328
To be the go-getter in a in a heterosexual relationship

666
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Go get her

667
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
GoGo make the move right

668
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
And women on the flip side or trained

669
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
2

670
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Play hard to get

671
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
So sure you're telling men

672
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
To be overly aggressive and hear your telling women

673
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:56,480
To be the inverse of that and so now you're at your training to human beings

674
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
To act in

675
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Opposite directions

676
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,624
And so what you do when you do that is you

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Set both

678
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Upper failure

679
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
You set the man up to be constantly rejected

680
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
And you set the women up to be at risk of

681
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Of aggression

682
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Abuse

683
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Right and so

684
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Here we have this world

685
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,752
The behave this way now add another element which

686
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,312
Does a profile write a digital

687
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Shield

688
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,480
Where you can hide behind a username or profile photo and you don't have to be accountable

689
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
And so

690
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,368
When you when you put women in control you completely reversed

691
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Soaps

692
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
She now

693
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Has

694
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,232
The confidence to go after what she's into

695
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
And the man on the other end doesn't feel rejected he feels flattered

696
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
And then all of a sudden you've balance

697
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
The behavior

698
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,496
So what's the word what are the name bumble

699
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,848
The name bubbles actually really funny so a woman who was

700
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
I really actually a great

701
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
Mentor to me for the first

702
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
A couple of years a bumbler name

703
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Michelle Kennedy

704
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
She named it on a whim one day because it was such a struggle I wanted Bumble to be Moxie Moxie like

705
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
You've got moxie

706
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
You've got courage right

707
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
Because you'd have Moxie you made the first move

708
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
And unfortunately there is a really powerful company that exists somewhere in America

709
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
Trademark

710
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
Every format of the word

711
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
So we couldn't get that and then we were sitting there for weeks oh my gosh it was a disaster we had probably a thousand words in the Run

712
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
And then one morning she said you know

713
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
I think she

714
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,136
Funny enough I think she called her husband a bumbling idiot she's got this really horrible British accent

715
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
She said what about Bumble

716
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
And I said

717
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
No

718
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
Way like ethics Bumble that the Bumble and Bumble the hair product I hate it

719
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:53,728
And then Andre was like bumble bumble I love Bumble and he checked the domain and we could get their domain

720
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,616
It was a miracle like in what world do we get Bumble but we couldn't get Moxie we couldn't get all these other words

721
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
And so

722
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,248
After that I was talking to who she ended up becoming one of my she was mine

723
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Third higher

724
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Her her

725
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
Her family are really close friends of mine

726
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
I was talking to her mom in the kitchen with a k

727
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,024
About Bumble for a nap and she was like oh like be the queen bee of bumble

728
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
Find your honey on Bumble and she

729
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,448
Started throwing out all these really cute slogan I don't like it done cuz I've done perfect branding opportunity

730
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,104
Hives and bees and building your your hive and queen bee the women make the first move

731
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Just perfect.

732
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
So you

733
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
So Andre

734
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,224
Contacts yuan July 2014

735
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,016
If I'm if I timing is right

736
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
You launched

737
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
Bumble by the end of that year

738
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Cracked we worked

739
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,232
Really really hard when you when you first launched it

740
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
Were most people signing up man

741
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Initially

742
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
No no no no

743
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
Even even split how did you

744
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
How did you get people to sign up how did you get the word out about it cuz there's a lots of competition in this place has tons and tons of dating

745
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
How did you

746
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
How are you able to tell people that and get to know

747
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
What to do

748
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Well I kind of had a little bit of a

749
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Play Buckeye it may be done at 1

750
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
So far so

751
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,832
I went right back to SMU this time

752
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,904
Decked out in yellow and

753
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
I went back into all the sororities

754
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,256
And I I spoke from the heart listen

755
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
I have lived

756
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Through

757
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
The pain point

758
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Of

759
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Male-dominated release

760
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
I have

761
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,752
Felt it I know what it feels like and guess what

762
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,312
Every Other Woman in that sorority house

763
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Chances are she's healthy

764
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
So you know I'm speaking from the heart and I'm speaking to them about how they can be empowered and they make the first move and they go after what they want

765
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
Me and my early team members I mean

766
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
There's the girls are at my office right now they're still with us

767
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
We went in there and we

768
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:54,304
A pizza boxes with stickers on it and offered a piece of pizza to the fraternity boys that would get on at we

769
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,376
Wrapped cookies in Bumble stickers we took

770
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
All sorts of goodies and

771
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
We kind of growth hacked our way to

772
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Success

773
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,336
I just jumped out of the story for a sec

774
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Because

775
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
I asked you about this idea that

776
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
That

777
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
Dating apps even even Bumble with

778
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
Your mission or purpose to empower women

779
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
Even an app like bumble

780
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Contributed

781
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
Culturehook

782
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Well

783
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
So here's Within

784
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
If the hookup is taking place

785
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,656
And the woman is empowered and feels comfortable and confident in that

786
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Then I say more power

787
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
2.

788
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,312
You know I don't care what you do on Bumble if you want to

789
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:42,432
You know spend the rest of your life with someone you meet on Bumble phenomenal if you want to hang out with him for only

790
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
A night

791
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,296
But you're going to wake up the next day and you're not going to feel terrible about yourself

792
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
That's what this is

793
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
It's all about it's about reverse

794
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
Engineering

795
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
The Dynamics

796
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
How men and women

797
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Feel

798
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
And Bumble is not just a hookup I mean

799
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
I can't tell you how many emails I get a day about

800
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,704
Bumble weddings Bumble babies double engagements now we're launching bumble bizz

801
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
We have

802
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands if not in the millions of the

803
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
This point of active

804
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
BFF users which are

805
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,504
You know young women matching with other young women kind of in that merci capacity of spoke about earlier

806
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
They're finding roommates

807
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,624
They're going on trips together they're building Social Circles in new cities

808
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
It's really not a dating app anymore

809
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
I rather that that you guys have zero

810
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
There's zero tolerance for sexism

811
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
On Bumble but if

812
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
Two people are communicating on Bumble how do you

813
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Police that how do you enforce

814
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
So that's a great question and it's actually very true

815
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Ricky 1

816
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
I'm so

817
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
We have

818
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Zero tolerance for bad

819
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
Behavior but it requires a little bit of work from our user

820
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
Because we also want to

821
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Respect your privacy

822
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,976
Write however if somebody is in a conversation and someone says something inappropriate

823
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,840
We have very easy reporting tools and once something is reported we do review it

824
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
And if there was bad behavior that user is banned

825
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
Your life there are no Second Chances

826
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,776
We really take it seriously

827
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
If you need us like

828
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Work one click away

829
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Do you ever

830
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,688
Rent any backlash from from yunnan people

831
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Who say

832
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
You know who are offended in some ways

833
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,344
The disempowers women that image is it does it make

834
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Yes

835
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,232
Bumble gets a lot of that you know just last week we became under attack

836
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
From the

837
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
This website called the

838
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
The daily Stormer Anthony

839
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Seaside

840
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
And we had upwards of a hundred men sending a

841
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Rats

842
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
We actually had a

843
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Police at our office all we bow

844
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,800
They're emailing my employees

845
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
Calling my employees calling me

846
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Leaving the most vulgar messages

847
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Because your your self

848
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
Feminist organization

849
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Female empowerment is not something that they

850
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
They believe in unfortunately

851
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
Do you know we get this to that the bullying

852
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:04,256
Now I don't let that doesn't hurt my feelings anymore cuz I know these people are just

853
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Atrocious but

854
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,400
If you lose me the anger fuels me to try harder at work and try and

855
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
And and you know changed

856
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Misogynistic

857
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:21,152
And so now we're putting such an emphasis to get all these people off of our app if there are any we're hoping there's not

858
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
We now have

859
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
A whole new set of moderator is looking for

860
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
Hate symbols and Hate

861
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Speech on our platform

862
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
We're really just trying our best

863
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
To build a clean Safe Community

864
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
It's been 2 and 1/2 years

865
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
You launched

866
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
Cracked and you have how many activities

867
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
20 million registration

868
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
That's I mean that's pretty amazing

869
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
20 million downloads of the app

870
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Since you launched

871
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah and when will you know that you have really

872
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Creativist

873
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
Hugely powerful

874
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,992
Sing when you got a hundred million

875
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
A billion

876
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
I'll never feel like we've made

877
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
We we got to just keep going I am mean

878
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
It's funny I used to say to myself

879
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,256
When we have 1 million we have 5 million when we have 10

880
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,144
And now we're here and I'm like you know what we always need to evolve and be better and try harder and

881
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Have bigger reach-in better region

882
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
Once we have that reach can you start over and do it in a different vertical how much of of your you know of

883
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
Your story

884
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
Through Tinder and Bumble now

885
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
Is lock and how much it is

886
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Scaling

887
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
You don't luck is a funny word I don't

888
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,952
I don't know if I call any of those lucky

889
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Feel

890
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
You know

891
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
I think

892
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
Luck is probably a certain element but if

893
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
People think I just you know

894
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
Was at the right place at the right time and just

895
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,264
Snapped my fingers and World a couple times

896
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Here's bumble

897
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
I mean

898
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
The really wrong this is been

899
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
We're talking all day everyday

900
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Down

901
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Highs lows and

902
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
And Laser

903
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Focus

904
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
So you guys are still

905
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Really young company

906
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Do you

907
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Do you like

908
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Stay up at night

909
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
Worrying about a competitor or somebody else

910
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
Coming in and just

911
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Yelp

912
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Totally replacing you

913
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
We

914
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
Really truly aren't super worried about comp

915
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Petition for 1

916
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
I really believe anybody can copy

917
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Be a product to anyone

918
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,152
I'm at the UT campus

919
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
Speaking to you right now I could go to the engineering school

920
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,064
Probably find five really talented young engineers and they can build bumble

921
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,856
With the right support

922
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Somebody could rebuild any piece of

923
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Technology

924
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Engineering

925
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
However

926
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
You cannot just copy someone's brand and the

927
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Become them

928
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
There has to be

929
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,448
Authenticity when you build a brand and there has to be true purpose

930
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
And so yes

931
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,312
You're right anybody could go and build a

932
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Competitor version of bumble

933
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,688
But where I don't think they can just come in and and

934
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Sweep us off our feet is

935
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
I don't know if there's another group

936
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
People with the exact same

937
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
Story or the exact same

938
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,672
Mission and motive and

939
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
That goes back to what I lived

940
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
True that summer of 2014

941
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
What landed on my phone

942
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,840
Every morning

943
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
And it was

944
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
I almost

945
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Built My

946
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Remedy to

947
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
The the heart

948
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Ship that I personally was

949
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
Bumble safety

950
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
Whitney Wolfe

951
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,736
She founded the dating app bumble

952
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
By the way according to Forbes Magazine

953
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,696
Bumble turn down an acquisition offer of 450 million dollars this past August

954
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
From the match group

955
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:52,096
Match as in match.com which also owns OkCupid

956
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
And tender

957
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472
For the record bubble has never confirm that report put it true

958
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,104
Not bad for a company that's only been around for three years and as for Whitney

959
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
She recently got married

960
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,760
Guess how she met her husband through through bumble

961
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
They met through friends

962
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
And please stick around because in just a moment

963
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912

964
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Your building

965
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
But first I quit thanks to one of our sponsors

Hey thanks

973
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Sticking around

974
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,048
Timeout for how you built that story comes from Michelle Ennis

975
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
San Diego and the problem she said out to solve starts with her husband jacked who likes to go

976
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
Go sport fishing

977
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Weekend

978
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
Comes back so stinky in your house in the evening watching moving until

979
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
Touch me don't touch me because Jack's hands always smell like stinky fish

980
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Not soap not lemon or baking soda get rid of that smell

981
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
So Michelle decided to Tinker around in the kitchen and make her own soap to try and kill them

982
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,168
That fish smell and getting the formula

983
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,568
Wright took months and months Rochelle did come up with a formula which of course is a secret between

984
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
We do know that one key ingredient

985
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:46,272
Is star anise the stuff that smells like licorice neutralizes the fish smell

986
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,112
Magic and so my husband was filleting fish

987
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,440
And I've said try washing up afterwards with this

988
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
You honey dip

989
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Oh my god it works

990
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,168
George is a pretty soon after Michelle started selling her soul would she called D fishing so

991
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,544
At local fishing stores in getting really good feedback I have people come up to me still

992
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
That's a

993
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
You saved our relationship

994
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,968
Michelle ran her small business mainly from the kitchen for about 10 years

995
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,832
But four years ago when a family member got sick she decided to sell it

996
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
We had calls from all kinds of people

997
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
And I don't I don't like them I don't want to sell it to them

998
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,352
Because it was my baby but finally when I met Nate and David

999
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,144
They were the right people

1000
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
My name is David Leon I'm based in Carlsbad California

1001
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
So David and his business partner Nate are both in the fishing

1002
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
And back when the show is advertising on Craigslist to sell her business the two of them had just quit their day jobs to start

1003
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
Or something new or what

1004
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:57,440
But then they saw Michelle's at and they were like this is it this was really interesting

1005
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Down to San Diego to meter

1006
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
We are excited from the business perspective but I think we were been intimidated by the actual making

1007
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Of the Soul

1008
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,800
And initially were looking at this and we're like we're going to have to learn how to make this but once they agreed to buy the business

1009
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,176
Michelle gave them the step by step instructions on how to make the soap in their kitchen and she

1010
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,504
Eat them all her equipment to we loaded all these things up in the Navy

1011
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Track and

1012
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
We going and back it into our place

1013
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
And we start unloading it and these are like big

1014
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
Industrial plastic drums

1015
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
Beakers

1016
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:38,912
Graduated cylinders and I remember telling a time like our neighbors are going to think they were opening a meth lab

1017
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,008
Nobody reported them to the cops and they didn't they started to grow the business

1018
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:47,872
First by selling the soap online and then by pitching it to National retailers

1019
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
I actually flew down to Bentonville Arkansas to meet with a buyer this fire at Walmart managers over half a bill

1020
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
Billion dollars in spend

1021
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,880
And we went in there with some canned salmon

1022
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,720
And we said you got to dig your hands into this and that

1023
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Steppenwolf

1024
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:10,912
In the buyer was impressed or maggots really relieved to get the smell of canned salmon off of his hands in any way

1025
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,520
Now defishing soap is selling at 1200 Walmart across the country

1026
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
David says the business is not a Ramen profitability which means that they're rolling in cash but they are

1027
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
Making enough money to feed themselves

1028
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Ramen

1029
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
The original soap Lady Michelle

1030
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
She's still a cheering them on

1031
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,696
Just left my kids I'm so proud of what they've done
