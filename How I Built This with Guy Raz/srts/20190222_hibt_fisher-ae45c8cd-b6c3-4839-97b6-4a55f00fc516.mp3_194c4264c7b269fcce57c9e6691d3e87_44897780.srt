1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
So today story isn't just about

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,072
Clothing brands

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,352
Mattel huge influence

4
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
Fashion

5
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,400
Business of fashion

6
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
It's

7
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
Silly story about

8
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Overcoming

9
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
Beers and

10
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
Personal insecurities

11
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,592
Biggest back in the early 80s

12
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
Eileen Fisher was

13
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Extremely introverted

14
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
Ethan terrified at the idea of

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
Speaking to buyers and customers

16
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
About her clothes

17
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
How she overcame that

18
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,416
Rico Story is first ran in 2017

19
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Hope you enjoy it

20
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
I was so freaked out the first day

21
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
I literally couldn't speak I just stood there people would ask me questions like how much

22
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
What's the style number and I like Frozen other people in my booth wood

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,576
Would help me out saying no tomorrow so I was like

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
Headlight

25
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
Robin PR

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
How I built this

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Show about innovators entrepreneurs

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Idealist

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Stories

30
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
Interior designer got over her stage fright

31
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
The launch Eileen Fisher

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
A multi-million-dollar clothing company

33
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
For women

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,928
So if you know a little bit about the clothing in this

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
The Giant

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
Especially for women's apparel

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
I Brands like Chanel and

38
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Versace

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Prada and

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
Of course H&M and Zara

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,520
Two given that Eileen Fisher does about 300 million dollars a year in Revenue

42
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
It's comparatively small

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
But in women's fashion

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
The brand is also incredibly influential

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,296
And not just for the designs but how Eileen Fisher started her company

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
To be precise with just

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
$350

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
She never took a dime from outside investor

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,536
And she still owns about 60% of her company

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Her employees

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
On the rest

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,936
Now you seen the clothes you'll know that they're pretty spare and minimalist

53
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
Loki butt

54
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Also elegant

55
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,824
Which is sort of how you might describe Eileen Fisher

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,920
Funny because lately I've been kind of calling my selfish IX

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,576
I think I don't know that I'm wired so much that way I just think that's something

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
I was kind of shut down when I was young

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Classroom remember they were like 60

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Kids in my Catholic school classroom and

61
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
Image it's always safer to

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
To hide and to be small and

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Not speak

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,776
Ellen grew up in a middle-class family in Des Plaines Illinois in the

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
And 60s

66
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Five Sisters

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
And a brother

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Her dad worked

69
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Accountant for a local company in her mom's

70
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
Spent her days at home doing laundry

71
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Cleaning and making dinner for all nine of them

72
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
I think but I mostly remember is my mother

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
You know they're kind of unhappiness I think it was hard

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
Beijing seven children then

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
I think she felt it was her job to do all the hard work

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,472
Oh my dad felt you know his jobs to go to work and make the money in

77
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
Come home and be taken care of after that so

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
She would

79
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Pretty much

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:34,016
We we Scott ranting and raving all day and then my dad would come home and just before my dad would come home she would

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
Get dressed

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Academy already in

83
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Sometimes you can put on lipstick

84
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
End

85
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
I just remember

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
I was about 16 and my mother had a breakdown

87
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,632
And my father said that the next day

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
You driving to work

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
And he had to pull over on the side of the road and he broke down crying realizing that

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
He had thought only a few days before that these are the happiest days of his life

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
But they were happy

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
Let me know there was a lot of Happy

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Moments

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Yeah we played the kids play you know we had the neighborhood

95
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Suburbs and bicycles and

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Reply

97
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
Canik 9mm a good humor truck came down the stairs

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,375

99
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Typical Suburban experience

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Aileen wuornos

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
The college at the

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
University of Illinois in the late 1960s without

103
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Any real idea of what

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
What you wanted to do

105
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Started out as a

106
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
The math major

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
But eventually

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Decided on

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Interior design

110
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
You know I just love fabric

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Coloring

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Playing with the shapes and

113
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
That's my mom for second I had sold with my mother when I was younger

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
So that was some of my

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
Happy memories with my mother

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
I used to have you

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
Pictures in my mind of clothes I wanted to wear

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
We would go shopping

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
I love being the fabric

120
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
My favorite place

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
In her early twenties Eileen moved to New York with a friend

122
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
But with no real plan

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Felt this was 1972 when you

124
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,039
You could actually find an apartment in Manhattan for a hundred bucks a month

125
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
Search parent Eileen started doing some freelance graphic

126
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:21,535
She got a job working with a Japanese graphic designer named Laura

127
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,351
I was an assistant so I started to

128
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Doing whatever needed to be done

129
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
And

130
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
We design logo

131
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
And we designed packages

132
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
Thanks for banks and

133
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Let me get stuff for Japanese clients

134
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Kirin beer and

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Things like that

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
And

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,575
After a short while we were like working together and you know we ended up getting into a relationship

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
She was like

139
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Oh no

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
And were you

141
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
Traveling to go to Japan

142
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Right

143
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,095
Right so this is exactly where the clothing idea came from so

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
Ice that we started traveling

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
We took two trips

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Together two

147
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Japan

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
I'm just trying to match like this is the

149
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
I guess the

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Mid-to-late

151
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
70s

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
1074 flying

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
From New York to do

154
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
Japanimation pretty glamorous writing that was a

155
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Big deal

156
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Yeah I guess

157
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
So

158
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
It was also kind of stressful you know I felt

159
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Pressure and

160
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
You know I couldn't speak the language so

161
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
Tried hard to learn it

162
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,071
So there was glamour yes I guess

163
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
You know

164
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:34,495
But I'm not I don't I'm not so attracted to glamour I am always more uncomfortable with glamour by Sam.

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
Uncomfortable person that's why I had to make you comfortable glow

166
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
What struck you about

167
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
About design

168
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
That you came across in

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
Cheeto

170
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Simple and beautiful

171
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Things were

172
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Temple released

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
And feel like you could

174
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
Really see like with a kimono for example

175
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535

177
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119

00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
They were just

179
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
Do you know use different Fabrics in different techniques to make it

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Different every time and

181
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
And it was beautiful

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Beautiful and

183
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895

184
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943

00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
Some complications was that

194
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
Did that sort of begin to unravel your personal relationship begin to unravel your prefer

195
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
National relationship

196
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
God

197
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,639
Yes definitely it was all connected

198
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
We thought we could split up

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,295
And work continue to work together but that became quite

200
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
Clear Within

201
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
You want that was did not going to work

202
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
But yeah so I ended up

203
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,047
Separating getting my own little Loft eventually after about a year of bouncing around and

204
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
Hang a little space in a loft in

205
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Tribeca and you lived and worked

206
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
Where I lived and worked

207
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,287
And I was stumbling around doing still in a few

208
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
You know some Japanese clients still and then some

209
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Other

210
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
I work I was

211
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
Stumbling around and getting I don't even know how and if I look back

212
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Cuz it was really

213
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Day by day it was

214
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Freelance like

215
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
Apartments I did a few apartments

216
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Small office

217
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Dentist office

218
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Whatever I

219
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Get

220
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
And trying to survive

221
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Pay the rent and you know

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
Keep working as a designer and not go back to

223
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
Working as a waitress at with my one commitment I was going to end up

224
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
Waitressing again I hadn't done that in many years and I can let go back to that

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
And then I met him

226
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,711
People and that's when

227
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
I thought I had been kind of cooking on this idea

228
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Of the

229
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Now the clothing business and cooking on the side

230
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Already in the early 80s

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Oh yeah

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,887
It was it was in my mind for probably five years before the first garments appeared to make your own clothes

233
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Find clothes that was in your mind

234
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
Right to try and design clothes where did that idea come from

235
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
I don't know I think some of it was at when I was trying to get dressed

236
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
Let me know the Japanese clients and you know the different I want it I need it too

237
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,343
Look like a designer and what does that mean

238
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
You know

239
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
Put together and no no

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,143
Clean and elegant and simple I wanted to reflect my own style of my own aesthetic

241
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
And I wore uniform when I was young

242
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
And

243
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,799
Let's go to Catholic school and so when I

244
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
Trying to get dressed as a designer

245
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
I kind of

246
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
I never really liked the uniform but I

247
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Like the concert

248
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Simple just shut up and

249
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Have enough to think about you enough to worry about

250
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Skip put the clothes on go and I'll

251
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
I wanted to make a

252
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
It's simple but I didn't want it to be so confined that it had to be exactly

253
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Like you know the uniform

254
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Or in one only one

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Particular

256
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Shape and I want to buy the same thing everyday and I just had this idea that I could make these simple clothes no one's really do

257
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Doing it and

258
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
The images would come to me I would see this simple shapes

259
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
And the first one I remember was I called a box

260
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Stop

261
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
White straight lines like a kimono sleeve and

262
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
It was about the way

263
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Drape when you had it on

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,279
That was kind of the first picture that came to me and others were

265
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
You know the simple

266
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Wide leg pants and you know there was a vast in a shell and the first few pieces of the star to come to me

267
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
I was talking to people cuz now I had artists

268
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
Best friends in Tribeca and

269
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,199
Other people who were designing clothes and jewelry and things like that

270
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Which often happens when people have an idea

271
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
You were saying have this idea

272
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
To design these

273
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Beautiful simple

274
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
Piece of clothing for women and and we're your friends think you should go for you

275
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
Definitely and you would have these conversations for

276
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
You know

277
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
For a long time with many people like

278
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Over a period of 5 years

279
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
Obsessed

280
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
This is what I'm curious about

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Because

282
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
This is the point at which

283
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
99.9

284
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
People

285
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Do nothing

286
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
But they have a great idea

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
And

288
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,903
They do nothing either because they decide not to do something or

289
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Just because of

290
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Bad luck

291
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
What was that

292
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
That

293
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Switch that idea into something

294
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Actually tried

295
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Okay that's good

296
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
So

297
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
I think

298
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,799
What happened is that I'm so I'm seeing these pictures and I'm trying to imagine Where do I

299
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
And how would I make this

300
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Happened

301
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
And I couldn't picture myself you know

302
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,087
Like what if I made these clothes how would I do that and went and then I couldn't picture myself how would I sell them

303
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,183
You know what I go to stores other people telling me they were going to like

304
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Henri Bendel and waiting in line for hours and by we go like nope

305
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,119
I don't like it if you did not have that was not you you were not a

306
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
You're not a hustler now

307
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
No I was a shy

308
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,543
Interpret the time

309
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
But I knew I couldn't have definitely not hustler and I could not have done that idea

310
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,063
What what what do you think it was the would have been the hardest

311
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Part of that

312
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Rejection semi saying no or

313
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Trying to articulate

314
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
What what it was

315
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Both

316
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Both I think

317
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Probably it was still rejected

318
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
The time in oh

319
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
But articulating

320
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Was and still is

321
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
What kind of

322
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Initial for me

323
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
To thinking today about trying to tell story

324
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
So you're thinking

325
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Alright I

326
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Try this but I

327
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
I cannot even imagine what I would do after

328
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
I would have liked a sample of this

329
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,047
Until what ended up happening is that a friend who took me to the boutique show

330
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
And

331
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Famous show in the goat

332
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
It's at Rachel

333
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Inn in York

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Right

335
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,567
But it was a show Big Show that cater to the small boutiques around the country

336
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,431
And a lot of small designers and small companies would come there and show their things

337
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,247
And so I remember going to the show

338
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
Just out of curiosity kind of

339
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
Anti floating through and going like oh

340
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
I can do this

341
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
I see how to do this

342
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,863
I could just look at these different foods and saw how the designers were presenting their clothes

343
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
A little rack here a few things hanging

344
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,311
You know I know how to do a logo I could do they had I need a logo wouldn't I need to name you know

345
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
So I could picture

346
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
The whole story so it wasn't just like one garment

347
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
It was that I had to

348
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
People have to see it kind of ahold understand that it went together

349
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,415
And that it was a a little story somehow a 10in by going to the design

350
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Show you

351
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
You thought well

352
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
I don't have to be Carnival Barker I can

353
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
Just stand here wait for people to come to me the people who liked it

354
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Will come in

355
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
Write orders or you know

356
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
Give me feedback and the people who don't like it'll just walked by

357
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Committed to

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
Small section just like a one

359
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
4

360
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
4

361
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
The same

362
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
For the next show

363
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
This is in like 1980

364
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
380

365
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
3 because I think

366
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Or that I

367
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
At the show that I first introduced

368
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
You said I'm going to go there and

369
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
I want to go there and then I'm going to

370
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
Show my clothes right

371
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
I know fabric style that nothing you had designs pictures in my mind

372
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
How much time do you have

373
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
3 weeks

374
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
You would read weeks to come up with a

375
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
Clothing line of fashion line

376
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,159
No don't get carried away now it wasn't really a special line at the start out with for garments

377
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
But I had

378
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
So now you know as a kid so I knew

379
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
You know that wasn't that,

380
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
But I was lucky in that this is how it this is

381
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Kind of weird how things

382
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Happened but

383
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,287
You know again one of the friends I've been talking to said I have a friend

384
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Cuz patternmaker she works in a

385
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Clothing company

386
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Maybe she can help you

387
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
So she came into work for me at night and on the weekends

388
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
The first three weeks this this woman

389
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Volunteer

390
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,391
And she wouldn't will she said you can pay me I know you're going to your good for you can pay me

391
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
When you get paid

392
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
Did you draw bunch of

393
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
Designs and give them to her

394
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Tissot

395
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Or did you sell them well

396
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,679
I pretty much talked my way through it I scribbled them you know my little sketches and she said what

397
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,079
What's special about the Miley and I was like well it's special that they're simple

398
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
But I'll help you

399
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
And so first I had to find fabric

400
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
I was kind of the

401
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Lange & sohne

402
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
She helped me

403
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
No figure out where I could go to get Fab

404
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
It was a linen and cotton blend

405
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
Yeah so what did you what did you end up making

406
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
I made the Box

407
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Top

408
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
The little crop

409
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Hand

410
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Kind of based on the flood pants from Japan

411
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
And I made a little

412
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
Shell and that's the kind of went over

413
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
The

414
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
Top and then I made a little shelter

415
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
I could wear it just a shell with a simple pant oh my God these are like the pieces on my line today it's so amazing to just see the pictures

416
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
What color what colors were they

417
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
They were like a teal color and kind of

418
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Burgundy

419
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
Nike white burgundy salmon need pinky right now

420
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
Ana ivory

421
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
So after 3 weeks you had

422
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
4

423
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Piece of clothing

424
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Samples

425
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
And that's what you were going to take to this trade show

426
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
I will email them into three colors

427
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
So I had 12 piece

428
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
And that's what I took

429
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
With my little logo

430
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
And I was I spent probably as much time obsessing about the graphics and the name because I didn't want to call it I'm in fish

431
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
White why not

432
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
Because I didn't see it as a personal

433
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
I thought it was something that

434
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
You know

435
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
People would make their own

436
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
That it would

437
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
I hope that it wasn't so personally me it was

438
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Change

439
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
What's up what did you end up calling it

440
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
So I called cuz I couldn't think of anything else and I was working as Eileen Fisher the designer so

441
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,735
I already had my name registered as a business so I guess if I was going to take checks

442
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Better having business name and so that

443
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
I worked for them

444
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
So like when they

445
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,159
Willie McGee the Eileen Fisher Story movie

446
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
Feature film one day and they have this scene in there

447
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
First trade show

448
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Is this like this

449
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,375
Amazing moment with designers

450
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Oh my gosh this is life

451
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,799
I've never seen anything like it is that what was going on no no no no no no

452
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Absolutely not

453
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
I was so

454
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Freaked out

455
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
The first

456
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
I literally couldn't

457
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
I just said

458
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
People would ask me questions like

459
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
How much does it cost

460
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
What's the style number

461
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
And I like

462
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Frozen

463
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Other people in my booth would help me out saying no

464
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
Tomorrow

465
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
I just want to give you a hug and say it's going to be okay I'll be okay

466
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
This is like

467
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
I was like

468
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Deer in headlights

469
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,127
She said did you eventually get over the stage frightened and

470
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Start selling

471
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
I did I did I saw it still 208 stores

472
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
I felt about a hundred pieces

473
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
So couple thousand bucks

474
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Yep 3000

475
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,487
I was thrilled

476
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
And it was the right amount because anymore I would have never been able to deliver

477
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
I would have been able to get enough fabric I would have been able to figure it all out

478
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Fast enough or get the money to make it happen

479
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,079
So that was a pretty good that was pretty good you walk away $3,000 and

480
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
These are boutiques around the country

481
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Right

482
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
And

483
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Fill those orders

484
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
You made most of them

485
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Yourself

486
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
Cut everyone myself on the floor in my loft

487
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Tribeca

488
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
And then carry them in garbage bags

489
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
Down my stairs on

490
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Subway In-N-Out

491
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
The Queen's did you show your name Eileen Fisher in the

492
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Act like a nut

493
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,263
Close the label I hadn't a label made that the source te

494
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055

Out in Queens

496
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Seldom

497
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
So at this point this is like 1984

498
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
You got 3005

499
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
X-end

00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271

Stuff

503
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Oh

504
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
I don't think I did that until

505
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
I got my neck

506
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Around the Border

507
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
So how did that

508
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Well I came up with

509
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
8 Style

510
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119

512
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
And this time I had the

513
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
New fabric that I found it was a

514
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
Very textural

515
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823

519
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599

520
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
Came back with

521
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Read

528
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,423

They want

567

Al.com

571
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,464
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

572
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Gyros

573
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
In the story

574
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Eileen head

575
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Just sold

576
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
$40,000 worth

577
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Orders in her second trade show

578
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
And things seem to be looking up

579
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Only problem was

580
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
Now I have to figure out how to put

581
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
Put together a real functioning business

582
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
But I was even for the back figuring out just how do I get the money

583
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
To buy the fabric

584
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
And

585
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
You know

586
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
You know how am I going to produce this you had

587
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Either $40,000

588
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Supporters but not $40,000 in cash

589
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
I just made the order

590
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,096
And you had to go and buy all of the material

591
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
You didn't have $40,000

592
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,496
Right well I would have needed about 20 to do the production

593
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
And

594
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
But I got some good advice actually while I was at the boutique show

595
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
But I deliver

596
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Small order first so I did

597
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,016
White just for like them February delivery and then I did

598
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,600
The other colors for every couple months later so that let me

599
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Spread out the delivery in

600
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,720
I could produce part of it while I was trying to turn the money

601
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
I did the orders on COD so then when they

602
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
Delivered

603
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,656
Boutiques with write a check and they had to pay right away to pay right away and

604
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,520
You know at the show when they were standing line was kind of easy to ask him to do code while because I have

605
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,568
How to play with them I'm a small designer need

606
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
Pcod and I were

607
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Accommodated me

608
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,968
But did you want to try to get a loan at a bank

609
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
I tried and

610
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,416
You know I went to the bank I remember and I with my stack of orders then they were like well how long he been in business

611
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
They just looked at you and they're like you have no tracker

612
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,120
How do you get a job you do that then

613
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,680
Right place at the first thing that person of the banks of witches

614

How do you know the reason real orders

616
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,568
I know this check credit on that order

617
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
Okay now I'm done that

618
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,504
That's a good idea what it what does that mean how do I do that

619

Well

623
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:43,264
Was I nervous even during the days when I was trying to make this come together no

624
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,872
No no I wasn't nervous then I was nervous at the show I was never wanted to present myself

625
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408

Another paid me up front and I could deliver

633
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Things like that anything you had to do

634
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
Puzzle making kind of fun

635
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520

00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Grambling day-by-day

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
Say I've this is real

651
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
I just going to trade shows

652
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,016
This is a company I need to hire somebody

653
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Well

654
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,952
I hired my first official employee that was Siggy who still works for the company today

655
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,048
And I don't remember thinking I'm a real business or anything

656
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,608
I just remember thinking I need help I really need some

657
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Stable

658
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Help and

659
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,776
Did you start to go to department stores and and do the thing that you were mortified

660
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
To do earlier in your hand

661
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,152
Design career no I never did that but eventually opened

662
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Store Madison Avenue

663
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
And

664
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Byers

665
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
From the Department Stores would come

666
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
So you open this

667
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
The store on Madison Avenue in

668
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
291

669
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
And how to do

670
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Really well

671
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Again similar

672
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Variants to that

673
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Boutique shower

674
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
You know people just

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
Ben leinbach clothes and stacks of closing

676
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,216
It was so delighted to find a store

677
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:56,128
I remember that's when he was a buyer somebody from Bloomingdale's came in because I've been looking at the line.

678
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,528
And they would say things like you know great clothes but you know they're just going to get lost

679
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Bloomingdale's

680
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
And

681
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
Simple

682
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
Simple you know

683
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,000
But I knew that was the idea that

684
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,120
Anyway so when they came into the store they knew

685
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
They didn't understand it but they knew something was happening

686
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
And so they wanted to

687
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Open the shop smoke shop

688
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
Yes it was a kind of I think that

689
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
Catapulted us to another face

690
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,944
Who are your customers were they

691
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,040
What was a certain type of woman was it a certain age was it a certain

692
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Profession

693
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Yeah that really pays out

694
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Describe the most

695
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Artist

696
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Therapist and teacher

697
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
And

698
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,536
Seems like they were people who

699
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
You know I used to say they

700
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
They help people find themselves something like that you know

701
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,984
That are that they could figure out how to

702
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
Make your own style with these

703
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Clothes and they

704
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
They operate in the in or not in such a

705
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Corporate world they can have two dresses

706
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Certain kind of way

707
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
Were you able to finance

708
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
The stores

709
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
And

710
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
The production just threw

711
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Existing sales

712
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes and know how we found we were able to get a line of credit

713
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
Cuz we we bought Fabric in bulk even though we were small because we I was very dead

714
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Educated to a certain Fabrics sewing

715
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,984
Built around 1 Fabric and then I

716
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,336
I had my brother-in-law can was helping me and he got me a small light line of credit

717
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
$50,000 line of credit

718
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
Then I got a new accountant 2

719
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
You know help me to happen to the banks and how you had to put business plans

720
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Gathering

721
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
It was a combination of credit lines and loans and

722
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
UNICEF funding because it was growing and it was

723
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
It was always profitable

724
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
From there were you

725
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
I mean what's the cross

726
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Just

727
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Off the charts

728
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Who's that

729
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
What's happening

730
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
You know it was

731
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
Come strong and steady and I know it was

732
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
Not exactly off the charts

733
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
But it was exciting and sometimes it felt like you know like

734
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,576
Horses and a carrot like an out-of-control Hilton Hotel you know like he was pulling me somehow

735
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
No

736
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Mosto

737
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
It wasn't

738
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
2 out of control

739
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:23,584
You know it was mostly organic there was never like an attempt to make it ever bigger than it was

740
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
It was more like okay

741
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,008
It's working so that's open to more stores or it's working so it's open for more store

742
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
You know or now you know

743
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,896
No other department stores want to buy the line

744
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,224
Saks and Nordstrom's and you know

745
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
That kind of thing

746
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
What was your Revenue with that

747
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Oh

748
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
Different moments in time how much

749
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,024
I can't remember I remember my dad came to visit me one time in the early days any

750
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,120
Set back in the chair he was in the county of going over some of my books you want to make sure I was

751
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
Campaign things are working out okay without adorable

752
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
And he sat back in the cherries

753
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
Do you know how much money you made last

754
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Here

755
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
And I said no I had

756
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,712
You said $200,000

757
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Gross sales of course and are plenty of expenses

758
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
But you know

759
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Was still

760
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Pretty

761
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
Pretty shocking

762
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,048
How did you I mean as the company was growing in the 1990s

763
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
How did you

764
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Deal with

765
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
Being a CEO did you

766
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,776
Did you like that no no no no no

767
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
No I think

768
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
CEO is

769
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
A word that I've always

770
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
I am always been sort of uncomfortable

771
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
I'm not actually

772
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,552
Helmet I'll used to call myself Chief creative officer that was sort of the closest

773
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,392
I could come but I did know that sort of the Buck stop with me

774
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Yeah sometimes I had to make important decisions

775
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,000
How much work would have been would be hard

776
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
But I always kind of help

777
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
Business Insider leadership standpoint pretty

778
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
Pretty loosely

779
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
And so I like the designers

780
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Being with it and making it

781
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
You know

782
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:11,616
Their own and working together and you know in the end of sort of collective way

783
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
And I feel that way about the leadership and even today were leadership team is pretty complicated

784
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,880
Then we're really working to streamline it and we're getting better we're getting a lot better

785
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
Period of time when you really mean

786
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Really just start

787
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
Exploding

788
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Yeah

789
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,120
Did you find yourself in a position

790
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,168
That you were reluctant to be in

791
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Yeah

792
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:45,920
I saw myself more than designer artist rather than a business person even though I wasn't bad at it

793
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
In terms of

794
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
Maybe not so much the managing people

795
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
I guess I never liked

796
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
Telling people what to do

797
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
I

798
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
I ate and I never liked working

799
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
For other people

800
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,280
Oh you know when they would try to tell you what to do it didn't

801
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,632
I didn't like being told I like give me the problem and let me do it my way kind of thing

802
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Ellen DeGeneres

803
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
I mean I know that

804
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
In the 90s

805
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
It was a

806
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Incredibly

807
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Active time

808
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
For Eileen Fisher

809
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
Continue and also personally me you were

810
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
You been married

811
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Two children in a in a

812
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
4 year

813
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:29,696
Period of time to young kids you are trying to run this company and

814
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Your marriage was

815
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm falling

816
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
Part 2

817
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
How did you

818
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
You manage the personal on the

819
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
I would say that wasn't the hardest

820
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
Hardest ever and if I look back

821
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,128
Man if I could do anything differently that be now I'm not not going into regret by

822
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
That was incredibly hard

823
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,064
God I think about all the women out there trying to start businesses and work in the business world and

824
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
How hard it is to manage families

825
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,976
So I really had to rely on

826
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
People

827
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
In company

828
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,144
I tried to again no sort of lead Loosely in just

829
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
But I struggled a lot with

830
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,568
Being in two different places and wanting to be at work when I was at home or worrying about work

831
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,200
You know I'm reading reports and try to understand us working or not what's working and what's going wrong

832
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,552
And at the same time worrying about my kids when I was at work and just

833
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
You know I guess the

834
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Nothing I say to myself now is that

835
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
If I look back I would

836
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,512
I would have just worked harder and being where I was

837
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,328
Doing what I was doing in the moment

838
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Stop tryna

839
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
B2 place

840
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
And stop taking the work home and do the best

841
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Canon

842
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
You going to be the best

843
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Mom you could be

844
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
And also run the company

845
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Anna

846
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
You

847
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,432
MSI mean it it it it

848
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Kind of sounds about like

849
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
What your mama

850
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Overwhelmed

851
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Right I mean she was

852
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,904
Everyday was his hamster wheel

853
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
Yeah

854
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,816
I did the best I could I I had to let go a lot of had to

855
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Trust a lot of people

856
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Which Wich work

857
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
And didn't

858
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
Do you know it worked in places

859
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
And then they were moments that I felt

860
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,616
You know sad about her let go too much over here when

861
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,640
I know

862
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,224
Going to a store and see pieces I didn't recognize or feel like

863
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
The line didn't look where I adore

864
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,600
I couldn't find the clothes I wanted to wear or wasn't really

865
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:39,744
The concept was gone where was the stall of this company and you know what happened and

866
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Yeah

867
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
You know

868
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Once I got divorced it was

869
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
The kids were four and eight and I said I am

870
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
I'm going to stop working on Wednesday Thursday Friday

871
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
I worked in my home a lot and I would

872
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
And I'll let the people keep working at

873
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
Close the door and go in and out and be with my kids

874
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
And

875
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,296
You know my husband will have the kids on Mondays and Tuesdays

876
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
Share the weekend things like that

877
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
So actually

878
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:14,816
Work better for me I don't think it worked so well for them they didn't really like the going back and forth stuff and then

879
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
I guess kids never like divorce

880
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,632
Yeah

881
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,472
But I think that I know overtime I sorted it out and

882
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
Things got better I got I got stronger I I started

883
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
Doing things like yoga and meditating I had some time to myself

884
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
My mother never had you know

885
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
I can have to have a breakdown actually it's a

886
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
To get a hold of myself

887
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Eileen where you

888
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Cuz your business was

889
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
I just bought are huge like you were

890
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Successful

891
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,304
Beyond Your Wildest Dreams the late 90s

892
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Today and

893
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
Did you ever think maybe I should just

894
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Cash it in and sells company of somebody into

895
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Wash my hands of it

896
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:03,200
Oh my God no I never never thought that never thought never crossed your mind that would be like selling

897
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:08,320
My first born child is this really felt like that

898
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,624
You did have that security like

899
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
You could have done that

900
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
Alright was never about the money no

901
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
I mean

902
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,816
Probably in the very beginning when I didn't know how to price the clothes wasn't about the money by

903
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:25,472
It was personal I guess I wanted it to be how I wanted it to be and I think it's still true

904
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,824
And actually what I did do was sell part of the business of employees

905
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
So we are 40% an ESOP employee owned

906
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
And I always wanted that

907
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
Collective idea wanted

908
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,808
I wanted to people who are a part of it too

909
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,136
Paid and feel like owners and be owners

910
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952

931
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888

939
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Write a book called how I became Island

00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Southern like

941
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
It's just strange

942
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
I keep singing

943
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
I like I keep thinking of your dad

00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,816
Coming to visit you in New York

945
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Senior liaison saying

And I like looking through your books and saying

947
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
You guys made 200

948
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
$1,000 last year just being so

949
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Blown Away by that

950
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
Eileen Fisher does

951
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
Hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue

952
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
A year

953
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
I mean

954
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,320
Is it strange

955
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
To you that

956
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
You

957
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:24,768
Became Rich even though you'd never wanted to or tribe that wasn't your intention

958
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Oh yes

959
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:30,912
I feel very uncomfortable with that that's something that I have to adjust my working therapy on

960
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
Because you grew up with like

961
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
7 children your house

962
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
This matter

963
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,200
Middle-class oh yeah I put myself through college no my father said no

964
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,808
I don't need to go to school so he and I like that your parents ever see

965
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
This level of success

966
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Yeah my mother did

967
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,024
My father was utterly totally impressed by 2 and $1,000 instantly Spanish

968
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,608
But my mother did I don't know that she understood

969
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Did it quiet

970
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,752
You know my sister is at work in the store out in the Midwest and so should go in there

971
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,800
She's so adorable she would go in and

972
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,104
Even as the company got really big and cheap

973
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,944
Damages we have a section of Damages that would sell in the back of

974
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Duarte

975
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,552
And she'd go to the back of store and pick out those damn today

976
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,672
Take them take them home and 66th

977
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,208
Put on the main rack

978
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
But I think to her you know

979
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,376
How it could have been 200,000 would have been nobody

980
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Hitman

981
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
How much to her

982
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
You know

983
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,520
It sounds like you are

984
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
And in a pretty good place in life

985
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Personally

986
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Assertive

987
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
You don't have to do this

988
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,296
Logistical operational stuff of the company you have

989
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
Can I have like fission and

990
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,392
Big picture stuff and

991
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
You seem like

992
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
You're really happy

993
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Yeah well

994
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
You know

995
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
Not everyday not all the time

996
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
But I

997
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
I know how to work with it

998
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
Now watch my mother she was depressed

999
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
And you know

1000
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,104
I remember having this inside even before I started the business

1001
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
When I went through a kind of a dark moment in my late twenties

1002
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,760
I remember going you know having this Revelation that

1003
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
I can make a different choice

1004
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,344
I don't have to be depressed

1005
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
Just because my mother was

1006
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,720
I might have to be overwhelmed because my mother was overwhelmed but I don't have to be the prince

1007
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,352
I didn't I didn't understand the full impact of the different choices they had to make but I realized

1008
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
That I could choose

1009
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,984
And it doesn't mean it doesn't get the better of me some days but

1010
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
I also know it doesn't last long

1011
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
So I would say

1012
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,200
Happy I'm happy I'm also really sad sometimes I'm also really

1013
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,576
You know scared like before I came in here today I'm really anxious I'm really

1014
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Excited I'm really

1015
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
More feelings than probably ever in my life

1016
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,464
I love that

1017
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
You

1018
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
Is everybody listening to this

1019
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Going to say

1020
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Eileen Fisher

1021
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
Future successful

1022
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
Creatives amazing company and brand

1023
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496

1024
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,312
You know made it beyond our wildest dreams and yet

1025
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,616
She has bad days she gets out

1026
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,944
Absolutely absolutely I think what's different

1027
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Is now I know that

1028
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
And I can

1029
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
I can look at it and I can just

1030
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Be with that

1031
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,624
So if I'm anxious I can just say I'm anxious

1032
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
And it's okay

1033
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,952
You know I don't have to try to

1034
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,976
Pretend I'm not

1035
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
I can just

1036
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Be who I am

1037
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

1064
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
I know for how you built

1065
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
And today were

1066
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:45,119
Updating a story we ran over a year ago my name is Glen

1067
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,423
And I'm in Minneapolis Minnesota

1068
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
And I've created a nice mug

1069
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
In the idea for nice mug came about

1070
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
Totally by accident

1071
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,895
It was on one of those freezing winter Mornings in Minnesota

1072
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Outside

1073
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Backyard

1074
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,855
And pick up a jug of water that had frozen over night nature freezes water in a jug from the house

1075
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
Outside in and from the bottom up

1076
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
So you get kind of a hockey puck

1077
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,095
Type freeze at the bottom but there's this really interesting cavity that freezes last

1078
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,143
And that's an iconic shape

1079
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
And that shape was a glass like a

1080
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,519
What kind of glass you would put on your dinner table perfectly formed

1081
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Made of clear ice

1082
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Sobini

1083
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,711
Resourceful people that we hire with a beer in our hand we poured a beer in a nice mug was born

1084
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,063
I mean can you say USA any more clearly than a

1085
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Cold beer in a glass made of ice

1086
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:44,767
Anyway the first thing Glen did naturally was to take the ice mug into his backyard sauna

1087
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
It held up

1088
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,863
Pretty well until you know it melted

1089
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:54,495
So then I started messing around with different molds and different ways that we could freeze ice

1090
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
So I experimented Glenn came up with a plastic mold

1091
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
Seemed to do the trick

1092
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
But it was a massive challenge for me

1093
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
To make clear ice

1094
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
And without clear ice you get leaks and leaks are no fun

1095
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,903
The leaks actually come from air bubbles in the ice and

1096
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
Concord 4 years

1097
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
To come up with a mold that

1098
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
Would make a mug without the bubbles

1099
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,887
And finally he mailed it but never leaks and I'm really proud of that

1100
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:27,263
The way Glenn mold works is pretty simple fill it with water freeze it overnight then

1101
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
How about your own ice mug

1102
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
He's no selling molds all over the country

1103
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
And just a couple years ago

1104
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Some Executives at Coca-Cola in Egypt

1105
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Actually called them up and said

1106
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,063
Hate we want to use nice mugs in one of our ads

1107
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,647
Yeah it's quite a rush you know the biggest Beverage Company in the world

1108
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,999
Make it nice mugs putting Coca-Cola in there we just had a great time

1109
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Business has

1110
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
Tripled since we last spoke with Glenn

1111
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
