16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,672
Eventually changing the way Americans eat out

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
So a past 10 or 15 years

18
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
You might have noticed a trend

19
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
At restaurants all across the u.s.

20
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,568
Where you get there the waiter says okay here's how it works everybody orders

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
One or two or three plates and you all shared family style

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
And you know of some octopus or some shrimp floating olive oil and Sublime whatever

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
The person who

24
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
Most responsible for that trend is the Spanish celebrity chef

25
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
Jose Andres he basically started the small plates movement in the US

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
And his company thinkfoodgroup now has

27
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
25 restaurant

28
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Cross the country in place

29
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,288
La Miami Vegas and here in Washington DC

30
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,128
Jose grew up in Barcelona when he was a kid

31
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
He was fascinated with food

32
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
My father probably

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
Is the one that helped me to understand the meaning of being a cook

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
My father would always cook on Sundays for families from Friends

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
He would make a big paella.

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Traditional Spanish

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Rice

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
He will never let me cook

39
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
She would always put me in charge of making the fire

40
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
He will send me through the forest

41
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
To pick up the wood

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
One day you got upset when it cool, he said

43
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
No I need you in charge of the fire der important

44
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Echoswap said we came you send me away

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
When the buyer was finished and he fed everybody

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
She's going in the sides and told me

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
My son I thought that you understood

48
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
I gave you the most important task

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Cooking

50
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
It's out it's easy

51
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
If somebody is controlling the fire

52
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
You want to be a great cook

53
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Be in charge of the fire

54
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
Then you will be able to cook whatever you want

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
That was a big lesson

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
So your kid and you decide this is what I'm going to do I'm going to become a chef I was not very good at school

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
Very difficult time concentrating

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
And I went to cooking school I never graduated they gave me the diploma last year

59
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,400
Almost 30 years later

60
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
I know how you felt cooking English

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Unaccounted cooking English Anaconda

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
That was amazing

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
And then I will always be working

64
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Formulas not working

65
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
For me I was like a little kid

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
In the kitchen for me was like

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
If I was a little Wizard and I was

68
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
You know in this Castle in this Tower were

69
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,423
The Witch of the the master wizard was there trying to teach me I was that kind of a guy

00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,007

71
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311

And so wherever there's a kitchen you would go I will be there so

75
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
I was working in very high end restaurants for lunch

76
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,695
I was doing catering for thousands of people at dinner

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
But always doing something during summer

78
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
I was very lucky

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
Because I feel I always had somebody

80
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Looking at

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Almond milk

191
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Everybody knows that

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
A gelatin is good when it's called if he's hot

193
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Mounts

194
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775

195
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Of hot oil

196
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079

The yellow Tina fountain

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
He began looking at the oil

201
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
I could see that he was thinking about dropping

202
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Almond milk

203
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,975
The cooks in the kitchen we were five of the time we were quickly looking at each other

204
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
He's going to do it he's going to do it

205
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Why he's going to do it

206
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,399
This is going to be bought everybody knows if you put that all gelatin in hot oil is going to melt

207
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Annie's going to explode

208
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Well

209
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
In that moment the Alamo

00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
Going into the hot oil

211
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
12 years later

212
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
He created

213
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
The liquid

214
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Trokita

215
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
The jewel put in your mouth will be like a traditional croqueta

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
The flavor of chicken

00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
I'm will explode in your mouth

218
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
But that was a message

219
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
Of who Ferran Adria was the message was

220
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Don't be afraid of trying

221
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
And don't take things for granted

222
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
You have two Spirits undiscovered things in your own

223
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799

226
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
You need

00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Honda Fury

That's a Moment of Truth learning

231
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415

Well in between working out there but I was in the military service

00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
You have to know no but in the old days

Hobbies

243

In the south of Spain

244
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783

Dancing Flamingo and drinking Sherry and living the life of a young sailor

249
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
I finished my military service and I was like

250
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Because I am without the job

251
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
I have no place to go back to

252
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,543
Then I call I make one phone call one of my teachers

253
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
He tells me

254
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615

255
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663

I'm ready

260
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,927
What did you think of New York was it overwhelming

261
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
Well that rival was very amazing because it look like very strange place

262
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
These New York that you see in

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Movies like voice Gotham

264
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
Where this smoke is coming in ahead

265
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Every street

266
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
So

267
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
I had like 50 bucks in my pocket I was going to 50th Street

268
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
Between Lexington and 3rd

269
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039

271
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,839
Qunar

272
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,191
2 hours to make it there how is the restaurant

273
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
The restroom was called Paris Barcelona that was a chain

274
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
This was right before the Olympic Games

275
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
1992

276
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Barcelona

277
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,247
On every Spanish company and especially Catalan company

278
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
They all wanted to be

279
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
America

280
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
They wanted to be in New York

281
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
So you're working in this restaurant and

282
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
And I mean did you like it was

283
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Interesting

284
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
No sew so I arrive there

285
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Very quickly I realized that

286
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Not the place

287
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
I was aiming for

288
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Coming from a boogie

289
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
So I told him I was leaving

290
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
I get a phone call from Chicago

291
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
The Great Richard Melman

292
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
One of the legendary restaurateurs of America

293
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Week hundreds of restaurants

294
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
I met him

295
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,343
And he tells me Jose I don't know what you will do in life

296
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
But whatever you do

297
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Throw the anchor

298
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511

300
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
To belong

301
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
In that moment I received this phone call from Washington DC

302
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
I have these opportunities

303
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
I come to Washington DC I met my partner

What are they want you to do

307
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
They were dreaming

308
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,015
Open a Spanish restaurant on London

309
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
We the aim of hoping in the hollow

310
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
Around January 1993

311
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
Okay now Jose we should pause here and Mensch cuz we're in DC

312
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
And I have been here long time

313
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
This is like 1993-94 like at that time

314
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,079
People did not really know what Spanish food was there wasn't common food in America so how did you

315
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
How did you know that you could actually

316
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Create a market for that

317
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
Toposar

318
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015

319
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
More than a type of

320
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Foot

321
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,415
Tapas in Spain in Seville you go with your friends in a bar

322
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
You don't see it

323
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,071
You are always standing up and you have one beer one to his next and you move to the next one

324
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Obviously I cannot come

325
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191

I'm where we were

333
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Really telling people

334
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903

And now

391
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
It's how I built this from NPR

392
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Gyros

393
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
So it's the early 1990s

394
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
San Jose Andres

395
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Has opened a new Tapas restaurant

396
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Washington D

397
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
DC his very first and

398
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
Well

399
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Except some of his diners

400
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Don't really want to share their food

401
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
And I always

402
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
Gave this answer which is very truth is like

403
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,967
I do believe that for tonight work invented and created no for eating or they were invented

404
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
To protect

405
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Hiplet

406
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,879
Trump anybody take away your plates from you as we became more civilized

407
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
We began using forks and knives really tweet

408
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
You said to put that thing

409
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Our territory

410
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
But I always tell people that

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Tapas versus not opposites only

412
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
20 inches

413
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
Yeah you want to go Tapas you put the plate in the middle of the table

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Can people know that that's the signal to share

415
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
If you don't want to do Tapas people

416
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
Multiply 20 in

417
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Shoe

418
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Ratio for Chrysler knife

419
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,271
And everybody would know that you were the one to share

420
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
That was my simple solution

421
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
To make sure that even those people not

422
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
I like him the sharing

423
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
I will be comfortable in a place like heaven

424
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,839
At this point you are still I guess in your in your early twenties so how did you

425
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
How did you handle being the head chef

426
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
When I open a learn

427
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
On that day was ill-prepared to be that

428
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Singapore

429
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
I'm barely I'm 23

430
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
I've working very high end restaurants

431
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
It's where we don't do necessarily volume

432
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
And we aim for

433
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Prestige

434
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Another 7 I'm coming to Oakland

435
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
These Tapas Spanish restaurant

436
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
When I really never managed a very big kitchen

437
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Again

438
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Their young

439
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
We have a lot of followers of experiencing

440
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
Different environments

441
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Different restaurants

442
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Different people

443
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,007
All those things kind of without me realizing

444
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
All my time in New York

445
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Prepare me

446
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
For pretty much believe in that anything

447
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Everything can be possible

448
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
It's amazing because that restaurant

449
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Elio is so associated with you

450
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
Right in the sight of this concept of like small plates

451
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,511
Who have the vision of creating it and and now you have

452
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
25 restaurants in somehow

453
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
You guys are all still together right

454
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Job well everything has it been

455
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Enchant a lot over the years

456
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
We used to wear the same people you didn't like fall apart and like happy device and like kill each other.

457
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
We had fights

458
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
We had

459
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
Exchange abuse

460
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Exchange of opinions

461
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
I'm in for them I was a very young kids when I can

462
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
I'm not sure what I have

463
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
Iona to them and this is the message I sent to many

464
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Knowledge chefs and restaurant people that they need

465
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
Business people it is good that you are able to

466
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Two very early on in July

467
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
Surround yourself

468
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
With people

469
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
You want to be with

470
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
For many years I had

471
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Only for family

472
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Only for friendship

473
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
But also for business

474
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
And if you can make the three it's even more wonderful

475
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
This is a very powerful

476
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Tool

477
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
That's why I always tell people. Dumb saying that the lawn

478
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
You can do more

479
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
Yeah together you can conquer the world

480
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
I mean given that you're right

481
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Major company now

482
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
Hundreds of employees

483
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Do you

484
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,959
Did you get to log as many hours are spent as much time in in the kitchen or in the creative side of

485
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Really

486
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Building up

487
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,127
Interesting menus are you kind of have to give let go a little bit and let other people come up

488
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Is pain

489
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
A lot of

490
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Of my

491
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
But I would call Brain time

492
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Thinking

493
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Creating

494
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
I cook at all hours

495
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
In my free time I need mine on free time

496
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
Cooking is why I really enjoy

497
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
I see myself

498
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
Very much like car Orchestra

499
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
She doesn't play

500
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Any instrument

501
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
But he's able to produce beautiful music

502
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
But you know one thing

503
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
I'm very lucky that they have

504
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
Chaps who shops yams

505
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
My name is Emily

506
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
The many of them

507
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Astounded

508
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
No more Talent

509
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
I'm what I have that the always War Ready Wellies

510
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
And in my favorite group we have

511
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
What we called

512
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Thankful tank

513
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
That's my creative

514
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Arm

515
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
For me creating that arm

516
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Off

517
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
8 9 10 11 12 in the Beatles

518
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
That the only thing they do is thinking

519
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Creating

520
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
I'm maintaining quality

521
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
ASAP Bari

522
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
Powerful research and development tool

523
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
I know you said the Lord

524
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
My team travels with me a lot

525
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
We always go to Faraway countries

526
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
We're always getting inspire

527
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Because if you want to get in

528
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Inspire you have to be on the move

529
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
When you put together this very big menu at Jaleo

530
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
And you created a sort of small plate

531
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
System there

532
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,680
Was there also any consideration of how how the economic so that would work because presumably

533
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
You'll be selling more

534
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
More

535
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,800
Play the food right so presumably you could help it would

536
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
Did it help me to help the restaurant

537
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Needed bottom line

538
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
And Beyond

539
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
It's a business like any other

540
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
I can't tell you you were harder

541
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
When you have to put the house

542
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
3000 is more plates

543
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
Dongguan service

544
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Then 1000 big play

545
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
It's more work

546
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,120
So sometimes believe me I'm like I'm tired of his my plates

547
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
I'm going to be sending them super

548
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,288
Steak and potatoes

549
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Even nice people

550
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
That will tell me

551
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Jose I don't want is more plates but then they go to sushi

552
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
What is a sushi restaurant

553
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
When is MOD Pizza the time

554
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,136
Ice people that complain about this more place and they go to great restaurants and what they give you

555
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Is malt balls have

556
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
Homewood city of Meriden

557
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
At the end

558
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
He's very funny dad today

559
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,376
When we have people complaining about certain things

560
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
They're doing those things

561
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
They need to be thinking

562
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
What's on the plate

563
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
Because today the weight we eat

564
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
Is an amazing form of democracy

565
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
Because by what you eat

566
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
You are boating

567
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
How about the things you

568
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Think should be the only on your plate

569
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
But in the place of many others

570
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
So we all need to start singing

571
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
The jewel Cambodia

572
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Would you play

573
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
A plate is an amazing form of democracy

574
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
If you are a young sat for young

575
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Business man or woman

576
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Try to get in

577
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376

To give to a Ito a twenty-two-year-old Jose Andres today

581
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Well

582
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
The big is a diocese

583
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616

586
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
Carol daughter Carlota

587
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
I'm going to go in through the process

588
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Kind of

589
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,952
Seems she she's a green we're going into

590
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
She's going to do business

591
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Because you can be anything you want

592
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
You will always work for yourself

593
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
I don't care if you want to be

594
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Painting in the middle of the streets of Washington DC

595
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
I don't care if you want to be

596
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
Singing with a rose in 5th Avenue

597
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
I don't care

598
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,224
What's the crazy business you want to be part of

599
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Make sure that you have the business background

600
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Businesses on the I wish I learned

601
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
When I was

602
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
15

603
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
I had 30 years

604
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Off the School of Life

605
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
Now I think I'm going to be putting these next head of yours

606
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Input interpretation

607
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Everything I learned

608
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Over the last day

609
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
You have like

610
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
25 restaurants

611
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,896
Even on TV Guide cookbooks menu for your major celebrity chef

612
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Yeah

613
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
But when you were a teenager in

614
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
And Spain just

615
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Cycle learning to cook

616
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Did you imagine you could ever get to this point

617
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
I don't think I ever

618
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
A train more than

619
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
Making sure that the next plates

620
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Put forward in front of somebody

621
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Is the best you can be

622
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,424
Quite frankly I always say I don't open restaurants

623
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
I tell a story

624
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Sometimes I wish

625
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,568
That I only had one restaurant

626
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
I'd only one

627
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
And I will be there every day

628
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
On every hour

629
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
But I know that that will be so bored

630
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
So I created a company around me that will

631
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Fulfil my personal needs

632
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
But to this day I still

633
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Consider myself that

634
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
I am only

635
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
As good as the last play ticer

636
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Even if you do radio

637
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,704
Show do the radio show on Jehovah's good

638
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
You fix it but the radio show is going to be there forever

639
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
I never for anybody to listen to

640
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
But foot

641
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
Is Berea funeral disappears

642
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
So this is how hard

643
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
My profession is

644
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
You only have one chance to make it

645
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,536
The address is a chef and the co-founder of thinkfoodgroup

646
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
By the way you should try his gazpacho it's a pretty easy to make just get some fresh tomatoes cucumber

647
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,080
Green pepper a little Sherry vinegar olive oil and garlic throw it all into a blender that's it delicious

648
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480

654
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,224
I'm guy Raz and you've been listening to how I built this from NPR

655
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
You still with us

656
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,120
Okay great because we are now at the part of the show where we talk about

657
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:50,496
Your stories in this one came to us from Dennis Darnell come in the house

658
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,616
And there'd be that one fly flying around you have no idea how it got in there but it's flying around at the buccaneer

659
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
I think we can all relate to that problems one that summer day in San Diego where Dennis live

660
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,368
Joyland we're sitting in the kitchen and they were watching him

661
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
Fly Buzz all around

662
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
We sat there and watched it

663
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
Trying to get into the garbage can

664
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
And what was said

665
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
Why do I drill a hole in the lid

666
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,840
And let it in

667
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
But put a trap

668
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
On the underside of the lid

669
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,216
And that is how the garbage can

670
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Fly trap

671
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Usborne flies

672
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Of course love

673
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Garbage

674
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Dennis designs trap where

675
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:33,504
You drill a hole in the lid of your garbage can and then you pop in this little plastic doorway for the fly

676
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,576
But there's also a second part which is the cartridge

677
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Which is lined with flypaper

678
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
And so why the fly thinks it's going down into the garbage can

679
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
It actually walks into the Disposable cartridge

680
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
And becomes

681
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Stuck in what's a cartridge gets

682
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,632
Full with like a hundred flies

683
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,472
You don't have to look at that more sticky or gross

684
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Stand just push the button

685
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
On the lid

686
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,104
And the cartridge falls into the garbage can

687
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Tennis Australian have filed

688
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
Three patents for this flytrap and they sold them on their website and at Ace Hardware stores in San Diego

689
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,624
And just last week we reach out to Ace Hardware headquarters

690
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
As well as Home Depot

691
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,256
But now that they're keeping their day jobs and enjoying the fact that their kitchen

692
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Is pretty much fly free

693
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
