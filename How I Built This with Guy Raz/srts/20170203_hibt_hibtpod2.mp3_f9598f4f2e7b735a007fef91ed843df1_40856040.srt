Hiscox

Business insurance experts

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
We were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were Andy was funding everything

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
I didn't leave you to shut it down I said it's your 401K money

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
And all of our savings at that point we still weren't seeing you no progression that week

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
Go to pass the salary the next year in the near future so we thought we'd a good run at it we think we've had it

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
From NPR how I built this

13
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
Innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements they built

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
The person behind the brand Uno is

15
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
Kate Spade

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
Grew up as Kate Brosnahan

17
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
Kansas City Missouri

18
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
Then she always loved fashion but

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Never plan to work inside

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
She wanted to be a journalist

21
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
So in the early 1980s

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
She went off to study journalism

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
At Arizona State University

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
And that

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
With her Kate met her future husband

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Andy Spade

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
We worked together at a clothing store and I was on The Winning Side he was on the men's side and

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
His car broke down and then we really started off

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Really great friends the car continue to break down so relationship along

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,584
And the rest of the story later they're still together anyway

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Kate graduated from college first Andy was a few credits short

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
You're up by yourself traveled around and came back to New York and

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,968
Ventura temp agency because I desperately needed

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
Some some money

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
Arizona to be with Andy but that's where my ticket

36
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
It started and ended in New York

37
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Got enough money to get back so I needed a job in order to do that so I started it at

38
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
The temp place I was typing and I said I don't I don't think this is going to work out

39
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
And then she called the next day and said can you get ready right now kind of NASCAR

40
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
And they have a job in fashion Department

41
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
So

42
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
They ended up hiring me they didn't want to because I couldn't type

43
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
My boss

44
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
That listen she's great and I don't need a side Lot

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
If we were doing fashion shoots and styling so

46
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,840
It wasn't as what were you doing

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Well I started as an assistant so I was

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Tying

49
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Model shoes

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
On a photoshoot because they couldn't bend over their clothes

51
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
That are getting hair stylist

52
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Snickers

53
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm telling you whatever I irons

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Kids bags

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
It was a lot of work

56
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
Did you were you were back in Tempe

57
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
At Arizona State University

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
I was back in Tempe hours to struggling with a few required courses

59
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,560
I think I had more credits than necessary but there are a few that I couldn't get through

60
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
But I did start an advertising agent

61
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
See my senior year in college

62
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
And so I started trading ads

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
For aborting food

64
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
Inside I go to a restaurant for example and I

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
I bring in the ad that they had running in the local paper

66
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
And I would show it to them and say I think I can do better if I come back and show you a

67
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
A better version of this

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,088
Will you either pay me in food or give me a few hundred dollars

69
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
I had like

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
10th Acres so I ended up with 10 accounts

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
How many things are going well

72
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
And Kate were you still planning to head

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Back to Arizona

74
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
At that point

75
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Yes

76
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
And I kept saying no I'm coming back

77
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
I will only stay here for 6

78
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
The first post

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
Text number I said I have to be honest

80
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
I kind of like my job

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
I loved it and I love the pain of the past

82
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Pace of

83
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
New York

84
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
And suddenly it

85
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
I loved it

86
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,551
When she got a job offer for $14,000 a year everything changed

87
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
She's on sting and that's what I said well I'm going to

88
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
I'm moving to New York

89
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
And you just figured

90
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Yeah I figured I'd find something there I had a little portfolio

91
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Of advertisements that I'd written and art directed

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
I thought I took that with me to New York in hopes of finding a job

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
And what did you guys

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Did you out like move in together

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
We did

96
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,151
I I forwarded a little bit of money that I had

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Decatur

98
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
First security deposit on the cheapest

99
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
List Apartments you can find

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
And

101
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
I remember arriving and

102
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
It's a call me from a pay phone on the corner

103
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
When you arrive

104
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
And all

105
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Get out of the fire escape

106
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
So I called and I walked

107
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
26 Renwick Street

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
And I looked up at

109
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,119
She was out on the fire escape and she threw down a sock with a

110
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,959
Akita that is true, it's easier to throw it down

111
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
Like suitcase

112
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
I had

113
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
One warm coat a suitcase

114
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
And a portfolio

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
Wow an integer but a cake

116
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
I know you went to an all-girls

117
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Catholic High School parents of have a problem with

118
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
You living with Andy

119
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
They never really said much but

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
My mother

121
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
That's not please

122
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
She was not pleased with the doll bed

123
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,095
I mean I just kept saying it was a matter of economics

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
Did you actually land a job in advertising

125
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,055
I did I was interviewing and a lot of programs like y&r in Oglebay anime there

126
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
But my portfolio didn't reflect the kinds

127
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Accounts that they're working on

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Bars in IBM

129
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
What is walking to Grand Central Station and a young man in a suit pulled me over I was carrying my portfolio

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
He said what are you do

I said Teresa I'd love to look at your portfolio and we stopped in Grand Central Station he went through my portfolio and

134
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
He said I think I might have something for you I'm a recruiter

135
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,799
It happened to see me walking to Grand Central Station

136
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
He went through it needs to meet me at my office tomorrow

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
2 did any set me on three or four interviews

138
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
What which which was an agency named bozell Jacob Canyon in a car

139
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,855
I need an opening for someone to work on the

140
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Army National Guard and Merrill Lynch

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
And

142
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,071
He said I know you haven't had any experience on these but these types of businesses but I like your hotspot

143
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,679
Oh. I didn't know what it meant until I called someone

144
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
What does it mean when they say you took a chance starting own business at the positive

145
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,383
Until I got that job

146
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,247
So okay so you guys are on your early 20s

147
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Your

148
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Living the New York Life

149
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Hate your working at at Conde Nast

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Mademoiselle magazine

151
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Actually it was amazing

152
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
I mean my mom

153
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Framed when they put my name in the

154
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Math test she still hasn't praying

155
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
And what are you doing what were you what did you start to do there

156
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
It was first assistant

157
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
For the senior fashion editor

158
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
And

159
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Then I was promoted to associate editor

160
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
And I was in charge of all the accessories

161
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
And

162
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,015
I did that for a couple years and they promoted me the senior fashion editor

163
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
And if there's one thing I did learn was

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
How to be very resourceful

165
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
And it came in very handy

166
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
We started our business because

167
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
I mean

168
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
There was do not come back

169
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Me with no

170
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
I mean you

171
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
Figure it out I mean it would be we have to go on a shooting

172
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
2 days and we need 8 tickets

173
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Bahamas in

174
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Figure out how to get us all there

175
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
I mean if we're all on different airplanes I don't care but get us there

176
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Make it happen

177
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,735
So I guess it was the early 90s like maybe maybe 1991 when you decided to leave

178
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Mademoiselle magazine

179
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
What was going on why did you decide to go

180
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
It's funny you know Angie and I were talking one night and I just said

181
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
I was looking ahead and I

182
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
So the fashion director is

183
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
How do your neck

184
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Jump from being

185
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Senior fashion editor

186
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
And

187
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
I don't really see myself wanting that

188
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
That job

189
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
So Andy and I were out honestly the Mexican restaurant and

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
He just said

191
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
What about handbags

192
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
You just don't start a handbag company

193
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
Resupply. How hard can it be

194
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Okay really

195
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
He regrets those words

196
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
What white handbags

197
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
Well she was in accessories editor and she collected

198
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Your handbags for fashion shoots that would have

199
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Whatever key responsibilities

200
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
So she'd have to

201
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Handbags from

202
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Vintage doors

203
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
For Beach shoot straw bag she had a

204
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,799
Buy a Personal Collection that was amazing and then she knew every handbag company in the mark

205
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
I thought you understood it better than anyone

206
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
What's missing in the market

207
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
What was missing in the

208
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
The time things for Barry

209
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Baxter too complicated

210
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
And I really love very simple kind of architecture

211
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Jose

212
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
And I would wear these

213
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Very simple shapes none of which were

214
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
Famous designers names

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
September

216
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Today

217
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,447
Who is this that I'd say I don't know I bought it at a vintage store or it's a straw bag I got in Mexico

218
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
Soaked and they were all very square and simple and I thought

219
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Xiaomi why can't we find something

220
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Just clean and simple and modern

221
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,223
Okay so about the time that that you want to quit you were thinking

222
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
Like I'm done with fashion magazines yes

223
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
And then he was like

224
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
You know bags you know like why don't you try to do this

225
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Design your own

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,975
Absolutely it actually said it before I quit so I kind of

227
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
Already had in the back of my mind and

228
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
I remember at the very beginning

229
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Stay I could have

230
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
Made an income while I was working on this and someone said to me

231
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
The truth

232
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Is you would never have done it

233
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
How do you say

234
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Because I would have been a scrap yours I mean that it was kind of didn't do or die so

235
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,991
I think if I'd still been working I would have been like

236
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
A little bit more lackadaisical about it words

237
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
And you don't have an income coming in you

238
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
To do whatever you can to make it happen

239
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
So how did you even start to

240
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Design hammock menu had no

241
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,607
Background InDesign you didn't even know what to do in Lakewood

242
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
Show things and

243
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,799
It's funny I did not know and I did start by buying

244
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Big sheets of white

245
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Paper

246
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
And I would cut out

247
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Tape honestly

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
The shape that I wanted and then I'd look at it

249
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Make it shorter smaller cut it

250
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,671
And I went to a pattern maker that I found in the back of women's wear daily

251
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
She advertises she made patterns

252
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,815
So I contacted her she worked out of her apartment and she was

253
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Patient as could be with me

254
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,703
Because I didn't know anything and I remember being really embarrassed about that

255
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
That

256
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
I wasn't there

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Student

258
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Comparison to RISD or

259
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Fit that if I really didn't know what I was doing

260
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,503
And I honestly started with paper then we'd make a sample out of any kind of fabric muslin

261
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
And then

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
I kind of got the shape down and I had to find a manufacturer so I called me mister daily they connected me

263
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,839
Me to a department that they really said we don't do that but someone in the fashion Department said oh it's so odd I know some

264
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
And he had left himself this

265
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
Production guide to start his own business

266
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,359
So was this guy that you found was he was he a designer manufacturer so he

267
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Did the production

268
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
And so I brought in my samples and

269
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,367
He was like okay why won't some money up front and he really was very nervous that I wasn't going to pay him and

270
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Tahiti

271
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
Took our tiny little production honestly which would be

272
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Handbags of time you know

273
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
And how how long after

274
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Like You music sort of start to sketch out design

275
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
What's this what's this like

276
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Weeks Later a month later what

277
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,335
Did you were you working on this idea for a long time in your apartment yes

278
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
At least a year and you were freelancing

279
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Nathan

280
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Certain days a week

281
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
As a stylist

282
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
After getting the

283
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Patterns made

284
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
The next

285
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Big Challenge was

286
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Finding someone who would sell us

287
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Fabric and

288
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Because we didn't have any experience none of the fabric houses

289
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
What cell has anything other than

290
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
100 yards

291
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
For example

292
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Probably

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
40 yards

294
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
30 RND 25

295
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
So I called

296
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
I looked in the Yellow Pages

297
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
And I looked up

298
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Burlap

299
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
And I found a potato sack

300
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
That's

301
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Is willing to sell to

302
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Annette three different

303
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
No weights

304
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
And I needed the heaviest weight so that

305
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Substantial enough

306
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Bram.

307
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
That was actually our first collection

308
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Made out of burlap

309
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,471
Made out of burlap bags look like imagine like

310
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Brown burlap

311
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Kind of

312
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Angular little bag

313
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Yes absolutely with

314
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Raffia Fringe

315
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
And

316
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,247
Webbing handle and I found a wedding company also

317
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
In the Yellow Pages

318
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
I see you get this

319
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
You get these samples and then what new how do you get

320
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Why do you start with the first thing you do

321
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
You go to these

322
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Accessory shows

323
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
Trade shows trade shows and you get to get accepted

324
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
And we did and

325
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
The question of your

326
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
You get the worst spot because all the famous people end up in

327
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,567
Citizen in New York

328
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
Trade show you went to debut the case

329
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Spade

330
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Burlap

331
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Bag yes

332
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
And we honest

333
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
God brought in our own tables

334
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
Lounge chairs we bought in lamps

335
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
Apartment apartment actually are both turned into our apartment

336
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Basically for the week

337
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,327
Where you guys are nervous I mean Kate were you like I don't know where that were you worried that maybe somebody from

338
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
I didn't ask

339
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
Cut be a little embarrassed or somebody would call you out and say what are you doing who you guys were you

340
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
I was I

341
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Because the editors come by as well as the buyers

342
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
To the trade shows

343
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
And I really didn't tell my parents

344
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
Or my family about it

345
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Or anyone for that matter

346
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Because I thought if it doesn't work

347
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
I will be so

348
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Embarrassed

349
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Because everyone kept saying

350
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
Why would you quit your job

351
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Yuan insurance

352
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,839
Who do you think you are I just knew my family with just

353
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
Oh you got a little hot-headed big headed there in New York and

354
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Think you can start this company

355
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
So I kept it on the down-low intentionally didn't

356
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
They talked about it much too

357
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Family

358
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Because I think secretly we both thought it

359
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Fail respond to the bag

360
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
It will

361
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
I remember crying

362
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Because when I came home we hadn't even sold enough to cover the cost

363
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
To the booth

364
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
And I started crying and he said both

365
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Who did you get tonight said

366
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
What we got

367
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Barney's

368
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Annies

369
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Okay and I said

370
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
Fred Segal in Los Angeles news

371
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Migas

372
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
Katie

373
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
To the best stores in America

374
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Why are you crying I said I think we should shut it down

375
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
I'm very conservative and I said I do I have no in

376
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
To losing money

377
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
I said and we feel we've already spent

378
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
$4,000 and that that's it for me I'm not a gambler so

379
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
That's her and he was like that

380
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Keep going

381
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
And also have to get a great deal of credit

382
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
To the editors

383
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,631
Nap time we weren't selling a lot but the editors were putting us in the magazine

384
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
A lot

385
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
What was it about your bags at appeal to them

386
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
I did because it wasn't

387
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
Anything anyone was doing and everyone there's a fabric show in Paris called Premier busy on that all the designers go

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Same material

389
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,951
Mine came out of the Yellow Pages chances are going to run into any people that have the same material

390
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,535
So we were doing something different which was really to our advantage

391
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Two editors for like

392
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
50 speed

393
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Beautiful burlap bag

394
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
They thought they were

395
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
Beautiful Friday they thought they were interested

396
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,615
And we did we got a lot of credits then that's when my mother first found out

397
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
And she was embarrassed

398
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
Then she called the embarrassing that you didn't

399
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
Tell me and my friend had to tell me lies

400
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
I know I don't know I don't want to make a big deal of this and

401
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
It okay it's one credit that's not a business

402
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
How did you come up

403
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
How did you serve land on the name

404
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Well that was Andy

405
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,887
Because we weren't I was not Kate Spade I was

406
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Kate Brosnahan and

407
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
I kept coming up with

408
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
Cities names in Antigua

409
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Kate

410
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Space because we were 50/50

411
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
Key partners

412
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
Finally I just said okay and I love it

413
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503

In Flames she was like

419
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
But you're not keep faith and I said I know but she's a

420
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,863
Oh now you'll never be Kate Spade now you've been jinxed it and why would you name it Kate Spade and I said

As well

473
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
It's how I built this from NPR

474
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
I'm guy Raz

475
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,831
So when Kate and Edith debut the original Kate Spade bag

476
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,159
They got orders from farnese and Fred Segal

477
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
And it was a big deal in the world of fashion

478
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
But even with those orders

479
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
It didn't mean Caton and E were suddenly

480
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Wash with

481
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
Kasher living large in New York

482
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
Wasn't going to guarantee that

483
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
The company was going to be successful

484
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Andy

485
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
He kept his full-time job in advertising

486
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Beijing

487
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,455
The overhead yeah I'm basically the rent in the other expenses right we'll keep freelancing that started the company

488
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
And I just got lower both 29 30 years old and

489
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
It's time to do it we don't have children

490
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Let's not quit even if we

491
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Lose everything

492
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Okay can I go back to Fashion job

493
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
You know I can continue working advertising

494
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
And you guys are running the company

495
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
We'd move to a loft in Tribeca because we were in a small apartment

496
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Honestly guy everywhere

497
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
To the point where are Loft

498
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
Bad was up the stairs we crawl up

499
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
The entire apartment was just to see if

500
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Brown boxes that sounds

501
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
We were doing very well but yeah

502
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,672
It really was we were still you were shipping out things from the apartment

503
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Oh yes

504
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
At least

505
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Two and a half years

506
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
You know you could take the train

507
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
The Brooklyn to the factory

508
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Pick up the box

509
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Just take the back on the subway

510
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
In trash bag floor walk-up

511
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
And she was shipping and

512
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,920
Packing bags and doing everything and taking orders on the fax machine I'm everything come through in the middle of the night

513
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
With your better around Wherever I Go

514
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,576
Excited put the orders would not be that big because it was hard to

515
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,696
The people that time to cut once they started selling then you get bigger order so it was really

516
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Very gradual I mean it was at least

517
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
3 years before we paid ourselves

518
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
Maybe $15,000

519
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
15000

520
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
And we're still working out of our apartment

521
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
It was our home office

522
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Standard shipping

523
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Warehouse

524
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Andar

525
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,384
Home did you start to see

526
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
The first year 2

527
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Women walking around New York with k

528
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
I did

529
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Most of whom

530
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,928
We redditors who are getting them a very good discounts

531
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
Eventually we started to see it and I remember thinking

532
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
What I did

533
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
That was a big deal

534
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
And

535
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,680
You know I think it took people while even my family my sister was working

536
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
Gucci and actually

537
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
Called me and said we're all pitching in

538
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
Mom

539
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Father's Day

540
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Get her a Gucci bag and I thought

541
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
What

542
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,040
I never that because they really didn't think

543
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
It would be much

544
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
I still should be upset

545
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
What about the hopefully they're listening

546
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,792
Show all the while you're shipping bags out your getting orders in and you are still designing

547
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Facts

548
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Yes

549
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
See you're working like

550
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
We are and

551
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
What we ended up doing

552
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Put sweet took on

553
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Two partners

554
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
For Sweat Equity only

555
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
It was at my friend at least Aaron's

556
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
My best friend

557
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
There was a t

558
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Someone that we just met through friends here in New York

559
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
So

560
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
The three of us were in cars going to

561
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Factories

562
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
I was really doing the design the only bed

563
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Didn't I also

564
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
Steaming the bags boxing pack

565
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
And how are you guys

566
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
It was always you

567
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,168
Yeah I got a job offer to work for Saatchi & Saatchi in LA and I

568
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,472
I almost tripled my salary

569
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,776
Yeah we're still funding the company ourselves

570
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
And we needed money for

571
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
For fabric and we needed money

572
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
For the trade shows

573
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,456
Until we both agreed that I would go to La you did move to LA

574
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
I thought I could go back and forth and at the time released

575
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Pallet wood hold down the New York

576
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Partner

577
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,976
FedEx in all my designs and materials and

578
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,536
I rented a little house that I called the house I never lived in

579
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,144
I never bought a piece of furniture and I just took the money and send it to me I put it back into the business

580
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
Did you ever get a point in the first two years

581
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,568
Where you thought this was going to collapse if this is going to fail

582
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Yes and I remember calling back

583
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Tulisan Pamela New York and I said

584
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
I didn't leave you two

585
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
Shut it down I said it's why were you guys

586
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
Like in dad or it was hard I mean it was we were still not making any money nobody was making a salary we were Andy was

587
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Standing everything

588
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,792
And at that point we were all kind of putting money in family would put into Emeli Sande

589
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,352
I just remember thinking of

590
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
We run to your 401K money

591
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
And in all of our savings at that point

592
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
We still weren't seeing

593
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,128
You know progression that was going to pass out in the next year in the near future

594
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
A good run at it

595
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
I think we called the partners who

596
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
We brought in as as

597
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,112
Equity Partners on a handshake without any salary and we said we think we've had it

598
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
Cuz we are exhausted and they took

599
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Left the start with you and we haven't even had it returned the deals.

600
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,472
So we felt like you can't remember we spoken

601
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
It said all right

602
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,824
I'm going to go back

603
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
I'm trying to think

604
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
95-96 95 probably 95 and I did get another job in New York a great job actually

605
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
But still the company was not making money

606
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
What was the turnpike

607
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
What happened

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
I would say the stores really

609
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
Started to buy more we were in Saxon Neiman's and

610
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
When the

611
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Largest department stores started to buy

612
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
It

613
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Kind of really took off

614
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
We won

615
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
The cfda awards which is the

616
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
The Council of fashion

617
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Designers of America

618
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
And

619
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,224
There were photos from around the country not just

620
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
New York at the show that were saying

621
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Who is this

622
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,904
So that really really helped us a great deal I have

623
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Nosey word that you're most

624
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Is smaller designers

625
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,096
Didn't win at the time it was usually a Ralph Lauren Calvin Klein Donna

626
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
Karen all those people

627
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
And I remember Kate when we came back to New York and we were hoping something

628
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
I think what happened that

629
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Either Neiman's or Saks

630
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,616
They're buying for two or three stores and they said we're going to buy for all of our stores

631
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
That was fifty stores

632
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
More Than Words

633
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
And that quadruple our business

634
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
But what you have to realize

635
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
When that happens although it's very good you also have to up

636
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Front

637
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
Pay for the production they don't pay you for

638
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
30 to 6

639
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Today so I remember that

640
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
Are we going to afford it but we

641
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
Never borrow a dime

642
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Ever

643
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
Was there something that you guys did like a business decision that you

644
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
You made

645
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
That

646
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
That was the

647
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
Key to turning this around or was it just

648
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,640
More people started to discover it and you just you just persevered

649
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
Through those rough years and then it finally did

650
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
Just kind of on its own

651
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
You know

652
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Got discovered

653
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
That's exactly what happened I mean it really was just

654
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Kind of a little bit of a Snowball Effect

655
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
No just got a little bigger in a little bit

656
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Bigger and

657
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
I think

658
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,888
At the point where the largest department store Square picking us up

659
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
I think that it will be realized

660
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,568
Getting larger and larger spaces in stores which is very important

661
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
And maybe get a few

662
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
Basin shelves

663
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Storm store shop and Shop is what they call them

664
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,160
Your name is above it really big

665
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
To walk into

666
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:49,888
I think it's more fun for my mom actually a lot of fun I have to stay in the

667
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
Opening of stores do you know weed open to store

668
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,800
And Soho tiny little 300 square-foot store the next day

669
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
You know we're opening a bigger Store New York and then we're opening in

670
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Los Angeles

671
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
10 Chicago in

672
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
It was kind of at that point it became a little dizzy

673
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
A bit of a whirlwind

674
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Thought it was fun

675
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
Until some point you guys sold

676
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
The part of the company

677
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
That was at the surf scale up or

678
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
To make it even bigger

679
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,376
You know it was also a safety that quite honestly for us personally

680
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,728
And it wasn't even Marcus and we thought that would be somebody that would

681
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Be in a position to help us

682
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
And they bought

683
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm a little bit more than 50

684
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
The company that they bought 56

685
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
Reportedly for more than 30 million dollars

686
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Same to you guys

687
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,576
They were I think our biggest

688
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
Client restore the time and

689
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,208
We're doing very well with them and they had just started investing in other little

690
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Little brands that they

691
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
They thought I had potential

692
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
And yeah they came to us we were

693
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Completely

694
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
In shock

695
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Exciting because

696
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
As we thought wow

697
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
Which everything goes goes away tomorrow

698
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
You know it will be able to

699
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Sustain the business

700
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
I mean it was really about not being able to have

701
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
A bit of an essay going forward

702
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
The four of us

703
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
I know what that mean when one even Marcus by

704
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
More than half of the change

705
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Kate Spade

706
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,600
We started going into work categories because they were

707
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,160
Encouraging that which a lot of the stores not just

708
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Is that all of them

709
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
Really encouraging us

710
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
2

711
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Categories

712
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Stationary next twitch

713
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
That was right when

714
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Phones and emails and all that word

715
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Replacing people riding notes

716
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Texas native

717
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
Another category we didn't mean

718
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
You know a dying category

719
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
So I think what they were implying

720
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Shoes they really wanted some

721
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
Real substantial

722
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
Second categories are third fourth

723
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
So then we started doing shoes and

724
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
It really just started

725
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
No I think it was just a good boost

726
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,304
And I mean you guys probably had to go from you and Andy and your two partners II

727
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
Lots of employees

728
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,656
We did but we have done that actually

729
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,192
In the process

730
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
Slowly slowly changing

731
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
And offices and we take a floor and then

732
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
We take another floor in the building in

733
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
Who started the hiring people to hearing

734
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
Different departments in production people in

735
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
And then how many people

736
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Have more experience

737
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
So I really had a lot of people around

738
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
And Andy did Andy really surrounded himself with

739
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Really

740
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Greats

741
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
Art Department

742
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
And I really had great designers with me and

743
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
I think we really developed

744
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Employees that were amazing

745
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
When did you start to see

746
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Kate Spade bags

747
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
All over the

748
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
Huge iconic

749
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
And when did you first kind of realized

750
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
I'd say was about

751
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
97

752
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
It was still

753
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
Ferry New York so I must say

754
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Are New York Los Angeles Chicago

755
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,744
I think it was about 98 or 94 UTM

756
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Did any city that you went to

757
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Counterfeit started

758
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,400
That was about to get on Canal Street

759
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
Which Andy said that's actually accomplish

760
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
You know you're doing something right when

761
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:12,640
They're on every blanket on every street and celebrated for a day and then the next day that was over

762
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,296
You guys sold the rest of your your share of

763
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
2007

764
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Walked away from it what would you decide

765
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
So

766
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
We had a baby

767
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Into

768
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
5 and I just wanted

769
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
It was a perfect opportunity

770
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
Neiman Marcus

771
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Set the time

772
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Was selling

773
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Themselves to

774
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Pacific

775
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Paintball Des

776
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
Give them a lot of credit for that

777
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
But when we sold everything he know

778
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
Kind of like we have a

779
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
A boss

780
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
I want to leave on

781
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
On good terms if it's a

782
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Perfect time to leave

783
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
I wanted to spend time with my daughter

784
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
It was

785
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Beaufort so many horror stories

786
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,584
About people who style and then they stay and then they fighting and they sue and

787
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
That's too ugly for me so

788
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
We left on great terms we stay because of turnover

789
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
4 a year

790
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
For the transition to make sure all the employees who we loved had

791
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
Agreements to carry on

792
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Understood

793
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
What the process was

794
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,320
And they understood

795
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
And

796
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,160
They were very gracious and I think we all handle

797
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
The farewell

798
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
It was seamless

799
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
It was a very

800
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Quiet exit

801
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
You guys obviously have this incredibly strong

802
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,240
Marriage meme email here college students are still together you have a

803
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,336
You created this big amazing brand and how do you

804
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,408
How do you have a marriage and a business and

805
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Make it work

806
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,576
Safe from my perspective I remember people saying how do you work together when I was thrilled

807
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,696
I don't wait up wait up and I'm not ready yet means

808
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,512
Let me tell you right now if you think that everyday

809
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:09,376
Good office together we can have lunch together

810
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
We actually worked on stepper

811
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
Florist Parma that very reason because

812
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Then he'd be on the phone tonight

813
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
Get off the phone I have something to tell you

814
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
Or ask you

815
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
And that

816
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
We had to really I had to

817
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Myself

818
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Boundaries in

819
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,064
We had to make conscious effort not to talk about it 24/7 which is

820
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
As you can tell by her

821
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Quickly

822
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
Slight tendency

823
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
And I also am very

824
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,488
A nervous person I worry a lot

825
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
A nanny could not be more different

826
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
You are like the sleepless nights person

827
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Yes

828
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Always another

829
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
The sky is falling

830
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
Zico

831
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
You know it's good it's fine because we

832
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
We kind of grew up together

833
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
Up until now in AR-15

834
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
And we actually have a lot in common which helps

835
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
You guys

836
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Recently

837
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Launch a new company

838
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Together

839
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
What you call it by Frances Valentine

840
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
Yes in Katy

841
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
You changed your name from Kate Spade to

842
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
To Kate Valentine

843
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,632
I did but I added it I didn't change it I just added

844
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Francis

845
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Valentine into it so it's very

846
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
It's Katherine

847
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
No

848
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Francis

849
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
Valentine

850
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
Eddie Long

851
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
Did you do it in part because

852
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Kate Spade and become

853
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Its own thing and

854
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Beyond a single person

855
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,904
Yes and I thought it was important to make sure that we weren't stepping on any toes and

856
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
That we distinguished

857
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Our company

858
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
And I think that was important

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
For both of us

860
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
I mean people still call me Kate Spade I go buy it

861
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Seitz eye

862
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
I get confused

863
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,448
Myself so you can call me Francis if you want

864
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,520
And he told me about Frances Valentine

865
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
We are doing

866
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,640
Shoes and Handbags and we actually when we started

867
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
It was initially just

868
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Shoes

869
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Although we've only

870
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Been in business

871
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
I'm not your just your little over a year

872
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
But we've realized that's

873
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
People expecting bag

874
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
And I mean now you're a different right because

875
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
The hunger is

876
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
I'm sure it's still there but

877
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
It's not like a do-or-die thing like

878
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
It must be that I don't know

879
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Is it less stressful

880
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,264
We've air conditioning I think that's big that's a big difference right

881
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,104
Are there elevators in air conditioning I would stay there

882
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
It's

883
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
But I feel a little more confident

884
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
I think Andy feels the same because we've done it before

885
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
But on the same hand

886
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
You think that

887
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
People are expecting a great deal

888
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,392
So they're still there still alot of pressure Trestman

889
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
Personal finance

890
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Say it again so

891
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,024
I'm not crazy that as I mentioned earlier that Lucy

892
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816

Is it serve like baleen Avec that's a different

900
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
It's funny because I

901
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
I do look at it and I don't

902
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,904
People said oh do you have any regrets I remember thinking all I hope I don't

903
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,512
And I never have and I think they've done such a good job that luckily I don't have to have

904
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,632
And so we do walk by the stores and I have a funny story that we actually walked into the store

905
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
To buy my daughter something

906
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,776
Cash register and she said are you on our mailing list

907
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
And I said

908
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
So

909
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,176
And instead that I used my maiden name and I said

910
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
She surprised me

911
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,624
Send my daughter kind of kept nudging me to his died for me to say something and I didn't and then I remember thinking you know

912
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
I'm not on your mailing list but I think I helped created

913
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824

Okay it's now time for another story about something your building

929
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,992
And this one begins about 10 Norfolk

930
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
15 years ago when

931
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
Kayaking on a creek

932
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
You're the town of Sunset

933
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
South Carolina

934
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
And there was overhanging rhododendron

935
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
That created at

936
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
Tunnel all the way down the center of the creek

937
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
Feet above the water

938
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,656
So you can only like lay down and go underneath these limbs

939
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
So

940
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,752
That's what he did lay it on top of my kayak

941
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,872
And went down the creek that way and it was exhilarating so that's what gave me the very first idea

942
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
And his idea

943
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,736
Ways to build something he eventually called a belly a cat

944
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
Shaped like a kayak

945
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,600
But there's no hollow space in the hall no

946
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Place to sit

947
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
So instead

948
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,488
The surface is flat you can lie on top and

949
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Paddle with your hands

950
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
What I like about you is it's like flying it's the feeling of flying on water

951
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:04,704
And you know having a high-performance freestyle kayak hog

952
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,264
Which is made to respond every Nuance of the

953
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,848
The current and feeling that through your entire body and having your hands right there in

954
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
The current

955
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
That was such a thrilling feeling

956
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224
Anyway for about a year-and-a-half

957
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
Adam tinkered in an old Warehouse with some urethane foam

958
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
To get the belly

959
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Just wright

960
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Hey. Bill 24 different

961
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Models

962
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Because I would build it and I be like wow that way

963
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,304
Was good but I need to add a little more volume to the Baldor

964
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,656
What if it were a little narrow here in a little wider here so I thought I would have more question

965
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Try that start with one question what would it be like

966
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
And after playing around with it for a while

967
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
Finally perfected the bellyak

968
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Adam got a patent

969
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
And he was thrilled because he thought

970
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Kayakers

971
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
They are going to love this thing

972
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
But he was wrong

973
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
People

974
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,856
Looks down their nose at it as something that they were too good for

975
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,952
And really it was because Tigers already know how to kayak it's like trying to sell it

976
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
Different type of mountain bikes somebody who are mountain bikes they already have their tool for that terrain but over time I don't realize

977
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
Is there were other groups of people who

978
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Did like the bellyak

979
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Swimmers

980
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Triathlete

981
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Surfers

982
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,056
And a group he was surprised to hear from the first

983
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
Disabled veterans

984
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
The Belly Up

985
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Allowed somebody to get out of their wheelchair

986
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
And I can be mobile

987
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
They could have exercised

988
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
They can work on their balance

989
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,832
And the coolest thing was as I've talked to so many guys have used it have been like

990
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
And ever since my injury

991
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:31,488
I've never thought I would swim again and it's helped me get back in the water and that's been the coolest thing to see

992
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,072
Adam says he sold about 8000 bellyak so far

993
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
And some people are even starting to use them

994
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
In Whitewater competition

995
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
But eventually

996
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
Adam wants

997
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
To see the bellyak on all types of water

998
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,640
Just as you see paddleboards and kayaks on every Lake and every waterway in the country

999
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
We want to see people

1000
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
