Hey everyone this guy here

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,336
Another bonus episode from the how I built this

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,920
Summit in San Francisco that happened back in October

23
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,248
It's for my live interview with John Zimmer that co-founder of Lyft

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,344
And my original conversation with John ran back in February

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Of last year

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
I heard that you may want to check it out

27
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Because in it

28
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,792
John tells the story of how he launched his first ride-sharing

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Service in college

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:12,192
And happiness co-founder Logan green went on to build one of the biggest ride-hailing apps

31
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
In the world

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,288
They say one of the biggest court because 12

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
There's scoober

34
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
It's no secret that those two companies

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
They have been in a fierce competition pretty much since they launched

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
It's a rivalry that's up there with

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
You know

38
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,856
Coke and Pepsi are McDonald's and Burger King

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
And that competition

40
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
And how it's affected lift

41
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Is one of the things I wanted to ask John about

42
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
We sat down to talk

43
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
At yerba buena Center for the Arts

44
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
In San Francisco

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Are you doing

46
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Yeah

47
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Did you guys hear his episode

48
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
One of our earlier episodes

49
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
Really amazing story

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Curiosity

51
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,832
Anthony a given day you might not be able to say the exact numbers but roughly

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
On a given day how many people use Lyft

53
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
So

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Every month we do over 50 million

55
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Wow

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
It's amazing

57
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Missing

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
But what was his idea because when you started

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
This idea when you came up with the idea for lifted did you guys think of this as a simple idea

60
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
Innocence when this started we had a tagline that was your friend with a car

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
It was that it was that simple

62
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
There are

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,248
250 million vehicles in the United States

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Aleve and they're used

65
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,344
Each car is used for percent of the time

66
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
96% of the time at the park

67
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
So the simple idea was

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
You know you know that time where you had a friend with a car

69
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,352
I got you where you needed to go what if we could utilize these cars more

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
We could offer new job opportunities

71
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
For those that needed it

72
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Inflexibility

73
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Think about a single parent

74
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Who can't work a 9 to 5

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Having

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
The timing flexibility

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
It was large and so that was the simple idea let's create your friend with a car

78
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
At a community level

79
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
And that's how it began

80
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,832
What is it and how much of it was driven by the sense of

81
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
We want to kind of

82
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Recreate

83
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Our relationship

84
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
With automobiles assertive

85
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Idealistic

86
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
An ocean and and how much it was

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
We want to completely disrupt an industry

88
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
I never thought about disrupting an industry

89
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
We knew that was possible

90
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
We were aware of

91
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
Early days in San Francisco when we started I sat down with the general managers of the three major taxi companies

92
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Because I wanted to understand their perspective

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
And I wanted to make sure that the work we're doing

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Had enough

95
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
The positive benefit on society so

96
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
I'm heading disruption with something.

97
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
I became part of

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
The equation but wasn't the

99
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
Reason why we began alright let's talk about the competition

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Pretty soon after your

101
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
After your lunch

102
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Uber kind of step into your territory with

103
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
With Uber with a premium Black Car service

104
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
And once lift got traction Uber

105
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
Launch Uber X pretty pretty soon after.

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
And what's more about that because in some ways

107
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
The story of Lyft

108
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
Slightly early story of left is probably about your competition with Uber

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Backwood when that happened

110
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
Cuz they were bigger than you and still are a little bit today

111
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
How are you are you about that

112
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Optician

113
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
I will quite worried

114
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,423
We started knowing what we were entering into

115
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
So we knew we were The Underdogs from day one

116
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
We we we did that you know with their eyes open

117
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
We knew what we were taking on

118
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
Whether it was Uber

119
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
The taxi industry

120
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
A small company with

121
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
6 years ago

122
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Maybe in five years ago we're about 30

123
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
How many people you know

124
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
I almost 5000

125
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,975
Five years ago you would 30 people you 5000 today

126
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Say that we knew it we were we were getting into and indefinitely

127
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
That was concerning at 10

128
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
But I mean this became almost like a blood

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,567
Sport for some time right this competition between Uber and Lyft and it was really an Uber want to crush you guys

130
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
How did you how did you deal with that like how did you deal with that just for me

131
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
You know the stress level

132
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
It was very hard

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
I have amazing co-founder Logan green

134
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Who's there

135
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
We don't know each other before you start working

136
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
There's a lot of stories are friends who start things together

137
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
That we started something together and became friends

138
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
I have a great wife

139
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
Who is very supportive but it was it was very difficult we woke up one day

140
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
It was about

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
For 5 years ago

142
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
An Uber has raised 3 billion dollars

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
And we had

144
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
$109 left in the bank which is

145
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
A lot of money

146
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
But only a few more months left

147
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
And now you have this crazy competitor who wants to

148
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
The kill you

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
. that was definitely definitely tough but I think we

150
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
We stayed focused on our values we

151
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Stay focused on our

152
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Our vision and our mission

153
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
And and just put our heads down and executed and tried our best not to

154
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Got distracted

155
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
A lot of people here are building

156
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
AR building ideas

157
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,615
That will inevitably attract copycats inevitably attract competitors even even

158
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Brutal competitors

159
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
What have you learned about your competition with Uber that might

160
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Help someone

161
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Figure out

162
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
How to deal with in with their own competitors

163
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
That's what you think back five

164
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
5 years ago everyone said we were

165
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
Right I mean if you look at the odds 3 billion dollars

166
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
A a strong competitor

167
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Add Network effects as part of the business

168
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
But

169
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
But values do matter

170
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Treating people well does matter

171
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
And having a mission that

172
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
You focus on and

173
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
Care about more deeply than someone else

174
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
In the end

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Really matters

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
So I would just say

177
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
Focus on what you can control

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
And there aren't there are good forces at

179
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
And how did the dynamic between you you and Logan work like how did you win

180
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
It sounds like what you're saying is

181
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
He was kind of a steady

182
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
You know

183
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Comforce and you are sort of

184
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
A little bit freaking out you would like to freak out person

185
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
I think in simplistic terms as reasonable

186
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
He's

187
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm I'm more emotional

188
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
He's more logical

189
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
But I think it's fair to say there are moments where we both

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Did you ever think that

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
I mean what you said people thought we were going to

192
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
We were going to be crushed really finished

193
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
Did a part of you ever worry that that might happen

194
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
Yeah I mean really like you thought

195
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,047
You have sleepless nights like this we might not be around

196
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Yeah of course

197
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Where's vultures circling around

198
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
I felt like it

199
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
You know you go to work everyday

200
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
And you want to rally the troops

201
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
And you talked to weathers reporters or investors

202
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
And in one of the big things people are saying was that like

203
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
Uber is so aggressive you guys are nice

204
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
It was like

205
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Spotlight

206
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Sorry

207
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Word

208
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,903
We're trying to treat people well and we are aggressively pursuing

209
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Our mission

210
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
But

211
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,559
You know we we entered as I said we knew what we were getting ourselves into and we took it on

212
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,631
Uber is a a good product

213
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,751
Lyft is a good product and they they they do things really well you guys do things really well I'm curious

214
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
How that competition is actually made lift

215
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Better

216
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Yeah it's a great point

217
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
The competition has

218
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
Absolutely created Mark urgency

219
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Hot more Focus

220
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
More privatization

221
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Yeah we started

222
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,439
Tipping for drivers we started rental cars that are completely flexible

223
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
On a weekly basis for drivers

224
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
We started this idea of treating drivers well

225
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Which is that

226
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Shocking that it's an idea

227
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,727
And not obvious and until I think in this case competition

228
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
Has been a good thing all right so this is it this is a tricky question but I'm going to

229
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
I'm asking this anyway which is

230
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
When you ran into so many problems

231
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
You know what those were many of course of their own making

232
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Culminating in the resignation of

233
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Of other founder

234
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Was there some

235
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
I don't know some schadenfreude on your part did you guys kind of feel like

236
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
What did you mean Did you sort of feel like

237
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Well you know

238
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
I guess I was disappointed

239
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
But we were

240
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Very careful

241
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
About

242
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
How we

243
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
How we behave because it was a really critical moment

244
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
You know all eyes were on the industry were on us

245
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
I know a lot of people that were hurt by what happened

246
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Anthony or internally a turkey

247
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Competitor shirt externally

248
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
And so we told our team this is not a time to gloat and we mean that we meant that

249
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
You know why would we celebrate someone else's

250
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Does pain

251
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
And

252
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:48,543
If our goal is to improve people's lives with world's best transportation and to serve our drivers and passengers

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
It doesn't affect us

254
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Doing that

255
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
Sing about you or I mean not only

256
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
Is this a complex and regulated highly regulated

257
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,855
Industry but the technology is changing so fast right like

258
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,951
In 10 years we might not even even be driving cars at all

259
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
Maybe 20 years right

260
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,607
So how do you how do you think about your business model and how it might

261
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
How might evolve over time

262
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
So

263
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
There will be a portfolio of options that we are for you to say a

264
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
We want to offer you Transportation as a service

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
Instead of spending $9,000 a year to own and operate your vehicle

266
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
That we want to sell you maybe at

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
$500 a month

268
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Subscription plan

269
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
Simatai you buy minutes you'll by a thousand miles

270
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
And

271
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
You'll get access to our by

272
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,023
Bikes and scooters you'll get access to Transit through the Partnerships we have with local governments

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
You'll get access to rides

274
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,167
That is what we're doing as technology changes as we had bikes and scooters it becomes part of that

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
As we look to autonomous vehicles

276
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,287
It's not the be-all end-all it's part of providing that trance

277
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Asportation to Arco

278
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,175
In an earlier interview I asked Jenn Hyman about her business Rent the Runway

279
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
And she described how it was fully formed right at the beginning when she was in business school that she had this vision for

280
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
For a closet in the cloud but that

281
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,231
She just introduced a part of that company at the beginning that the high-end

282
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Ball gown rental

283
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Company

284
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,887
But ultimately she knew that she wanted to create a company where

285
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,679
You could buy you get all your clothes

286
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Didn't it what you're talking about now where you're paying off a monthly

287
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Subscription fee and you've accessed all these things and

288
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Driverless cars were you thinking about that

289
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
No7 8 years ago or or

290
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Or is Lyft with Lyft is today was that

291
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Was that the vision

292
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
I need somewhere between

293
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
But when we started at

294
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Again the vision is like

295
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
At the city level

296
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
You look outside

297
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
And walk around

298
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
You see cars you see pavement

299
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
DC parking spots that sucks

300
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
And nothing you see is people staring down at their phone

301
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
Or driving alone in their car

302
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
And and we don't like that

303
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
And so we're trying to solve what we think is a big part of the design problem

304
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
And so we did have that Vision to

305
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,903
Eventually get into other forms of transportation I remember thinking in College of some type of

306
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Automated service

307
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
That would just be way more efficient and allow you to have less infrastructure

308
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
But there are parts of it that are definitely knew his way

309
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
I want to go back to the theme of scaling because of

310
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
It's 2018 now

311
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
And really four years ago

312
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
You are

313
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,895
Fraction of what you are today and we were a tiny company comparatively

314
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,247
April 24th 2014 on that one single day

315
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
You launched in 24 cities simultaneously

316
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Huge

317
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,671
Insane launch how did you manage that

318
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
That gross and in that scale

319
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071
Yes it's been a constant balance I think for us

320
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
About picking our areas of focus

321
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
That we chosen

322
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
To be careful about International launches

323
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
We've chosen not to go into food delivery

324
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
But we did think having

325
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Coverage in the United States for

326
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
For every American is a critical

327
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,551
Doctor if we wanted to replace car ownership is the best way for you to get around

328
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
If we want to be you no have

329
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Transit

330
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Lyft bikes and scooters on one app

331
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,791
Having coverage first United States for a car that was as convenient as a car parked in your

332
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Driveway

333
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Coverage was important

334
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
If you hear the podcast you talk a lot about how

335
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
You're sort of commitment to

336
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Environment and your interest in in the environment really kind of motivated this initially Desai

337
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Tidy initially but

338
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,991
As with any new technology there unintended consequences

339
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
And even with lift there are even with Uber there alright you've seen studies that have shown that in some cities

340
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
There's an increase in traffic

341
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
Some people say you go to airports as an increase in traffic because of

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Ride-sharing drivers

343
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
Is that something that you think about.

344
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Do you ever think

345
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
That's not what we intended to do and n

346
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Yeah we're definitely

347
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Our goal is to get rid of traffic

348
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
So when there are cases that we are adding to it

349
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,479
That is not good and that's something that we do think a lot about is there a solution to it

350
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Yeah

351
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Congestion pricing

352
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Is the best solution

353
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Getting more investment in public transportation

354
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Is another solution

355
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
And those two things can be

356
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Directly tied together

357
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
So

358
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
We may be an unlikely

359
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,423
People might not expect it but you know I think will become more vocal about her advocacy for both of those

360
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
You can imagine

361
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,287
A future where the drive into a city at a certain time you have to

362
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Toupee

363
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Like in London need to pay a fee to go to the city

364
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah you need to have that

365
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,503
In order for there to be Equity you need to have a free option for those that can't afford it

366
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
We have that

367
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
In the Eastbay call the carpool lane

368
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
And we know how products like our shared ride service that can make it easier for people to connect and get into that car plane or just the car

369
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Casual carpooling lines that exist

370
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
And have existed for many years that actually work

371
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
Quite well

372
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
So I do think ultimately

373
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
If we as a society want to get rid of traffic

374
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
We need to all

375
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Create a new system

376
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,895
I know I want to shift for an inner final moments cuz I know a lot of

377
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
People think that when they launch a business

378
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
They really think of the what you know what is it that I'm trying to create

379
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
We've talked about this

380
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Before and after I've heard you talk about the why

381
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,231
The wire that the why of what you're launching is much more important than the what

382
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
So what do you mean by that

383
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,631
Yeah so there's some revisionist history that I know like to say the Y and lift is

384
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Because

385
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
The why behind our work

386
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
Is way more important than the what

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
The one that has always been true that the Y

388
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Has been important

389
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
The reason is like

390
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
In today's society we can

391
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
There's so many things we can make

392
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Technology

393
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Incredible

394
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
We can have these computers in our hands

395
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
That everyone can have why

396
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Why are we doing this

397
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
So I think there's too much focus on the next

398
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
In office

399
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
And Technology you have the the next phone release

400
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
And I think there needs to be a much

401
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,399
Much more push from all angles on people thinking about why are we doing

402
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
And if we all were to agree on

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Like principles of what's important

404
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
Principals around enough for us Equity sustainability

405
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Economic Mobility

406
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Then

407
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Then our what would be better inform

408
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
John and I love his question was asking people at your

409
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,367
At your point in your career the question if you were sitting in this audience 10 years ago

410
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Watching

411
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Somebody like you up here

412
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
What would you what do you wish you would have known

413
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,071
That would have been helpful to you as you are growing and creating your business

414
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
The first five years ago I very much could have been in the audience

415
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
5 years ago

416
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Yasso

417
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
You can accomplish a lot in a short amount of time

418
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
And

419
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,895
You know the thing that's been cemented in our minds is just

420
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,247
Having a core set of values and a mission that drives you

421
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Is

422
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Is the thing that matters most

423
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
And so

424
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
Is that how you thought of an even 10 years ago

425
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
Yeah I think so I mean

426
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
I think in our society

427
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
You know in the United States for the most part

428
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,631
We're extremely fortunate that there are a lot of job

429
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
And if you do have a choice not everyone does

430
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
But if you have a choice

431
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
And you can do something you're passionate about

432
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
With the majority of your time

433
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
Or you can do something you don't like doing like

434
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,503
You know I got an if you're lucky and fortunate to have the choice then you should do what your passion

435
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
So it do you think people to be driving cars in 20 years

436
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Just curious

437
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
In major Urban environments I do not think so

438
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
I think maybe we'll go to amusement parks to do that

439
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Wow

440
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
In 20 years

441
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Incredible
