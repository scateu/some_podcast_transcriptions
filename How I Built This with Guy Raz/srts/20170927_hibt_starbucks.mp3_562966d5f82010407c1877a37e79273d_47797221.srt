14

When I returned

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
I never had planned to come back I would say that they were people both on the board at the time and many people.

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
Starbucks in certainly hundreds of people of Wall Street that said you're bringing him back

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Mean

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
NPR how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealist

19
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Stories behind the movements they built

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Today I will pour kid from the projects in Brooklyn turn the small coffee company

21
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,832
Seattle the third largest restaurant chain in the world

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,024
Time in America when a typical coffee experience

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
Involved a styrofoam cup

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
Like a PTA meeting or a church social and it was usually served at of a giant aluminum

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Warming up that coffee for hours and hours to be a cardboard box of happiness

26
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Glazed donuts next to it

27
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
And if you have no idea what I'm talking about consider yourself lucky

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Because you may not know how hard it was to find good coffee in America before Starbucks

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
I know I know some of you are hater some of you wouldn't be caught dead in a Starbucks

30
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
Corporate and that's okay that's totally fine but just consider for a moment

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
How much coffee culture in America owes to Starbucks

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Am to Howard Schultz

33
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Because if he hadn't stumbled into a little Coffee Bean & Spice Shop in Seattle called Starbucks

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
1981

35
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
It may never have become what it is today

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Not the time Starbucks was just a local chain in Seattle and it didn't sell brewed coffee just

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,608
But Howard was so blown away by the

38
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
Quality of the copy he tasted from those beans that he quit his job and beg the owners of Starbucks

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:56,640
The hire him then six years later when those same owners decided to sell

40
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,760
Howard raise the money to buy the company and just a few years after that

41
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
He took Starbucks National

42
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
That today there are 27,000 Starbucks location in roughly 70 countries around the world

43
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Which isn't bad for a kid who grew up poor in Brooklyn a couple weeks ago in the Seattle

44
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,752
I sat down with Howard in front of a live audience to hear about how he took that Seattle Coffee Bean shop

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
And turned it into the Starbucks we know today

46
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,200
Thank you very much

47
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,600
They didn't think you would be here that's why they true soul I do whatever they could not believe you walked out

48
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
They were just amazed

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
How many cups of coffee do you drink everyday

50
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
Probably four or five a day

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Four five

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
No caffeine after 5 p.m.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Turn up

54
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
And what what is your

55
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Preferred copy drink

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
French Press of aged Sumatra would be my

57
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Number one choice

58
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Alright okay okay good

59
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
I still have Starbucks people here

60
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,624
A lot of people know that you were raised in a housing

61
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Bayview in Brooklyn

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Can you

63
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Can you describe the apartment that you grew up in

64
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,095
Sure I grew up in Canarsie which is at the last stop

65
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Of the L train in Brooklyn

66
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
In a housing project that had 34 building

67
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Two bedroom apartment

68
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
For my mother and father

69
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Sister and brother

70
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
I think the rent

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
In 1956 was $96 and

72
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Well

73
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Who did people live there

74
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,159
Who live there were people who are construction workers cab drivers plumbers

75
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
And it was a childhood that was

76
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Based on

77
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
A real sense of community

78
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
And because they were

79
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
People with like-minded values

80
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
And it was a very diverse group of people

81
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,103
And I think it an early age I learned how to get along with a lot of different people because we were in one building with one elevator

82
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
And you had to go on

83
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Yeah

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Your dad

85
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
World War II that

86
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Yes he was a

87
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
A driver

88
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Mom

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Receptionist

90
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,279
I guess I was certain point when you were a kid your dad got injured on the job

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
My dad had a

92
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Series of

93
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
What I would Lucy describes

94
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Really bad Blue Collar jobs

95
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
And he went from

96
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
One job to another

97
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
In the winter months

98
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
Of March of 1960 he was a

99
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
Delivery driver busy probably is one of his worst jobs

100
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,039
Picking up and delivering cloth diapers before the invention of Tampa

101
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,135
He fell on a sheet of ice and broke his hip in his leg

102
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
And I came home from school and he was kind of laid out on the couch

103
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Eyewitness

104
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
What are Loosely described is the fracturing of

105
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
American Dream

106
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
And despair hopelessness

107
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
And what happened in 1960 if you were a blue collar

108
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
You know I uneducated worker

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
Despite the fact that you have served your country World War II

110
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,479
It was no workman's compensation there was no healthcare and you were dismissed

111
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
But what eyewitness scarred me

112
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
And that's what we

113
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Kind of went through

114
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Were you good students get

115
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,423
I was not a good student I don't think I applied myself very well

116
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
But an athlete you were I was in a

117
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
Yeah that was an athlete because in the projects

118
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
The entire day was spent in the schoolyard

119
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
I'm in a concrete schoolyard playing any sport that you could invent

120
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Or organize

121
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Do a dive on concrete

122
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
To win

123
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
Nn

124
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,583
It's what my competitiveness I think was born out of being that kid in that schoolyard

125
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
You know I became a very good high school football play

126
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
Which is so weird to think about cuz you're pretty trimmed I right I mean you're not like a

127
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Big

128
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Huge

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
You know how can't really guy right but it's like very good and you were recruited by a

130
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
But I was a fast white guy

131
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Got it

132
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
So you so you are recruited by

133
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
Northern Michigan University to go

134
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
Play football there and and did you think that mean

135
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
Did you think there was any possibility you might go

136
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
To the no no no no

137
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455
I never thought I was going to be good enough in a sack when I got the northern Michigan and I saw the size of these guys

138
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
And you know real Midwestern Grit

139
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
The toughness and the competitiveness of what I experienced in the schoolyard started drifting

140
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Did you get any playing time I got hurt right away

141
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
I know it sounds funny but at the time you know i n n here's the thing a very famous guy

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Was ahead of me in my position and that was Steve Mariucci

143
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,807
Great player became the coach of the San Francisco 49ers and he was much better

144
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
So football was not hard you are not going to play professional so you had to go out and get a job after you graduate what do you

145
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
What are you doing

146
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
I was very fortunate that when I finish school

147
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
I somehow convinced people

148
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
At Xerox to hire me

149
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
What do you need to come inside

150
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,567
I had no training I don't know I did not have a business degree at a communications degree from northern Michigan

151
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
But I I

152
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Got a sales job at Xerox

153
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
This is 1976

154
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
And at Xerox

155
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
At first I sent you to a

156
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Sales training school in Leesburg Virginia

157
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
And after that

158
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
For 6 months all you do is make 50 cold calls a day

159
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
But I'm not talking on the phone you used to go make a physical Coco

160
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Into an office

A lead

166
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319

To sell the product you and I'll give it you an intern basic

169
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
You had to give it to the salesperson

170
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
Am I salary in 1976

171
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
I tell my kids to go that's not true

173
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
And I gave half of it to my mother

174
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Does living at home

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,639
So are you good at I mean were you good at cold calling and I was really good

176
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
You would like you like you like getting lunch at the time so I didn't like cold calling but once I became

177
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
A salesperson at Xerox

178
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
It was clear to the

179
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
People of Xerox that I had some Talent

180
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
And I stayed there a number of years but I

181
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
All along I knew

182
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
That the

183
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,935
The discipline the regimentation the lack of

184
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Kind of

185
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
Personal creativity

186
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,103
I was very restless and I was looking for a way out

187
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
So

188
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
It was enjoyable

189
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
I wasn't happy

190
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,831
It's interesting because a lot of people we've had on the show like Sara Blakely who started Spanx started out

191
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
You know selling the door to door

192
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
Do you think that was an important I do because I think the rejection

193
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Of cold calling the humility that comes with the disappointment of not someone saying yes to you

194
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,263
I went through a steep learning curve and I started having a higher level of self-esteem

195
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,871
Xerox and IBM at that point in the mid-seventies were two kind of

196
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
Pedigree companies that you could call somebody working for Xerox

197
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
People felt

198
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551
Kind of good about you until I told my mother I was leaving Xerox

199
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
And she started crying but I knew in my heart early on that I had an entrepreneurial

200
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Ask for something

201
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Different

202
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
And was looking for a different kind of offer

203
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
So would you be

204
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
So I left Xerox because

205
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
A friend of mine

206
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Shared with me that there was a Swedish company

207
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
Opening an office in New York

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
And looking for gentleman

209
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
And I had no idea what the

210
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
The product really was

211
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
Met the person who was in charge

212
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Of moving from Sweden to New York

213
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And he and I

214
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Mayday

215
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Immediate connection and he became a life

216
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Long friend

217
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
And mentor to me and higher

218
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
And his name was Kai alyacen

219
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
And and what were you saying

220
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,359
At first we were selling they were opening up a division for furniture

221
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
And I had to move to North Carolina for a year

222
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Washer and I were dating a New York

223
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:10,879
You had met Sherry around this time your wife and I met in 1978 on July 4th

224
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
And this was 19

225
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
80 or so

226
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
North Carolina was not for me

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,959
And so I went to Kai and I said I want to come back to New York or I'm going to leave the company

228
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:30,335
And he said I kind of think about all this me figure out what to do and he

229
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Gave me the general manager job

230
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
The consumer division in New York

231
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
And unbeknownst to me on a trip to San Francisco to see our largest customer which was

232
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Macy's at the time

233
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,951
On the way back from California I stopped in Seattle because it was a small

234
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
Coffee company called Starbucks selling his product

235
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
And it was a non-electric kind of thermos coffee maker and I walked into the

236
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
The Pike Place store and I just said

237
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:04,895
I literally

238
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
Had the kind of epiphany that just spoke to me that this is such an extraordinary thing

239
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
About what they were doing and the coffee the romance the passionate people

240
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Plaid and I I met the founders and over a course of a year I prefer

241
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Sueded them

242
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
Fireman here's what I don't get what was it mean they were selling

243
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,359
Playing coffee beans which is it

244
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
But

245
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,991
I mean you have this really great job an apartment in New York and

246
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
What majors

247
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
Think I have got to drop everything and sell coffee bean roaster things going on I think she and I we had it under

248
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
Standing that we did not want to raise our

249
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Orchids near

250
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
We wanted to get out

251
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,399
And I was in Seattle on this spectacular Majestic day like today

252
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
So

253
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
The combination of all of that

254
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
And the experience I had as a customer

255
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,383
And watching what was going on in that

256
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
First store

257
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,783
I just immediately was kind of Swept Away with this is the kind of

258
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Environment

259
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Product

260
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
And young company I like to be part of and I

261
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Over course of a year

262
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Just kept banging the door to say to the founders

263
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
If you expand the company

264
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,935
I think I can help you in and their dream and nothing against them their dream at the time was 2

265
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Expand to Portland Oregon that was there

266
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Big idea

267
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,151
And was that I mean part of your vision for the company that time do you think we can expand and continue to sell

268
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Coffee Bean

269
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
You know I think

270
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
I had to learn the business

271
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,343
So I didn't know anything different at that time until I went to Italy

272
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
A year later in 1983

273
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
Drinker but I I did not know much about like Maxwell House and

274
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Whatever

275
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,447
Sharp sorry

276
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Come on

277
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,591
So you knew something about that I knew enough

278
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
That I had a

279
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Great appreciation for the coffee I tasted for the first time

280
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
At the original Pike Place store and I was just blown away

281
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
We had four stores at the time and then the founder

282
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
Send me to Milan Italy

283
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,303
First trip for me to Italy to a trade show representing Starbucks and

284
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
That's when I was walking the streets of Milan and every 20-30 yards you are intercepted

285
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
Literally with a

286
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Italian coffee

287
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
And I walked into all these places and kept seeing the theater the romance

288
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
And the

289
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
The nectar of the Gods which is espresso a big sort of copper espresso

290
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
The Elegant Style but what really struck me was the sense of community

291
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,095
And I started going to the stores

292
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Almost the same time everyday and I would start seeing the same people are realizing that this

293
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
What is a third place between home and work but the beverage was a draw and so I

294
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
I realized while I was in Italy that

295
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Starbucks

296
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
Was in the coffee business but perhaps the wrong part of the business and I raced back

297
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
With such

298
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Enthusiasm in such passion that I overwhelmed them when I got back you said we've got

299
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
Got to do this we got to sell brewed coffee cuz it we're not selling book right now there was no service of

300
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Any cup of coffee at any Starbucks was just pounds of coffee for homies and you come back into Seattle and you say

301
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,711
Guys we have got to do this it's going to be huge and they say

302
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
No

303
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:59,135
They viewed the beverage business in their parlance as being in the restaurant

304
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
And it didn't like

305
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
There is Messi

306
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
And that's not what they wanted to do

307
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
So

308
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
I literally

309
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Pounded on the table for a year

310
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
And I think they just said okay

311
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Get this kid out of her face

312
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,823
And we're opening a new store on the corner of

313
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
4th and spring in 1985

314
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
It was 1500 square feet

315
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
And they said will give you 500

316
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
Seed of the 1500 to open up an Italian coffee bar in the store

317
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
And

318
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
That was it I mean so we opened

319
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
The fortune Springs Starbucks store with their first coffee bar

320
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Overnight

321
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
We had

322
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Hundreds

323
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Of customers everyday

324
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,215
And we introduced caffe latte the city of Seattle basically

325
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
Now here's the rub

326
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
It was

327
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
So successful that it completely dwarf

328
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
The other side of the bed

329
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
And

330
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
The two founders

331
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
At the time

332
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Did not like

333
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
The disproportionate level

334
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Obssales

335
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
And how the store was function

336
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,767
And they respectfully said to me

337
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
We don't want to repeat this

338
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
And I was crushed

339
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
I was thinking how could you possibly this is look what's going on here

340
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Not to mention we're making more money

341
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Yeah

342
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
I was devastated

343
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Imeson believe it at first

344
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
If you really are you serious

345
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
And so

346
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
I think she knew I was

347
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Depressed

348
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
And

349
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
I came home one night and said

350
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
I don't think I can work for anyone anymore

351
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
I'm leaving sermon

352
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
I'm going to start my own

353
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
So I told

354
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
The two Founders what I was doing

355
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
And then they surprised me and said

356
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
Well if you do that

357
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
We'd like to invest in

358
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
Which is pretty cool. But here's

359
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
Here's the rub

360
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
But of course you're going to use Starbucks coffee

361
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,087
They invested and kind of gave me legitimacy

362
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,463
To open up an Italian coffee bar in the Columbia Center Tower when the building open

363
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
I sign that lease with a

364
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Developer in Seattle

365
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
Very famous guy here locally called Martin selig

366
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
700 Square ft

367
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
And he asked me for personal guarantee

368
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
I said sure I'm

369
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,895
I've no problem with that and by the way you are you're like 32 years old

370
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
And we had nothing so he wanted to personally guarantee I guarantee it

371
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,671
But knew there was nothing behind it and we open the store

372
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
Call Guild ranalli I went back to Italy I did a lot more research I spend more time there and I named the company after the attack

373
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
Italian newspaper in Milan

374
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
And we opened

375
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Too stores in Seattle

376
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,287
And then it was a great location in Vancouver BC

377
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,639
And we sure that's open to Vancouver

378
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
So we open three stores

379
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,087
We're raising money to do that by the way how did you do that anywhere or people Cersei

380
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Of course I wanted Howard Schultz on my gosh you know future genius CEO please take my money was it really

381
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,119
Easier to get that money the truth of the matter is that I spoke to 242

382
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
People

383
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Try and raise

384
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
1700000 dollars

385
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
24 Mildred

386
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
And Starbucks was a seedinvest

387
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Did not give me enough money to open up a store

388
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
And Starbucks put a little

389
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Contract in which was

390
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
You have to raise

391
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
$600,000

392
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
To use r200

393
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,207
So I went out and try to raise money was having a very hard time you reminding me of

394
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Cold calling

395
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Lottery Jackson

396
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Because

397
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
I remember people said

398
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Let me

399
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Try and understand this

400
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
The name of the company has a name no one can pronounce

401
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
You're going to sell coffee for two to three dollars a cup of coffee in a paper cup

402
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
With Italian names that no one's ever heard of

403
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
And you want to give Healthcare to your employer

404
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
And it was a tough sell

405
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Now

406
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
Our first investor is in this audience

407
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Her name is Carol Bobo

408
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
I don't know where she is

409
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,536
Well

410
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
Errol Carroll that was a good move

411
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
Em Carroll

412
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Was Shari's dearest friend

413
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
And we went over to their house

414
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
I had all this business plan at the pitch and everything and

415
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
Carol and her husband said we don't need any

416
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Pitch

417
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Just going to trust

418
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Already checked

419
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
But that night and gave me $100,000

420
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
And things started happening after that what was your ambition mean

421
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,584
Did you did you think this is going to be a national chain of coffee

422
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Coffee bar

423
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
His interesting story

424
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
So the original business plan was 100

425
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
And we weren't raising any money

426
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Because people didn't believe we could

427
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Open 100

428
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
And I didn't even have enough

429
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Funds resources

430
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
The kind of professionally reprint

431
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
The document

432
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,600
So I figured out a way to kind of white out

433
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
The hundred

434
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
And I wrote 75

435
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
So we opened our first store

436
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
Innate

437
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
6

438
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
And then a year after

439
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Jury

440
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
The founder of Starbucks

441
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,312
Had acquired Peet's Coffee Company many people don't realize that pizza Starbucks were one company

442
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Two years prior.

443
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Injury K to me and Sheridan

444
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Candyman Zedd

445
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
We run into some financial trouble

446
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
And we can have to split to company

447
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
And I decided I'm going to move to California and I want to keep Pete

448
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
The person who should buy Starbucks issue

449
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
And so

450
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
The prices

451
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
One-time sales

452
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
6 doors

453
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
3.8 million.

454
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Which was

455
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
You know I was fantastic news

456
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
And

457
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
I'll give you a 90-day exclusive to try and

458
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Come back to me

459
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
With 3.8 million.

460
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
So I was

461
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Extraordinarily

462
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Excited

463
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
But I didn't know where I was going to get the money

464
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,464
Yeah and so now we had to go back out and raise money

465
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,512
And it was very difficult

466
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
So how did you do it

467
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
We went back to the original destivelle giornali

468
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Some of them were interested but a lot of them weren't

469
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,008
Because Elgin only had three stores we weren't we can prove anything

470
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Show

471
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,896
You know Jerry kept checking in with me to see how are you doing on the fundraising and

472
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Matt 60 days in

473
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
I said we're about halfway there

474
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
And I'm confident that we'll we'll get the 3.8 million.

475
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
And

476
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
He said I have to sit down and tell you something

477
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
We have a competitive

478
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
I said

479
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
Drake

480
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
You told me we had an exclusive what do you mean

481
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,912
And he said one of your investors

482
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Rebuild your knowledge

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Has

484
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Showing up

485
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
And offered me $40 cash with no due diligence

486
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
And I was like

487
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
I'm I I just

488
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
I can remember that moment as if

489
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
My

490
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
The world just ended

491
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Because I knew who it was

492
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
You told me

493
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
And

494
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
The person at the time

495
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
There were three business Titans

496
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
In Seattle

497
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
And he was one of them

498
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
And they had invested in elderly as a group

499
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,192
I didn't know what to do and Jerry said

500
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
I will hold for 90 days but

501
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
You have to know

502
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
On the 90th day I have to sell

503
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Two or three days later

504
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
I'm playing basketball

505
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
And a friend of mine who is my Young attorney at the time

506
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Scott Greenberg

507
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
I tell him the story that night after the game

508
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
And

509
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,232
Him trying to help me as a friend and as a lawyer says

510
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
You need to come to

511
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816

I didn't know who the senior partner was I know anything

514
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
So I go to the office following morning at 8 a.m.

515
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
And he takes me into the office to me

516
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Bill Gates Senior

517
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,432

00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,040
With Scott and Bill Gates Senior said tell me the entire story

00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
We don't know each other just ask you this question one time

522
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Is everything you told me true

523
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
And I said it's 100%

524
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
And he says to me when take a walk

525
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
And I said

526
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Where we going

527
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,152
And

528
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
He says

529
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
We're going to see the man

530
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
My heart was racing

531
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
With such

532
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,904
Anxiety trepidation he's taking you to see

00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,744
This guy I'm not saying the name but he keeps taking me to see

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,536
Be competitive buyer

535
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
So 10 minutes later we walk cross street

536
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Got the office building

537
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Can we walk into this man's office

What's 7

540
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
And

541
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
Admit 80s he was in his prime

542
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
And he was a force

543
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,920
And we walked in at office

544
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
And

545
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
All I remember him saying is

546
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
You should be ashamed of yourself

547
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,112
Then you're going to steal this kid's dream

548
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
It's not going to happen

549
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,464
You and I both know this is not going to have

550
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
And

551
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
Within 10 minutes

552
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
He told them to stand down

553
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
We're walking out of this office

554
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
And this kid's buying discount

555
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:54,336
In just a moment

556
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,176
Howard Schultz explains how Starbucks spread from Seattle

557
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
East coast and then all around the world

558
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,648
I'm guy Raz new listening to how I built this recorded live in Seattle

559

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

568
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
That guy rides

569
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,696
It's 1987 and Howard Schultz is just

570
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Starbucks witch

571
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
6 doors at the time

572
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
And yet

573
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Grand Vision of a

574
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Spending all across

575
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,376
The country facts

576
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,288
Call Mike hobby shops Warren Oliver cities like they are today and the idea of hanging out in 1/4

577
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Hours

578
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
Or working in one or catching up with friends

579
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
Passing the time

580
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,320
Until when Howard started sharing his vision of rolling out these copy stores

581
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Coast to Coast

582
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
Lots of people were like

583
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Crazy idea

584
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,488
A lot of people said that

585
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,072
We Believe early on that what we had seen in Italy

586
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
It was replicable in America

587
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
True in American lamps

588
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
It was thinking let's create a store that

589
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,848
Not only is a store for coffee but produces the sense of community

590
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Between home and work

591
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
And

592
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,272
I think early on we realized that the brand we were about to build

593
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Was going to be experiencing

594
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
I mean

595
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,952
How how did Starbucks do in in the first few years after you bought it because

596
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
You weren't

597
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Comfortable

598
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Right away right now we weren't profitable

599
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,096
But in order to grow the company

600
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
And Theresa money

601
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,216
We said kind of metaphorically we want to build a hundred stories

602
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Skyscraper

603
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,104
Well we're going to have to invest to build a foundation so we started investing heavily

604
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Like any other startup

605
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
In people and processes

606
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,552
And it infrastructure and so the company lost money

607
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
Almost from the day I bought it

608
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Yeah

609
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
An investors I think

610
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
Understood early on

611
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
That we were going to lose money in order to build a much bigger company

612
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
What mean

613
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
As you begin to expand and grow Beyond

614
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
The Pacific Northwest and I think

615
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
Your first location was in Chicago

616
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
What was the secret I mean was it was was it building a narrative around Starbucks around the beans

617
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Farmers around the

618
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
You know around the story of coffee

619
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,112
Is that how you were able to bring people into the

620
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Into the stores

621
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
For something we did go to Chicago

622
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
Hazard first city outside in Northwest

623
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
And it did not work right away

624
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
So

625
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,936
I got fooled very easily because I selected that location in the summer

626
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
And then when the winter came

627
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,360
It did not have an interior entrance into the building

628
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,944
So the customers had a walk out of the building

629
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
In a cold winter Chicago to get started

630
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
You know what

631
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Didn't do it

632
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
But we wouldn't have any any extra resources for traditional advertising or marketing we did none of that in even today

633
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Starbucks

634
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
Is not a traditional marketing come

635
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
And it sounds

636
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Really old-fashioned but we built the company

637
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
One customer at a time one cup of time

638
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
And I think we were we got a lot of positive

639
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
PR

640
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
About

641
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
The equity of the brand experience

642
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
And

643
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
People started

644
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Anticipating that we would come to their City

645
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,368
He probably that the best example that is what happened when we open

646
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
Now I'm going to fast forward

647
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
In 1996 we opened in Tokyo Japan for the fur

648
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
What happened

649
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
So

650
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
No one at Starbucks had any International experience

651
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
No

652
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
And we told our board we're going to open up

653
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
We think of Japan

654
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
The first state the board

655
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,592
Said we should probably hire an outside resource to consult a word that really

656
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
It gives me hives

657
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
If you have a IRA

658
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
A consultant

659
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
It means that we don't really know our business

660
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
And

661
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
They went away and they produced is

662
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,440
Big report and before they presented to the board they gave me the bad news and said Japan will be a disaster

663
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,560
You can't go there Starbucks no smoking policy will not work

664
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
And no one no person in the entire country will ever eat or drink in the street because you will lose

665
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Loose face

666
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,568
Any Yunnan economics of Real Estate

667
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
You can't sell enough coffee in Japan to pay the rent

668
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
And

669
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
I convinced the board that I believe

670
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
The Japan woodworker

671
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,648
Just based on what an instinct on I'm going to guess I just

672
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
I just knew

673
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
I mean I just I just felt we had to have the courage of our convictions

674
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,400
Going to be a national and a global company

675
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,544
We have to go somewhere in Japan had a direct flight from Seattle Department

676
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Okay so

677
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
We make the mistake

678
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
Of opening up our first store in the middle of August

679
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Westin Tokyo

680
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,552
So those are going to Japan in August

681
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,600
Humidity is 100%

682
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
95 degrees

683
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
You're in the street for 5 minutes and you need to shower

684
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,792
And we didn't have any cold coffee or frappuccino at that time nothing like

685
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
It was hot coffee

686
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Show the night before

687
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,240
It's kind of a celebratory dinner with our Japanese partner

688
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
And is an interpreter

689
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
I'm thinking

690
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Tomorrow is just not going to go well

691
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,944
I can feel it it sends me a problem

692
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,320
So I tell the partner for The Interpreter that I think you should expect since it's so warm

693
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
I can be a big open

694
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
Anticipate the fact that we have to build this business

695
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
And wait for the cold weather

696
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
Amyotrophy

697
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Braids

698
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Tell him what I said

699
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,656
Wow

700
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
I find out

701
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
10 minutes later

702
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
That The Interpreter said Mr Shield said it's going to be the biggest Starbucks opening up

703
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Did you really do that

704
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,856
So I get to my hotel room and I get a call

705
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
From someone in Seattle who sings

706
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Static

707
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
See

708
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,768
We got CNN to cover the opening live

709
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Oh wow

710
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
And I'm dying

711
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,680
This is it

712
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
At 6 a.m. in the morning

713
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
We're driving up to the store

714
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
And

715
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
There's a lineup

716
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Of hundreds of

717
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Japanese people

718
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
On the street

719
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,272
And I turn to save interpreter

720
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
And I say

721
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,904
Did you hire extras

722
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,976
And of course no

723
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
And

724
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
We cut the ribbon

725
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Gary Young

726
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,400
Japanese college student who slept overnight

727
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
Run to the front of the line and we following

728
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,800
Any says double tall latte

729
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,296
With Seoul

730
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
Crazy to me is that

731
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
Azure expanding

732
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
In the early 90s

733
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,256
None of these huge players and coffee like Nestle your

734
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,096
You know the other companies got into that game I mean they could have

735
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
Trust you if they wanted to

736
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
Do what you did why didn't they see that opportunity

737
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,616
And I've been asked that many times I think the large companies just never believed

738
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,200
That you could build a national company and brand

739
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Around selling coffee

740
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
In the cup

741
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
I just think they were naive

742
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Maybe arrogant

743
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,928
And they gave us a lot of Runway

744
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
You guys started to do all kinds of branding Partnerships

745
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
In the 90s

746
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:50,400
Ice cream makers with supermarkets bottled Frappuccino candy companies record companies

747
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Were you ever worried that

748
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
You were diluting the brand

749
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,568
We were very disappointed a lot of things but we turn down

750
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Hundreds

751
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
People wanted

752
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
To do with us

753
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,688
And I think we were trying to say was

754
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,504
Will our customers give us license

755
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
To sell

756
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,344
Coffee remember this was a huge incision back

757
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Then

758
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,928
As to whether Starbucks should be in Costco

759
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Discount the coffee

760
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
What's a great debate inside the company because

761
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,608
How could you sell at a Costco to Discount your stores

762
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,216
And it what happened was we introduced hundreds of thousands of people at Starbucks who never been in

763
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:30,592
Bottled frappuccino in a JV with Pepsi became a multibillion-dollar business

764
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,432
And we started believing that we could build a brand in our store

765
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
And then extend it

766
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
Into another form factor in the grocery store

767
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
And

768
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,184
We also learned that many people got introduced to Starbucks through bottle crap and get it

769
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,792
I guess around age 47 48 you

770
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Step down

771
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
The first time

772
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,400
As a CEO the company at that point

773
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Is doing 2 billion in Revenue

774
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,800
You're pushing more stores outside the US why did you step down

775
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
I felt like I was repeating myself

776
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
I felt I was

777
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:13,856
No longer engaged in the fun creative part of the businesses where I get the most Joy

778
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,416
What were you what were you doing when we fought

779
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,720
Mia between the lawyers

780
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
DHR shoes

781
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,376
You just what it was I was not having fun

782
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,704
I just decided that I needed a break from

783
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
The Madness of it and were you able to really step away away

784
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Company

785
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248
And ask him and I should have been paying kind of more more attention to the company but I

786
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
I started doing other things

787
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
One of which was the Seattle SuperSonics

788
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
Which weekend we can talk about or not I think we're going to leave that one

789
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:59,168
I'm not proud of that

790
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,568
Who wrote a famous memo to the bull

791
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
Gordon Diecast 2007

792
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,712
Were you expressed regret over the commoditization of the brand

793
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
What was going on

794
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,624
Was two things going on at that point first update the country was heading into a cataclysmic Financial

795
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
But I think

796
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
And I look back on those years I would describe it as the years of you

797
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
I got Starbucks was growing

798
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
At a pace in which growth and

799
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Success

800
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
Began to cover up a lot of mistakes

801
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
And like what kind of steaks

802
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
TUMI stores cannibalizing other stores

803
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
Did not the financial controls and discipline that work

804
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,224
Warren place we're not being leveraged

805
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
And

806
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
I think the big mistake though

807
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
Was Wall Street in the stock price

808
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
Became an albatross on the company's neck

809
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
And so growth became

810
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
The strategy the company and growth is not a strategy

811
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
A10 Grossmont what

812
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
That customer service was wasn't as good that the

813
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,312
Product was not good that the experience of going to a Starbucks wasn't as good

814
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,384
Rothman too many stores too fast in areas that

815
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,920
Should not have had a Starbucks

816
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
And secondarily

817
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
The experience

818
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,552
We should Define the essence of the company

819
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
Was being compromised by efficiency

820
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,720
In the company in a management team at that time started measuring

821
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Yield

822
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Sales per hour

823
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
And doing things that

824
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
We're so diluted

825
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,728
To the essence of the foundation of the company and it really started

826
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
I think upsetting me

827
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,336
I began to go into the stores and not recognized

828
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
What we had built

829
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
What what did you see

830
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
Probably the signature thing that I saw

831
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
Was a new breakfast sound

832
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
That

833
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
Contaminated the odor of coffee

834
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
This is the grilled cheese

835
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
And not that it was

836
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,072
Wrong thing to do but it was executed so poor like the the Starbucks smell like

837
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Yeah

838
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
Around 2008

839
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Starbucks share price hits a record low

840
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
Some analysts are saying its days were numbered

841
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Were they really

842
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
I'm at the time I didn't think so

843
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
But I knew we were

844
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
In a downward spiral and

845
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
The company needed to go through a major transfers

846
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
And when I returned a CEO which

847
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
I never had plan to come back

848
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,120
I would say that they were people both on the board at the time and many people at Starbucks

849
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
And certainly

850
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
Hundreds of people of Wall Street

851
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
It said you're bringing him back

852
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Mean

853
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
He's the problem

854
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Really

855
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
And the analysts in the media we're not very kind

856
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
But when I came back

857
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
I came back for two reasons and that is

858
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,600
What it means to love something in the responsibility that goes with it

859
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
When you told your wife Sherry

860
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
That you were going to do this

861
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
What was the response I mean

862
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
100% supported

863
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,608
I mean she went through the same pain I was going through and watching what we had built

864
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Yeah

865
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:14,752
And knew I had to go back and you were gone from from running it for almost 8 years

866
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,848
Did you think you were just going to go in quickly stabilize it and then go back out

867
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
I don't think I knew what I know how long I would stay at that

868
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
But I think as we discussed earlier

869
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
The problems

870
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
We're so severe

871
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
And

872
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
Every rock that I turned over

873
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Was worse than I had imagined

874
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
To the point where I had I made some very drastic

875
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
Decisions you at the shop

876
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
600 stores

877
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:45,216
We closed 900 stores and 90% of them had been open less than a year

878
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
The thing that I did that was probably most telling

879
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
Was when we decided to close the stores

880
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
For training

881
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
A12

882
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Every Storm

883
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Was closed

884
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
How much did it cost

885
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
I think we estimated

886
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
About 24 million dollars

887
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
Empress of lost sales

888
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
And labor so you're bored just love this

889
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,095
The shareholders love this things that I did that people said

890
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
He's really lost it

891
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
What's a training

892
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,519
Was so vitally important because Starbucks Coffee Company

893
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Forgot

894
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
How to make

895
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Quality

896
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
And

897
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
We had everybody in the company we train

898
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Now

899
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
The thing that galvanizing Tire Company

900
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
Was something else

901
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
And that was we were in room one day and I said

902
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
I feel like I need to communicate

903
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,743
With every single store manager

904
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
In person

905
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Dennis Wilson 2008

906
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,423
This is during the crisis with no company was traveling at 8

907
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,495
You can't get 10,000 people to do what you going to do and I said no

908
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,359
I want to go somewhere we can get 10000 store managers in a like a

909
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
We talkin about

910
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:06,367
By the way this event cost about 30 million dollars at a time and we didn't have the money

911
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
Why everybody there

912
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Ya food

913
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Everything

914
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Until

915
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
I had to give a $39 fee

916
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
Yeah this is the of the ten thousand storm

917
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
And I'm

918
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,007
I'm running some notes and couple hours before from my colleagues at will

919
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Sometime the truth

920
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
The realtor

921
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
Because at this point I knew

922
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
We were really in trouble

923
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,063
I knew that we had about seven months left if we continue down this track

924
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
Where we would be

925
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Insult

926
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
And

927
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,767
I felt so strongly that I needed to trust our people

928
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
With the same information I had

929
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,143
And if and if I was going to ask them

930
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,191
To do the things that they needed to do

931
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Which mint take

932
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,287
Every single customer interaction soap

933
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
As if this is your last

934
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,663
And make it so personal to understand if we don't

935
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Correct the situation

936
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
You're not going to the Future Families

937
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
And you said that I said

938
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Yeah

939
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
How long

940
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
How long does it take

941
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
2

942
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
To recover

943
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Overnight we began to

944
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
Change the trajectory within 6 months

945
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
We were

946
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Starting to climb back

947
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
And within a year

948
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
It was a memory

949
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
However

950
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
The real question was

951
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
What did we learn

952
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
We were so hungry and so driven

953
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
When we started the company

954
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
But when we were that successful

955
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
People got sloppy they got lazy

956
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:45,695
And this is so vitally important success in any business

957
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
No matter what it is

958
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Is not an entitlement

959
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:56,447
It has to be earned we stop turning it and that's why we got in trouble

960
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,847
Building a company is a lonely place

961
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,199
Sometimes because you're imprinted especially as a man

962
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
Not demonstrating vulnerability

963
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,927
And I think one of the perhaps most undervalued characteristics of leadership

964
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Is

965
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
Vulnerability and asking for help

966
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
And I've done that a number times so I think it's important I think When You're vulnerable

967
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
Ask for help people come towards you

968
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
And I think I've

969
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,127
I've tried to do that every step of the way and be honest and truthful about what I know what I don't

970
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
And most importantly what I believe

971
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
I want to ask you about

972
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
Your approach to

973
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,087
Your employees you calling partners

974
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
They're eligible for

975
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
Healthcare

976
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:53,023
Education benefits you can now earn a degree through Arizona State University

977
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
Would you work at Starbucks at least 20 hours a week

978
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
Free college tuition

979
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
I'm all of this is very expensive

980
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
But it does buy you a lot of Goodwill from from the from the Publican from your employees is that why Starbucks does

981
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
No

982
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
Health insurance

983
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
Equity in the form of stock up

984
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Trying to prove something

985
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
To myself to my family

986
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
And many of us

987
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
Who were in the company

988
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
We're not born with a silver spoon

989
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,559
Many of us have come from similar

990
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Backgrounds

991
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,167
And I think customers began to realize we're paying these kids

992
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,495
Give me an ownership they had health insurance

993
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,871
Any intimacy that was built between the Barista and our customers because of the frequency

994
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
Begin to build your list turnover

995
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
With much less turnover then and today than anyone in our industry

996
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,439
The my dad is in the audience tonight here you flew up from LA to be here

997
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,095
What are you my dad what are you

998
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
What do you think your dad would have

999
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:07,519
Made of your success and if he was sitting in this hiding tonight and use hearing your story

1000
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
What are you

1001
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Think you would have

1002
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,383
About his son who

1003
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,199
Became one of the most successful entrepreneurs

1004
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,735
In modern American history

1005
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
My dad passed away in 87

1006
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
At the age of 65

1007
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
So he he didn't see any of the

1008
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
A success that we have enjoyed

1009
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
I think

1010
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
It would be so shell-shocked

1011
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
And and so proud

1012
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,751
And I think he would it would go back to what he experienced

1013
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
And I think

1014
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,359
What he would be most proud of is how we have treated

1015
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,991
Everyone in the company because he was that blue collar worker who is not respect

1016
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
For lack of Education

1017
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
And not being sophisticated

1018
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
And unfortunately never really

1019
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,671
Got the chance to

1020
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,999
Be himself or be valued in a company

1021
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,303
I hate he would Marvel at that

1022
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
In many many ways and I've said this

1023
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
Before

1024
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,215
The values of culture and guiding principles of

1025
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Starbucks

1026
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:17,151
Really are defined by me wanting to build the kind of company that my father never got a chance to work for

1027
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:23,551
Howard thank you so much

1028
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Howard Schultz step down as CEO

1029
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
Starbucks earlier this year he's now the executive chairman and you probably heard the rumor that he stepped

1030
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
Down in part to explore a

1031
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:45,055
Possible presidential run and I know I know you were probably dying for me to ask him all about this

1032
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,711
And I did but just backstage before the show and his answer was pretty koi

1033
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:58,111
Mostly says he's not really interested but when pressed on it he says Never Say Never

1034
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:04,511
Hey thanks so much for listening to the show this week this effort
