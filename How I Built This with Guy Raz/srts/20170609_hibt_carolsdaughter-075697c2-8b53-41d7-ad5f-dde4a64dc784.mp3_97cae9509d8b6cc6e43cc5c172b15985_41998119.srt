L'Oreal bought Carol's Daughter

34
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,128
2014 for an undisclosed amount of money but

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
You can safely bet that it was

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
For a lot

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Of money

38
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
But what

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,952
Is that Carol's Daughter literally started in Lisa prices

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Kitchen

41
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
A one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn

42
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
And if you haven't already guessed

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
It started out as a

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Because Lisa already had a career

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Pretty cool

46
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,288
In the 1980s

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
On The Cosby Show what should the time of course wasn't get tarnished because of Bill Cosby

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
It was the hottest TV show

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
In America

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,648
I thought that I had found the career that I was going to do for the rest of my life because

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
It was an amazing experience

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,560
It was particularly incredible being you know what

53
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
And African American woman

54
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
And

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
What that show

56
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Meant to me and my family

57
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
P2c

58
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
African American

59
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
Connected in you know such a

60
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
Positive light so it was something that

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
For me to be standing in the Huxtable kitchen the morning of my first table read as I'm listening to the

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
The cast read the script

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
The III could have just

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Floated off

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
That point I mean

66
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
Presumably

67
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
You know

68
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
I guess looking for the outside one would think

69
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
This is going to be a career like this is what you're going to do with your life but that is not what happened

70
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,544
No it's it's not I could have gone on to been a script supervisor

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Production coordinator associate producer perhaps

72
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
On the on the

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Operational side of

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Things

75
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,344
And if that is what I thought I was going really happy

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
I was

77
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Ecstatic

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
And I see

79
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Because I was

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Very happy

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
B at what I was doing with work

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
When I had my downtime and I was not at work

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
I didn't have that desperate feeling that

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
You feel

85
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
When you're like oh God

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm finally not at work and I just want to relax and I just wanted

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Veg-out you know

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
So I've became

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Creative when I was at home

90
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
How did the idea to

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Start making beauty products

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Even occur to you

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Well what

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,232
Initially happened was I'm a huge Prince fan and have been for many years

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
And I read an article about him and in that article

96
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,959
They talked about how he always smells very good and the reason for it was

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
He kept

98
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
An assortment of fragrances on his bureau

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
And it was also rumored that he put

100
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Chanel Number 5

101
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
His boots

102
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
So that whenever he took off his boots he didn't have to worry about his feet not smelling good

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Wow I could die I could see Princeton I just love this

104
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,119
Idea of this blending of fragrances and creating these unique set but you weren't thinking about this

105
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,727
Business no no not at all for you just like just to do for me

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,615
And that's what I began to do I learned that the way that your fragrance last on your body

107
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
Is you layer it so you wash with it you

108
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
Moisturize with it then you Spritz it on

109
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:15,135
So then I said well I don't I don't have moisturizers that smell like this where am I going to get that

110
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
And at first I started

111
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
Using lotions that I could get at the drugstore and I would

112
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
Put fragrances into them

113
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,959
And and blended it it didn't work that that wasn't you know balanced from a chemistry

114
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
Prospective so things would just separate and be kind of messy

115
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
And that led me into

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Looking into

117
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
Possibly making my own

118
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
And

119
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
One day I walked into

120
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
To dislike New Age kind of

121
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Bookstore

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,159
And there was a book on essential oils and the Art of perfumery

123
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,207
And in that book

124
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Were basic recipe

125
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Puppies for

126
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
I massage oil or

127
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Cream or balm

128
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
So then I thought this is great I can make my own lotion

129
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
And

130
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
You know the recipes were very like

131
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Barebones

132
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,919
You know they use things like paraffin and lanolin which I wasn't too

133
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Crazy about you saying I

134
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
I wanted to use

135
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
Beeswax and I wanted to find cocoa butter

136
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
I used the the skeleton of the recipe with in the book

137
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And then I just started adding

138
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,095
My own combinations and tweak it you know if something came out runny or too thick

139
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Thor

140
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Too oily or too stiff

141
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,007
Wow so you are like a literally melting down cocoa butter on your stove top

142
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,871
Cooking oils together and then

143
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Sing what came out

144
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Yes wow so that's right you start to melt a bunch of stuff and licks it

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Yeah I mean today you couldn't get old

146
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,487
Go on YouTube videos and get a good head start but

147
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Back then you just kind of had

148
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,143
Figure it out this was this was like what that the late 80s or the early 90

149
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
That was the late 80s

150
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
I began

151
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Selling

152
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Because I had actually gotten

153
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Something

154
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
That you don't

155
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Look good and work

156
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,479
And my mother encouraged me to sell at a church flea market

157
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
In May of 90

158
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
E3 what she was saying

159
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,415
Lisa the stuff is pretty good like you're you should sell this people might buy it

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
That that is pretty much verbatim What

161
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
There you go I did not say I said really mommy do you think people would pay for this

162
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,615
She said yes she said your Butters are good that you know my skin looks great and she was using it on my little brothers and sisters

163
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Prison

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
You know she said I think you should try

165
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
And I remember saying to my mom I said Mom what am I going to put them in because I just would give it to friends and family

166
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
So I put it in tupperware Rubbermaid you don't say I didn't think about

167
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Ajar

168
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Recycled baby food jars

169
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
I'm cuz my mom had adopted my baby sister Torah very recently so she

170
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
She had lots of babies

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Pujara's well

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
And we you know boil them on the stove like how you used to sanitize bottles back in the day

173
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
I put the cream in the baby food jars and made my labels by hand and I took them out to that flea market

174
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
And I sold out

175
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
What did you what did you call them

176
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,767
I called the company Carol's daughter I did have

177
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Have a name

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,911
And I called it Carol's Daughter because that's literally who I was

179
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
My mom was Carol and I

180
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
I was her daughter

181
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,543
And the products that I sold I called them

182
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Frequent moisture butter

183
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
At the time

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
So you show me the flea market by the way you are still

185
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
A writer's assistant on The Cosby Show

186
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Dislike your weekend side hustles

187
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
No by 90

188
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
3 Cosby had ended

189
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
And I

190
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
I thought I was a freelance

191
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
Person

192
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
But it was summer

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
Television typically in New York was very

194
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
Slow in the summer months

195
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Because you your season would end

196
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
In May and your new

197
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
New season wouldn't be

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Begin until sept

199
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
I'm so unless you were working on a pilot

200
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
You will probably off

201
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
During the summer

202
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
And that first

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Summer of

204
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Starting at that flea market

205
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Going to be end of May

206
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
I spent most of that

207
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Summer making money

208
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Selling at different

209
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Craft fairs and Expos and things

210
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Like that and I went back to work that fall

211
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
What did you how much money did

212
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Did you have to put into

213
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Blastoise

214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,959
That very first flea market honestly was an investment of $100

215
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
Between you know whatever the table rental was and

216
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,151
The ingredients that I had to purchase to fill the baby food jars that I had and

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,479
Maybe some flowers you know to decorate my table

218
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
And what I did I just kept reinvesting

219
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Because I didn't

220
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Have

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,231
Money that I could say oh well I'm just going to go pull 10000 out of my savings to

222
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Start this business

223
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,863
So it was something that started in a very small way of very organic way

224
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
And I didn't do anything that I couldn't afford to do

225
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
So if if someone told me about an expo

226
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
In Georgia

227
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,895
That's fantastic and the fee to get in it's only $5,000

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
I wasn't going there

229
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
But a table

230
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
You know in Park Slope

231
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
35 bucks

232
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
Okay what who is

233
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Who are your customers in that first summer

234
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:40,767
They were mostly African-American women that you know where in the different neighborhoods that I was in

235
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
I did have some customers who weren't African-American but for the most part that's who would come to my table

236
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
I was not deliberately saying this is for African-American women I was deliberately saying this is for dry

237
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
Dry skin and subsequently

238
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
When you have more melanin in your

239
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Skin

240
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
That dry skin will show

241
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
You you look dull you look a little bit at people say ashy

242
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
And you cannot get away from that

243
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,327
And that's how I probably at that time ended up with that audience

244
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Of

245
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
People who were more Brown

246
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Because they found something

247
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
That took away that Ash

248
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
So if you if you

249
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Pure African American women

250
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
In the early 1990s

251
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
Essentially there was very few options it did

252
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Really

253
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Few companies that were serving

254
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
4 Watts

255
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Yes very

256
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
There was definitely

257
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
A community that needed to be served

258
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Who was not necessarily being served

259
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
It was it was not something

260
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
That you could walk into a drugstore

261
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Look at that

262
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
This is fantastic great

263
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
It wasn't there

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
It is now but it wasn't then

265
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
So that summer of my teeth

266
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Three when you were like

267
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Selling

268
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Body butter in baby jars

269
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Flea market

270
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Did you think of this as you know as

271
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,647
Future did you think of this kind of fun little side project hang out with

272
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
People I know and

273
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
I'm having fun

274
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
At first

275
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
I thought about it as fun

276
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
And then

277
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Of that summer

278
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
I was watching an epic

279
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
Episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show and she was talking

280
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,311
People who had started businesses with little or no money

281
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
One person said well

282
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
You have to know that you

283
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
You're passionate about what you

284
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
You do you can't

285
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Start a business

286
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
This just because you want to make

287
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
A bunch of money

288
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Because it's going to take

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Too long

290
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,671
For you to make any money and if you're not passionate about it you will quit

291
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Before you make a

292
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Eddie Money

293
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
And I remember thinking

294
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm really passionate about

295
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
This stuff like I I like

296
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,911
I like doing this and then somebody else said

297
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
She would Define passion as

298
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,847
If someone woke you up out of your bed in the middle of the night would you go and do this thing

299
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,503
And I honestly could answer yes to that question and I'm someone who is very fond of sleeping

300
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
King and I love

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
A good ghetto lately been kind of thing and I realized yeah I would get up out of bed to do this because I really

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
We do enjoy it

303
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
And I remember sitting

304
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
On the edge of my bed and saying wait a minute

305
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Maybe this is

306
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
This could be a business

307
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
And

308
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
That day was the day that I realized

309
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
This just

310
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Doesn't have to be a hobby this

311
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Can be more

312
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,991
All right so that first summer ends and you go back to a job in t

313
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,343
And what happens to to the business to Carol's Daughter

314
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
It continues to grow

315
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
People

316
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Call

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
And say Hey you know I bought a jar cream from you

318
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
You know what

319
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Such and such

320
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Street fair

321
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
And I'm running out how can I get some more

322
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
And I would look at my

323
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
My schedule and

324
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
You know if I knew I was going to be home on

325
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Saturday as well

326
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,479
If you want to come by my apartment on Saturday I'll be home I'm working the rest of the week but I'll be home on Saturday what time

327
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Would you like to come by

328
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
And that was to be

329
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Beginning

330
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Of people coming

331
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
And shopping in my

332
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Apartments

333
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
And and that continued

334
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,607
To grow to the point where sometimes I would come home to nasty message

335
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,447
Someone didn't know that it wasn't an actual store

336
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,079
You know they heard about it from a friend and you know that your answering machine at home

337
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
So at this point

338
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
How did you get the word out

339
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
About Carol's Daughter

340
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Flea markets in MA

341
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Breitbart

342
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Get more people to know about

343
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
You know my my husband calls this

344
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
The sister girl net

345
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
It was literally

346
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
One woman telling another woman

347
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,887
And somebody always brought a friend

348
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
With them

349
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
And if you brought a friend

350
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Do you know get a free gift or you know something

351
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
Sing off it was all of that Grassroots type

352
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Stuff

353
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
And if I was out selling

354
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
Somewhere and someone asked me about something

355
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
If I didn't know how to make it I figured out how to make

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
So

357
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
I learned how to make bath salts I learned how to make bodies

358
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Scrubs

359
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Different types of moisturizers

360
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
I figured out how to make shampoo how to make

361
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Air conditioner

362
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,679
And it was it was just experimenting the way you would experiment cooking

363
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
And what did you decide to

364
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Leave TV in

365
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,847
Do this full-time I left television in 1996

366
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Because my son Forest

367
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Was due to

368
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
To be born April 5th

369
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Of that year

370
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
And

371
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
I realize that

372
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
If I can

373
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Continue to work

374
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,671
I would basically just give my paycheck to a babysitter

375
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
So it just logically made

376
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
Sense to let the job go

377
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
And see if

378
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
In being at home full-time while taking care of a baby

379
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Could the business

380
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Grow enough

381
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
We also at the

382
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Same

383
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Time

384
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
We were able to change

385
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
How and where we live

386
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
So

387
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
My aunt and uncle were

388
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Selling their home

389
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
They were selling it to someone else

390
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
And

391
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
I think there was

392
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Three tries at the

393
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
The closing and it just didn't happen

394
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,791
And I finally worked up the nerve

395
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
To ask

396
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Is there any way that we could purchase

397
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Your home

398
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
And we did it and so forest was born

399
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
March 18th of 90

400
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
B6

401
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
And May 22nd

402
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Can of 90s

403
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
We moved into

404
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
The home that we live in today

405
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
And it enabled us to

406
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,623
You don't have the space that we needed with a baby but also have space for the business to grow

407
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
And that was

408
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
That was a big turning point you know it was a huge difference

409
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
So many people coming in on Saturdays to shop you know there was a time where you would be like oh hi Diane

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Hi Susie hi Charles

411
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
And that was like I don't know any of

412
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
I never met you

413
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,687
The voice mailbox would fill up every hour and a half

414
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
My husband and I would you no wait

415
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,367
When did you last check the photo I checked it at 2:30 oh my God it's five

416
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,463
Get me a pen and paper and it's just

417
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
You just look at it and you and you can't

418
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,863
You can't believe it Lisa Price

419

453

Harrah's

454
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
Definitely should have started to focus on Carol's Daughter

455

Full-time

456
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Things started to take off

457
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Pretty fast

458
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
What was the turning point when did you when did something happen

459
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
Were you sad

460
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
This is like

461
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Bedtime

462
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Well because I've been in business for

463
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
For 24 years

464
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
And because

465
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Turning Point

466
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
And

467
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Success

468
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
And

469
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
You know those aha moments

470
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
AR

471
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Very relative

472
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Fluid there's been

473
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Several of those

474
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
So

475
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
You know there was

476
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,543
There was the moment when my second son Ennis was born

477
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
And I was in the hospital

478
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,223
I'm after having given birth and my husband walks into the hospital with

479
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Essence magazine

480
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
And I was in the November issue

481
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,671
And I actually had a half-page article with a picture

482
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
And my name

483
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Which was a really big deal

484
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
How did they know about it

485
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,935
There there were Beauty editors that lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood where I live

486
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
So

487
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
They were always in search of something different

488
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
And then because I worked

489
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Can television production

490
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
For so long and then my husband

491
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Continue to in

492
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
And still does

493
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
I would have access to

494
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Makeup artist

495
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
And hairstylist

496
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
And

497
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
If they

498
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
You know went on another production

499
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
They could reach out to me and I know I could send it to them

500
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
I remember hearing that Edie Falco loved a moisturizer of mine because

501
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
A makeup artist that I worked with on his show

502
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Shared it with

503
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
You know and I was like

504
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:07,199
I've never met Edie Falco to this day but she she loved one of my moisturizer

505
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:12,575
Wow so by 1999 you guys were able to open up like an actual ShopRite

506
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Yes

507
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,903
The first store that was not in my house

508
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Brick-and-mortar retail space

509
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
He said had windows and a door

510
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
And

511
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
The landlord

512
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
Wanted the space to be something else

513
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
And

514
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
I sent him a gift basket

515
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
For his wife

516
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Ana Package

517
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
With a letter about the bread

518
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
To convince him

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
That

520
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
My shop with

521
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
Be great in that location and because

522
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Of my letter

523
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,088
He decided that he was going to give me a shot and he wanted to meet

524
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
With me to go over

525
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
What's terms

526
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,232
So I'm sitting in this meeting feeling so Victorious I've convinced this guy that

527
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
You know my business is what he wants

528
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Put in here

529
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
He's so he said so

530
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,424
The terms of pretty basic I'm going to need

531
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
4 month deposit on the rent and Bubba Bubba and he's like talking other things and I'm quickly adding in my head

532
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
And I'm like that's 14th Ave

533
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,016
That's $14,000 that's $14,000

534
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Yeah

535
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
I have no clue

536
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
Where are we going to get $14,000 from

537
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
It worked out

538
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,352
We had some small account set up for our sons for their college

539
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,472
And we took it you know my my boys were very very young

540
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
You know we took

541
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,896
It up between their two accounts aye I don't know something like $3,500 out of the bank

542
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
And then one of my aunts

543
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Loaned me

544
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
Little bit more like another for $5,000

545
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
Yeah it worked out it was it was a little little dicey at first but it worked out and I paid my aunt back

546
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Back before Christmas

547
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,608
That year it's so incredible to hear how $3,500 is

548
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,936
Excruciating excruciating my money when

549
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Of course

550
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
In a within a decade you were going to do and you know

551
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
A hundred million stars

552
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,408
Sales but at that time it was scary must have felt really scary

553
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,528
It was it definitely was this think that that made it

554
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Palatable was

555
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
I knew I couldn't stay in the house

556
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
Like you know you're you're bursting at the

557
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,280
It seems and you can't accommodate people

558
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,376
And your neighbors are starting to look at you like what's going on in there this oldies

559
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,168
People that come in and out everyday

560
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
I mean we were actually watched at one point

561
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
For suspicious activity

562
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
Because did you know I was just ringing the bell and going inside and they come out with bags like what's going on

563
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
In there and and and we found out later when you know

564
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
The police office

565
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Officer came to shop

566
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,976
And she cheetah she was like I just want to let you know cuz you probably didn't know this

567
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Somebody made a phone call and someone was nervous

568
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
If you don't realize that everything was okay

569
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,448
And there was nothing untoward going on but yeah yeah

570
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
You just get to a point where

571
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
You have to

572
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,104
To grow up in and you have to take that leap of faith in

573
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
I didn't want to live in

574
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
Well what if I had gotten the store

575
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
What if I had

576
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
What if you digest

577
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
And I would rather have had

578
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
At the store

579
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Fail

580
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Then to have wondered what

581
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
What did your mom think about

582
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
That store that first dortmund

583
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
Her name was was in the Marquee

584
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,800
She she she loved it but it but I will I will tell you the moment that she was like

585
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
Really excited about

586
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,896
The business being Carol's Daughter

587
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
I got to do

588
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,064
The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2002 and so she got to see that

589
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
You know to see her daughter on

590
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Oprah

591
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
All of her

592
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Her friends got

593
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
To see that

594
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
And

595
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
The place where she went

596
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,864
Where she would get her blood work done on a regular basis

597
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
South Medical Center in Brooklyn

598
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
Glenn called The Hip Center

599
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
At what was she what she say

600
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Yes with an illness called polymyositis

601
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,664
So when she came to get her blood work done after that Oprah Winfrey show

602
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Oh miss Carol was so happy to see you here come right in. The so-and-so is waiting for you

603
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
And then I'm going to take you down to the lab as soon as you're done

604
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,512
She said she was in and out of there so fast

605
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
She told me she said yeah girl

606
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,656
You going on television I could get you

607
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
How did how did Oprah find out about you

608
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
You threw the magazines and in the attention

609
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
You re getting there

610
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Getting me on to the show came through

611
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
Douceurs

612
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,664
And the producers of

613
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
The show heard about me from another producer

614
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
Who was interviewing for a job

615
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
She went to Chicago

616
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
To interview for

617
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Position

618
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
They talked about what they were working on

619
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
And one of the shows was

620
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
A show about women who have started businesses

621
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Is in their home

622
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,888
And she said to them will have you spoken to

623
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Lisa Price

624
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
And they reached out

625
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,288
They liked what they heard they interviewed me like

626
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
6 *

627
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,384
A week later I was in Chicago taping the show

628
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
And I was sitting in the audience

629
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
And

630
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,832
She looked at the screen and she sees the name of the store and she said

631
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Carol's Daughter

632
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,208
Your calendar I know Carol's Daughter your camels I know camels

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,864
And I'm sitting here like oh my God Oprah Winfrey meldman I'm going to die

634
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
How did that

635
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Affect business

636
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
When it when it was on Oprah

637
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
It affected it in an amazing way

638
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
We

639
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Had

640
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Our website

641
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Go from having

642
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
37

643
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
People in it

644
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
And within four minutes

645
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
My segment

646
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
The audience

647
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
In the website went from

648
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,952
You know whatever it was 30 something people to 17000

649
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Wow

650
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
The website Act

651
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Crashed

652
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
I mean it was remarkable it was just remarkable

653
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Not anything

654
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Crazy like not what

655
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Not what

656
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
People think that you know

657
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,640
One day you're on the show and all of a sudden you're a millionaire and money is just falling out of your hands

658
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
Not that but definitely a c

659
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Significant

660
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
Lift and shift

661
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
In

662
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,112
Who knew about us but it was something that was manager

663
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
We didn't implode under

664
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Did the pressure

665
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
I mean

666
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
Basically

667
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
From the moment you open their first store for the next

668
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
Decade you guys were

669
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,120
What is massive

670
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
You were just like

671
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,984
Growing and growing and growing ever

672
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
Year-in and opening more stores right

673
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
What we did

674
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Open additional

675
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Stores for a very long time

676
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,736
I mean I I I wouldn't describe it as a massive growth

677
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Trajectory

678
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
There was growth each year

679
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,600
But I wouldn't describe it as

680
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
As massive

681
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,184
If I didn't open up another store until 2

682
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
2005

683
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
In 2004 I took out a business

684
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Partner

685
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
And then into

686
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
2005

687
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Took on invest

688
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
And you guys had some

689
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Big deal investor

Two places

702
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
Like Sephora at the time

703
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
And then subsequently maze

704
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,024
It helped to build a better infrastructure

705
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
You know that there's there's definite

706
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
Excitement

00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
You know Pride

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
And everything

709
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Sing when you're

710
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,616
When you're small and your grass roots and your building but they're there comes a point

711
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
You know when you start doing

712
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,456
A million a million and a half 2 million

713
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Two and a half

714
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
Hainan sale where

715
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
You can't win

716
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
You know like things half

717
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
To be

718
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Cure

719
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
And and that's when invest

720
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Was deaf

721
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
I need it because

722
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
There there was some winging it

723
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
That was going on and you can only do that

724
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Her butt solo

725
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
At a certain point I mean you guys were

726
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,008
I'm your revenues were

727
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
You know

728
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
In the tens of millions of dollars when you saw

729
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
Those numbers

730
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
At the end of the year

731
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Was that Strange Fruit

732
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Could you have imagined

733
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
That happening I I can definitely

734
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
He say for certain

735
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
That

736
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
I never

737
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Imagine

738
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Jen that happened

739
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
And even to

740
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
This day

741
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
I still am amazed by it

742
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
It's still surreal

743
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
And that's not something that ever goes away

744
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
And I don't mind

745
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
That I feel that way

746
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Because I think it

747
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
Grounded

748
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
And it keeps me focused on the work

749
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
That I do

750
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Because that never change

751
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
Regardless of

752
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
You know

753
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,552
40 mm in sales

754
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
In a year

755
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Or

756
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
28 million

757
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
In sales in a year

758
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
I'm still doing this

759
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Same work

760
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
I know that your mom Carol

761
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Passed away

762
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
More than a decade ago

763
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
But when she was alive

764
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
What what sort of role did

765
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Play Enya

766
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Because I mean she

767
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
Did actually get two witnesses

768
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
She she did she

769
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
She did get to see

770
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
A lot what Mommy always

771
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,528
Did for me was she always focused me

772
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
On the

773
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Positive

774
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
So if I was calling her

775
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
Saying to her

776
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
You know Mom I don't know how I'm going to get the

777
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
These orders filled

778
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Christmas

779
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,376
They all have to ship by this date there's just so much I just

780
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Just can't figure out

781
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
How to get it all done

782
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
And she was

783
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Would say

784
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
Well actually that's the easy

785
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Depart

786
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
And I said what do you mean

787
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,712
The easy part I just said I don't know how to do it like it's it's really hard and she said but what if

788
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
You didn't have the

789
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
The orders

790
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
That seems to me like it would be the harder

791
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
Airport to kind of

792
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
Make people be interested

793
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
And make people purchase he says you have the orders

794
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
You have their credit card number

795
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,328
As soon as you get the stuff made you'll get the money

796
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
So the money is just sitting there waiting for you

797
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
You so that seems like it's easy

798
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
She said I think we just need to clear our heads

799
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,800
And figure out how to get it all done

800
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,664
And then she would say something like go make yourself a cup of tea I'm going to make myself a cup of

801
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
He call me back I'm going to figure

802
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
This out

803
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
And I would be like

804
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
Is she crazy

805
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
I would go make my cup of tea

806
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,440
And come back to the phone and we would talk and I'd sit there with pen and paper

807
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
And we would figure out

808
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
Plan

809
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
And

810
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
I never let that go

811
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
I know that in 2014 you sold

812
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
The company to L'Oreal

813
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Was that

814
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Was that

815
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Difficult

816
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
For you to sell this thing that

817
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,432
Built out of your apartment in Brooklyn or

818
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,504
How did it feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders I mean that

819
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
You know that.

820
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
Huge deal on one of the biggest cosmetic companies in the world buying your company it was not a difficult thing

821
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
For me to do

822
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
At at all except for the fact that the

823
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Process to get there is

824
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
So it wasn't

825
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Oh my God I have to

826
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Sell my baby

827
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
I can't I can't I can't

828
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
That

829
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
Emotion had already happened

830
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Because

831
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
In 2007

832
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,992
Carol's daughter took nonequity partners with pegasus capital advisors

833
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
So once you take on an equity

834
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Partner

835
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Your goal

836
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Is 2

837
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Celtics

838
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
Dziedzic partner and everyone eggs

839
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Happy Cow

840
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
I'm so

841
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,864
Having someone like L'Oreal acquire the brand

842
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
With something that I knew would happen

843
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
And

844
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
I always had

845
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
L'Oreal at

846
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
The top of my list

847
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
And it did work out

848
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
And I was

849
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Thrilled and

850
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Proud and

851
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,760
Because for me it was the culmination

852
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
Of all of that work that I had

853
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Do to fix the mistakes that I made

854
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
In my company

855
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,696
Not trusting my gut often enough

856
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Not

857
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Valuing

858
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
What I brought to the

859
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,864
Table and not valuing myself

860
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
As a business

861
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
This person and as a smart woman

862
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
And I had to

863
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
Find my voice again

864
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
And

865
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
So I got it back

866
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
I felt strong I felt

867
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Power

868
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,736
And I stood with everyone else shoulder to shoulder

869
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
Indicted

870
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Carol's daughter to that place

871
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
For us to have that app

872
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Position so

873
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
I was very very high

874
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
When when L'Oreal bought

875
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,768
The company some of your customers were disappointed

876
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Because

877
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
You know I mean you know they felt that well this was

878
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
Company owned by Naf

879
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
American Woman

880
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Now it's somebody that's big

881
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
Multinational

882
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
How did you guys respond to that one

883
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
It didn't take me by surprise that there was

884
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
With some backlash I think the only thing that took

885
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Take me by surprise was that some of the backlash

886
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Was very

887
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Personal

888
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
And very

889
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Pointed end

890
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Very cruel

891
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
And just speaking about me in

892
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,512
In ways that I was like how do you say this about somebody that you've never met before

893
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
More wow

894
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
That was surprising

895
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
But

896
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
What I realized

897
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Was

898
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
People didn't know

899
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
My story

900
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
I realize that as

901
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
A group of P

902
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
People with in this world African American people

903
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Historically

904
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
We have left

905
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
Experience with generational wealth

906
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
We may be sick

907
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
Successful in certain areas we may have B

908
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Become

909
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
Rich recently

910
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,512
But we don't really know what generational wealth

911
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Is

912
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
And we haven't

913
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
Come up in

914
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Family

915
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,168
That have owned and passed down business

916
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
So they were just things that

917
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
People didn't know

918
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,312
And they wrote a narrative for me

919
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,384
On what they felt was appropriate and what they felt

920
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Was something to do

921
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
Be proud of and I didn't follow this

922
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
And

923
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
And I apologize for how they felt

924
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
And

925
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
And that I didn't follow the script that they wrote

926
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
For me but I used the opportunity

927
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
And still use it

928
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
To educate asbestos

929
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Is possible

930
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
Cuz it's going to take us

931
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Time

932
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
To build that generational wealth

933
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
And then perhaps

934
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Be in the place

935
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
Where we have the luxury of

936
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Might have

937
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,128
To sell because we were able to build it on our own or we were able to build it

938
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,920
With Mom and Dad's help

939
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
And we can stay private

940
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
We own but it's going to take time to get

941
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
But it it was

942
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
It was difficult

943
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Sometimes it still is difficult because people

944
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,464
Still will bring it up and it's it's almost as if

945
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
I've been asked

946
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
To apologize

947
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
For one of the greatest accomplishments of my life

948
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,728
And something that I'm very very proud of her for a little girl in from Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn

949
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
You did pretty well yeah pretty well

950
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
I did

951
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
I definitely did

952
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,760
Better than I would have had I continued to have a career in television and film production

953
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
And there's a

954
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,464
There's a very deep respect

955
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,048
That one ends up having four

956
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,144
Where they are where they've come from and what they have

957
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,216
When you go through something like that

958
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:03,104
And it and I just I just have a very very profound respect for what I've done

959
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,408
And I won't be that person who

960
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Runs off and buys plane

961
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,552
Cars and things like that because I have too much respect for how hard it was

962
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
Together

963
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,440
There

964
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:22,816
Lisa Price founder of Carol's Daughter by the way even though L'Oreal

965
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
The company Lisa is still the public face

966
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Carol's Daughter

967
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,240
And despite becoming financially secure for life

968
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
Lisa still lives in that

969
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080

Looking around because it

988
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,672
It's time now for how you built that

989
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,488
Asteroid today comes from Dan Gosling live

990
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
Jobs in Indianapolis

991
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Square

992
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
He plays music

993
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
And this is how Dan made his living for years

994
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Playing with

995
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,056
Trumpet in ensembles and orchestras

996
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
And giving lesson

997
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
And when you're a brass player

998
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
All those hours of planking

999
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Actually taking

1000
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Real toll on

1001
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Lips

1002
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Swell up

1003
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
Auburn extreme cases that deliver

1004
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Split

1005

Chocolate

1008
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,072
Oops all that pressure buzzing

1009
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
So you think they would just

1010
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
Bicycle

1011
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,984
Chapstick right you would think that but what I heard from my musician colleagues was

1012
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
There are a ton of lip balms out there and none of them work

1013
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Anyway about 10 years ago Dan was talking

1014
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
One of the students who had

1015
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
Just had a marching band

1016
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,808
Accident like literally somebody ran into this guy while he was playing

1017
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
Any of this horrible bruise on his lips and I sweated you too

1018
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
I said I use

1019
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Arnica

1020
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,000
And I just kind of looked at him cuz I never heard the word

1021
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
What's arnica

1022
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
Arctica it turns out is an herb that comes from sunflowers and naturally cut down on bruising

1023
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
And swelling so

1024
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
In that moment

1025
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Dan start

1026
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
Arnica

1027
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
Trumpet

1028
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Let me

1029
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
Can make my own lip balm

1030
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,432
And you know as ideas pop into

1031
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
And sometimes they come

1032
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Come and go but this one

1033
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,136
I couldn't let go upper it wouldn't let go of me so as you would probably expect at this point Dam

1034
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,720
Went into his kitchen he turned into a mad scientist

1035
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
Anchor with different amounts of arnica

1036
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
And do research on all the other ingredient

1037
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Castor oil in Delaware

1038
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Text beeswax

1039
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
And of course he had absolutely zero background

1040
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Apricot kernel oil

1041
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Calendula comfrey

1042
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
Raspberry leaf

1043
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Iteration

1044
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Iration

1045
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
His wife she was

1046
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,880
Supportive but a little concerned that this may be a sort of like a midlife crisis kind of thing

1047
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
And to the point where it's actually actually

1048
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
Kick me out of the kitchen and then I was

1049
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
Kind of formulating stuff in the laundry room

1050
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Connect remote

1051
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
20

1052
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
Different Generations

1053
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
Dan found a manufacturer in Ohio

1054
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,728
And he started sending out samples to musicians and Orchestra

1055
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
Even went

1056
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
Marching band competition

1057
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,848
We would literally have little car

1058
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
And I would just

1059
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,432
Swipe a little bit of the formula on the card

1060
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
That 99% of the time that person would

1061
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,856
How to look at me and I put that on your lips and they would do it and that's really amazing

1062
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,440
Dan kept sending out samples to Brass players wherever he

1063
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:06,816
Find them and he's getting great feedback from they can play longer without getting chapped lips

1064
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
And then

1065
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
Something happened that

1066
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
He did not

1067
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,264
I've literally got an email from a dermatologist he said hey one of my

1068
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
What happened to be a musician

1069
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,896
Show me your product and it's really working well for her could you send me some samples

1070
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
And then I realized

1071
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,504
Oh that's a whole nother Market wouldn't that be cool and sure enough

1072
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,136
The lip balm gradually became popular with all kinds of people not just musicians in effect

1073
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
Ten Years After Dan started

1074
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Anchoring in his kitchen

1075
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
The lip on was picked up by CVS and is now in over 8,000 of its stores so billion-dollar category

1076
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
And I just feel like

1077
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
You know in an infinite universe

1078
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
There's always room for

1079
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264

Hey one more thing this weekend visit Viola NPR show about the invisible forces that shape human behavior

Things you would seem like a politically relevant question how is it
