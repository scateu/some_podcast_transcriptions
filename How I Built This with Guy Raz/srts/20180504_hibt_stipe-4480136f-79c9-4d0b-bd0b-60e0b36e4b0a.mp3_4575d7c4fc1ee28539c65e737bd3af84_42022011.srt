33
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
We built the first prototype back in October 2009

34
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
It was not to be possible for it to be sensitive well that we code furiously for 2

35
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Man's we launched his thing and then it's Off to the Races like from when we start working on it full-time when I publicly launched

36
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,104
With almost two years and so yeah going to be hard but it is actually possible

38
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
How I built this

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
A show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
Stories behind the movement they built

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816

Who wrote Seven Lions

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Shooter code

45
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
Built it into a 9

46
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
Billion dollar business

47
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
The holy grail for a venture capitalist

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Is the elusive

49
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Unicorn

50
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
This is what

51
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Hundreds or thousands of business school graduates working at Venture firms search for everyday

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
They said through pitch

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Chapter pitch

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
PowerPoint after PowerPoint hoping that

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Today

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
Will be the day that

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
One of these pictures will be the next

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
We worker Uber or Airbnb

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
An opportunity so rare soap

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Coveted

61
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
It's like a unicorn

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Well welcome to today's story because stripe

63
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,856
Is basically a unicorn with extra whipped cream and cherries on top

64
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,256
Choose a company that went from zero to a hundred million dollars in value in a matter of months

65
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,840
And today barely seven years after its founding

66
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Stripe is valued at more than 9

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Billion dollars

68
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
So now your next question

69
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
What is stripe

70
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Stripe isn't

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
Thing you buy it

72
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
It's not like Under Armour shirts or Warby Parker

73
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Glasses but

74
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
It is what allows you to

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
To buy those things online

76
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
If you use instacart

77
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Floor lift

78
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Kickstarter

79
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Even if you shop online

80
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Target

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
You're using stripe

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
It's basically the back-end technology that allows you to safely enter your credit card details and

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Pay for what you want

84
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,424
There are two things that makes Sprite

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Very different from its

86
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Peddlers

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
The first

88
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
Is it Simplicity it was originally just

89
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Seven Lions

90
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
And II

91
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
The ages of the two brothers who founded it

92
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
When stripe launched 7 years ago

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Patrick

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
John Collison

95
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
23

96
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
21 years old

97
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
The Collison Brothers grew up in

98
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
In rural Ireland

99
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,512
County Tipperary where are their parents

100
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Ramey's

101
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Small hotel

102
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,144
Very small 12 bedrooms in Nevada

103
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
And

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
And we got a house. Milo to away

105
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
Until we grew up surrounded by

106
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Farmland

107
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
If the options were to

108
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Play in the garden

109
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Dilaudid

110
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
I'm too

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
Play with Lego we did a lot of that and to read books

112
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Signs

113
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
So your dad was running this hotel and where you guys involved

114
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Electrocuted

115
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Go out there on weekends in like

116
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Change sheets

117
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Yamato's hours

118
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
But remember

119
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,423
You know, I think before I was to

120
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
I'm so you're not the only

121
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,335
You know a two-year-old can only be so useful at in the operations of the

122
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
At the hotel

123
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
I think my favorite memory is the unit with the ballroom

124
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Floor the highly polished surface

125
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
That was awesome as a

126
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
The kid for Africa

127
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Getting a

128
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,647
But yet you know cover length game in terms of who can fly the farthest but

129
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
What channel is Howard like to imagine that we were extremely useful in

130
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
And running

131
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Primarily

132
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
How did you guys get into coding

133
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
I bought a book

134
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
When I was 13

135
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Reddit one Saturday and

136
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Start running some web pages

137
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:09,759
I really was all said if I was all downhill from there

138
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Saint Patrick get into coding

139
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
I think I will try that too

140
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,951
Yeah that's definitely an influence on and I think I have an experience

141
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
That a lot of people I know who learn to code hack which is

142
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
It's often an end result

143
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
The pools you alone

144
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,959
And you're making everything up as you go and you don't really understand you know you're copying things from a book

145
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Griffin website

146
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
The computer

147
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
To get it to work

148
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
People often have

149
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
RI website

150
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Or

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Video game

152
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
Answer my case initial website is not very good

153
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
After I built it has Patrick taught me a lesson in

154
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Insecurities in Arabic

155
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
I'll be fourteen at the time and I called together this website and they were vulnerabilities and issues and stuff that's Patrick

156
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Then hackthissite

157
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Teach me a lesson.

158
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
Officer Patrick

159
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
I Amendment

160
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
That's cuz you're not going to

161
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
In 2005 you won an award like that he's

162
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
The young scientist

163
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Stella ward of iron

164
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
And

165
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
I'm assuming and maybe you weren't cognizant

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
People must have said oh there the Collison

167
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975

Just really

172
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Smart

173
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Were you where the people were aware of

174
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
The two of you

175
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
When we were kids

176
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
I don't think they

177
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Wer

178
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Wendy Raquel

179
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
I think I should just this going to science contest

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Who's winning the first time work

181
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
Anyone might have had even the slightest

182
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Cause ya had to have

183
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Kind of

184
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Come across over or

185
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Or heard of either of us

186
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
What would you do at what was your

187
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Intention experiment of submission that when you young scientist

188
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
List of Ireland

189
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,703
Well let me touch then I got really into programming and

190
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Become interesting this programming language called

191
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Lesp

192
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
I was contacted by this because it's been invented that I 50

193
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
He's like really early into the history of tech

194
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Technology

195
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
I

196
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
But I've been kind of Forgotten and ignored

197
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
The thing I worked on this Avenue version place

198
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Update it making it really straightforward to build

199
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
So complicated what applications and things like that

200
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:33,375
And looking back and let that this little becomes clear and very early stage

201
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
I was interested in

202
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Working on tools

203
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Building things

204
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,079
That created leverage for other isn't that basically the whole point of working on this programming line

205
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,175
Which was to provide it to make it easier for others to build things

206
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
I didn't consciously think about it this way at the time you have

207
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Stryper whatever

208
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
But basically all the things I've worked on Canada

209
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
Somewhat seriously having some ways and kind of tools

210
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
Recreation sex after Patrick one

211
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Young scientist of the Year award

212
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
He decided to go to the US to MIT

213
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
College

214
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
And 2 years later

215
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
John Wooden

216
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Follow his brother to Cambridge

217
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
To attend Harvard

218
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
But all the while the brothers were always working and cancer

219
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Firing on Waze

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
To solve problems

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Come across on the internet

222
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
For example why it seems so hard

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
To buy and sell second-hand things

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
In an efficient way

225
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
What afternoon while mulling over some ideas at

226
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Local pub

227
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Patrick and John came up with a potential solution

228
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Backend technology

229
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
EBay user

230
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Cheers to manage inventory

231
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
And they found two other guys were working on a similar problem

232
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
So did you end up with him

233
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
Move to San Francisco and call their company

234
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Automatic

235
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,967
What automatic did was it made it really easy to have managed

236
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Enter list items for sale

237
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
An existing life

238
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,951
Things like eBay or no other marketplaces for 4

239
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Selling through these items

240
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
You could use automatic to

241
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
Track your inventory and to upload your items into manage the listing photos and so basically it was a tool for

242
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
People who work at selling

243
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
Significant events

244
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,359
To stop by like you no answer was software to help those people do that job better

245
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
Idid it was a kind of that could help us gain kind of one side of the mark

246
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Play stupid overtime

247
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
We could come and then building a better user

248
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
So you guys build this

249
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
Who is the public face of automatic because

250
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
I mean obviously you colors

251
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
Super smart and talented but

252
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
You know you were really young right like 18 + 6

253
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
16 years old

254
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
So were you guys sort of staying in the background with the other

255
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Founders

256
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
That the public face was really the website for the great light about her on the internet Nobody Knows the door.

257
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
I took full advantage of that

258
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Pretty well right

259
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
I guess it's just over a year after

260
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Had your original idea

261
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
It's sold for reportedly for

262
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
5 million dollars

263
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
What was a strange to all of a sudden

264
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
At that age

265
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Aladdin to that kind of money and I know you

266
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
And yourself

267
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Divided

268
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
Esopus Telluride

269
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
A couple hundred thousand bucks that was

270
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Probably ever seen in your life

271
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
We certainly

272
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
More money than we'd ever seen

273
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
In our lives yeah

274
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Was enough money to afford it a kind of freedom and really I think just kind of forced of a kind of reflection that you know had we being

275
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
Never had I being kind of understood

276
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
The treadmill has

277
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Are you going to college

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Gabriela Hearst job and so on such that

279
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
I can certainly imagines of a different version of you in my life or my career where I didn't do some of that thing

280
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Until I get my shoulder so I guess this is the time you were at at Harvard

281
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
China and Patrick you eventually went back to

282
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
That's exactly right in the fall of 2009

283
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
And I should just practices within both of you with drop out and never return

284
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
But his head in the brief moment of time where which on your Harvard and Patrick you are at MIT

285
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,935
Is that really the Run 2009 is that where the early sort of idea

286
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
That would become stripe began

287
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
That's interesting questions on the one hand stripe has the most interesting idea we have come

288
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
Automatic in the

289
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
It was the single hardest thing

290
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
About developing in China

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Was just the business side of it

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
It seems like a really important problem

293
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
And we thought there should be something really easy folk some developers in

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Tattoo that people started

295
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Starting accepting

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
The other hand

297
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
What we know right where that we're these two College

298
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Yes no maybe the financial

299
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
System had it all figured out

300
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,895
And we were these these impetuous youngsters at with the wrong ideas

301
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
And so

302
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
You're trying to figure out in those early days of

303
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Starting company

304
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Clear starting a product

305
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Are We Wrong

306
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Or is the world wrong

307
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Let me understand

308
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Understand what

309
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Take a picture 2019

310
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
I remember using

311
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Amazon India no buying stuff from Amazon

312
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
For me as a customer it was

313
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Seemed fairly free

314
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Unless you know

315
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
I just hit

316
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Bo clicked

317
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
Tempted by the night would be delivered like couple days later

318
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
That's exactly is and I think that's part of why

319
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
It didn't get solved

320
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Is that as a customer

321
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,735
Everything seemed fine and then you talk

322
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
To anyone who have to run a business

323
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
In particular and internet

324
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Business and they would talk your ear off

325
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Remington

326
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
The stories they would tell you

327
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Oftentimes to tell you

328
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,583
Is the single hardest thing about getting their business off the ground because that the providers that exist

329
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
The time is often true facts

330
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
They were the gate key

331
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Hebrews they were the people that said yes you can

332
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Can have it online

333
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Or are no you can't

334
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Answers much more important

335
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,383
Stop in in that regard I need to go to

336
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Investors are Leone

337
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
They would say you know it seems pretty solid

338
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
2009 like at UIC

339
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
We have

340
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
This Internet payment thing down

341
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
And they would do some asking around I'm back

342
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
They got us right

343
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
So you sold so if you were starting a

344
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Internet business

345
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
In 2009

346
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Idea came to you

347
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
What I mean

348
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,191
Do you want to accept payments what's that you had a business selling

349
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Oh I don't know

350
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Yunobo me peanut by

351
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
That you would ship to me

352
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
I mean it was hard

353
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
It would have been really hard to set up a way to

354
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
To accept payments to your site

355
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
And it is it is hard to imagine that it could have been the case

356
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
Samsung easy to use

357
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
And we just weren't finding

358
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
If we came to realize that

359
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Because was Financial

360
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
That that took technology companies were very hesitant to go in addresses

361
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Why why would they be hesitant

362
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
Because you feel with Partnerships with financial institutions and Regulation and risk controls and making sure the things are so

363
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
Should have done compliantly and it becomes been very complicated figure out how to offer that service internationally and so the fact

364
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
I spend these multiple sectors and deal with all these kind of things

365
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,415
Constraints with with figure out a better way to do payment technology companies startups

366
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Attended and Stilton Deming for understandable reasons

367
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
Highway from thing from problems that to do

368
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
React to solve a lot of hard problems

369
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
In multiple

370
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,567
And then you couple that with the fact that in PayPal existed and I think for a while back in the early days

371
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
It's a PayPal people thought that your PayPal was going to tell

372
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Explain for mom as a PayPal

373
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,759
Because I have used PayPal not very often but

374
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
Locations where

375
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
Somebody asked me to PayPal limited PayPal them and it seemed pretty

376
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Easy sew

377
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
What was the problem

378
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
To the basic issue with PayPal was that

379
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
Line for consumers. For businesses closing an app if you're building the website if you're building a new Marketplace

380
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Something like this

381
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,055
People works okay for sending yo $20 from Joe Jane

382
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
Breadworks much less well is when you want to do this at scale you want us to build an automated integration to your website

383
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Running a business with a

384
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,575
Those people just isn't designed for the business use case it was built

385
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
For eBay where can one off

386
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Sending $100 in manually

387
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
From this person to that Yasin

388
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,839
I will rise when you're building a business online where your again integrating this into a website

389
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Orion to Annapolis

390
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
You look quite different out of consideration

391
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
Saran how you do with it

392
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Scale and PayPal has not been decided

393
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Okay so

394
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
You guys were

395
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Obviously super smart and very good

396
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Coding

397
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
What made you think that you could

398
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Solve these big enormous problems

399
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,111
Like regulation and dealing with banks a developing relationships

400
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Credit card companies that

401
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Yo Google and Apple

402
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Clearly

403
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Felt that they could not resolve

404
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
Enlarge person a healthy dose of the naivete of Youth

405
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
But I

406
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
You know

407
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
We didn't just leave it

408
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,079
We built the first prototype back in October 2009

409
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
I didn't replace Lee spent

410
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Can a 8 or 10 months

411
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Trying to Surf map out

412
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Bob attacks be required to have this work

413
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Sensitive

414
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Near any material scale

415
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,439
What sort of people we have to hire which sort of entity we have to partner with and you know what that would look like

416
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
Until we realize while we need to hire a very senior and experience

417
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
Partnerships people to make sure that we can get today

418
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
First-year relationships in place with banks

419
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
And I really want a parent to a stick and I wouldn't be easy

420
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
Like I was not going to be possible if

421
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
For to be sensitive well

422
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Naui

423
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Code furiously

424
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
For two months we launched his thing and then it's Off to the Races like

425
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
From when we start working on it full-time

426
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Do I publicly launched

427
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
With almost two years

428
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
That's how long it took us to

429
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
The kind of orchestrate all those details that severe described

430
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,791
Amber I guess we got to sense first of the doctor again that this kind of Investigation was

431
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah going to be hard

432
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
What is actually

433
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
So you guys had a couple hundred thousand bucks from the sale of optimatic and obviously you have the code

434
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Loading

435
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
Chops in the technology chops but

436
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
You did not have

437
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Any money

438
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
How are you able to

439
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Get money to

440
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
You know fuel the Ambitions of this

441
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
One of the things that

442
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Silicon Valley

443
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
As well

444
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Is it probably has the hot

445
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
Patrick and I now travel to

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Number of other places

447
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Pinstripe has offices around the world in

448
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Dublin London and Singapore in places like this

449
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
But I think Silicon Valley is probably the best place

450
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
In terms of the risk tolerance

451
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Of the investment cap

452
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
That's available

453
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
If we could get people convinced of the opportunity

454
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
And if we could show

455
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
People that initial air leak

456
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Customer traction

457
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
And how much it resonated

458
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
With the target market

459
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
They were actually wenzhou

460
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Take a bath

461
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Despite the fact

462
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Certainty in every other

463
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Aspect

464
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Stop the execution

465
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Between what path might be able to get

466
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
Visas for the meaning of United States

467
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
To work here

468
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
Ted would we be able to hire to help with the long-term

469
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Financial partner

470
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
Docker things like that

471
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
People are willing to look past all of the things

472
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
To the opportunity

473
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
What I wonder is when you Amine

474
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
You had an advantage when you

475
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
When you start a meeting with investor

476
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
I'm assuming because you had already

477
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
Started and sold a business in the NM a lot of investor

478
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Just love that they loved

479
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
To see that experience

480
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
What do they ask you where you ask

481
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Tough questions Bible

482
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
Potential investors like for example

483
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
You know you guys are really young how are you going to manage people or you don't have any connections or Envy

484
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Palm in the financial industry or backpack

485
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
Did you get questions like that

486
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Surprisingly no

487
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,735
And people are used to that in Silicon Valley I mean by the time people become famous

488
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
Because because

489
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
The thing they worked on it

490
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Succeeded

491
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
But I think the mental image we have

492
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
People who do successful things

493
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
It's like 10 to 20 years maybe even more

494
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,839
Older than the ages at which they tend to have actually done them

495
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:21,215
Right and VC's investors and I'm just people in general in Silicon Valley I think Arthur

496
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,311
Unusually to the iTunes this fact and recognize and realize it said hey

497
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Really significant work

498
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
Not only can be done by people in their 20s

499
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
But is very commonly done

500
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
And so I think that's kind of 2/3 great credit and yeah we really benefited

501
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Promise

502
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,207
Suggestive investors you know

503
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
Rush with enthusiasm to invest in stripe

504
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Most investors had no

505
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
With the reason it was much more

506
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,911
Your reasons were much more because they just thought it was a bad idea

507
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Are running the candidates

508
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Well

509
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,919
You're a whole host of reasons it was going to be a developer oriented service rather than going instead of

510
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Trying to

511
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,807
Run this big kind of expensive sales and marketing campaign is already many companies

512
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Thousands of companies doing something like this

513
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
As you suggested there were a lot of

514
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
Partnerships we have to navigate and get in place and they are those

515
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
Don't tend to be have the Forte of a startup

516
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
And wasn't here to them back then

517
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Viscerally

518
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
Just have a early the market kind of still alive

519
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
We were so starting stripe

520
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
In the wake of the financial

521
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Surprised I said it's kind of hard to

522
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
I remember this or kind of

523
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Internalize it

524
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Now

525
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
The people Rocky fairly pessimistic about

526
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Technology in some ways back then

527
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Lowe's in part because

528
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
Us investors had really kind of thumb

529
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Tilted fights Katakana vertical stripe

What's in your wallet

560
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
Capital One

561
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Na

562
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Hey welcome back to how I built this from

563
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
NPR

564
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
And Gyros

565
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
2010

566
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Patrick Hayes

567
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
Dropped out of MIT

568
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
John has dropped out of

569
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Harvard

570
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Their parents are not free

571
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
Freaking out about this by the way

572
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
The brothers are working

573
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Full-time

574
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Stripe

575
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
And they start to look around for invest

576
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
And a lot of investors are saying no

577
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
But finally John Patrick

578
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Catch a lucky

579
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,008
E brake when they managed to get a meeting with a

580
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Pretty big player in

581
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
In Silicon Valley

582
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
We had a meeting with Peter Thiel

583
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,968
Answer the phone that you're just having this conversation be set at

584
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,856
Told him structurally what we saw is being all the kind of major flaws in PayPal

585
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,976
Looking back on it I should have had you know how

586
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Impolite

587
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Augusta

588
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
So energetic Great Lengths

589
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Belabor the point

590
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Find about

591
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
How they've got a bad things wrong way

592
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
But Peter being as such as

593
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
You know

594
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Inveterate contrarian

595
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
Was quite sympathetic to this case

596
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
And decided on the spot

597
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Add to make

598
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Material

599
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Capital $200,000

600
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
Did Peter Chelsea and

601
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Like what was it

602
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Easy to use and it was

603
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
A software developer of omigod somebody

604
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Finally figure this thing out

605
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
If any of the Developers

606
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
We're just

607
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Really glad that someone was finally paying

608
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,128
Them a shawl now as it happened we paid

609
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
And we are really building for that audience

610
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
Put that bass line.

611
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
People were working with

612
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Was very low

613
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
It was not compatible

614
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
I think about changed and wasp

615
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
We were

616
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Fortunes be apart of

617
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Was the fact that now

618
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
For internet businesses

619
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,448
Payments is actually part of the strategy that matters it's part of the product experience

620
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
And so basically I think this used to be a

621
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Fairly tax

622
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
Toccoa vendor decision for the business

623
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Prayer

624
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,224
It was just something that needs to be taken care of and

625
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
The only downside real you can make a bad choice but you couldn't make a great choice

626
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
Freezing now as we've seen with

627
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Like Amazon like lift

628
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Like insta

629
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
They can actually win based on their product experience

630
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
And that's new

631
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
200 caso4 people or not

632
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
Icon on Kodi

633
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
I look at myself

634
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
Explain how the

635
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Basically

636
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Your left

637
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,800
And I take a lift

638
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,592
Then I pay the driver I just

639
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
Clickpay in life

640
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Are you guys I guess on my credit card

641
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
And so you

642
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
Have to communicate with my credit card company

643
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
2

644
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
Make sure that they are charging me

645
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
Acid in my bank account

646
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,744
Will be able to pay the credit card company later

647
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Did you say you also have to pay that

648
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
Credit card company right like they're taking

649
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Can cut of your money

650
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,240
That's exactly right so what's happening underneath the hood when you use any business card

651
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,848
My stripe is he know you probably type in your credit card you probably only type in one so that it saved

652
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
With your profile of any time using

653
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
In future that is security sense directly

654
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Stripes odoo

655
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
Kissing at work

656
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
Extort on other servers

657
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
And then when a business wants to actually

658
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,488
Accept money and charge your credit card in the overtime it's now more than just credit cards is

659
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Transfers

660
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
International payment method

661
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,352
Things like this but the business wants to charge

662
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
They say hey I'd like to

663
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Two charges cards

664
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
$20

665
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
And we put money in their bank account

666
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Captain we have

667
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
And everything that goes on

668
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
Between that instruction on the money writing

669
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
It's actually pretty complex what goes on under the hood

670
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
But again our aim is the

671
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
People did not start businesses

672
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
So they could deal with the minutiae of the

673
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
Because they have a vision of a product that they want to get out there and

674
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
And we want to

675
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,096
Get them back to doing that anything that does not get them jumping out of bed in the morning

676
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Yeah we should be able to take off

677
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
So my understanding is it

678
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
It was basically Seven Lions

679
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Zip code

680
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
I guess from a coding

681
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
What is very simple

682
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
Elegant and a developer

683
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Lugz Adian

684
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
To the application or site they were developing

685
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
And then

686
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
That was it

687
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,000
That's weird lots of stories of people interpreting payments in an afternoon or anything

688
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
Anger and then launching their business the next day

689
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Has a big break

690
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Before

691
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Once you

692
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,776
Started to gain momentum I guess you lost you launched

693
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
Publicly 2011 ride

694
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
That's right how did you convince

695
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
Companies to the trust this to work with you

696
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Who's your first

697
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Big

698
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
Mark Lyon

699
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Well

700
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:41,696
Because we are serving high-potential companies and startups in fast-growing companies

701
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,536
We grew with our customers right there back in the early

702
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
And in the very earliest days

703
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,376
Yes those companies are pretty small

704
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
But some of them started to become pretty big

705
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,264
Like Lyft and Shopify and so I became customers of stripe

706
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,568
And of course list and Shop if I have now become you know

707
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,224
Every successful companies in

708
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Does companies in India

709
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Developed

710
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,368
Yes we should have got to know those people but I think more

711
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
Fundamentally an important Aid in Bosch

712
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:17,536
Enables product experiences that they wanted to have tow-in lift case for example

713
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
They want to not just charge of the customers what they wanted

714
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Peter driver

715
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,704
And there was no product that able to really good driver pay my

716
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Until

717
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
We've got a cool evolve with them

718
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
To enable the best

719
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
And you and your

720
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
Revenue stream was a percentage

721
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Everett Transit

722
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
I was that that was going to end that is the way that

723
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Get paid

724
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Yeah we really wanted

725
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
Clarity in the alignment of interests

726
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
That's where we would only make more money

727
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
And the businesses be serviced

728
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,280
And is a guy's music 2.9%

729
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Transaction fee

730
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Be right back

731
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,448
Directions are right that's right did anybody try to stop you or make life

732
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Difficult for Eubanks

733
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
Regulators cuz you're dealing with intricate Financial

734
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Regulations in

735
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,992
I mean in big Banks presently have a big interest in this as could be a revenue stream for them like

736
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,808
Did the people who try to

737
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
Or was it just a

738
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Once you started you just a momentum

739
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
The wind was behind

740
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Police Department really tried

741
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
Tried to approach things differently. I think how technology companies often tend to

742
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
I

743
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
Technology computer think off an episode of go It Alone mentality will build it all in-house will do it all ourselves we can do things better than ever

744
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
From the outside world

745
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,152
Where's we thought the tribe would only be possible and it would only be possible to do it well

746
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,552
If we partnered closely with people who a deep expertise and experience and industries that we ourselves were less familiar

747
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,696
I live in the very beginning before we launched we partner Toshiba thanks and now we work with thanks and you too many different country

748
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
And I'm not just Banks because of other financial institutions

749
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Besides

750
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
But we really wanted to build a stripe instead of in a multi

751
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Decade thing

752
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,264
And if we're going to go and to do it that way we we really had to do it right so as you started to really

753
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,544
Juno launched in

754
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,336
Develop and get more more tension

755
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Why didn't

756
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
The competitors come out from the woodwork white and like PayPal or

757
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,992
These other transaction

758
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Square stuff say

759
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
What should I do with a do

760
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Do they try

761
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:23,488
Well what we are doing doesn't look that important back that it wasn't the case instead of we immediately

762
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
Herbal what we're doing immediately

763
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,168
Looks like it was obviously working and obviously of major significance

764
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
We were

765
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,032
Back then in the eyes of others that are working with all these inconsequential little company

766
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
I end

767
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,712
Making their lives a bit easier but well was this mobile payment thing actually going to amount to much

768
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,832
In a curious world where they're actually that made developers that would be signed a successful companies me

769
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
Acana can I get back to this pessimism

770
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Around technology that can exist

771
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
Silver Bells Ranch

772
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
Does a 9 mm tenants on that is one of the great fact about horrendous

773
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
Is it you cannot

774
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Hearn

775
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Money

776
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Integrate products

777
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
As a kind of mechanical operation

778
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
If it were possible

779
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
There be many more great iPhone competitor

780
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,176
Facebook would have been long since he kept my MySpace or Yahoo or Google or

781
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Good to use

782
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
The intricacies

783
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,112
I've good product of good design of good architecture

784
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
Those can't be triggered a replica

785
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
I mean I mean essentially your

786
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
Competitor that has was

787
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Was you guys

788
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
I think it's

789
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
An amorphous

790
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,496
Combination for any of these products single stripe out

791
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,080
For any great product at some amorphous combination of set of

792
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
The ethos in the culture and the Pea

793
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
People

794
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
And

795
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
To the work Style

796
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
And

797
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
Kind of a fingertip sense

798
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
For the priorities

799
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,136
And all these things are just like very hard to copy I mean it

800
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,696
DeSilva Continuum at where

801
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
At one end to your

802
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Your manufacturing steel

803
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
I'm at the other end your

804
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
Yeah you're manufacturing novels

805
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
And

806
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,752
In steel manufacturing sure you can turn Capital into a more better cheaper

807
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,360
4 steel and at the other end it's very hard to know how you how you turn the money into can a better writing

808
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
And software is is somewhere in between

809
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
And I think this is kind of

810
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Consulate the challenge

811
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
For people looking to analyze and make predictions in the

812
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
The industry for again

813
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,184
Google should have beaten Facebook yeah Google it every advantage against Facebook they had

814
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,584
I am more people more money more distribution more brand recognition Morris can have any

815
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Any of the obvious Imports

816
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
And yet somehow there was something this

817
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
What would you think of this number

818
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Blast your nine points

819
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
2 billion dollars

820
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
Does that mean anything to you Amanda's abstract

821
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Do you think

822
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,200
And I'm rich or are disabled

823
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Cross your

824
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
Mighty mustard some level right

825
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,624
It's been my experience that people pay a huge amount of attention

826
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,440
To the headline numbers of of Silicon Valley come

827
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Stripes a company that's being valued in

828
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
In fundraising

829
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
At night you and I

830
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
$2,000 are Apache

831
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,144
There is an assumption baked in

832
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
That striped

833
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,984
Continues to execute very strongly on the so

834
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
It would be very dangerous mode to slip into

835
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Tired

836
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Becoming rearward looking

837
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm looking at everything that has happened

838
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
And today is because the most

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Irrelevant fact

840
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Is

841
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,064
Possibly release in 2018 hotly releasing 28:9

842
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
19 Stripes Global expansion looks like

843
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
Some things like that

844
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
You don't have a volleyball

845
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Company

846
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Unless the company

847
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Execute

848
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,632
It's very Dynamic is a very careful way of saying I hate

849
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
What

850
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,104
How much of the success of his company do tribute to

851
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
Your skill and

852
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Your

853
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
You know

854
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Your intelligence how much to lock

855
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
I need the questions last about

856
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
How much can be attributed to

857
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
My

858
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Skill and intelligence

859
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
And instead to

860
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,608
Fiscal intelligence of the

861
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,168
Hundreds of people who got in the Striped where it is

862
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
And I guess I would say

863
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
That's gilland

864
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,312
Intelligence and especially most importantly

865
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Tents

866
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Application and hard work

867
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
I think all the things are necessary

868
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
I think had they not being there had their

869
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
Not being so many people who just

870
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Came up with

871
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
So many smart ways of doing things and

872
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Amenities is toils

873
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
At such length

874
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Does not chat

875
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
It's not a sliver of the chance that will be here

876
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
But I also think that the luck was required

877
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
The dirt again

878
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Groups of people who are

879
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
Smarter and harder working at us

880
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Who

881
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
It just didn't have the same gun

882
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
You are

883
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
Still both you guys are still

884
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
So young I mean

885
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
You know

886
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
You're at a

887
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
Everyday but

888
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Everyday but little at a point in life where lots of

889
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
People are just starting out

890
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Eating at the same age

891
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
So

892
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
When did you guys know

893
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
That this was

894
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
You know it was going from

895
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,072
This idea that you have in Cambridge Massachusetts

896
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
To raising 2 million to

897
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Bengali

898
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
20 + 100

899
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Billion and then today

900
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
How much is 10 billion. When did you

901
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
Did you have a moment

902
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Julius a packing said

903
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Wow

904
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
Rebuilt

905
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Never really been time for that

906
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
I have

907
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,880
And there's nothing like a young company to

908
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
Every morning remind you that those

909
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
So much

910
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,000
Left to be done

911
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
So much

912
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,072
That's not yet working the way it should be

913
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
I mean if it's really quite visceral

914
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
You wake up in the morning

915
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Android 20 emails in your inbox

916
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Somehow all related to

917
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
Two things that you're doing badly or wrongly

918
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
There's never a moment when I feel

919
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,384
Successful and

920
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,664
The quote that I

921
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,736
Kind of stop and think about it from Greg lemond saying

922
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Did the first

923
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
It never gets easier you just go faster

924
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
And

925
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
Are you still going to

926
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Cycle quite a bit and

927
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
There's a lot of Sudafed

928
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Painful truth

929
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
That wear

930
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
As you cycle more you practice more zika

931
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
If it is you get faster is your form gets better

932
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Sure

933
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
You start

934
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
Cycling faster your times get better

935
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,104
With the experience of being on the bike never gets easier

936
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
The pain that you feel on the first bike ride

937
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
That's the same pain that you're going to feel on your 500 bike ride

938
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Just Begun much faster than 500

939
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
And I kind of feel like I can just start up for

940
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Everyday now

941
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
The

942
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Problems and challenges

943
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
And

944
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Visceral pain is just as cute

945
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
Cuz when we were starting out

946
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
The problem we just have a different form

947
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
It's it's

948
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Relentless

949
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Process of

950
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Trying to

951
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Shift

952
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
But it is that

953
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Exists and what

954
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
Collectively match

955
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,456
Create so far

956
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
Interpol

957
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,040
All set at

958
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Creating the first

959
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,624
And we still quite a way to go there

960
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Patrick and John Collison founders

961
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Stripe

962
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632

How to find your perfect pair

987
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Today

988
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

989
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,728
Time now for how you built that

990
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,544
And the story comes to us from Selma Alabama

991
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
With Robert Armstrong

992
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,432
And his grandmother Anis of our family

993
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,760
Lifted the Great Depression even her accident was

994
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
Older Southern she would say

995
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
Bara

996
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,976
For butter and butter is the operative word here because Robert grandma

997
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,608
She used a lot of butter in her recipes especially in her family famous

998
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,448
Pecan chocolate chip cookies never tasted anything

999
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Like the way my grandmother bacon

1000
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
But they were small

1001
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
Are Krispy and it was a

1002
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
A good bit of butter in it so it

1003
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
The Taste would linger

1004
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,248
And I told her when I was in junior high school at

1005
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,064
You know I make $1000000 off these cookies one day

1006
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Intellij idea kind of stayed with Robert

1007
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
So

1008
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,976
After we got our ecology thought today you know maybe I'll try this

1009
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Maybe I will bake and sell my grandma's cookies

1010
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
But the problem

1011
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
He had never baked a cookie in his life

1012
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,264
Convince my grandmother to teach me how to bake them

1013
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
And she got thought it was funny and that she had no idea that

1014
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,384
Somebody would want to make a business out of it

1015
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
She was all for it was just go absolutely so

1016
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
Show step by step

1017
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
In her kitchen

1018
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,648
Chinese. Robert how to make her buttery pecan chocolate chip cookies

1019
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
And then he tried making them himself very first day I begged about 3,000 cookies by hand it exist

1020
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
Laughing like my grandmother told me and it rained that day and it was humid in the kitchen but I had no idea that that

1021
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,264
That was going to affect the products open a all

1022
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,408
Turn to Mush so I got to throw them all away and that's when Robert learned rule number one of cookie making

1023
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
No humidity

1024
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:25,088
Anyway he eventually figured it out he found a tiny kitchen in an abandoned restaurant in Selma

1025
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,160
And he started placing his cookies in specialty shops

1026
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,208
Around the city and around the state

1027
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,512
For two years that was life

1028
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:37,376
He was selling cookies in the afternoon and baking them early in the morning

1029
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,496
I called it cookie present for a little while because it was just I was in there by myself for so many hours but

1030
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,080
You sitting here baking cookies in your thinking there's got to be a better way

1031
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,896
I'll think I'll make about $4 an hour at the time

1032
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
Robert could not pay his bills

1033
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,016
Soca 2011 he actually shut

1034
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,600
The cookie business down and he tried a bunch of other jobs

1035
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:04,000
T-shirt printing business I did it online so beef and pork to the military for a little while

1036
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Going from job to job

1037
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,608
And this is for like 2 years GPS monitors

1038
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Robert kept thinking he should go back to what he really loved doing

1039
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
Back to the cookies and thought you know

1040
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,896
I proved the concept proof people would pay money for this thing

1041
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
But this time around Robert knew that

1042
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
If you wanted to make money on the cookies

1043
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:30,624
He had to find a real Bakery to bake them in some serious Brokers to sell them

1044
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,024
After months of calling around he finally found a bakery in Pennsylvania that says it's okay you know we'll give it a shot

1045
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,584
So we work for

1046
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
Domotz on the recipe taking it from you know cups in teaspoon family recipe to an industrial

1047
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Recipe that could

1048
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Be back on some industrial equipment

1049
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
We took out a line of credit with a package with his grandma on the

1050
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,479
Front

1051
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
I called them

1052
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,111
G Mama cookies G4 Danny which was her family nickname

1053
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:07,743
She was me I would blush some that are facing her kind of her name is all over the place

1054
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:14,143
But she was my number one cheerleader passed away

1055
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,239
I got to see how G Mama's has grown since it relaunched

1056
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Cookies are now in stores all over the southeast and in some big stores to like Publix and Walmart

1057
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
And last year

1058
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
G momma's Revenue was nearly half a million dollars

1059
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,135
