Perfect pear

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
One evening we put the kids to bed I'll never forget that swear in

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
In the living room and Chris came up to me and he pulled a spreadsheet out of his pocket

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:36,096
And he said Sadie I've been holding us in my pocket for couple weeks

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Open it up and it was a spreadsheet a model of how we could

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
Seller home all our possessions and drop out and not work

14
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
And that was the spark to building

15
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
NPR

16
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
How I built this

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Stories behind the movements

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
They built a garage

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,224
Lincoln turned a room with mirrors and a ballet bar into a multimillion-dollar company

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,296
That's not one of the fastest-growing fitness programs

22
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
Us

23
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
So if you want to take a little bit of

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Pilates and yoga

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
And then throwing some ballet into the mix

26
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
You get bar

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
It's actually been around since 1959 when a former ballerina named Lottie Burke invented the whole car

28
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Concept in London

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,664
But it didn't really begin to take off in the US until this past decade

30
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,528
And today there are more than 700 Barre studios around the country

31
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,880
Companies like core Fusion physique 57 and Pure Barre

32
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,696
People who go to Barre classes

33
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
Overwhelmingly women

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Muslim marches

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Going to the exercise is there actually connected to the

36
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Culture around the whole bar movement

37
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,008
It's about building confidence in this team but it's also big business

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,616
The whole Boutique Fitness sector which bar is definitely a part of

39
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
Is now a 30 billion dollar industry

40
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
And one of the best-known faces of bar

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Sadie Lincoln

42
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,904
Her company barre3 now has about a hundred and Thirty locations all around the world

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
And the company is still privately owned by Sadie and her husband Chris

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
And just one outside investor

45
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,400
Now all of this has of course made them rich and in Sadie's case

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
It's made her a celebrity Fitness Guru

47
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Which as you will hear

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
Has made her very uncomfortable

49
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,176
Because Sadie isn't actually is flashing slick as her online videos would suggest

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
In fact her upbringing

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
It was pretty unconventional

52
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
My mom and her four best friends

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,416
Dropped out their part of the counterculture

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,048
Dart like they live in California and they just dropped out they were living in California yet they found each other

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
They're kind of gypsy like they're traveling around together they ended up in Taos New Mexico

56
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
And each of them

57
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Ended up having a child

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
The dads off

59
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
Flat and they

60
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
Basically raised us kids collaboratively

61
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
That's what I mean was that there

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,040
They're playing like to all these women to move to tylosand

63
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
You know basically have children and then

64
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,672
Ultra raised up the children together

65
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Because it

66
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
It mean that's how it works out

67
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
Is that how they thought it was going to work out I don't think they had a plan

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,400
I think it just happened and it was a time of

69
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Serration

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
It was a time for them to

71
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Go inwards

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Look inside

73
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Live close to Nature

74
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Chester intellect

75
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
And create and discover a new way of living

76
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Number 5 kids

77
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
All together

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
Soul artists

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
8 years older than me so she's sort of like an honorary Auntie anyway but lark

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Sophia

81
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Chia

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Kyle

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Megami

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
So sexy

85
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
First Fitness

86
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,703
Part of your Early Childhood we used to do what we called the Tea Party

87
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
Put on a red record and Boogie

88
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
Dance our butts off

89
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Bob Dylan Willie Nelson and Chuck Berry

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
The Beatles of course

91
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
We did that as a family often

92
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
So that was my first can introduction. Just

93
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Loving moving

94
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,415
Your mom like make ends meet

95
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
Well first of all we are off and on food stamps

96
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
I do have memories of going to the store with food stamps with a note for my mom that I could use them and thinking of this is I have different money than

97
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
But

98
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
They did and that

99
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
I'm in went once they got secure and they had some

100
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Stability that they created their own

101
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
Are they created a newspaper called what's happening and then changed it in later years to Eugene weekly which is still the weekly

102
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Publication in Eugene

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Yeah and did you sometimes

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
Feel like a weird kid like a different kid

105
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Yes I felt like a weird kid

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
And

107
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Then I

108
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Tried to play Norma

109
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
You know I thought I played normal for a long

110
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
I don't want my friends

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
That I had this alternative

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
Out of the box family I was really attracted to kick normal kids normal families

113
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Were you embarrassed

114
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Oh yeah

115
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Yeah I was embarrassed

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,247
I mean my mom was wearing Birkenstocks before they were cool they were smoking weed

117
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Before it was legal they were

118
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Just

119
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Outrageous

120
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
Now I think

121
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
It's wonderful that back then

122
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
You know I wanted to

123
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
To be I was like Alex Peak

124
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
And Family Ties

125
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Kind of

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
I was like

127
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
You know I became a cheerleader

128
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:02,751
You know which is very you know of course they all supported me because that's what they do unconditional love no matter what your choice is

129
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
Is really social

130
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
I just want to be normal

131
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
2

132
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Were you a pretty good student

133
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
In my school

134
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Horrible skin

135
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Really bad

136
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
I went to Alternative School called magnet Arts

137
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487
I developed a great deal of confidence there you know we did

138
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Pottery and dance

139
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
And music and

140
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
But I didn't learn the basic

141
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
And then Middle School I entered middle school and I didn't have the foundation

142
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Nor the interest

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
And so I just kind of survived on

144
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Having fun

145
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,967
So After High School Sadie took off for La. Should become an actor

146
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,319
And in the meantime she started to take classes at Santa Monica City College

147
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Actually liked it

148
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
A couple years and she transferred to UCLA

149
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
And it was during that time she got really into fitness classes so after college

150
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Sadie decided to look for work

151
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
In the fitness industry

152
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Yeah

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,799
I landed a job with a company called 24 Hour Fitness

154
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
And

155
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
The reason I took that job really was I wanted to move to San Francisco to live with my girlfriend I lived on her dining room floor

156
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Heart literally

157
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
And

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
They were based on the bay area and Fitness

159
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
As I

160
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,927
Yeah and what was the job that you were hired to do

161
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
I was hired to run

162
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,047
All of the group exercise for I think 25 gem

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Wow is it

164
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
We were acquiring gym

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
At a rapid

166
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
Okay so I started I think we had around 50 gems

167
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
I ended up staying there for 11 years

168
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
When I laugh we had 430 location

169
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
So this was just

170
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
Massive explosive growth

171
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
Explosive growth I thought I was going to work there maybe to one to two years and

172
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
I ended up

173
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
Reporting directly to the founder and CEO

174
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Mark masterov

175
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
And he just kept igniting interested me because he gave me all these incredible projects along the way

176
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
So everything from sales

177
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
2

178
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Brand strategy which is my favorite I mean it was the ultimate

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Learning

180
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Experience for me I traveled all over the world

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Alter Scandinavia and

182
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Asia and

183
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Spain

184
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Italy

185
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:21,247
Mark had other businesses besides 24hourfitness that I got to be a part of Jen's in Russia

186
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
So he's like a major

187

Your husband Chris

192
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
I'm at Chris in San Fran

193
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Sysco outside of

194
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
24-Hour Fitness

195
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
He was working

196
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Game for a startup software company

197
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
I met him at a Super Bowl party

198
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
And we connected instantly his last name is Lincoln

199
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
And I meant he introduced himself as Lincoln everybody called him Lincoln and I remember in that moment thinking Ash my name is going to be Mercedes link

200
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,463
My real name is Mercedes so I knew that insta

201
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
Wow yeah I knew

202
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
I know he was

203
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
She's the one

204
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
And

205
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
He

206
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
After a couple inches with Mark

207
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Mouse Drive

208
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Mark pulled Chris into the loop

209
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
As well so he ended up working direct for Mark as well

210
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,871
And so Mark now had me and Chris and he would put us on Project

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
That was a wonderful testing ground for us as business partners

212
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
To see how we work together

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Chris is really analytical really grounded

214
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
I'm more the new shiny thing

215
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Dreamer

216
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
We

217
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Bought a house

218
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Which is like climbing Mount Everest in the Bay Area

219
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,423
Which is really exciting to find a moment for us for me especially I I rented

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Michelin Tire

221
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Life growing up

222
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
So he actually owning a home with Incredible

223
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
We had two children back-to-back 18 months apart

224
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
So I mean

225
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
You're living in the Bay Area and you've got this gig with

226
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,575
Mark and both you and Chris are kind of doing projects for him and

227
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,463
What what happens if you have a scissor some sort of Crisis that kind of propels you to make a big life change

228
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Will the first

229
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Prices for me

230
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
I think

231
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
Happened before I was pregnant with my first child

232
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
I

233
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,471
Even though I was part of this booming business and my career was booming

234
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
And I was making it

235
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Great salary and you know we're buying a house and all that good stuff

236
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
My own health was declining

237
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
And I didn't feel good

238
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,855
You know I've just been immersed in the fitness industry but it wasn't working in my own body I was

239
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
I was

240
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
Really uncomfortable in my own skin

241
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
I don't feel alive inside that make sense

242
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
I

243
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,375
With working out really hard everyday everyday

244
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,263
Running on the treadmill counting how many calories I was eating and how many calories I was expanding because that's scientific

245
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
Calories in calories out doing all the right things

246
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
That I had learned where it was the formula for success in this is multi

247
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
Billion dollar industry I was in with working

248
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Selling like hotcakes

249
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
And

250
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
This attachment to an idea

251
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
I was sort of drinking the Kool-Aid

252
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
An

253
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,279
I was shameful that I wasn't looking that idea or feeling that idea

254
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
So what changed

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
When I got pregnant with Audrey

256
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
I think being pregnant

257
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Is the ultimate

258
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
Opportunity to realize

259
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Because

260
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
If you think about it inside your body

261
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
I I was craving a baby without

262
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Thinking about it

263
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
And I never felt more alive and connect

264
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
And happy

265
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
For me becoming pregnant reminded me

266
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Add my grits

267
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
My auntie's

268
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,351
The power of intuition what healthy really Wyatt's with living close to Nature being intuitive versus following someone else

269
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
The formula

270
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
And I had this a high thyroid to do yoga at home

271
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
And I had this

272
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
This Moment of clarity I'll never forget it

273
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
At work

274
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
I literally said

275
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Myself

276
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
Maybe I'm not feeling Fitness

277
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Maybe Fitness is failing me

278
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
And

279
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
I'm probably not alone

280
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Even though the fitness industry is booming the vast majority of us it's not working I mean that's the new

281
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
New story on the news everyday

282
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,071
It's like Abby cities on the rise people are more stressed out than they ever have been

283
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
There's all these magic spells magic answers formulas that were also Desperately Seeking

284
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
You having this conversation with your husband

285
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Chris

286
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
I would say the conversation

287
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,175
Chris and I are having more at that point versus Fitness is failing or not

288
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
Was we were lonely

289
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
Really lonely as a couple

290
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
We were having a hard time finding belonging

291
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
We don't have a strong community

292
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,511
And it likes it just you and me you know

293
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
What's going on he was having a hard time relating to

294
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Business as he was

295
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Managing

296
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,983
Vista Studios he was managing with 24 Hour Fitness in

297
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
And I just remember this one moment walking into the room and

298
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
You was on speakerphone and the manager that was working with

299
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
Coaching him there on a conference call

300
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
The guy and he was did it with such great intention but he was

301
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,879
And nobody could see each other so he was saying okay everybody raise your right hand

302
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Now put it on your back

303
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
The lift it up

304
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Now put it back down

305
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Now lift it up

306
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Put it back down

307
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
So he was having a run on the conference call Pat there on that

308
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,959
Incress instead of doing that was flipping off gif

309
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Right

310
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Something needs to change

311
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
This is not working

312
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
So we felt empty there wasn't a sense of purpose

313
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
So what did you do

314
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
So we started

315
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
I mean over the years over at like maybe a two-year

316
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
He was coming up with all kinds of different business

317
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Plant watering business

318
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
The pizza

319
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
To Nail Studio chairs

320
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
And

321
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
So that was sort of in the backdrop

322
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,399
But also it was like I had this good gag I was working from home I had two babies

323
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
I'm he had a

324
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Good job I mean

325
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
We had bought our house

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,847
So I feel like things are kind of moving along pretty pretty well

327
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
And one evening

328
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,271
We put the kids to bed I'll never forget that's where in the living room and Chris came up to

329
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Tumi

330
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
And he pulled a spreadsheet out of

331
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,951
And he said Sadie Ivan holding us in my pocket

332
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Her

333
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Couple weeks

334
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
And

335
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
And I just need a sheriff

336
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
Can you open it up

337
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
And it was a spreadsheet

338
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
A model

339
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Of how we could

340
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Seller home

341
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
All our possession

342
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
And move to Bend Oregon

343
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
And drop out

344
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
And not work

345
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
4

346
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Well and

347
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,855
Yo I'm the one that's usually thinking of these outrageous ideas Keys more conservative and

348
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Super analytical person

349
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Bring me this outrageous

350
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Idea

351
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
Was honestly one of the hottest things

352
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
Because I was just like you see me

353
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
Eufy Adventure

354
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
And

355
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
It's also a reflection of how this

356
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Erased

357
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
It gave us permission

358
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Think outside

359
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Of

360
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Any kind of

361
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Boundary

362
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
If we can not work for a year

363
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
What can we really do

364
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
So that idea morphed into

365
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Let's sell the house

366
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Unless every single penny

367
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Into

368
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
A dream job

369
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,511
That might fail but we don't care let's just try to

370
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Build a life for ourselves

371
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
That

372
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
Will feel like dropping out that will feel

373
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Free

374
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
And

375
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
That was the spark to building

376
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
And so with the money you move to

377
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
Bend Oregon

378
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Deciding on Portland

379
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Because

380
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,391
I wasn't as excited about then you know I wanted to be in a more thriving

381
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Urban Market

382
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
How much cash did you guys have to live on

383
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,143
I don't remember the exact number but I can tell you this we went down to one car we packed all of our belongings into

384
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
The car

385
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,031
A moving van we moved our two kids are cat to Portland Oregon we rented a small little house

386
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
We just went down to the bare minimum

387
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
And how much did you have to

388
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Put towards

389
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
This business

390
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
So our only investor

391
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
This day is marked

392
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
So he he said hey

393
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
All all work with

394
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Yeah it's a he gave us a

395
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Small investment

396
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
I want to say I under 200,000

397
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
And then our house

398
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Which

399
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
So we probably had maybe

400
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Three or four hundred thousand

401
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
And that was with a Christian Life

402
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,751
Poured much of that into this business idea

403
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
Yeah so what what was the

404
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
The concept that you guys started to work on when he got

405
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Oregon

406
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Well

407
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
I became enamored with

408
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Studio

409
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
And

410
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,879
Going to yoga studios going to Barre studios in the late 90s early 2000

411
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Barbed wire

412
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Reigniting and New York

413
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
Is just for people who have no idea what bar is

414
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Can you explain LOL

415
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Little bit more

416
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Yeah

417
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Well bar back then was

418
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Space off of the lahti brick method

419
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Which she was a dancer who we have to

420
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Just off basically at a ballet bar and

421
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,383
Her first instructors started the first Barre Studio

422
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Core Fusion

423
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
57 Bar Method there's a bunch of them out there

424
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
And they sort of had a Renaissance

425
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
In the early 2000

426
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
And I started to take those classes and I was as intrigued by them

427
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
How come

428
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
For one thing they reminded me of

429
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Part of a contemporary

430
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Jawzrsize

431
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
And then using the ballet barre

432
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
As a prop

433
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Does has this

434
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Instant Grace and art and Heritage

435
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
That was really attractive

436
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Tumi

437
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
And when you got into when you decided to

438
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Open a bar stool

439
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
There were

440
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Contenders

441
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
So did you think

442
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
How are you able to say well we're going to be different

443
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
This way or try customers by doing this

444
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Yes so

445
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
We moved to Portland

446
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
A conscious decision where there was no bar

447
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Around us

448
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,423
And I love using about Labor I love the isometric work of Lottie Burke

449
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
And the small movements

450
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Animusic

451
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
But I wanted to create a studio

452
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
That instead of

453
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:27,711
Being something gave me answer being a methodology I didn't want to be the Sadie Lincoln method or the par-3 method

454
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
I just wanted it to be an exercise

455
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Experience

456
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
From the very beginning in R instructor manual

457
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
The very first sentence

458
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
As

459
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
The one thing that never changes at barre3

460
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
If we're always

461
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
At the very beginning of class

462
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
Commissary instructable start by saying

463
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Walking to barre3

464
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
I give you full permission to do something different than I say

465
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Your only job

466
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Adolescent

467
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Not to me but yourself

468
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
I'm your guide

469
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,151
Turn the music on I'm going to show you how to line your body and then I want you to make it

470
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Your own

471
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
The chest

472
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,783
As an idea to introduce people I mean obviously

473
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
The people on the show up

474
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Taking the classes right but

475
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Like

476
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
When you passed by

477
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
The studio

478
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
You saw this

479
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Barre3

480
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
B a r r e

481
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
A lot of people may be sick from speeding

482
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Superman I guess I don't know

483
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
Probably betraying my

484
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Stupidity

485
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,127
Would say what is as Bareilles like at is this thing right and so I can't be the only person

486
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Thought that when I first saw it

487
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,319
Nobody knew how to pronounce it nobody knew what it was I had a tagline at the beginning where ballet barre meets

488
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Yoga and pilates

489
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Wichita

490
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
Okay that makes it right to it to it was a descriptor to explain what it was

491
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
How did you come up with a routine did you spend like

492
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Weeks in months kind of

493
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Writing it down or

494
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
White hot for about 20 years all different concepts

495
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
And so I started a piece together

496
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
The

497
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,151
Concepts that balance the body so

498
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
I really focused on working opposing muscle groups in every x-ray

499
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
So if I work the bicep I was going to

500
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Weekly work the tricep

501
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
So I had this hope

502
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
When you open your doors and is August 2018

503
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,327
Was it right away was it like a hit two people over people like letting us come in Wizard of curiosity

504
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,167
Got before I even opened our studio I taught free classes

505
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Upstairs

506
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
At what is now Whole Foods but at the time

507
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Tenants Wild

508
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
And

509
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,639
I'll never forget the day we finally got our permit to open the doors

510
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,991
I sent out an email to the community that was coming to my free classes

511
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
And I said hey I got my

512
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Certificate of occupancy

513
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
I'm going to teach a class 2

514
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,719
And I thought maybe a couple people that show up you know my friends my good friends that I've made

515
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
On 12 people showed up in

516
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
That night

517
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
And I sent out the email at 2 and I think I taught at 5:45

518
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
And I will never

519
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Forgot that moment

520
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
The sun was coming in

521
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,543
I played my opening song with seal amazing

522
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
And

523
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
To this day when I hear that song it's such a visceral memory of

524
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
This is going to work

525
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,343
Sadie Lincoln in just a moment

00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Capital One na

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

561
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Gyros

562
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
It's 2008

563
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
And at this point Sadie and Chris

564
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
SAR

565
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
Pretty busy running their studio in Portland

566
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
Let me spend so much time there that

567
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,104
They actually have to hire a babysitter

568
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
To be at the studio

569
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
So that their kids and their

570
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
Clients kids

571
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Can also come to the studio

572
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
I was a busy mom with two kids

573
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,904
And I think the most important thing to both Chris and I as we wanted to have it

574
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,768
Community that we wanted a place where we could attract people that were inspirational

575
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Thoughtful

576
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Connected

577
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
Citing a be around one of my girlfriends

578
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,032
Friendswood move from the Bay Area

579
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm she taught one or two classes

580
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
If an evening

581
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
But I checked everybody in

582
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,552
Open the door checked everybody and clean the bathrooms I mean the whole thing taught all 19 classes 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.

583
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
I was there

584
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,648
I knew every single client Maryellen

585
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,976
I remember she was the first person to sign a membership she stole one of my client

586
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
And if you were a drop in at that time how much do you have to pay the

587
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
$20

588
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:07,936
So what's my feet pay wasn't it was probably as around $5 more than yoga

589
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
How much runway

590
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Did you have

591
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
Before this had to actually start making

592
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
I think

593
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
Our return was maybe in

594
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
16 months or so

595
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Is there pretty quick return

596
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,904
You know starting with 19 classes a week and having those classes have at least 10 to 12

597
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
People was our goal and that's exactly what we did

598
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,352
I mean you must have been stressed out even though you were doing 19 classes a week and you

599
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
Probably got a lot of your

600
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,752
Stressed out that way you still must have been stressed out 19 classes a week is not huh

601
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
And if not

602
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah right it is not

603
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
The chart of the story of my body

604
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Literally my back went

605
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,784
And I remember my mom saying to me

606
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Honey you're embodying

607
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Your business

608
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Because I was like

609
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,744
Walking around like a nine-year-old woman you know with my back slumped over like whining and

610
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Hurting

611
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
Yeah and it was like

612
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah

613
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Shoot you know this

614
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Isn't good

615
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
So that was

616
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,800
A moment I was training instructors at the times I did have some relief

617
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
But I learned that

618
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
To be healthy

619
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
It really is okay to pause to not move cannot achieve

620
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
Do not have an outward expression

621
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Of what exercise means

622
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
You must have like

623
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
You know

624
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,792
Pull out of this because you you still managed to open up a second location pretty fast

625
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,864
Pretty much right away I mean the first year

626
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
We are open

627
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
We put up a tab on our website

628
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
But that grow with us

629
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
And we got

630
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Instant

631
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
What did that mean

632
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:54,176
Play start your own barre3 we grew up in

633
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
An industry where we knew how to run multi-unit operation so going into barre3 we thought unilift open maybe two

634
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,160
20 of these in the Pacific Northwest so you thought

635
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Are model should be franchised

636
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,048
We have this unique knowledge and wisdom in the industry's so

637
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
Instead of raising money

638
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
To open our own

639
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,728
Let's look into this franchise model which is really ultimately about empowering someone else

640
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
To invest

641
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:24,128
In this idea that we have in our wisdom and open up their own business pension so instead of going to

642
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Venture capitalist

643
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Thanks or whatever

644
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Yeah you didn't have to

645
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
Decide once and we don't want to be the Holden

646
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
To institutional money

647
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
Instead I was really excited about still am excited about the idea of being the Holden and two other people just like me

648
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,376
Who had a dream and wanted to open their own business and have their own skin in the game

649
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
And

650
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,192
Be able to make it their own

651
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
So where was it the second location

652
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Our first

653
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Two partners Define

654
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Wer

655
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
The Philippines

656
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
In Manila

657
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
And Bend Oregon

658
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Wow signal

659
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Which Heist immediately to

660
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Manila

661
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Yeah

662
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,904
This woman came in her name Tania town and she was in the states

663
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
And discovery.

664
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
And her family is very entrepreneurial

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
Are they have a family business and then their children each have different business models and she's the youngest of all the children and she

666
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,008
And because you and Chris had this experience at 24 Hour Fitness

667
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,336
Franchising you can understood how to structure it

668
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
I was weird we are bullish that way and

669
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,248
I mean it was exciting it was an adventure but we knew we could do it we knew we could do it internationally

670
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
With the right paw

671
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
And then Darcy and bend

672
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Was close enough and she was coming

673
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
Opossum really a part of our tribe

674
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,768
Shortly after that was Carrie who opened in Vancouver Washington witch

675
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
20 minutes away

676
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,352
So most of our franchise partners

677
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,144
Were or Arc lamp

678
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
So they

679
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Came to barre3

680
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
Loved barre3

681
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
Nubar 3ware owner operator

682
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
So unlike some franchises are franchises owner-operated so if you're going to franchise with us you're really going to live and breathe the product

683
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
They're going to teach and manage and NLP the face of it

684
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
It's interesting cuz we had Jerry Murrell on the show

685
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
The founder of Five Guys

686
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
And which is like

687
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
The fastest growing very different business from yours Burgers and Fries

688
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,120
More than different in some nice but you never know

689
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
And

690
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
He was supposed to it like all of his sons part of the

691
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
Do you know of the Five Guys

692
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
They like to do this

693
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
And he really didn't want to do it because to him

694
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,200
It's a burger that they were serving in the fries at they were serving was

695
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
It was great to keep control the quality

696
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,112
Has completely opposed the idea obviously he feels differently today

697
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Two weren't you nervous about handing over

698
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Your concept

699
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
To somebody who could

700
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Like

701
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Screwed up

702
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,864
No I I think that's one thing about I have unbridled APA

703
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
Feminism in people

704
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,728
Sometimes to a fault to be honest that I really do believe in people

705
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
And here's the thing we don't

706
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
Our product isn't a burger

707
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
It's a person

708
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
It's someone

709
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
A class

710
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
And

711
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
I cannot pretend to be able to control that

712
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
Because I can't control other people nor do I want

713
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
But how did you

714
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
I mean there's no way

715
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,280
Is a creative person and creator of this concept that you spent

716
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Gill years on

717
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
There's no way

718
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
That you just hand it over and said go run with it like you have to get

719
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
Their mental

720
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
I have to assume

721
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Well it's person by person

722
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
You know we would meet with these people and

723
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
See if there was a deep connection

724
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,760
I believed in our training program I believe in my ability my mouse is in

725
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
I love training and development

726
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
And that's what I wanted to bring to Fitness has this idea teaching and a true teacher at the teachers that I left the most going back to see

727
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Santa Monica City College

728
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,536
And the teachers who really

729
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Brighten Academy

730
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
It wasn't that they were all knowing

731
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
And that they had the answers

732
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
They sparked something inside of me

733
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,544
That made me realize I have the answer

734
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
And

735
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
I love doing that with

736
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Body

737
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
I love doing that with

738
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
I like showing

739
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
People that

740
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
You can

741
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
First of all run your own Studio

742
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
And you can do it your own weight here's our blueprint

743
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
But you

744
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
Now get to go

745
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
But your own fingerprint on it

746
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,048
Because I do not want you to copy this is not the Sadie Lincoln math

747
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
I am not a guru where the anti Guru

748
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
And

749
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Your true power

750
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,800
All of my owners is is in Collective wisdom just like I was raised

751
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
We didn't even use

752
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,152
The word chain we still don't wear a family of owners

753
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
And we were all of the partners just like

754
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
Everything was

755
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
Was just about perfect fit it all

756
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
It all worked out great cuz that's what

757
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
It sounds like you didn't really run into any problems well

758
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,744
We did I mean I think the biggest problem with it

759
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
It's emotional

760
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
It's scary and it's the most

761
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
And

762
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,912
Does first Partners took a big risk in us and we took a big

763
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,752
You know jumping leap of faith trust fall with them as well it every owner to

764
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Stays at rest

765
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
And when you franchise

766
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
The Campfire Song

767
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
When you franchise

768
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Their your you're

769
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
In a partner

770
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
And

771
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
It's for the lawn

772
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
And

773
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
Me and Chris are job is it always

774
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Volume up so they see that

775
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Importance of Being connected to something bigger

776
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
And

777
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
You know that's really what drives me I'm beholding

778
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
To all of these

779
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Partners

780
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
You're the CEO of the company

781
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
How many

782
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,240
Locations. Do you guys own

783
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
We own

784
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
6 locations

785
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
And then we have

786
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
124 France

787
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
As you guys

788
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
Or just expanding and exploding

789
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Engross

790
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,040
I mean

791
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Did you try to say

792
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,184
This is crazy I mean it must have been like a hamster wheel that just never stopped

793
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Going

794
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,304
Yeah I mean right in the middle there I kind of lost myself

795
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,656
We are booming we're being acknowledged as like we're getting grapes

796
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
You know we really

797
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Hit mainstream

798
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,848
It went from this really insular like

799
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
Word-of-mouth tribal

800
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Kind of secret

801
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Stage

802
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
And worldstage really

803
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
And

804
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
I was at the

805
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
The center of that

806
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
So that was kind

807
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Kind of crazy I got lost

808
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,232
A little bit just being a public figure

809
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
In a way yeah

810
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
And I started to

811
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Fall into

812
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
Marketing machine

813
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
Which I had

814
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Laugh

815
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
When we moved

816
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
To Portland weed

817
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,824
Excitedly shut out all traditional marketing

818
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,128
And a weighted like Express

819
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Hairstyles we don't even like

820
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Tetanus

821
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
I'm in an office and I kind of got back into that

822
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Machine

823
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
And I was in pain

824
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
Applications

825
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
I was working with this

826
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
Producer in LA and everybody was telling me that

827
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
This way

828
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Speaking about Fitness

829
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
This is the way you speak

830
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:09,888
Think about what you're doing you had people come to you sing Sadie we can turn you into the next Jane Fonda

831
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,752
UNF you go to the website and you still are the face of it and then videos

832
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
Love you and

833
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
But you don't Embrace that

834
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
Well I did want it because the idea of

835
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Growing and

836
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:29,088
Serving the company that way was really exciting to me and to be able to get that kind of attention and to fuel our business was

837
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Super exciting

838
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
I'm really hot

839
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Soulfully though it went against

840
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
My

841
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
Intuition about not being a guru

842
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
And

843
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
I don't want to see the messages that are already

844
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
So loud

845
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
We've got the message

846
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Just loud and clear everywhere yes

847
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
If you work out and you do these things are going to look like this

848
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
And

849
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
I was getting trained by

850
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
Produces and stuff to say think so

851
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,688
While you're working out you're always supposed

852
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,016
How to say you're working out this muscle so you can have a thinner waist for bikini season

853
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
You're doing this

854
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
So that you can have this

855
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
You know it sells like hotcakes this is the way you're supposed to do it at

856
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
I tried it on for size they also said

857
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Get hair and makeup

858
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
You know get a stylus

859
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,072
So I did all that so we have online work

860
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
And I just little era of online workout

861
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Were you can see where I did this to you

862
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
We've pulled some of them

863
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
I hired a makeup person

864
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,896
I started to be more self-conscious about what I wore on camera and then I started

865
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,992
Speak in a different language that was more like quote-unquote results-oriented

866
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
And under the videos

867
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
People who are commenting

868
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
They were checking

869
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
My plants

870
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,928
People who are part of my movement

871
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
We're checking me out the door

872
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
They were saying

873
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
They were saying

874
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,584
Honey you don't need to wear all that bronzer your beautiful as you are

875
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
And

876
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,680
You know what you don't need to tell me to get teeny tiny arms

877
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
Like I'm doing this cuz I want to Beast

878
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm sure they're people who are Saints

879
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
Do you want to be a

880
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,688
Ex million-dollar company XXXX million-dollar company

881
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,576
And then you can do that then you can become like Jillian Michaels are like another

882
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
You know

883
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Jane Fonda

884
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,464
10% by the way I respect all those people

885
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
For all these Incredibles

886
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,840
People in my space to who are booming right now or are incredible with

887
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
And I think

888
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
We all

889
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Want the same thing

890
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
In terms of growing bigger

891
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm actually not focus on growing bigger anymore

892
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Company

893
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
We paused

894
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Franchising

895
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
For now we're just holding

896
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
Being still and we're being uncomfortable and

897
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Being still isn't

898
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Barry and I

899
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Just in class and we're still

900
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,112
In class or when you try to meditate I don't know if you ever have

901
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes I'm comfortable if I do everyday and I'm

902
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
It's hard

903
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,280
It's hard to be still because it's a real like intermere than you

904
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
You have to check in and see thing

905
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
So if you look at a company as a person

906
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
We've decidedly decided to meditate

907
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Easter

908
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
What was the reasoning to disowning

909
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
To happen or did you increase assets

910
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Siddhartha

911
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Just put some pod

912
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Why I mean

913
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Can any

914
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,296
Other business people would say

915
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Which is

916
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Exciting what we aspire to be courted by a lot of and

917
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Bankers

918
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Pure Barre was sold for 121 million

919
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Ibar

920
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Champion

921
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:24,192
Powerhouse right and like the story we kept hearing this who's going to

922
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,800
The number to who can be number two and you could be valued at gazillion dollars and

923
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
So we started entertain a bunch of conversation

924
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
You could have just cashed out

925
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
Like majorly

926
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
Yeah there's lots of choice.

927
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
That right and

928
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
Kind of feel like

929
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
I want to be a bit of a rebel

930
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
So Inc

931
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Peking right now

932
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Other CEOs

933
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
Other Founders other people in this world who are going at it alone

934
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
So I just want to protect

935
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
But I had

936
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Versus

937
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Make it Giant

938
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
And I want to show

939
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Business community that you

940
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Do it that way

941
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,456
Yeah there's not that many people seem not in the business community

942
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
You know the value of not

943
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Growing

944
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
The value of not

945
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Sign

946
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
You know it's interesting because

947
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
There's just kind of Drive

948
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
An intern segments of the business world

949
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Do that but there are plenty of companies including

950
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
Episodes in the show we did with

951
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,376
We were doing with with Angie's List

952
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Companies that are not

953
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
Profitable but they're sustainable

954
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,312
They are more like breaking even if every year

955
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
That is enabled them to hire

956
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,456
You're more than a thousand people and in their lots of companies it

957
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,552
Aren't as focused on profit but our focus on sustainability and just

958
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Creating jobs in printing careers for

959
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
People link

960
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
So it doesn't

961
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,488
Have to be about growth and expansion and growth and expansion right

962
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
That's right

963
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,840
That's really what I love about my product is that

964
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
We literally embody ideas and barre3

965
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
So we're teaching exercise but we're in body and I

966
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Stay with me for a second I know this is strange

967
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
But I think what you just said is so and nausea

968
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Chuze Fitness

969
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
You can do a 30-day

970
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Stream program

971
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Crammed with your body

972
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,272
You know exercise

973
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Every single day

974
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
Eat nothing White

975
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
You know drink tons of water

976
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
Get 10 hours of sleep every single day

977
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
You know lift lots of weight

978
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
And get tremendous results

979
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
That's like

980
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Exciting

981
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Write it

982
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Tremendous I change in your body

983
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Is that

984
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Sustainable

985
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
Exercise every single day

986
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
To be. Regimented and disciplined

987
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Not for me

988
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
It's a short-term

989
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
And that is the story were sold over and over again

990
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,600
The story Which is less intoxicating know a lot of people but overtime I think

991
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
They really get it it's a

992
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
Sustainability model

993
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Exercising

994
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
10 minutes

995
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
Being in touch with the foodery

996
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
You know that it's okay to drink a glass of wine that relationships are just as healthy as a

997
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
And that developing a long-term

998
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
Term relationship with exercise that's

999
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Sustainable is actually

1000
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,408
Going to benefit your posture you'll live longer you'll

1001
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
I'm feel better in your

1002
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
Scan

1003
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,552
Yeah you won't shut up weight in 30 days necessarily but in the long-term you will

1004
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
Listening I mean to ask you about which is

1005
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
I like Melissa & Doug Berman on the show who came up with Melissa & Doug toys for kids and and Caitlin

1006
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
Andy Spade corset

1007
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Kate Spade in

1008
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,728
Matthew's incredible Partnerships married and

1009
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
They are

1010
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,080
Yeah they built these incredible businesses together

1011
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
But then you know I talked to other artists

1012
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,992
There's no way I could work with my partner this is no way I mean might might might

1013
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,296
Did the person who I have a family with like that we would just

1014
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
Kill each other

1015
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,112
You and Chris have built

1016
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
A business together

1017
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,928
I'm hesitant is it just

1018
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,488
Your personalities mesh and you

1019
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
Naturally find your way or is there ever any

1020
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Tension or

1021
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Yeah

1022
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
I mean

1023
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
There's no way

1024
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,520
I'm sure there's a way but I can't imagine a way of not working with

1025
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Yesterday

1026
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Saul start there

1027
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,456
We're different and that he's really analytical and his

1028
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Skills are different

1029
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,344
He's very thoughtful he doesn't talk very much he thinks about things for a long long long time

1030
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Where is Ida scope

1031
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Got instinct

1032
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
Yeah we're both starters

1033
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
We're both on

1034
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
We both are

1035
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Really into our children

1036
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
And our dogs

1037
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
I have my best

1038
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Friend

1039
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
By my side my

1040
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,752
Rock he's the one that gives me courage

1041
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
To be

1042
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
And to make crazy decisions

1043
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
And so it just

1044
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Work for us

1045
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,968
Are you always talking about the business

1046
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,016
We talked about it a lot

1047
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,320
Like we talked about the business more than we do our kids

1048
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
We are joking we're talking about how

1049
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
How many business

1050
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
Decisions have been made in bed

1051
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:08,864
But then we were laughing about how funny that sounds because it was nothing about that sexy it's like Carol and Mike Brady

1052
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Like

1053
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472
We live with our laptops and we're like

1054
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:18,080
What color should it be orange okay whatsername be barre3 sounds great

1055
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
But it's kind of beautiful to

1056
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
How much of

1057
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
I asked

1058
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Too much everybody's going to show about

1059
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,112
This question was how much of what happened

1060
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
To you guys

1061
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Ask you would like and how much

1062
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
Evan has to do with your skill and ability

1063
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,584
Oh gosh I think

1064
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
Timing was great for us

1065
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
This Boutique movement started and

1066
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
People wanted connection and community

1067
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,080
I was I'm a teacher and group exercise became hot again

1068
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,151
I'm moving to Portland and just the right moment

1069
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,295
Being shut out from all the noise so we weren't competing with anyone we can just do it exactly what we need to do scratch around Edge

1070
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
So that's like anyway but the movement

1071
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
You know

1072
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
At the right time

1073
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,975
But a lot of hard work and enter work and

1074
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,535
Paying our dues out there in the business world

1075
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Certainly was a part of

1076
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,983
Scout I think probably like most business is a combination of all those factors

1077
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,775
Sadie Lincoln

1078
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
Founder of barre3

1079
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:25,407
By the way if her childhood story sounded somewhat familiar

1080
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
It's probably because you heard her brother Miguel's version I previous episode of the show he's met

1081
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Miguel McKelvey

1082
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,159
Founder of the multi-billion-dollar company we work

1083
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,999
Miguel also grew up in that all women's Collective

1084
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
And like his sister Sadie

1085
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,119
He also rebelled against it by going into business

1086
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Was it better than Miguel

1087
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
Hahaha

1088
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
So much better

1089
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
But I will say I was really excited because my high school

1090
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
Took me over him for the Hall of Fame

1091
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
San Miguel

1092
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015

Sticking around because it's time now for how you built that Story begins about 5 years ago

1107
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
Wallace was just

1108
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:56,287
Standing in his kitchen in Washington DC have a bag of cherries in the fridge and weenie

1109
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
I needed to use them before they went bad anyway he is girlfriend Corey happy to be making turkey burgers of the time

Short on ketchup I like to mess around in the kitchen so that's where my Creative Energy

1111
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:15,487
Kind of comes out and knowing you you probably wanted to make tomato ketchup but we didn't have tomato so you said I'm going to make cherry

1112
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,887
Recipe and then cook the cherries with vinegar and sugar and spices

1113
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,959
He had fresh cherry ketchup that was

1114
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Kind of sweet

1115
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:31,615
Smokey it was definitely a novel thing and we we both really liked it

1116
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
Except a few months later

1117
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,271
Sitting in his office he works in the energy business

1118
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,159
He wasn't thinking about energy that kept thinking about the ketchup

1119
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
I just had this moment of realizing

1120
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
Yeah there's literally one kind of ketchup on the market

1121
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,119
And there's this huge gap that no one knows about

1122
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,727
Tyranny of the Tomato at any Gap in the market that could be filled

1123
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
Not just with cherries but

1124
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
With all kinds of fruit

1125
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
So that day

1126
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
He emailed Cory

1127
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Best starting a business

1128
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,223
It was probably 30 e-mails back and forth

1129
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:13,343
Yeah I felt like I had the idea kind of downloaded into my head fully-formed

1130
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,671
What he also knew right away that he wanted to call it chopped

1131
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,791
Because his best friend growing up referred to catch up as Chuck like past the tub

1132
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,351
So Corey and Matt started to experiment

1133
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,167
They took celery and onion garlic

1134
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
Vinegar

1135
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,079
And it makes those ingredients with blueberries mangoes peaches plums and of course cherries

1136
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
And what they came up with were five different types of ketchup they work really well with a lot of foods that you wouldn't know

1137
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
Formerly paryer Pines with pork tenderloin

1138
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Fried rice

1139
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,647
I started doing taste tests with their frets

1140
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
Great as a base for a vinaigrette

1141
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:57,631
Thumbs up from celebrity Chef Jose Andres who actually feature the ketchups and one of his restaurant

1142
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:03,775
That was really the impetus for me that this guy knows what he's talking if we have his sort of

1143
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
Unofficial endorsement that this is a good product

1144
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
Yeah we got to go for it we got to make this thing official thousand dollars on Kickstarter

1145
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,879
Cops out of their kitchen and into a shared commercial space in DC

1146
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,695
View Whole Foods in local markets in the DC area

1147
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
Oh and somewhere along the line they've also got married we wanted to do something meaningful we wanted to do something

1148
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
Sing together

1149
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:36,287
Learning the art of the hustle and all of those things and we get better at it every week

1150
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
It's not killing it flying off the grocery store shelves

1151
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
We put everything into it

1152
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
I mean it's all Sweat Equity

1153
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
At this point

1154
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Hazmat

1155
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
