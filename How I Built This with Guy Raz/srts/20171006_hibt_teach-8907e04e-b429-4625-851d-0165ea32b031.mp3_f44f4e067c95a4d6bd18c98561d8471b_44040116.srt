When I walked into Ross Perot's office I felt like I was at the

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Like I had tried everything I had tried to access everyone and I knew either

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
He supports this or I just really don't know where else to turn so I I literally told myself

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
I won't leave his office I'm going to glue myself to the chair in his office and I'm not going to lie

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Until he commits

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,968
Running PR

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
How I built this

16
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
Show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
Graduates

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
Some of the top university

21
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
To forget Wall Street

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Forget Law School

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Forget big money

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Become a teacher

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
So today

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
From other episodes you might have heard

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
For starters you will not discover a Wendy Kopp made her Millions

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
Because she didn't

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
Money was never the point

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
Wendy's still a realist

31
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Successful Builder

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,816
You can say what are the most successful non-profit Founders in recent times

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
Anyways or story is

34
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Case study for how to start a business

35
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,312
If I could probably why there's an actual case study about her at Harvard Business School

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,408
Because Wendy built teachforamerica from an idea in her head

37
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,224
Operation with a budget

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
Hundreds of millions of dollars

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
It's a program that sends

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Thousands of college graduate

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Switch to some of the most neglected Public Schools across

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
The US

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
Each and every year

44
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
Utf8 isn't without its critics

45
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
You hear about that

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
But is also a program that's changing lives

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
And schools

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
Wendy during her time

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Student at Princeton

50
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,128
Even though she didn't really have any experience working with underserved students

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
In fact

52
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Corona bringing in Dallas

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
Was practically another world

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
And honestly I grew up

55
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
In a community in Dallas Texas that

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Referred to itself as the bubble

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
You know pritzker

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
Lack of diversity and disadvantage me my parents had

59
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Really made it

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Point to

61
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
Buy a place in this community so that we could go to the

62
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,496
You know, notably strong public schools there

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
And

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,408
Somehow I managed to grow up really without understanding the extreme disparities

65
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
North Country end

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,832
The fact that where you're born really does so much to determine whether you have access to an excellent education

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
And I

68
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,464
You can never become aware of that really in its full extent at Princeton but

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
On any campus and entrance in included you can see

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
You know evidence of that that

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,216
Reminder freshman year roommate had gone to public schools in in the Bronx and

72
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
When honestly one of the most driven brilliant people

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
To make it to Princeton but still threw her and and threw her friends made from work kind of other first-generation college

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
I realized how differently prepared they were to do while so many things pet turn me on

75
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
2

76
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
This fact that our country that

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,328
Claims to be in really aspires to be a place of equal opportunity really isn't one

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
Just thinking about this tougher or did you

79
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Did you started to do something

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Well

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592
Actually I had organised a conference alongside some other

82
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Students at Princeton about

83
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Improving our education system

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
And it was at that conference where we had

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Pulled together students from Oliver

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
The country and they were some of the

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Most incredible student leaders and

88
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
They were saying

89
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,791
We had no idea there was a need for teachers in in urban and rural areas we would teach

90
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
And it was really sitting there that I thought of this idea

91
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Like why aren't we

92
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Channeling

93
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
People energy into teaching

94
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
And

95
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,055
What struck me was this idea that we would

96
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Essentially build a movement among

97
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
The rising generation of leaders

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
To channel their energy

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,063
The Cheech in urban and rural Public Schools

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,207
Knowing that that would have really important immediate impact in in classrooms and schools and in the life

101
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Kids

102
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
So

103
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,095
I became obsessed in the minute I thought of it I just thought this would change our country

104
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,751
Can we change the consciousness of our country and it became the answer to everything like that I need to propose in my senior thesis

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,335
So you decide to turn this idea into

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Into your thesis your like your research project

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,223
Yeah I mean I do know I looked at different things I looked at

108
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
Other models that guy looked at the

109
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Peace Corps and

110
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
There was a federal teacher Corps in the sixties

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
And this time and I really went back

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
I analyze the policy

113
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,119
Context do you know what this actually work could we get these folks into classrooms

114
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,751
And also the mood on college campuses having it all the factors and ended up in this thesis

115
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
Proposing the creation of a national tea

116
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
What was the idea

117
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
That

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
They were

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
All of these

120
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
Talented college graduates every year who

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
More willing and and

122
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Could

123
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Contribute

124
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Set a few years to teaching kids in

125
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Chicken in low-income areas I mean

126
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
And if it just was

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
That bat resources

128
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Underutilized

129
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Yeah I mean I felt like

130
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
You know when I was

131
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
Thinking about my own self and all of my peers

132
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Princeton

133
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
You know

134
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Folks were really searching for

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
What do we want to do

136
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,407
Not a whole lot of people knew exactly what they wanted to do so they were

137
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Doing what

138
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
In front of them

139
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,295
At the time this is late 80s so all the recruiters were

140
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Literally investment Banks manager

141
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Consulting firms

142
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Couple of brand management firms in Phoenix

143
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
I was at Princeton liberal arts majors at Princeton I mean those were the

144
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Companies that were banging down our doors

145
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
And so

146
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
My thought was you know how different would it be in Ark

147
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
Country if we had many of the most promising

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Future Leaders instead of

149
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
And working on Wall Street

150
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Tears right out of college teaching for

151
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Two years in

152
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Urban and rural areas

153
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,015
And how was the thesis receive like when you are visor

154
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
I called you in to give you feedback

155
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
What they say

156
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Well

157
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,975
He called me in and said can you come into my office and I was thinking hoops

158
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
I guess this didn't go over

159
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
But he loved it you know he did he said

160
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
I thought this was

161
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Bryant

162
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
Wow so he was like let's let's make this happen for real

163
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
Well

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,639
The last week of writing a thesis I decided I'm just going to say in the thesis that I'm going to go do this

165
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
So

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
He liked the idea but he thought it was really crazy to think that I was really going to try to go do this so I had this plan

167
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,647
And one of the things I had looked at the origin of the

168
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
The Peace Corps and

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
There's this

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Credible paper and

171
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
The paper was this beautiful analysis that

172
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
Concluded that it had to start with v

173
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Hundred

174
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
Core members that that was the smallest possible number that would seem nationally

175
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Important

176
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:43,359
But that it was a workable number anything bigger would be unmanageable so that became my number

177
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Like okay we've got to recruit 500 people so the whole plan was to inspire thousands of people to apply in the

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
The first year on selected training place no fewer than five hundred of them in

179
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
You know five or six communities across the country

180
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
And I had a budget saying this was going to cost two and a half million dollars in the first year

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
And my thesis advisor became really obsessed with that number like how are you going to Race 2 and 1/2 million dollars

182
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
He said you know do you know how hard it is for $2,500

183
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
And he sent me down he said I'll tell you what I'm going to link you up with

184
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
The head of development Princeton is going to explain how hard it is to raise $2,500

185
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
And this is 1989

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Yeah

187
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,695
And so does that happen to juice it down with a development

188
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
And you said hey I've got this idea

189
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Una Familia box

190
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Yes

191
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
He was very nice

192
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,447
He he did explain how hard it would be

193
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
But meanwhile

194
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
I had

195
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Look back at this and I too wonder

196
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
What

197
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Possessed me

198
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
I thought I was blessed with the advantage of

199
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,039
You don't know you have at 8 and I was really obsessed

200
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,135
So this idea I mean I just thought an end really it was an idea whose time has

201
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Tom I mean I would

202
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Tell people this idea and they would just a dozen this already

203
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
Obsessed in fact I spent most of the thesis writing just looking for it I was just

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
Convince someone must be trying to start this

205
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
The really was a mood on College

206
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
What campuses are people really were searching for something

207
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
It would enable them to make a real difference and

208
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
You know the fall of my freshman or of my

209
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Senior year

210
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
There was a

211
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
The front page article in Fortune Magazine

212
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Saying

213
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Corporate America takes on edges

214
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Education reform

215
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
And so I

216
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
I thought

217
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
These people will fund

218
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
So I wrote letters to everyone quoted in the article

219
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
And a few others by the way I would

220
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
Pick out like you know Delta Airlines and write to the CEO of Amazon

221
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
You don't leave management

222
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Experience

223
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,959
The believe it or not I got seven meetings up

224
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Those letters not with the CEOs but with

225
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
People who they would pass

226
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
There's down to

227
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
And

228
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,639
One was the head of the Business Roundtable

229
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
Who was the CEO of Union Carbide

230
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,319
And you know the Business Roundtable was the group that it said we're going to take on education

231
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
And they had no plan

232
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
So

233
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
You know

234
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
I think my timing was just perfect and he said I'll tell you what I'll

235
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
But you use our office in Manhattan

236
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
And I'll introduce you to some other folks

237
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
And I met another executive at mobile

238
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727
Who was just love the idea and said you know

239
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
What do you need to

240
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
To try to make it work

241
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
I said I need a $26,000 I had developed a budget saying that's what I needed to do to you know needed to spend

242
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
3 month sleep liner all over

243
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
The Country Inn really trying

244
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:36,159
And he said okay I'll tell you what I'll do it if you can get Princeton to be the conduit of funds

245
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,767
So I called the head of development and literally I mean this is amazing I now realize but

246
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,423
In two hours he got the president sign off on being the conduit of funds what was the condo to fun what does that mean

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,031
Meaning like they could write the check to Princeton and then Princeton would just give it to

248
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
Even though we didn't have our taxes

249
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Exempt status

250
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Wow so so

251
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Hawaii

252
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Was that important to us

253
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
Well I have no credibility in and you can't give him as a foundation you can't

254
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Give funds to an individual like me

255
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
So

256
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Other ngos

257
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,511
Can figure out how to be a conduit to startups but

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
You know you have to jump through hoops

259
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
To be able to do that so you got person to

260
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,935
Who created to launder this money you to hell

261
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Help you a lot

262
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Teach for America

263
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
Right off the bat you suck I've got to just go to

264
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
The corporation

265
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Get funding for this

266
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Well I had to find

267
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Yeah I had to find some

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
Funding before I

269
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
It's what I had something

270
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Live on

271
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
And that was my biggest thing was her you know that was very stressful day April

272
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
I'm thinking I've got two months to get some money

273
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Yuan

274
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
A lot of

275
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
A lot of students right

276
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
College

277
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,911
Reese's right like mine was on gladstonian liberalism that was the last time

278
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
I expose myself to Gladstone and liberals

279
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Two decades ago

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
But you

281
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Here we are

282
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
You know

283
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,687
Your thesis is been your life's work

284
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
What do you think it was that

285
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Compelled you to stick with this idea did you

286
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Go out and graduate and say

287
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
I'm going to pursue this

288
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
What is a relay

289
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,255
It is good idea right like one of those ideas that

290
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
If I hadn't pursued it

291
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
Someone would have figured it out in the in the

292
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
Couple years after I'm really

293
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,799
Cancel that I mean it's just one of those ideas it's so foundational with so many other things

294
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
You know somehow I just landed on

295
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
On a good idea

296
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Okay so you got

297
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
$26,000 in NC money

298
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
And then you got this office space in the Business Roundtable

299
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
And are you guys at this point already calling yourself

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Teach for America

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
Well we we had named ourselves

302
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
America and then we found out that that was the name of the medic

303
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Supply companies

304
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
3 months trying to think of an alternative until one night at midnight

305
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
In the subway ad

306
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
Just thought for

307
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Teach for America

308
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
Thank heaven rate

309
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Because Teach for America is such a better name

310
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,271
You keep saying we so I'm assuming that you and Emma I guess a couple of friends

311
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Planned launch this thing

312
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
Yes well our plan was let's

313
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Show people

314
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
So I mean that was pretty much

315
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,375
Cuz we were hearing no one was going to do anything the school districts were telling us

316
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,959
You got these people from these colleges with a list of 100 College

317
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:36,127
And they would look at the list I remember meeting the head of Human Resources in Los Angeles and I mean it had its legs kick back

318
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
He started laughing when he looked at the list of 100 colleges and said

319
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Okay I'll tell you what

320
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
You get 500 people from these colleges to want to teach in my schools and I'll hire all five who is the LA

321
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Poway Unified School District

322
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
So you went

323
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
To meet with

324
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
Seattle hiring there and said I had this plan and what it calls to you want them and he said if you can do it

325
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Sure I'll take them

326
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,775
Yes and and he wouldn't have to pay any of them because you were going to get the funding for this

327
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
Although he was going to hire them

328
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
Regular teacher salary so I had gone through in

329
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Was really testing the fee

330
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Feasibility will the districts hire them

331
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
And I was hearing yes if you can actually get them and then the funders I would need these

332
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Potential funders and they would say wow

333
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
It's a good idea but you know it

334
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Not going to work

335
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Is the college students

336
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
I want to it so the whole plan became let's just show people that the college

337
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Didn't want to do it

338
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,399
So what we did was to decide okay we're going to find

339
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Two students at each of 100

340
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
We're going to

341
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
Find one and tell them to go find someone who represents a different

342
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
You know what sort of diversity on that

343
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And then those two piece

344
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
People are going to

345
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,503
Actually put flyers under doors and try to inspire

346
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
How to apply

347
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
So you you said hey if you want to teach in a low-income

348
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Sun School

349
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
To train you and then

350
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Place you in a

351
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
School and that was it and then

352
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Can you put that out there and

353
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Did application started

354
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Yeah I mean the pitch was even it was like

355
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
If you want to be part of the movement to improve education

356
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
An American

357
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
Ensure that we live up to our nation

358
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
Promise to be a place of Eve

359
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
Equal opportunity then

360
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
You know apply to this

361
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,199
And you'll teach for two years and then you'll be part of a

362
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
Group of leaders who work for the rest of their lives

363
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
How to change the

364
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
And

365
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
One of the first

366
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
People we found was a guy

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Yale actually who

368
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
Drafted this flyer

369
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
And he was really the first one he put it under doors

370
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
And within one weekend

371
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
He had 170

372
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
Voicemail messages on his answering machine

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
Saying hey I want to play I want to know more about this yes

374
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
And then there was a

375
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Man his son

376
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
Of your listeners will remember Fred hechinger

377
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Who is a columnist at the New York Times

378
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,087
You know I'd met him along the way and he just couldn't believe he know where is this out Purina

379
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Idealism kunming

380
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
Open the me generation so he told that story in an article in The Faults probably a

381
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
October

382
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:06,143
And so one thing would lead to another people start realizing wow I mean this generation does want to do that so you know the donor

383
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,799
You know making a decision decided some of them okay we'll get behind this the school district started

384
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Taking it more seriously

385
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
So everything was coming together

386
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
The only

387
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Massive problem was

388
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
That we were nowhere near prison two and a half

389
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Million dollars

390
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
You

391
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Are going out and

392
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Basically advertising

393
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
2

394
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Tencent

395
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Hunter College

396
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Apply for the

397
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
But like you didn't really have a guarantee

398
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
Ironclad guarantee that that you could actually

399
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Place them in any job

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
She was really just kind of

401
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
And you were kind of

402
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Hoping it would work out

403
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
Yeah well

404
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
That is as I look back

405
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
Like you that maybe how it looks me that the time it didn't

406
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Seem soap

407
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Precariously

408
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
There were real

409
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Shortages in these

410
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Districts

411
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Talk to

412
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
Folks in many of these districts and realize that they really

413
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Wanted

414
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
To hire these folks

415
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
And so

416
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
It didn't seem as precarious as it sounds now

417
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
So how many

418
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Applications did you get

419
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
We had 2500

420
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
People apply

421
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
How many spots

422
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Could you

423
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Can you were aiming for 500

424
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
So

425
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
Wow I mean how many of you were now

426
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Running this organization like

427
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Before 5

428
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Well

429
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
You know it just kept holding on

430
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
South Bend

431
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
We had all these

432
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Occasions we had underestimated

433
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Of course everything

434
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
What to do

435
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Do with 2500 go through 5

436
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
2500

437
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
Yes

438
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
That's a very good question

439
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
That we hadn't thought through

440
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,799
But one thing we did was say okay we're going to send teams of 2 out in

441
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
You know actually

442
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
I got the head of

443
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,407
Hurts to donate Rent-A-Car so we had

444
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,735
Five rent-a-cars and we were going to send two people in each of them

445
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Off to interview

446
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
So they would each take parts of the

447
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,647
The country and they would drive from campus to campus and would do these interviews and we had

448
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
Created a day-long application process that you know

449
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
Start with an essay application and then they did a sample teaching session and

450
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
An interview and we have had someone go out and develop this kind of

451
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Selection process

452
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,543
And by the way this is about when I mean you know we have these teams out on the road

453
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
And there

454
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Interview

455
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Spoke and

456
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
I'm thinking

457
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
We don't have it

458
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Money

459
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039

461
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
A mutiny in the ranks

462
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
The struggle

463
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

496

Gyros

497
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
So it's the spring of 1990 and Wendy is about to train pfas very for

498
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
First class of teachers

499
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
The only problem is

500
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,935
She's short on money like two and a half a million dollar short

501
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
Kind of a Hail Mary move

502
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
Wendy decides to contact Ross Perot

503
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,175
Who at the time was one of the richest businessmen in Texas and

504
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,015
Because he ran for president in the early 1990

505
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
He's from Dallas and I'm from Dallas and and he's really into education reform I mean what I was growing up Ross Perot as a boy

506
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Business leader in Texas was

507
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
No really fighting for all this legislation to improve the school so I had never met him and but I

508
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
I just had in my head he was going to fund this and and Ross Perot dozen

509
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,311
Doesn't think I wrote him 11 letters before he agreed to see me but

510
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
We have different memories

511
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,599
Actually thought it was a friend of mine cuz everyone knew I was trying to get to Ross Perot and someone yells down

512
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
The hall

513
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
Ross Perot is on the line and I

514
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
Pick up the phone and say yep

515
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
I'm thinking this is one

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
My friends

517
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Pulling a prank

518
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,912
And I hear his voice on the other end you know which is very recognizable of Michael my God and

519
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,984
And I said to him I'm coming to Dallas I'm going to be there next weekend

520
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Can I come see you and he agreed

521
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
What happened when you went down there

522
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
Well when I walked into Ross Perot's office

523
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
I felt like I was at the end

524
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Like I had tried

525
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,088
Everything I had tried to access everyone and I knew

526
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Either

527
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,648
He supports azure

528
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
I just really don't know where else to turn

529
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
So I literally told my

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Myself and I've often wished I could

531
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
To be as per

532
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
But I won't leave his office I'm going to

533
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Glue myself

534
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
To the chair in his office and I'm not going to leave

535
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
Until he

536
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
You say to him

537
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
This might things my program and what did you ask

538
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
For how much chemical

539
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Well I asked him for $1000000

540
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
I need a

541
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
You know another 2 million

542
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Basically

543
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
And

544
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Keyspan I mean I was in there

545
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Probably 2 hours

546
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
And

547
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
He spent the whole time thinking about his

548
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
Friends who would do this to me really love to the eye

549
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Idea

550
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
And he kept saying I think Sam Walton would do this and

551
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
I kept thinking out loud

552
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,800
I know where all this leads like no like you are the one I know you're the one who care about education

553
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
You you're an entrepreneur you understand this

554
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,248
And he finally I actually think he decided I wasn't going to leave and he said I'll tell you what

555
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,112
I will give you $500,000 if you can raise the other one point five

556
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
And that was the moment I knew it's done

557
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
Like I knew that his

558
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
His credibility

559
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
And that

560
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Have leverage

561
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
I could just go back to everyone else and that they would all

562
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
You can go back to her house to say Ross Perot is coming

563
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Is $5,000

564
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Guys I need your money

565
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
Yep in order to leverage that

566
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
Yeah

567
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,128
All right so so did you I'm assuming you raise the money

568
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
After Ross Perot Museum

569
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Yep

570
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
So one year after I graduated I was literally looking at an auto

571
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Train full of 489

572
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,696
Recent grads who were all in that auditorium at USC

573
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
Year after you graduated rest of the season

574
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,584
You got it you got this

575
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
489

576
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
College graduates in this room

577
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,240
Ready for 45 week

578
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Trained at 8 weeks at the time they were all going to go to the LA Unified School District well they were during the summer they were

579
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
But then they would go to the one at 6 places

580
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,528
That's where we had decided to Cluster them and where the school district

581
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,184
New York City and the NLEA New Orleans

582
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,584
Baton Rouge in Southern Louisiana and then to World sites in in World Middle Georgia and in eastern North

583
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Carolina

584
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
And they had to make it to your command

585
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
So I mean

586
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,824
Ifi'm remember correctly in that study

587
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,944
Did not have a teaching credential like how did you know how to train

588
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
I didn't know an end

589
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
You know that's why we

590
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Found this

591
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,392
Experience teacher Educators in an experience

592
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,696
Teachers who had a specialty in

593
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,096
You know preparing and supporting teachers in urban and rural areas and we really just turns the whole thing over to them

594
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
So how did that first summer go of a train

595
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,704
It was terrifying

596
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
You know I mean

597
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,616
It was the first year we had 489 people cooped up in dorms for 8 weeks

598
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,200
A diverse group not as the verses

599
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,784
You don't we would all hoping is Teach for America is achieved at this point but

600
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
And we had a

601
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Max

602
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
The folks who had never been

603
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
In an environment like this and we're never

604
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Many of them

605
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
Who hadn't been working in

606
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,632
Urban rural communities so there was just a lot of

607
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Tension and a lot of issues to sort

608
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
It was

609
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
It was very

610
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
And I was exhaust

611
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
You

612
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Start teaching and you see the micro

613
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
Prakasam of the world playing out in your car

614
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
You know you see kids

615
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
2

616
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
Are facing

617
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
All the challenge

618
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Pictures of

619
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Poverty

620
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Lack of adequate

621
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Healthcare news

622
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Nutritionist

623
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
Racial discrimination the whole bed

624
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
And

625
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
It's very overwhelming

626
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
So

627
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
Pioneering first Corps members

628
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Hi-Tech

629
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,936
Find their way to solution

630
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,520
You know often from other teachers in their schools and

631
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
Ultimately we're learning

632
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Once that first class of teachers went

633
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
Go to their to their schools and start

634
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Start teach

635
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
Did you just have to get right back on the fundraising

636
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Hamster wheel

637
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
I mean this in a non the recruitment

638
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,048
Sidon it's a cycle rate like every year and so yeah the fundraising never stops me not to

639
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Just kind of an ongoing

640
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Underlying

641
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Constantly

642
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Cuz that was where all of your Revenue was going to come from

643
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Different fundraising right

644
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
It's a

645
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,640
Nonprofits is very different from

646
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
This is mention the other companies

647
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Is weed on the show

648
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
But it does business

649
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
I mean you were a Christian business

650
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Yeah

651
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
When the hardest pieces you say was around

652
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Recruiting selecting training

653
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
But then

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
There was how you managed

655
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
When I had no idea what

656
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
I was doing

657
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
I mean I hadn't really

658
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Really idealist

659
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,216
Notions you know we should all make the same salary in there shouldn't be any hierarchy and all sorts of things

660
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,568
Which now I might think maybe this path to some of that but it

661
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
What time is it

662
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Chaos

663
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
And and then ultimately

664
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
Most importantly be there also

665
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
Political parties you know how do you navigate the

666
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,576
Politics of education but probably most fundamentally kafka

667
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
He can't do any

668
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Without reason

669
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
How are we going to

670
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,720
Sustain this thing financially because none of those donors

671
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Thought they were going to stay

672
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Stick with it

673
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
And we were losing donors

674
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Like half a million $1000000

675
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Trunks

676
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
And

677
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
How to completely convert the funding base

678
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Essentially over

679
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
And that kind of threw us into

680
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
2

681
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
What I think of as the dark years of

682
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
Teach for America you don't like

683
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
Every paycheck

684
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Every payroll

685
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
You know there's a question about whether we work

686
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Can I meet at

687
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Was there something

688
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
It happened during during a period that was pretty

689
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Particularly deaf

690
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,184
If there was so much

691
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
Probably the most

692
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
Excruciating moment

693
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Was

694
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
When President Clinton

695
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Launched Americorps

696
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
List national service initiative

697
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
Teach for America with one of those first

698
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,336
Partners with Americorps and said that Federal funding really gave

699
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Big Boost

700
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
But the second year

701
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
There was

702
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
Them all sorts of question actually about our

703
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
Financial viability

704
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
And so

705
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
The defects were operating Americorps

706
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Wouldn't

707
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Approve

708
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
I granted

709
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Teach for America and

710
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
This is about

711
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Doyoon

712
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
And we have five

713
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Teachers who think the

714
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Going to training but we didn't have

715
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Have the money to even

716
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
Fly them there

717
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
And so I felt like

718
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Is that

719
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Either we get the government alive

720
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Approval

721
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Or

722
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
We shut it down

723
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
We were ready

724
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
We were ready

725
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
To FedEx

726
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
Letters to all 500

727
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
We can't make it

728
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
You're not going to be able to come

729
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
And

730
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
We could not get

731
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
Anyone in the government

732
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
You know I'm still in my

733
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
20 is 20

734
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Whatever we still had

735
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,192
Only so much credibility and we're dealing with these governmental

736
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Officials

737
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
And you know

738
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,848
We were taking ourselves a lot more seriously than they were taking us let's just say but

739
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
Ultimately at about

740
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
1 minute before we would have

741
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Person.

742
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,808
Plan B after shutting it down they finally came through but that was

743
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
One of many many examples of the

744
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Extreme stress of

745
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
La Terra I mean

746
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
What how much money did you need

747
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Tatume payroll

748
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Artem TV

749
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Well

750
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
I mean I think that Grant was

751
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
Just a big one you know is probably one and a half million

752
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
Price of that

753
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
When and why did it come in at the last

754
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
I mean we were calling every

755
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Single

756
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Personal

757
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Lever week

758
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Could possibly

759
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Come up with

760
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
And ultimately I guess we wore them down

761
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
But you know these things happen

762
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Like this is what happens in Vegas

763
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Bureaucracies and it's

764
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
Happens to social lunch

765
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,976
Panera's you know I mean ultimately it all works out cuz

766
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
You can appreciate the ecosystem

767
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Environment and that's why

768
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
From here to Old

769
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,680
Thrived but I think it's kind of the definition of social on

770
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
Her Shipley

771
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,288
There aren't natural funding sources so you you almost have to

772
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,616
Create them and ultimately by your existence help shape them in

773
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Until that happened it's just

774
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,688
Excruciating

775
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
How to make it

776
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Wendy I guess

777
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
Maybe maybe it was about five years into

778
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
America

779
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
The staff like

780
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
For my bed like

781
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Dave Dave revolted a rebelde

782
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
Brenda quit

783
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
What was going on

784
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Oh gosh that was even earlier I mean

785
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
I think it was our second year actually we were all at our training and

786
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
Cute and

787
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,520
I was still I had this notion of no hierarchy

788
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
Which was a genuine notion I just thought

789
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
If we're all on the same

790
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
You know we're on the same Mission why do we need a higher out of a self-directed

791
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
But people decided this was because I wanted to control everything and they just decided unless we

792
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,184
Can make all Decisions by vote we're all walking out the door how many people

793
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Who said that

794
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
Well it was everyone sitting in a room

795
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
People without

796
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,472
If we can't vote on every decision by democratic

797
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
And so would you do

798
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,384
Well at this point I didn't know what to do I was honestly still remembers like midnight

799
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
I'm so exhausted

800
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,968
And one of our

801
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
Staff members who turned into my husband later much later

802
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
Raises hand and said

803
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Wendy

804
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
I was making no sense and wasn't being responsive

805
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,792
So what I'm hearing you say is that we're not

806
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
Going to make all Decisions by vote is that right

807
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
And even then I had like I should have said yes

808
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,520
But now if so we all left and the next morning I sent out

809
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Note saying

810
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
You know

811
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
We're not going to make decisions by voting you know what no one lie

812
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,784
Was there any truth in what they were saying like were you autocratic and in your style

813
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Let's just say

814
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
I wasn't on

815
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
Autocratic in Mayan

816
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Tension

817
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
You know I really did have this thought that everyone should know

818
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Just do the right

819
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Fang

820
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
You know so it was just not playing at

821
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Itself out of

822
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
Intended so I'm sure that there was some truth

823
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
On all sides

824
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
When when you are

825
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
24 whatever

826
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
25 however old you are

827
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
The time in

828
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
The whole team is like hey we want to

829
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
Vote of no confidence

830
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Even even if it wasn't but it kind of fun

831
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
That kind of Lies

832
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Did you did it shake you

833
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Did you sleep feel like

834
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
Exacerbating self-doubt

835
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Oh yes

836
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
It did

837
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
But I didn't

838
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Know what to do

839
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
I mean part of what

840
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Was leading me

841
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,728
Stay in it was just

842
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
A sense of responsibility like

843
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
I couldn't figure out how to get

844
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
Get out of it I mean honestly if someone had a

845
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Peered

846
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
So I felt like could get us

847
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Out of this

848
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
And get us to

849
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Stability or something I wouldn't

850
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Turn the whole thing over to them

851
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
There's no doubt about that I mean I was just

852
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
In fact I was

853
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Looking for

854
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Let's play

855
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,024
I couldn't seem to find the answer other than to keep put my head down and

856
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
And keep going out until we could get out of it

857
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
Once once you get out of bed

858
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
You know

859
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Became more financially stable

860
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Were you able to

861
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
To start seeing the impact

862
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Teach for America

863
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
Well I think

864
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,968
I mean we were seeing even your five we were

865
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
Starting to see real evidence of

866
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Beyond the immediate impact

867
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
What are teachers what some of our alumni were starting

868
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
To do

869
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Like we were starting to see

870
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
The big idea play itself out

871
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:41,376
These people aren't leaving their dedicated themselves to this they're becoming the pioneering leaders we thought they'd

872
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Tissot

873
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,496
That's what kept us going through these dark years like realizing that acts

874
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
This really

875
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,080
Is killing it really is working

876
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
Because we were seeing enough evidence in classrooms

877
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
And enough evidence

878
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Even a whole school's that actually

879
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
When you meet kids

880
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,856
Who are facing a lot of challenges and have a lot of assets

881
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
You know with high expectations and the extras

882
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,744
Support they need Dell excel at an absolute scale so

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
That

884
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,120
Recognition is what really inspired us to say okay Halloween

885
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
Pastiche America really start to take off

886
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
And grow and grow and get more

887
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Mark Hutchins

888
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
You also

889
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,616
With more disability comes more criticism

890
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
And I just

891
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
Trying to think of me you were

892
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Still pretty young

893
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,528
You had no teaching experience

894
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
There were

895
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Professional Educators who are kind of going after you

896
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
Criticizing Teach for America everything from

897
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
This is your wife

898
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
Eternalism of middle-class wealthy

899
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Poor neighborhoods

900
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,840
Color to

901
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
You know there's not enough

902
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Training to

903
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,448
You know they're only there for two years

904
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
Detection disruptive

905
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Did that

906
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Did the curse of hurt you did it

907
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
They keep you up at night

908
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:02,528
You know we were working very hard to get better you know when the criticism actually started pretty early on it mean

909
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
You know this was a constant

910
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Fred

911
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
During our first date

912
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,488
In a way we were our own harshest critics and we were

913
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Tearing ourselves

914
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Buttonweed

915
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Felt that we needed

916
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Things a lot

917
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Better

918
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
So

919
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
I guess our assessment was

920
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
The World Isn't

921
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Going to be better

922
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
If we shut down

923
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Teach for America

924
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
So there's really only one option

925
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
What does to get better

926
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,640
So you just it didn't it didn't faze you

927
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Well

928
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,504
It's not that it didn't I mean the fact is it made the work so much

929
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
More difficult you know

930
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
It's easy now

931
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
2

932
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Justify a decision to

933
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Go off

934
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
To work for the consulting firm

935
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
For two years to Teach for America really good

936
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Sing like there's enough

937
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
Question out there in the

938
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,936
Blogosphere you know and Enzo definitely made the work more difficult but

939
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,496
You know it was the criticism became

940
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
Probably at its most extreme

941
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
We were seeing

942
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
Palatable

943
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
In communities

944
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:06,272
I mean when we started placing teachers in Washington DC it was the lowest-performing of all the major urban districts

945
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
Kids for 2 years behind the kids in Harlem and now it's the fastest improving Urban schools

946
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
System in the country

947
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Yeah everything

948
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
Graduation rates enrollment rates everything moving in the right direction

949
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
The fact is if you took the teachforamerica people out of that City not just the teachers during the two years right but the

950
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,544
900 teachers who are still in the system and the

951
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,944
The school principals and the last two schools chancellors who presided over the system for a decade and one of them

952
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,296
Save an alarm of everyone

953
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
And that one city

954
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,184
Name a city I could tell you the stats against really they become such

955
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
A leadership Force

956
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
14th in the city soap

957
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Take it all you want

958
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
But

959
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
I guess my view is

960
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,472
Proposed the alternative we have here

961
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Frenched

962
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,592
Systemic issue

963
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
That cannot be solved from within classes

964
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Right

965
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,552
No amount of teaching is going to solve this we need incredible teachers

966
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,136
But we also need some of those people who understand what you understand

967
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Keychain

968
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
And decide I'm not

969
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
I go because

970
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
School principal in schools and some who say I'm going to work

971
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,120
System I want some you say I'm going to run for office cuz we got to change the policy

972
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
Contacting some you say I'm going to start something that proves the child welfare system

973
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,472
Is that

974
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
Until we do that we will never solve this problem

975
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
And that's what Teach for America trying to do so

976
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,992
I know that and I know that we need to stay the course because I have yet to see another thing that's made a bigger

977
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,040
Difference in really tackling

978
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
The systemic challenging

979
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
It's full complexity

980
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
And the critics

981
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
You know I wish they dive in and help us do better.

982
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Essentially

983
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
What's Teach for America

984
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
Budget today

985
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
It's about 300 million

986
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Wow

987
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Cute

988
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
It's gone from Two and a half million

989
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
If 300 million

990
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
20

991
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Teachers disease

992
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Supreme does it there about

993
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
You know seven to eight thousand teachers at any given

994
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,736
And 50000 alumni

995
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
I wasn't alone

996
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,088
Most of whom I will say are still in the work

997
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Wendy mean

998
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
I think anybody hearing this

999
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
To conclude that you could have been a

1000
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Start up business

1001
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
A for-profit company

1002
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
And

1003
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Probably

1004
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Metronome

1005
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Colors that you do you have a talent

1006
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Skill

1007
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,032
To do that and

1008
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
And I wonder whether

1009
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
You could have gone on a

1010
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
And on that and let's say you had three hundred million dollars now you could have just been a huge philanthropist and given three hundred million dollars

1011
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Cars 2

1012
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Education

1013
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
Projects in your name would be everywhere to be the Wendy Kopp building for Education reform and people messing up to you would have

1014
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Who knows but I

1015
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Just not

1016
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,632
There's really not a bone in my body I feel like I don't even know how I would

1017
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Do that like

1018
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,936
You know what everyone's cut out

1019
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
Things in NY

1020
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Shaped by early experiences

1021
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Horse butt

1022
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,848
I don't even I have not won in

1023
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
To do that right like I'm so to this day I'm I've never been more energy

1024
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
Like 27 or Harvard

1025
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Many years in

1026
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,392

Thanks for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and when Chris Waters

1052
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
Wakes up in San Diego on most days heads to his usual job he's an account manager at a stop

1053
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
It's just

1054
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:46,848
Phone usually talking to relatively unhappy people to talk to

1055
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,688
Tivoli happy people which explains how he started his side business

1056
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,808
A few years back he was on the website Reddit and read it has this thing around Christmas

1057
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
I'm where the connect you with a total stranger

1058
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
And then you can send them a gift

1059
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
And then I eat that match for this guy who live 20 minutes away and I was thinking about what to give him

1060
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
What I could do with this great opportunity where you live so close and Chris was thinking Way Beyond the scope of this

1061
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
Hold secret Santa thing

1062
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
Send a boring gift card or a

1063
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Snack box

1064
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
And fortunately I was hosting a weekly poker game with my friends and I had just happen to one five weeks in a row and so

1065
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,624
I had a lot of extra money like almost $2,000 in extra money and Chris.

1066
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
Pay it forward and put together this

1067
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,024
Really elaborate and expensive secret Santa gifts

1068
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
I like doing things for the people I like creating something

1069
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,752
I don't know special and magical and if you have the opportunity to do something truly spectacular for someone

1070
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,800
Including an internet stranger

1071
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
You should

1072
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Take that opportunity

1073
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,943
Okay so it's important mention here that Chris is really into scavenger hunt

1074
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,271
10 buried treasure in planting Clues and stuff like that

1075
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
Jokes for secret santa guy

1076
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Chris wound up planning this incredible day-long Adventure at 8 a.m. a century-old

1077
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
2 case

1078
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,583
Filled with envelopes and a box with a chain wrapped around it

1079
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
I was hand delivered to his door

1080
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
This is all happening around Scottsdale Arizona by the way they got to a place where there was an envelope with two tickets to the zoo

1081
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,383
And at the animal pens there was kind of a cipher that you used to decode the message

1082
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,199
And then it sent them to a restaurant where the

1083
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
The server said

1084
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
We've been expecting you like Chris wind up spending something like $600 of his poker money on ticket

1085
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
Get some chachis include meals

1086
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,743
Old for this total stranger

1087
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:46,143
And at the end of this incredible day Chris actually met up with the guy at a local bar his name is Blaine and as you

1088
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Blaine was

1089
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,543
Pretty blown away and couple days later plane posted to Reddit

1090
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,943
And it just blew up Plains post about his secret santa experience went to number one on Reddit front page

1091
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,343
I told Crystal to get inundated with messages just people commenting and privately messaging thing that you need to do this in

1092
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,671
The biggest you need to do on here I live in England can you come over here and do this

1093
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,767
I'm in the business is saying we would like to be a part of this and that

1094
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:19,167
Is how Chris started his business constructed Adventures he puts together these personalized scavenger hunt

1095
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,055
Excursions for people's birthdays and marriage proposals and stuff like that and

1096
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
It's pretty good money minimum

1097
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,479
Probably going to cost them about 1 to $2,000 for the whole shabang

1098
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Chris is made about

1099
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
$20,000 for the past

1100
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
2 years

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
Just doing it part-time but

1102
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,439
Listen breaking news here is that boring office job you talked about
