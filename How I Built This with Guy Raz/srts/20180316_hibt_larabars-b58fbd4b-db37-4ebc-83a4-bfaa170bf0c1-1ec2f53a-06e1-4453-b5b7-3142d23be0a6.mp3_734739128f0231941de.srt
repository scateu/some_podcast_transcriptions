What happened to that name well the trademarking attorney called me at the eleventh hour

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
And we were getting ready to launch it was the year 2002 summer and she said I think you're going to need

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Change the name

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
And I just thought you're joking right I'd left working at Whole Foods and

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
We're supposed to be watching that we don't launch and everybody's backing out because nothing's happening

Stories behind the movement

00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
American through dates cashews and dried cherries into

Cuisinart and turn that mushy mix into Larabars one of the best selling energy bars

18
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
In America

19
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
Sophie recently walk to the energy bar section

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
The supermarket

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,744
You might be surprised were overwhelmed by the number of

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Choices

23
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
I need for starters that are hundreds of different types of energy bars

24
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Which is kind of

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Protein bars

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Paleo bars

00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008

00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
Cacao infused with matcha powder

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
Probably an energy bar out there

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
For each and everyone of us

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
And that whole Revolution

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
It really got started in the 1990s

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Clif Bar

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,928
84 previous episodes of the show you might have heard our interview with Gary Erickson who actually invented

35
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Does Clif bars

36
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Well in the early 2000s

37
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Lara merriken

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Camp Jose

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,912
Pretty simple concept that shockingly wasn't really out there in the world

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
It was an energy bar made from two or three Rodriguez

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Like almonds

42
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Are cashews

43
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
All bound together with

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Dates

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
No alarm

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Big deal today right

47
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
You can get them

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
Pretty much anywhere any 7-Eleven

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Put back in the day

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
End of revolutionary

51
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
And how she even came to inventing them to building this brand

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Well there was no Direct

53
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
Pat Lauren never intended to start her own business or even to sell a product

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,240
She grew up in the Denver area or parents rent a pretty successful high-end clothing

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
And Laura was really into sports was actually good enough to make the USC women's volleyball

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,968
Graduate from college with a degree in

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Psychology

58
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Wasn't really sure what to do

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,112
So she came back to Denver and got a job as a social worker

60
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
And she turns to work with kids and teenagers

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
You needed help

62
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
It was hard

63
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
I mean just emotionally

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Difficult job it was

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Intense it was always chaotic

66
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
We were on call every

67
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,288
6 weeks I think this is a timer attic. Page around remember the pager days

68
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:30,944
And if the pager went off at 2 in the morning because somebody ran away from our treatment facility you had to answer the phone call

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
But it was

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
It was intense work in the sea

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,136
15 year old girls actually 13 year old girls with kids

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,952
And I had to manage their care with the

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
The judicial system I went

74
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
Wordalot I made recommendations

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
It was one of the most stressful jobs

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
Ever had in my life and I was in my early twenties

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
How long did it take you

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Before you

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Jeopardize

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
A year-and-a-half so if you're doing this and

81
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
You decide

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
This is not

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
This is not for me

84
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,504
I knew I needed to change what the landscape look like

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
So

86
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,624
I wanted to help these kids but I wanted to do it in more of a recreation

87
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
I didn't want it

88
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Feel like I was the police all the time

89
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
And so I be

90
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
Became a

91
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Community involvement leader and I got

92
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
These kids involved in the community

93
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
How long did you do that for

94
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
About 4 years

95
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
I really loved

96
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
In the more recreational component with

97
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
These kids and kind of

98
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Opening their eyes to a bigger world

99
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
And hoping that

100
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
They saw opportunity for themselves that was very gratifying

101
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Like you would play

102
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Like sports of them and take them

103
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
For like

104
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Nature walks

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
I would do anything and everything

106
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,327
I mean we went to a natural food grocery store one day and got a tour of that and

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
Then I would take them to Rockies games cuz somebody would donate the tickets and then

108
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
We had the

109
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Cat petting club and I take them to the local animal shelter cuz they couldn't have pets

110
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
And their home

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
And then we would have our community garden and

112
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
So is a year-round program they come after school and then during the summer I basically ran a summer camp

113
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
And then I would teach him how to cook and do arts and crafts I mean anything I could think of to do I would do so dislike your MB

114
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Yeah that was your management training

115
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
It was good it was

116
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
It was really fun I mean

117
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
To this day I still

118
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Is children and I wonder

119
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Where they are was happy

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
What they're doing

121
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,495
So during this time that I was being a social worker

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
Working as a social worker I was also

123
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Cultivating this passion for now

124
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Well

125
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
So let's go back to college

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
College volleyball

127
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Our coach had a

128
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Rule of

129
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
No sugar and no red meat

130
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
So

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
At the time I was totally in the junk

132
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
What I was 18 years old

133
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
You know my favorite place to eat was any fast food restaurant you can name

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Then I opposite of started to stop eating sugar and

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
No red meat

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Inspector he felt that

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
No red meat no sugar wood

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Results

139
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Inveterate

140
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Performance from his players

141
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
Yes and did he did he like enforce this rule

142
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Oh yes

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Now this was

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Fairy real

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
Like it was a rule in the team and

146
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
And that was a it by the way it's been an intense

147
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Demons that Division 1

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Volleyball

149
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
USC Utah

150
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Majorly

151
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
Pac-10 School

152
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Oh yes

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
I remember thinking I can't believe

154
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
I have the opportunity to play volleyball this

155
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,591
I will do anything this man tells me to do

156
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
And

157
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
Then I also said I'm starting to stop eating sugar

158
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
No red meat

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
It was really an interesting experience so I start feeling better

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
So

161
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
That was the first light bulb

162
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Went off for me

163
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
Post-college I mean I'm working as a social worker I start doing all this reading

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
When I start having migraines

165
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
I started getting migraines out of nowhere I've never had them

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
But I got a blood test and learned that I was actually very allergic to wheat

167
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
Wow you've been eating wheat your whole life and an africology

168
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Yes I mean

169
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
Wheats

170
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Everything everything

171
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
So this is in the early 90s

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,367
The time in there wasn't really many options and their their solution to this is

173
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
Stop eating wheat and I'm thinking what what am I going to eat

174
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
So at the time

175
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
I didn't even really know

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
My cookbook

177
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
You know I grew up with two working parents

178
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
My mom went to school

179
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
It was just

180
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
I'm sliding over these

181
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,359
A stove is very much Convenient Food oriented

182
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
So I really didn't know how to cook why to learn how to

183
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Cook for myself because I had such a limited diet

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
And I got introduced to Natural Foods

185
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,207
So things like kale and quinoa and all the things that we kind of know now is normal

186
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Totally for it

187
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
Especially in the mid-nineties

188
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
It's like

189
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
It was weird.

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
First and then I had

191
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
I thought well

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
I'm going to embrace this

193
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
And so I would

194
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
Read everything I could

195
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
About

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
Recipes and nutrition and I just

197
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Got into it

198
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
And I made the most of it so that I started thinking to myself in the background of going through this whole experience and feeling better

199
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
I thought

200
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
I love naps

201
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
Make such

202
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,791
This is common sense to me why don't people know about this why isn't somebody teaching us

203
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
About

204
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Healthy food

205
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,703
And so my passion started to build

206
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
So I guess it at a certain point you stopped working with

207
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
Kids and did you find another job or did you

208
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
Which kind of starter

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
What you want to do

210
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Well

211
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,951
I knew I had an excitement and passion for Natural Foods I just didn't know how I was going to make a transition

212
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Between

213
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Being a social worker

214
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
A natural foods

215
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
They were two completely different worlds

216
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
What was going on in your personal life or you single at the time I was married

217
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
And I was in the middle of

218
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Getting divorce

219
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
So is

220
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
A huge

221
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Change for me

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
And I realized that I needed to get a divorce in the middle of all of this

223
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
See where you were young

224
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
Young woman married and getting

225
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Yes

226
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
And I'm thinking about changing my career

227
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,415
In a matter of like 6 months

228
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
And what were you

229
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Thinking about doing

230
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
I didn't know

231
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
But all I knew

232
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Is that

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
I needed to

234
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Find the courage

235
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
To take a leap of faith

236
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
And somehow someway I figured that out

237
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
For myself

238
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
And

239
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
I left my marriage

240
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
I left my job

241
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
And decided I'm going to go back to school and I'm going to study

242
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
I want to get into natural

243
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Medical school

244
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Naturopathic is like

245
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Natural homeopathic

246
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Yes so there's

247
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
That's cool in Seattle Washington

248
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
And 1 in

249
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Portland Oregon

250
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Naturopathic medicine

251
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
And I thought

252
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
I'm going to practice.

253
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Which covers all natural medicine

254
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,823
Nutrition acupuncture everything and that's what I really

255
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
I think that's

256
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
The direction I want to go

257
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
I looked at the school for years

258
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
Really renowned school I thought this is what I'm going to do so I started take

259
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Can chemistry

260
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Physics

261
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Ali size classes at the local Community College

262
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
And actually move back out to California

263
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
My parents were living out there

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
So I'm on my path taking classes

265
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
I made a friend of mine

266
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
A dear friend of mine now one day eating at the local health

267
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Bistro Reading lunch

268
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
And he drags me

269
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
To this

270
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Raw food

271
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Classen

272
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,639
I have one of the most amazing meals I've ever had in my life at this class and I

273
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Wow

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
What foods are kind of amazing

275
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
And it just never had a curtain

276
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,159
And meanwhile I'm taking my classes I got accepted to this program to

277
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Schools 1 + Seattle + 1 +

278
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
Washington and I thought I'm going to be a naturopath

279
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Pick doctor that's what I'm going to do

280
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,935
And I went to a meeting with all the doctors in California and they were very limited in their scope

281
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Practice there at the time

282
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Because

283
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
The laws weren't open

284
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
There and I went to this meeting and it was like April

285
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
I was moving to Seattle in

286
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
July of this is like

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
This is

288
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
The year 2000

289
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Mm okay

290
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,159
So I was three months away from moving to Seattle I was thrilled to death I got into

291
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
The school I went to this meeting with all these

292
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
You know naturopaths that has been naturopaths for 20 years

293
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
And this meeting

294
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Scared the living

295
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Why because

296
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
All of these p

297
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
People

298
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
We're passionate

299
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
But because the state of California didn't allow them to really practice their scope of Medicine

300
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Because the the laws limited them

301
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
It just look like a giant struggle

302
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Frustrating

303
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
To be able to have a degree in something and not

304
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Gilda really do it

305
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,951
And then I went back to Colorado over Memorial Day weekend visit one of my dearest and oldest friend

306
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
And

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
I went hiking

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
And

309
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
I was just

310
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,935
Kind of eating a trail mix and thinking of food and raw foods and

311
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:29,823
Thinking about moving to Seattle and all of a sudden I'm on this mountain and this light bulb goes off for me

312
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
And I say

313
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Why isn't somebody made

314
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Fruit nuts and spices like something very

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Just pure simple

316
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Real foods

317
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
What is portable inconvenience

318
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
But it tastes indulgently

319
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
You shouldn't be eating

320
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
Like junk junk food I mean

321
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
I don't know that day at that moment it was like the surge of energy I got I could feel the

322
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around everyday with ideas

323
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
But for whatever reason it that day in that time and all those little experiences that built up

324
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
I just felt it

325
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
So what you do did you like run home and and an insert like writing things down or drawing pictures

326
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
Or do you just kind of mullet over throat for a while so I ran on the mountain

327
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
Can I start writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver

328
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
But how can I take fruit nuts and spices and and turn them into something really exciting and I would

329
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
Get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay how do I take cherry

330
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
Free pie and make it just in my Cuisinart basically a Roth raw unprocessed food

331
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,719
And make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread

332
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
What have you

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Did you immediately think

334
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
Hey I can turn this into a business or was it more like

335
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Experiment and see

336
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
See if I can make this

337
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Back

338
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
I did think

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
I think I can turn this into a business

340
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
I don't even know I think it was like a day later

341
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
And the next thing you know I'm thinking

342
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
I'm going to start

343
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Business

344
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
And I'm going to do this in the next 3 months

345
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
I mean

346
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
Can I use that to think that you're going to start a business in 3 months

347
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
And I called my parents

348
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
And

349
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Everybody thought it was

350
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
Completely out of my mind

351
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
Do they think it was like an early

352
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Midlife crisis

353
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
I don't know what they thought

354
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
They just thought

355
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
We Center

356
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
You know

357
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
2 through private

358
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
High School

359
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
USC she's graduated she's 32 years old

360
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Oh my God what's what's going on here

361
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
But it was actually great that

362
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
People question me

363
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
And wondered why I was doing what I was doing

364
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
And especially my family because it made me dig in more and

365
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Recognize that

366
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
I really did want to do it

367
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
That I didn't need to get approval from anybody

368
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
But that I needed

369
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
I had found something that was important to me

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
And

371
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
I just could not be stopped

372
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
I arranged to stay with another friend of mine

373
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
Moved in with her and then I would

374
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,743
Take these concoctions that I would come up with him with using the Cuisinart

375
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
That I had for years by the way I've never actually used it I didn't even know how to use

376
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
And for some reason I

377
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Got the Cuisinart out and

378
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
I would

379
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Do what's called

380
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
Officially called a focus group I didn't even know the name

381
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
And I would

382
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,175
I created my own little survey and I would ask people why do you

383
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
You know what do we need energy bars for why do you like them why don't you like me

384
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
In all these things

385
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
People would sell them out

386
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
And then

387
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
I would

388
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Give them my concoctions and say please tell me what you think

389
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Is that how you developed your recipes

390
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Yes

391
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
The interesting thing is the recipes came fairly

392
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
Ino because I would sample my friends and they would give me feedback

393
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
I really like the Cherry but I don't taste Cherry in every bite

394
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
And I would

395
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Go back to the drawing board

396
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Think I need to add

397
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Mortuaries

398
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
You should taste cherry and everybody

399
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
You shouldn't be searching for it

400
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Then it doesn't taste like cherry pie

401
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Right

402
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
By the way how did you make

403
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Like how did you

404
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
I think of Cherry Pie Liqueur

405
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Is dried cherries and

406
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
What else

407
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Well

408
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
So I would go to this natural food store

409
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Because

410
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
Everything was less expensive there

411
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
And I would buy dried cherries and dried bananas and dried apples and

412
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
Then I would come up with the idea of cherry pie

413
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Okay let me see if I can make cherry pie with these cherries

414
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
The dates of the almond

415
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
And they sold these tart unsweetened cherries I will never forget they were the best tasting thing because it actually

416
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
Real Cherry without a bunch of sugar in them yeah

417
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
And then

418
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
What is today larabar cherry pie

419
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Is from these cherries

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
And you're in your kitchen

421
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
Which Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like

422
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Nothing

423
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Ball rolling on the queen

424
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Sticky

425
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Sticky ball of a mass

426
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
And then we would like to take it out with your hands and

427
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,415
Like I was rolling out with a rolling pin and then

428
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Got to Qatar

429
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
And I would like I would cut it out

430
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Just in your kitchen and I would make samples

431
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
I mean

432
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,191
Batch after batch after batch

433
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
And did you have any of your own any cash to get those sort of ask your parents help you out in that year while you were not

434
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
Dino World getting a salary how did you

435
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Within

436
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,111
About a week I realized oh I had a little bit of money saved up

437
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
And then I saw it

438
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Restart this business but I have to

439
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Work I have

440
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Job

441
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
You know

442
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
So

443
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
Whole Foods open their first store in Denver

444
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:18,239
At exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they

445
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
In the neighborhood I grew up and actually

446
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
And

447
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
I thought

448
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
I'm going to get a job with

449
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
I'm going to work in their Nutrition department doing what I love

450
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
But I'm in a cigarette

451
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
The business and how it works

452
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
And use it as a learning opportunity

453
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
Almost like a paid internship in a sentence

454
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Like incredibly

455
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Prescient

456
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
It's really amazing planning reminds me of

457
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
We interview Ben & Jerry's

458
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Is and a

459
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
People think that they were just

460
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
She's happy easy but they actually likes

461
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Turn a street corner with a

462
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Counter to count how many people pass the

463
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
The street corner when they were looking

464
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
Looking for a location for their Ben & Jerry's you like

465
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
That is a real

466
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,991
Planning moment you were you were sort of looking ahead and say all right with him to do this business

467
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
At least learn that

468
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Whole Foods

469
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Look up

470
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Cashier Whole Foods

471
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,511
I got a job in the Nutrition department doing what I love which was working around

472
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
All the nutrition products

473
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
So I thought okay I'm enjoying myself but I'm also going to

474
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
I'll have a first

475
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
Hand view of what it's like

476
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Have a product in their store and what does that mean

477
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
From the standpoint of

478
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
The vendor and it was one of the

479
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Best decisions I ever made

480
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
So at what point

481
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
You think yourself

482
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Okay this is going to be

483
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Really

484
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Is really going to be at

485
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Big deal like this

486
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
I'm not sure I ever thought that

487
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,095
It was such a gradual progression so I first

488
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,191
You know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends

489
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Should say

490
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
I would buy that

491
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
And that

492
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
That little tidbit of

493
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Asking me to buy it would make me feel

494
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
So excited

495
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
And motivated to get to the next place which was

496
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
How in the world am I demand

497
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
The facts are these

498
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Yeah

499
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Where am I going to get dates and almonds

500
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
And cherries

501
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,511
I didn't even know I'm buying them at a natural food grocery store in little baggies

502
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
What do I know about almonds and dates

503
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
And all that stuff

504
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
What do I know about manufacturing a

505
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
And at the time

506
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,823
I started questioning am I actually going to do this or should I just go to work for Whole Foods

507
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
If you want to do that

508
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
And just to clarify again how are you

509
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
Just like sort of funding The Spinners like buying the ingredients and stuff

510
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Will you using your own money

511
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Again I had a job at Whole Foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious

512
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,911
I don't know I have moments where I would be really gung-ho and I would

513
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
Get all kinds of great information and a month would go by and I would find out about a piece of manufacturing equipment

514
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Or just little things

515
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
And I would be so motivated and somebody want to buy bars and I'd make them a a batch of bars in these little ziplock bag

516
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
Eggs in a little Chinese takeout box

517
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
And I would

518
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:19,232
They would pay me like $22 or something for a box of bars and I would think how

519
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
And then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and

520
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:32,032
Then I would just get really unmotivated and nothing would happen and this went on for

521
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
The three-year period

522
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,640
Between my idea phase and when I actually launched

523
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm trying to figure out how you

524
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Maintained your

525
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
Optimism in confidence about all this

526
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
I mean

527
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
You're 32

528
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Your divorce

529
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,256
And I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this

530
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
I don't like was part of you

531
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
Did you ever get the feeling that people look you in kind of think

532
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Oh yeah that's Laura

533
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Weird Science

534
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
A lot of people thought that

535
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
I mean

536
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
I would see people I went to HighSchool with and they would come into Whole Foods and

537
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,552
You know the dirt dirty climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh

538
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
I didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and

539
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,256
Even if I had those moments with people were

540
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
I would

541
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,144
Notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life

542
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
And you have to go for it and embrace it

543
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,848
Make it happen when we come back

544
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,456
Hella embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly

545
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
Figured out how to turn her kitchen project

546
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Into a business

547
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720

Stream NPR

565
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm Tyrone

566
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,144
2001 American is working at Whole Foods Denver into trying to

567
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Figure out how to start a car

568
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,032
But you don't have a whole lot of money and she doesn't have any professional equipment

569
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,616
Or even a way to process and package her energy bar

570
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
So eventually I went to a packaging company in Denver and they weren't even taking me seriously and they just

571
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,856
Tell them you said Hey how do I make the sun on a bigger scale

572
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,440
What I said I need packaging and then they they look at me and go

573
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,608
They couldn't take me seriously didn't even have a business in that they give me a giant book that looked so tedious to read through

574
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,240
And they will read some of this and come back and we'll talk to you about packaging and then I would read enough that I would come back

575
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Partially educated and then they

576
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
They started realizing I was serious about it

577
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
You want it you were looking for somebody to you

578
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
LED food-grade packaging package or bars

579
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,672
Yes she's in the Cuisinart I was trying to find a giant Cuisinart I was trying to

580
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
I didn't even know what that was called is called a vertical cutter mixer I learned and and then that led to

581
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
Some guy that they knew that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that lo-and-behold was the exact thing that I need

582
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,616
And so because I had the tenacity to ask

583
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
And I wasn't afraid

584
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,504
At a time when a lot of people question what I was doing

585
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
But I knew

586
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,440
That I needed to do it it it gave me the motivation to keep asking questions and to be curious

587
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
And

588
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,632
Tenacious and so I called the guy with a piece of equipment and I'd meet him and then I talked to this guy and he

589
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,704
He said well I'm not really using it if you want to use it you can

590
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
And

591
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
That's how it all kind of piece together

592
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
An individual and you have the name by that point

593
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Larabars

594
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
Well no

595
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
It was a different name

596
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
So

597
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
I was going to name it Mana

598
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,672
And your Mana is your vital energy review

599
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
What

600
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
What happened to that name

601
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
Well the trademarking attorney

602
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Called me at the eleventh hour

603
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
And we were getting ready to launch it was

604
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
The year 2002 summer

605
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
And she said I think there's going to be a problem

606
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
And she said there's actually manna bread manna

607
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
And

608
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
I think it could be confusingly similar

609
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
And I think you're going to do

610
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
I need to change the name

611
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
And I just

612
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Thought

613
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,624
You're joking right I I don't I don't want to deal with this

614
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
That's right now

615
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Naming is one of the hardest things

616
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
So

617
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,096
I got the phone call finally came to terms with the fact that that was going to have to happen

618
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Friend said you know

619
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Which color bar

620
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
You may come either your bars that sounds kind of

621
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Like a good

622
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,688
It rains larabar do you know

623
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
I thought no way

624
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,600
I am not putting my name on this product I don't want my name in there

625
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
No way I'm not doing that

626
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
And then I just kind of sat with it

627
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
For a couple of weeks

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
And I finally thought

629
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Larabar

630
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
I guess that could work

631
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,264
And if I thought you had raised some money

632
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Help me write a business plan

633
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,128
I had a few friends and family interested

634
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
And

635
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
Between the renaming of

636
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
Larabar montamarta larabar and

637
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Manufacturing issues

638
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
I was going to launch in Fall of 2002

639
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,768
And that got delayed until April of 2003

640
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,376
And during that time all of my interested friends and family

641
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
They because they got

642
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
Yeah it was just getting too late

643
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah

644
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
And all these people

645
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:03,712
Are starting to slowly back out because things are not happening I left working at Whole Foods

646
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
It's like mid 2002

647
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
And we're supposed to be launching that we don't

648
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
And everybody's backing out because nothing's

649
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
So

650
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
What you do

651
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Well I had to

652
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Had to raise the money

653
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
And my dad

654
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
Had decided he would like he wanted to get involved in the company

655
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,216
Get a great business background in the retail business

656
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
He knew operations and how to run a company

657
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
And he called me one day and he said

658
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Hey

659
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Would you

660
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
Would you want a business partner

661
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
And then how much money did you

662
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
You decide that you needed

663
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
There really wasn't an amount

664
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
It wasn't really his specific I think

665
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
I think we came up the amount because I had to print Packaging

666
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,024
And we had five flavors that I was launching with

667
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Cashew cookie cake

668
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Cashew cookie

669
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Cherry pie apple pie

670
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
Banana bread and chocolate coconut chew

671
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,360
There was a minimum print run of all of those and I actually printed

672
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
At this company Minnesota

673
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
And I remember it costing somewhere around

674
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
You know a hundred 250

675
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
$2,000

676
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,768
And the manufacturing wasn't working out I've been to now for manufacturing places that did not work out

677
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
And I had a giant vertical cutter mixer in the back of my old Land Cruiser that I would haul around to each facility

678
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Whether it was

679
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Two hours away an hour away 2 hours away what have you and

680
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,128
Them installing a facility ideally you bought this thing

681
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
I borrowed it the giant the giant Cuisinart

682
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,504
Join quizizz 400lb it was on a

683
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Pallet

684
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
And they got the forklift

685
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Into the back of my Land Cruiser

686
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:50,720
So I was running around the state of Colorado trying to find somewhere to manufacture and when your

687
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
Noodle business nobody take me seriously

688
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,888
They didn't even know how to make your product you know they just want me to sit into what they're doing

689
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,264
And so I'm running around trying to find a place to manufacturing all the additional

690
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Investors have now back

691
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
And I remember it was just like

692
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
A dark night in January and

693
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
My dad was getting discouraged

694
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
So I said to him you know it

695
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,368
I believe that this is going to work out I really have faith and I

696
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Think the right people will come along

697
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
At the right time so

698
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,608
I started talking to some other friends about it friends in yoga class friends I worked with the Whole Foods and then all of a sudden

699
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
Holy group of people came that were just

700
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Throwback

701
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
66 people

702
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
I said we'd love to invest money

703
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
And how much did you raise

704
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
What was the total of $150,000

705
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,944
150000 bucks and that was going to get you through

706
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
Some production and printing

707
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,856
More less and then a little bit extra just for operating cost

708
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,696
We were operating out of a tiny duplex in Denver so that overhead was

709
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Extremely low

710
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,840
Manufacturing in the printing nail down but how did you

711
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
Then find the stores to

712
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
By and then

713
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Set alarm

714
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Well

715
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
Let me let me backtrack

716
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,336
To wear it when I was working at Whole Foods before I left

717
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,432
So one morning I was there because this is also

718
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Part of what you're asking me

719
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
So I was on the early shift

720
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
At 8 a.m.

721
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
And one of the grocery guys he said

722
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Lar the guy you need to meet

723
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,488
He's the regional buyer from Austin and he's

724
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
He's the guy he's coming in

725
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
You know this next week he's the guy you should talk

726
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Talk to you about your car

727
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,936
So here I am I'm taking trash out one morning

728
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
It's about 8:15 in the morning

729
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
And

730
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
He walks across my path on the back dock

731
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Of the store

732
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Aspire

733
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,176
And he says oh hey how are you what's

734
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
What's new

735
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
He was being friendly he'd seen me before he didn't know who I was

736
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
And I

737
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,088
In that moment

738
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
I thought

739
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
This is my mom

740
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
And I said

741
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Ojai you know

742
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
This is what's new I've been working on this

743
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Product

744
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Creating my own

745
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
Nutrition bar this and that and

746
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
He literally kind of dead stopped and started doing this

747
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
Lucius

748
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:15,616
I didn't really think it at me I didn't mean that and I'm I'd like to run away from

749
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Free right now

750
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
He said well

751
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
I'm only here for two hours

752
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
GFC apples and he's just trying to

753
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Get rid of me

754
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
And I said

755
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Actually I do have some

756
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,696
I'm leaving in 2 hours I said I can go home and get them at it I mean I had an answer to everything

757
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Is pride

758
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
Make me go away and I wasn't going away

759
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
And

760
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,632
He said okay bring me the samples and just cut it

761
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Walked off

762
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
And so I

763
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
Send my coworker I have to go home right now to take my break

764
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
And so I gave it to him

765
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
And then

766
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
Like an hour later he's sitting there and he goes

767
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Laura

768
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
This is the most Innovative product

769
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
I've tried

770
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
In years

771
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Wow

772
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,856
And I'm standing there

773
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,416
I couldn't even believe my ears

774
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
You know I knew I made a great product

775
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,048
But he's a buyer he's a regional buyer

776
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
And he said when you are ready here's my card

777
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,728
He said give me a call let me know he said dot your eyes cross your t's

778
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
I will let you bring it into

779
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
Colorado store

780
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
And that was just such a motivational

781
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
I bet

782
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
I mean this is you know

783
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Two years in

784
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
And I'm

785
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,856
Questioning what I'm doing and why I'm doing it I'm tired

786
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,952
I don't know what I'm doing and he says this and I think

787
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Wow

788
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
Larabars enter the World ride

789
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Yes

790
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
Finally have raised all the money we wanted to raise

791
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,640
And Manufacturing facility it was the fourth one

792
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
How many bars did you have to make for the first

793
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Big puss

794
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784
The first watch they didn't make the bars

795
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,088
We made the bars how many to make

796
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
500 Bars by hand

797
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
So I had rules of Packaging

798
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,560
Edit vertical cutter mixer essential as you in a bunch of like friends and

799
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,680
It was me my father and then any friend that would help

800
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,008
And it took us about 15 hours to make 500 bars because

801
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
I had to hand cut each

802
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,152
Rapper off of the rolls of film

803
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,712
Make the bar in a roll it out

804
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
With a p

805
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:35,392
With a rolling pin in a pizza cutter and then stuff it in the package in heat seal

806
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
This bars like Whole Foods and then

807
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
Like set up a table with the samples and and try to

808
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
227 people who are shopping list or

809
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
Yes so what I learned

810
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,704
Working at Whole Foods in the three years that I was there among other things was

811
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
When you sample products

812
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
For free the people

813
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
It's this kind of non risky trial

814
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
So in my mind

815
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
The marketing plan for me was to do that

816
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Is to stand in the store

817
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:07,136
Talk to people educate them because what I was doing fruit and nut

818
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
And everybody was afraid of a piece of fruit at the

819
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Did the whole carb thing

820
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,400
The Atkins thing was very big and everybody thought like eating a carrot was a very bad thing so I'm thinking what am I going to do with

821
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,032
Cherries and dates and then in the nuts have high fat in them that's good fat and

822
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
So there was a lot to explain but I had to make it

823
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
Digestible and simple for people

824
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,456
So my whole strategy was to

825
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
Get an each store and

826
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
As often as I could

827
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Lunch and dinner

828
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:41,696
Demo my product cut it up and you were Manning the table and you were like hey you want to try to alarm bar

829
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
I was Manning the table in fact

830
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
I have pictures of me doing all the demo

831
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
And within two

832
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
2 weeks

833
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
Abingdon Whole Foods

834
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,216
Because one of my friends still work there

835
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
He's a liar you have

836
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
Have to go look at the movement chart upstairs and I said

837
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
What he said

838
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
Larabar is the top

839
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
5

840
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
Once your 5 top selling products in the entire store

841
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
Right now it out sells olive oil and water

842
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
You are one of the five

843
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Best selling products

844
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
Insane

845
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,512
I mean I knew I knew in my heart

846
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
From all the feedback I've gotten that people were excited about what I was doing

847
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,960
But I also on the other hand knew that there was going to be challenges and

848
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
That was the I remember the day I got into the stores and I brought it after making those 500 Bars by hand and remember

849
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
Standing there and I was just

850
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
I was excited

851
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Exhilarated anxious

852
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
Scared to death I mean it was like putting a piece of art

853
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,136
What do you think

854
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
I mean

855
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
What explains

856
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,768
Wyatt sold so well I can now you think about

857
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
How many people are paleo

858
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Paleo and

859
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,728
People are doing Whole30 and all these and that's a raw food

860
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Jalama mainstream now

861
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Open 2003

862
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
You know that consist a really big

863
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
You know an answer

864
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Some of these ingredients

865
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
We will survive

866
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
Comment a lot of people think I will I don't know

867
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Knots in the fat

868
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
What

869
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Explains how it took off so

870
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
It was simple

871
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
10 or less ingredients

872
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
You know what these ingredients are

873
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Xiamen state

874
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Cashews

875
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
Cinnamon I mean

876
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Depends on the bar but

877
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Cherries

878
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
You know what these things are and we

879
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
Been eating these

880
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:38,944
Items you know they're grown on trees we know what they are it's not a question and then they were made to taste

881
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,808
I blended them to taste like something you want to eat so I didn't feel like you had to sacrifice

882
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,464
So it's healthy but doesn't taste good I wanted to blend both and I wanted to make it something that you were so happy

883
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Phoenix

884
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,328
2 3 4 5 ingredients the average

885
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
All right there

886
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,656
Like my all-time favorite

887
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
Kashi cookies me too

888
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,056
I love it it is cashews and dates it's so simple

889
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
And I think that's what resonated with people is people had never seen something like this before

890
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,040
Which is in that category such a simple idea

891
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
Complicated with simple ingredients even my dad asked me one day how come somebody else thought about this

892
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
I have no idea but I have

893
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
And I wanted

894
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
This is why we're doing this

895
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,264
Once you launch and Whole Foods and you realize that your top five

896
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
How quickly did

897
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,528
Did Whole Foods generally into the whole foods are all Whole Foods companies actually

898
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
It took a little time I mean it was over the next year

899
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,464
That that started to happen that wasn't as easy as it seemed

900
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,024
But it but it did come together

901
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,424
There was a journalist in Denver that works for the Denver Post and he wrote an article about me Memorial Day of 2000

902
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
3

903
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
And it's literally put

904
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
My company on the map

905
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
Just from that one article

906
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,640
I will always be grateful for that and

907
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
From that the industry paper

908
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,784
Caught it and then all these stories from California

909
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,392
Started calling and so I started launching in California

910
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
And

911
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,768
It just started to build how are you making the bars faster

912
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,704
We were doing anything and everything we could to me

913
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,544
My father started taking over manufacturing operations

914
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,080
And then we started

915
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
Just getting help

916
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
You have to hire

917
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
We are we are we are

918
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,736
And we were really riding a great wave

919
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
You are told you are getting a lot of

920
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
I mean we we were two years in we were

921
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,904
Basically a national brand now and show Revenue

922
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000

7

925
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
Million-dollar

926
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,936
About 5 to get we were jumping

927
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,032
Crazy growth

928
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
Your whole life from light

929
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Mm

930
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
To launch and then

931
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
In the middle of this song

932
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
2000-5000

933
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,344
Will you be working like crazy or by the time

934
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
You're hitting 5 to 7 billion in sales

935
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
Were you like kind of kicking back and your dad's room

936
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
Clinking champagne glasses and saying alright we can chill out a little bit

937
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
Never

938
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
The bigger we got the more I felt like

939
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
We can never rest on our laurels

940
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
I just felt

941
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
Like I had to work as hard as I could because I was leading our team and if I wasn't showing that I'm

942
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Working hard

943
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,784
And showing up everyday then how could I ask people that did that for

944
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,368
You know we're building a company we can't say

945
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,720
Sorry we're not available until Friday you answer the phone anytime

946
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
Somebody calls about

947
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,328
Some of these big retailers would call

948
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
In the most random moments

949
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
And say you're interested I would like to bring you in can you come out and meet us at our national headquarters

950
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312

00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
So as you can see

952
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Musicradar

953
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896

955
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
39

956
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,808
How many employees did you eventually hire

957
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
We had about

958
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
26

959
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Sales and Mark

961
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488

962
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
75

963
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Q

964
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
In mm

965
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
8 I guess

966
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
You are pro-choice

967
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Starting in mid

968
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Do you start to get approached by big

969
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
That were in

970
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,848
Starion talking

971
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
DaVinci salted

972
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
General Mills

973
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
And they were not the only company

974
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Approach to you

975
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
They were not

976
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,695
The first phone call I got from a really large company with

977
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
And

978
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
Early 2000

979
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
5 so like a year-and-a-half in

980
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Well they said hey

981
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
My

982
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
One of my investor friends who work

983
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
Work for us with answering the phone

984
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
And she said

985
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,335
Sandwich so from this company's on the phone and I went

986
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
What

987
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,639
It was

988
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
A big

989
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Huge

990
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Yeah

991
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,783
It's a competitor of General Mills and

992
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,855
I was in shock I didn't I

993
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
It never occurred to me

994
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
That I would

995
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,511
Sell my company or be approached by these big

996
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Japanese

997
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
It wasn't in

998
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Where my mind

999
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,167
And then it became a distraction in the middle of

1000
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
Growing the company in running

1001
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
And and so

1002
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
You know my business partners and I had to decide

1003
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Really going to be serious entertaining

1004
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,199
An offer or we just

1005
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Cuz it's just too much distraction

1006
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Yeah

1007
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,087
So we finally decided in

1008
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
2007 that

1009
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
We would entertain

1010
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
An offer if it was the right cup

1011
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
If we feel like it

1012
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
Who's the right company because we didn't

1013
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
So we were very

1014
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
You know financially stable company

1015
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,983
For me I was starting to get

1016
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
Really tired

1017
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
And just

1018
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,407
I was I was getting worn down I bet and Anna mean you would spend

1019
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,479
Most of all of Russia Alder thirties

1020
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Really

1021
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
Finding this out right and so

1022
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,903
Presently you wanted to kind of

1023
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
Focus on yourself a little bit

1024
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,815
Yeah I just wanted a little relief and

1025
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,679
And then we started to talk to some of these companies and then I met

1026
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
With General Mills

1027
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
And

1028
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,847
I just needed the day I walked in that building and how they approached me and

1029
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
The meeting we had I knew

1030
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,735
I felt that there was a connection and authenticity

1031
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,087
That if there were companies that were big that they would be

1032
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,231
The great said I felt like they understood my brand and respected it and all the brands made hats have been around forever

1033
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
So they're not just turning Brands out

1034
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,327
Putting them on the shelf and getting rid of them

1035
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
I just felt this energy

1036
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,215
Almost nobody we had on the show

1037
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
Michelle

1038
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,615
I'm even thinks about money when they're starting their computers

1039
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Committed to

1040
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
The products are packed is a passionate

1041
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
Problem they want to solve

1042
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,807
And then one day they find themselves with this money

1043
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Ginter financially

1044
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
You start this thing

1045
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
It's 3033 really

1046
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Tell 3484

1047
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,047
39

1048
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
You sell it and

1049
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,167
All of a sudden you and your dad you have

1050
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
This money

1051
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
And this

1052
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
Thing that you built

1053
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
It took

1054
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
A while

1055
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,759
During the sale process I had to be

1056
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
You know they had to do all of

1057
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,903
Kind of the research of our company without us

1058
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
Tell your employees and that was very nerve-wracking

1059
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
So I had to have this very

1060
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,839
Compartmentalised life for 3 months and I

1061
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,167
Felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown but

1062
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,519
Cuz you don't know if it's going to come together until literally the day before

1063
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,335
So that was very stressful.

1064
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,639
For me exciting but also

1065
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,687
Really unknown and then

1066
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
We put a deal together and that was

1067
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
The day before it turns

1068
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
40

1069
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
And

1070
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Then

1071
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
All of a sudden I had to go from running the ship

1072
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
2

1073
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,791
Realizing that a whole nother team of people wanted

1074
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,863
Needed to come in and do that and I needed to let them

1075
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
Do that as a result

1076
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
You know

1077
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,775
I had a little boy I'm involved in his life I you know

1078
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
I could just

1079
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
Spend time pursuing other things important to me yeah and still keep my hand in the business and do the things that I love

1080
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Love for it

1081
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
But without all the stress

1082
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Remember

1083
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,415
Kate Kate and Andy Spade were on our show

1084
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,255
I asked Kate Spade do you know does not has no ownership

1085
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Skip over

1086
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Anymore

1087
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
She doesn't own the brand

1088
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
So weird to just go to some city in the world

1089
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Kate Spade

1090
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,983
Shopper walk around New York where she lives in

1091
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
See her handbags

1092
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,615
In her brain is her name her name above the door all of the city

1093
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
And she said you know she told us

1094
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
The story about how it's really cool.

1095
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
See that and you must experience I mean

1096
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
You doing any 7-Eleven or any

1097
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,647
Whole Foods or Safeway or Trader Joe's there their they're Larabars

1098
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
Right by the cash register

1099
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
Everywhere

1100
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Your name on this

1101
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
Honest brand

1102
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
Honest products

1103
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Actually have

1104
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
I was in

1105
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Target one day with my son

1106
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,239
Is a couple of years ago and

1107
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
He was six

1108
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
What's the time

1109
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
And

1110
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
We were

1111
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
Dino wandering around

1112
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,943
Find what and then he saw the Larabars

1113
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
And he said

1114
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
Did you make all these

1115
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
Sparse for the store

1116
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
And I said

1117
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Indirectly yes

1118
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,815
And it was the first time the light bulb enough for him about what I had done and what

1119
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Larb

1120
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,655
But to see him in the store and it was

1121
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
It was really exciting

1122
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Really positive

1123
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,287
Antiemetic

1124
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,151
Yes he has had a Snickers and he does love him

1125
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:51,039
Yes

1126
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
Laura how much

1127
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,623
Of

1128
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Of what happened

1129
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
Cusb

1130
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
The black and how much

1131
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,071
I mean I feel lucky that

1132
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
I have opportunity in my life and that and that

1133
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
I've surrounded myself with

1134
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
People that

1135
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
Care about me and

1136
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,567
That you know along the way when people thought I was

1137
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,127
Completely out of my mind for starting an energy bar

1138
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
Comfy I remember thinking to myself

1139
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
You know

1140
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,991
You need to surround yourself with

1141
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
People that believe in

1142
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Really important

1143
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
And actually I remember thinking to myself I have more to lose

1144
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
If I don't

1145
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Find out

1146
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
Then I do

1147
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
If I try this

1148
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
And it doesn't work

1149
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
And I'm so glad that

1150
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:41,983
For whatever reason I had that in my mind because it compelled me to move forward and

1151
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Make Harbor happen

1152
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Lara merriken

1153
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
Founder of larabar

1154
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:56,063
By the way if you've ever struggled with how to pronounce larabar maybe you thought it was larabar

1155
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,159
You can blame that umlaut above the A and Lara

1156
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,487
You don't like the one using Haagen-Dazs or Motley Crue

1157
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,559
Which serves no real purpose or function

1158
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Largest

1159
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:14,239
Thought it looked pretty cool

1160
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,439
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things your building

1161
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,279
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors synchrony

1162
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,559

1163
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,631
The payment tools Technologies and insights

1164
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,703
To help people realize their own unique ambition

1165
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Synchrony

1166
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,775
What are you working forward to

1167
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it

1168
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
It's time now for how you built that and the Story begins about 25 years ago

1169
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,439
Guinea in West Africa where Rahim Jolla was growing up

1170
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,791
And what are the things you loved as a kid versus sweet injury

1171
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Pineapple juice called

1172
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
Gingin is actually a really popular drink in that part of the world you know you go buy a snack on the side of the road you are

1173
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,871
Nothing has when a woman that have a little cooler of of Ginger and that they sell along with it eventually.

1174
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
Do ostriches like

1175
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:28,479
Lemonade or iced tea or maybe milk to a lot of the kids

1176
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
Early Childhood in Guinea was pretty great but around the time I turned fifteen the political situation

1177
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,183
And the country became unstable

1178
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,719
And unsafe

1179
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:43,071
Sara Haines parents sent him and his brother to the US but

1180
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,375
Raheem overstayed his Visa

1181
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,447
And was eventually caught by immigration officials

1182
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,543
And he ended up spending almost a year in detention

1183
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
Honestly looking back at it it's now that I appreciate how difficult of a time you was

1184
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
Young and too naive to understand how

1185
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,135
How much trouble I was in that he was eventually able to get a green card

1186
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
And then made enough money to go to Community College and then to Michigan State University

1187
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Whole time

1188
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
He was missing home

1189
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
His mom is friends and even then pineapple drink he loved as a kid

1190
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
When I'm playing sports

1191
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
When I'm running around and really hot

1192
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Summer that usually don't plan for Coke

1193
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,199
I think about Ginger

1194
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
Now you can find homemade pineapple ginger juice said some African restaurant but you can

1195
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:43,999
It just walk into a chain store and buy that the shelf so maybe we should start

1196
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:50,399
Making it and selling it and when they started doing research the timing seems perfect

1197
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,727
What is that the traditional the Colts the pet scene

1198
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,799
Aldi's of the carbonated artificially flavored

1199
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
Brian I'll have been losing market share

1200
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
The point where

1201
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,991
They have all started to buy up smaller companies that are developing

1202
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
Fresh organic

1203
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
Products okay so a great opportunity for something like ginger but

1204
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
As much as they love the stuff

1205
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
They did not know how to make it

1206
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
So they called up their mom and guinea and ask for the recipe fresh ginger

1207
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Corvettes pineapples

1208
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
All fresh lemon juice

1209
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,847
Vanilla and 2014 and the two brothers are living

1210
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
New York City Gin Gin in Bahamas apartment and Raheem

1211
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:43,647
They give out samples to customers at the bar where he works. Try some folks would find a ginger to be too spicy

1212
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
I need to have a little too much lemon or too little lemon

1213
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,631
Or the pineapple is not pronounced and also it is later after trial and error

1214
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,959
Muhammad get the recipe exactly where they wanted

1215
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,567
And they decide to launch gingin at an African Festival in Harlem

1216
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,711
He was one of those moment to realize that we really want something everyone that came by the world from West Africa.

1217
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
You are the product

1218
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,319
Goodnight just buy one bottle you know I did buy

1219
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,391
Poetry take a picture and send it to a friend

1220
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
They sold out

1221
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
All of their bottles and then a really big break

1222
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
They wanted $25,000 a competition for budding entrepreneurs so they moved into an in

1223
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,823
Industrial kitchen and eventually they pitch Ginger and Whole Foods and well we're definitely let missing from those

1224
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,223
What's showing them because we knew Whole Food one adult to get a distributor and their distributor was interested in

1225
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,527
Because they know we're talkin Horford

1226
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,343
So we can update them against one another

1227
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,439
And it worked out well in 2015

1228
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
Ginger has made it into a five Whole Foods in about 100 independent stores they made about 3

1229
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:01,983
$100,000 bill my profitable but they're having a great time or my God I'm having a blast
