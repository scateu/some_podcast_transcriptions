00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
Got up

34
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Clothes on jumped in the car

35
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,608
I live just one mile from the mill

36
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,912
And I was up on a hill

37
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,032
And the mail was down in the valley and when I came around the corner and I could see this

38
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
Fire reaching into the heavens

39
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
And realizing that that was

40
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
My business

But today story

It's about as low-tech as it gets actually goes back to the Paleolithic era

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
And a technology invented

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
Grinding seeds and grains in the flower

55
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,080
Is an actual industry people have been making a living off of this for at least 10,000 years

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
Disruptive idea here

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Bob's Red Mill

58
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,736
Mainly sells whole grains and flour

59
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
And not just a weed or corn but

60
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,672
Things like Millet and sorghum income booted who actually knows what commode is

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
And even though it wasn't his intention

62
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Bob has

00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048

You will find Bob's Red Mill products just

67

Look for Bob's friendly white bearded face on the package

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
And what's really amazing about the story

69
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,856
Bob started the company after he basically retired when he was almost 50

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
The years old

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
The time

72
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
He decided to study theology at a Christian seminary in Portland Oregon

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
Bob was not a rich man but we'll get there

74
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Here's what you need to know

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
In the LA area during the Great Depression

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
His dad

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Track selling Wonder Bread

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Around the time of the second World War

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
All the young men went off

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
The fight

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
But he was old enough to work

82
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Absolutely

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
I rounded up a

84
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Job

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
From the May Company

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
In Los Angeles

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Guess which was their headquarters I believe

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
I got a job in the warehouse I had a master Warehouse

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
It said the other May Company stores

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
And because

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
There wasn't meant around that

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
People that were running the warehouse where all the old guys

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
At least in my mind

94
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
They were really all

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
And they weren't draft

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,088
Edible and I can remember after working at the May Company warehouse for

97
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Quite some time

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
I was called down to the office

99
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
And

100
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
His name was

101
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Mr. house

102
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Smoked cigars

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
And he was

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Ominous

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
In my mind

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Wife

107
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
And I knocked on his door

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
And of course I thought they were going to fire me

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
And I was just shaking I was so nervous to go in there

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
Mr. house circles stem Bob

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
And

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
He asked me if I would like

113
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
To have a department of my own

114
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
At 16 years old

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Guy that was probably the

116
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Greatest thing

117
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
That Society did for Bob Moore

118
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
What's to give me that kind of

119
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Responsibility

120
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
When I was that young

121
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
And I

122
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
I almost

123
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Cried

124
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
And he said

125
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
We will pay you a dollar an hour

126
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
Nice that was a lot of money at that time

127
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
But I walked out of his office

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
I didn't walk out

129
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Flew out

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Justin 7th Heaven

131
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
And it was probably one of the most

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Magnificent moments in my life

133
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Was having that happen

134
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Batumi

135
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
After High School he joined the army for

136
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
3 years

137
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
And we got back to Southern California

138
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
He met his wife Charlie

139
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
Eventually they had three boys

140
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,983
Free couple years Bob work for an electric motors company

141
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
I thought that's what

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
He would do for the rest of his life

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
But then

144
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
His dad died

145
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Expectedly

146
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
I have a picture of him in my office

147
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Was taken the same year he died

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
He looks

149
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Freshen

150
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Normal is anybody at

151
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
49 years old

152
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
Certainly didn't look like he was ready to die

153
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
And

154
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
Just keeled over one day and the doctor said he was dead by the time he hit the ground he had a massive

155
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Heart attack

156
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
To this day I missed

157
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
My dad and me

158
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
You were I guess in your early

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Early twenties when he died

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
Why did that change your your direction that

161
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Well

162
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Dad and I were always going to go into business

163
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Well that didn't happen

164
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
And up

165
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
One day

166
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
I was

167
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
Driving down Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles

168
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
And they had just put up a big

169
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
Sign on a corner that said coming soon

170
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Mobil gas station

171
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
And I wrote the phone number down

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Call it

173
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Cuz I wanted to find out

174
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
How much it would cost

175
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
2

176
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,479
Got a gas station I didn't even think there was enough money in the world for me to do that

177
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
But they came through with a figure

178
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
That seems

179
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Fairly reasonable to me

180
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
And so

181
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,511
We put the house up for sale and sold it immediately

182
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
And got the money we needed

183
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
To buy the gas station

184
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
And that's what I did

185
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,471
How much did you need to buy that gas station. 6000

186
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
And

187
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
I can tell you that the excitement

188
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Of having my own business

189
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Still with me

190
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Guy is still with me

191
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,783
It fulfilled every single thing my dad and I had talked about

192
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
And only I was

193
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
I didn't hit my dad

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
So if you were enjoying things

195
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
At the gas station

196
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Will you

197
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
You like sold it

198
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
A couple years later and

199
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
Got out of La why why did you do that

200
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,471
Well la had a lot of problems it was very smoggy

201
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
It was so

202
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Intensely uncomfortable

203
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
That we talked about

204
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Well now that I have a gas station

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
We could really move any place week

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Could get a gas station in

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Any town

208
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
And we decided

209
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
That Mammoth Lakes

210
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
What's the right place to go

211
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
The Mammoth Lakes

212
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Watch

213
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Had just built

214
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Big Ski Resort

215
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
The top of the mountain

216
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Which I believe is still a very

217
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Yeah sure active

218
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
It is the area

219
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
And that's all

220
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
I sold my station

221
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
And we sold that house

222
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
So we had enough money I think

223
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
The time we had about $17,000

224
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Which in

225
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
19

226
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
59

227
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
All guy

228
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
It was a lot of

229
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
And so as a you move your family out to Mammoth

230
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Haidian

231
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
And how'd it go

232
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Nothing

233
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
No business

234
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
It was crazy

235
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
There was already a Shell station

236
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Turn up there that had been there for years and years and years

237
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
And everybody loved him and went there for their

238
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Gas and for everything else

239
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
And

240
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Frankly

241
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
A guy by the

242
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
Almost one year to the day we just ran out of money

243
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,759
And there's only one way I could go in this to get ourselves out of there

244
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Which idea

245
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
And Charlie and I and the three boys

246
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Took off for Sacramento

247
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Where I

248
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Change my direction in life

249
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
So what did you end up doing

250
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Year after

251
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
Mustang fails at one year almost to the day we got down

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Sacramento

253
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
And I got a job at Sears and Roebuck

254
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
And in the hardware department selling everything

255
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
I mean lawn mowers

256
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,247
All the stuff that was there to sell when you move to Sacramento what was your family's Financial

257
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Situation

258
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Well I think we were at the lowest point we moved in we had a minister of the church that we

259
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
Decided to go to with the time

260
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
He was caretaking as an apartment

261
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,935
3 unit apartment and one of the units didn't have any

262
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Showers at work

263
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
And he said well Bob can let you in Charlie and the boys live in that for a while

264
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
And we took him up on it because we didn't have any money

265
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
I remember about the kitchen was very small

266
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,647
And Charlie and I put up a mattress in the kitchen and slept on the floor

267
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,231
And the boys the two youngest boys slept together

268
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
On a

269
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Fold-up bed

270
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
And can the oldest that time

271
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,447
Slept in a sleeping bag and that's how we slept

272
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
We don't have any furniture

273
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,079
So that was about the lowest point in our life when we were living

274
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
On somebody else with the three boys

275
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,807
You know when you get down you feel helpless like a baby yeah you don't there's no strength left in you

276
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
You don't even know how to retaliate or fight

277
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
We really

278
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
We needed a helping hand

279
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
But at some point. Maybe was in the earlier midnight

280
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
Ever that you came across a book

281
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
That's right that

282
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
I think it's safe to say probably change your

283
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Your life what was that book

284
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,919
A book called John goffe Mill written by George Woodbury

285
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
I have it in front of me right now

286
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
And George

287
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
Wasn't was a very well educated

288
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Educated

289
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Archaeologist

290
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,183
You got a letter in the mail it said that he had inherited

291
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
His family's Mill which is about 600 acres

292
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
In Bedford

293
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
New Hampshire

294
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,191
Well I mean if you got a letter like that you're going to go down and see what you had

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
And that's exactly what

296
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
George dip

297
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
He went down to

298
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
The mill

299
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
And spent the next 10 years of his life

300
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Restoring

301
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
John goffe Mill

302
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,295
But you still down there and said this is at Like A Memoir of his life

303
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,159
Restoring that's exactly right and struck a chord with you what

304
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:45,023
What why all of a sudden he makes a statement in the book that

305
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
The most delightful thing was

306
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Whole grains

307
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
When he ground all these wonderful whole wheat flour and

308
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
Jolla rice flour and cornmeal

309
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,591
And all this at the public beat a path to his door I remember those words

310
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
I underline them

311
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Tagum

312
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
I showed it to my wife

313
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
If we could do this

314
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
If we could get a meal

315
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
And do the same thing

316
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
The public would beat a path to our door

317
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
And we would be in business

318
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
So you see

319
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Can you get really into

320
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
This idea of May

321
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,679
Maybe starting a mill in lots of people get laundry room ideas and get obsessed with

322
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
With

323
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
With things for a time being it and so what did you do

324
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Did you start to think about how we going to buy milk

325
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Did you start to talk to your wife to Charlie

326
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Dubai

327
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Yeah I did a lot of talk

328
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,831
I did a lot of talking to Charlie a night in the boys were all in their teenager

329
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
By that time in

330
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
And I got them interested to

331
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
And one thing I did was I went to the library

332
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
And they had a

333
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
12 volume group of

334
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
American manufacturers of equipment

335
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,263
And in there they had two pages of companies who made flour Mills

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
And equipment for Mills and

337
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
I wrote some letters rather naive because I really

338
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
I was talking about

339
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Stuff in the 8th

340
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
1800

341
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
And asking them about Stone Mills

342
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
And I wrote about 10 letters

343
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
And

344
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
I think I only received a response back

345
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
From about two of them

346
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
One of them gave me the name of a fella

347
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
Who they knew had a Stone Mill his name is Dewey sheets

348
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
And you lived in

349
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Muncie Indiana

350
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
And he had been in the Milling business for

351
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Yeah a lot of his life

352
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
And Dewey was such a help

353
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Found me

354
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Amil

355
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
That was

356
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
To be torn down

357
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,575
Fayetteville North Carolina

358
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
So I ended up

359
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
For not a whole lot of money

360
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Where's

361
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
My garage

362
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Stack full

363
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Of old

364
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Very ancient

365
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Stone Mills dated

366
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
1870

367
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
18:6

368
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
C.1880

369
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
Bringing like large

370
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Stone

00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,407
Yeah wheels and just all the equipment you need to

372
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Grind up grains and into flower

373
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
And

374
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,063
With I guess we all with with the intention of Adventure

375
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
Getting it up and running and starting milk

376
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Anybody that you knew saying

377
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Thinking

378
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Cat losing his mind

379
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,935
This hockey thing I'm starting until it seems like he's taking it a bit far

380
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
You know. I don't know why

381
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
I didn't have much resistance

382
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
I didn't

383
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Feel that I had them back up anybody

384
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
Or apologize I think that

385
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
I felt it was

386
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Climb

387
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
We're healthier food to come along

388
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
Are World needed better food

389
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
Needed more whole grains that needed most of the nutrition

390
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
Put back

391
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
In the food that

392
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
We were feeding people

393
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Through the grocery chains

394
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
And the whole thing

395
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
Began to take on a real form

396
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
And make sense to me and

397
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
When I talk to people certainly my wife

398
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
And others

399
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
It made sense to them to

400
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
So well maybe you should try it

401
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,831
I guess after a couple years you throw to save some money and then you were able to buy

402
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,159
My wife started to save money

403
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
Are you able to protect liver was good at it

404
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
After couple years you were able to move to a

405
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
A small farm

406
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,423
Five Acre Farm you have you amass all this equipment

407
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Because I guess the

408
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Late sixties early seventies at this point

409
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
First of all how did you how much how we going to get the

410
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
Cash to defined as a land to build a Flour Mill

411
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,783
Well we didn't build a Flour Mill we rented a piece

412
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Property that had a building on it

413
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
There are so many things that happened in our favor

414
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
I got a job

415
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
At Penney's JCPenney company

416
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
In Redding California

417
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Opening a brand-new Auto Center

418
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
So we ended up in Redding California

419
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
There was a delight

420
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Full.

421
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Quonset hut

422
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
On the south end of town

423
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
And I was vacant

424
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
And we built walls inside built

425
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
The store

426
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
A real coin store with

427
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
With cedar planking on the walls

428
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
We covered the whole front of the building

429
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
Made it try to make it look like a Flour Mill

430
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
And called it Moore's Flour Mill

431
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
And we converted this building

432
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Into what was

433
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
A reasonable

434
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Facsimile

435
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Of a mill

436
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
And we had

437
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
3

438
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Stone Mills

439
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
That we sat here and there

440
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
And begin the process

441
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
Of grinding

442
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Flower

443
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Whole wheat flour cornmeal

444
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,015
Social Services 1974 you open the doors to more flour mill with

445
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Your boys

446
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,415
And and you're making wheat flour corn flour what else

447
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,791
Oh actually we I created the 10 grain cereal that were using now on

448
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
We ground whole wheat

449
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
There's a lot of kinds of week

450
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
There's a

451
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Durum wheat which is

452
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Hard white wheat

453
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
There's a red wheat which is high in protein

454
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
And makes wonderful bread

455
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Alden soft weed

456
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
There's a soft white

457
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Wheat

458
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
4

459
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Pastries and

460
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
And biscuits and

461
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
So

462
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
You you get

463
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
A little knowledge of what

464
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Grains are

465
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
And how to use them than you

466
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
Create some recipes and

467
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Put them in a bag

468
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
And then you pendulum

469
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
And that's just what we did we put large

470
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Windows

471
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,543
Across the wall from the store into the mailroom

472
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,151
And they could see it one or two or three meals running all the time

473
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
So this was like

474
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Almost like an artisanal

475
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Mom-and-pop kind of

476
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
Store Friday was he was never designed to be anything bigger than that

477
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Yes no no no

478
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
No I kept my job at

479
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
Pennies for 2 years and Charlie of course

480
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
She worked the store

481
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,143
And talked with people and she was a great believer in whole grains and

482
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,471
It was all very nice we were having a great time

483
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
You must have still been

484
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
Like kind of restless because

485
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
You I guess it was around the time you

486
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
How to make a radical shift

487
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Like you decide to

488
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Retire

489
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,831
When your son's takes over the mail and then you

490
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Take off to go study

491
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
At a cemetery

492
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
That's right

493
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
I had a

494
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Intense

495
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Desire

496
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,607
To learn to read the Bible in the original languages

497
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Hebrew and koine Greek

498
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
And we did a little scouting about found here

499
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
That Portland where I am right now

500
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Was one of the greatest

501
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
Spots for seminaries

502
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
And we enrolled in

503
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
One of the seminaries here

504
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
And

505
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Begin to learn

506
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
To speak your Bible in its original languages

507
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
This is a mean this is Jake Bugg

508
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
At this point when you decide to

509
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
Completely change directions and just go and study at a seminary you are about 50 years old

510
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
Just a little bit older than the age when your father

511
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Died

512
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
And this was going to be

513
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,687
This is going to be your retirement the beginning of the user of winding down from work I go

514
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
Where I Canada all my

515
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
Buckets that I had and I said the Charlie I think we could last

516
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,903
We could live this way for for 5 years

517
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,255
And I think I could get my education and once I got that

518
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,375
I would get some kind of Direction I felt whether it was spiritual direction or what

519
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
And would be able to

520
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,775
Reroute my life into something that was worthwhile

521
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
And we both agreed this as what

522
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Step you'll do us both

523
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,943
So that's what we did see you start at 7

524
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
School end

525
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Fulfill all of your dreams and hopes and wishes

526
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
No

527
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
I don't know what happened

528
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
What's part work when you haven't been in two languages

529
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
Guy is a tough one actually

530
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,679
I had to do a lot of studying and Charlie was right with me

531
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
What really changed the whole thing

532
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,359
Was one day we were walking along

533
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
Weaver reading vocabulary cards

534
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Back and forth

535
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
First we had

536
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,599
Greek verbs on one side and nouns on the other end

537
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
So anyway one day we walking down April

538
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Particular Street

539
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
And much to my

540
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Surprise

541
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
I looked over and there was a

542
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Amil

543
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
Had it been there for a long time

544
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
And in front of it was a for sale sign

545
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,263
I couldn't believe it I said to Charlie

546
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
I said hun that is an Old Mill

547
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
We walked over

548
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
It's probably six blocks

549
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
From the cemetery

550
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
And I got to run up on the steps

551
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,087
And I looked in the window and I could see bucket elevators grain cleaners

552
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
I could see all the Milling equipment

553
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
I could not believe what I was looking at

554
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
And there was a phone number

555
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,376
And I called the number and I got ahold of the guy that owned the property and when I

556
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Told him I was interested

557
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
He says what what are we talkin about here you owned a lot of property

558
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
I said that

559
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
The Old Mill

560
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Milk Bill mail

561
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
Oh he said yeah that property UCI we're going to tear the building down

562
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,016
And we're going to have the property is 2 Acres

563
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
And we're going to have it for sale so it's going to be a really

564
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Goodbye without that Old Mill on

565
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,464
What you going to do for dinner that Mill.

566
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,304

And then

662
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
I could fill a parking lot in notes

663
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
And people were buying your Granger

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112

Just coming in and buying buying all that stuff

667
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,280
Yeah but what else came in was we had a group of

668
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Markets

669
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096

00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,776
And their buyer came in he was a vice president and he said Mr Mayer

672
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Would like to open

673
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944

675
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,600
And they gave me a list of the grains they wanted the flowers they wanted

676
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
And

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
Of course with the Fred Meyer chain

678
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
Others came to a Safeway I know

679
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
And Albertsons in some of those

680
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
And ask us

681
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
If we

682
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,888
Had enough production wow to keep

683
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Them going

684
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
And without

685
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Too much effort

686
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
We

687
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,640
Got a pretty good business going to say this is the mid-70s

688
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
This is like

689
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
Really what the health food

690
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
Praise kind of starts to

691
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Take off in America

692
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
We had a

693
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Yeah we we had a lot of help like Reader's Digest

694
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,744
Came out with an article on brand and why that was so healthy for you to eat

695
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Your bowels

696
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
In good order in

697
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Just one thing right after another kept

698
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
Coming out and of course everybody had a TV

699
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
And there were shows on Nelson

700
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
We really begin to realize

701
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
That we had a

702
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Kind of a tiger by the

703
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
The tale

704
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
Over this whole thing you know I'm

705
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
There's a lot of

706
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Revelation

707
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
In this stuff we didn't start out with any

708
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
Hugin 10th or anything it just

709
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
It just seemed like the right thing first off

710
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,744
We were eating this stuff ourselves and we all felt

711
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
The

712
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Benefit

713
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
It's have all this

714
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
So that's one thing

715
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
That you're

716
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
In a business that you believe in

717
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,008
And I think that's so one of the biggest things that made this thing work

718
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Yeah so are you

719
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336

Person at all and it wasn't any like an ex-employee or anybody mad or what

Any grievance or anything

735
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968

Why it is

740
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
Really caught fire and it was full of grain

741
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
It was a very active

744
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Did you find out about it

745
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Well

746
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,592
I got a call in the middle of the night

747
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360

And I was looked up on a hill

756
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,656
And the mail was down in the valley and when I came around the corner and I could see this

757
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:00,288
Fire reaching into the heavens are and realizing that that was my business

758
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
You don't know what to think

759
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
You don't know how to think

760
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,808
If you don't know whether to cry or or what I just

761
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Got down there

762
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
Pretty quickly the fire chief came up to me who I knew that used to make inspections of the mill

763
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
And he said we got all of water we need

764
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,888
But if you could tell me what part of the mill is

765
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:32,288
Is the most precious that would keep you going in business I can direct the whole fire

766
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Department

767
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
At that point

768
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
Of course the millstones were the most

769
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,944
Important part of the whole thing

770
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
We walked over to the male is pretty hot there but

771
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
You know the end of the fire departments

772
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,904
We're pulling a lot of water on the on the building

773
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,792
But we walked over and then I pointed out on the building side of the building where

774
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
The Mills were inside

775
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
They immediately had a saw

776
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,800
I just whack a big square hole in it and he planted one of the firemen there on the ground with a v

777
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Fire hose

778
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Aim through the hole

779
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
And it for the entire

780
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Time of the

781
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
The fire

782
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,272
He kept Direction inside the mailroom

783
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
Which actually saved all three meals

784
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
So when the fire was

785
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
When the fire was put out

786
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
And you're

787
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
You're looking at what was left of

788
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Bob's Red Mill

789
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm assuming

790
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Was not a whole lot

791
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Teach you

792
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
Did you were you immediately thinking words

793
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Rebuilding

794
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,264
And start up again really soon or did you did you think

795
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
Maybe it's time maybe this is a sign to

796
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
To pack it in

797
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,176
Well that's pretty much what I thought

798
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
But there was some things that

799
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Change my mind

800
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Mind

801
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
And even that very nice

802
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
David

803
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
My

804
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Is that time my oldest

805
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Employers wife came down

806
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:01,632
Eileen was such a lovely lady she was our bet she worked at the bank where we bank and that's how

807
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
How David met her

808
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
And we took them the two kids

809
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
On their first date together for dinner

810
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
And they got married we went to there

811
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
Wedding and everything else end

812
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,992
David has been with me almost 10 years by that time

813
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
And that night

814
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Within a few minutes of my arrival

815
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Their Charlie came

816
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
And she and Eileen were talking

817
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
And I overheard them and Eileen told Charlie

818
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
Oh Charlie I don't know what we're going to do

819
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
We just signed the papers

820
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
On our home

821
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,192
David doesn't have a job now

822
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
And you know that sunk in pretty deep

823
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
Charlie looked at me

824
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
And I guess what she was saying and what I was thinking in my mind

825
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,480
Is it there's probably not going to be any thoughts

826
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,856
Not continuing this thing somehow we'll make it work

827
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,952
There's an awful lot of things that have motivated me over the years

828
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
And

829
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
A lot of those things came out

830
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Because of

831
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
David Den

832
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Eileen

833
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
And the fire

834
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
So I felt

835
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
That I had a

836
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
Weighty responsibility

837
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Staring me in the face

838
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:20,736
And there's a lot of things that goes through your mind and in those kind of situations and certainly I had every

839
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
You thought you could

840
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,856
But you kept it going you decided to keep it going

841
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
We tried first

842
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,536
Courser rebuild a melon that was impossible but I had

843
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
A warehouse across the street about a 10000

844
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Square foot

845
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
Warehouse directly across the street

846
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
So

847
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,312
Even though the mill burned down I had some resources

848
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,128
I was able to save the millstones

849
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
So we almost immediately

850
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Moved across the

851
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
The street to that ten thousand square feet

852
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,088
That we had it wasn't enough but we tried it

853
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
And I kept

854
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
I had the business

855
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
Guy had

856
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
Awesome business people wanted are Prada

857
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
He kept bugging me when I was going to open a read my retail part which

858
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
Of course burned up

859
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
And

860
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
We just kept trying and trying to keep Machinery going yeah remember now I started many years ago with my sons and

861
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Redding California

862
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
My wonderful son

863
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Bob

864
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,480
Had a Milling operation that we had all built as a family

865
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
And he allowed

866
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
One of my peeps

867
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
To go down there

868
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
And grind

869
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
My whole wheat flour my cornmeal and things like that at night

870
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
You know and then they put it in the truck

871
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Brought it back up

872
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
So all these things

873
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Begin to work almost immediately

874
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
They gave me

875
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,656
A pretty good degree of of

876
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,496
Of comfort with getting things going

877
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Listing things

878
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,312
Baba seems it after the fire

879
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
Is really when the business started

880
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
How to take off mean

881
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
10 years after

882
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
The company almost pinotage

883
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Just like a business

884
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Conspire

885
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,136
What happened what was the reason why was there a strategic

886
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
Decision that you made was there someone you met was there

887
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,024
A lucky break that you guys got that just

888
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Allowed Bob's Red Mill

889
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Product go

890
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
National and then beyond

891
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Well actually I there was

892
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
I was told that I never go anywhere be anything unless I

893
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Became a part of the national

894
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
Natural food

895
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Or industry

896
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
So I joined that wasn't very expensive

897
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
And

898
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,392
We went down to Anaheim California where I just got back Famous Amos natural food

899
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
Who's X

900
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah and we got a little 10 x 10 boots at the back of this thing

901
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
And we brought all the products that we were making

902
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
Has quite a few actually several hundred

903
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
And I tried to have all natural

904
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Whole grains

905
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,616
And every form of them we could take one item corn for instance and we can make corn grits

906
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
We can make

907
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Fine cornmeal

908
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
Regular cornmeal coarse cornmeal

909
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
I ended up with funeral

910
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Six or seven products over 1

911
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,880
Basic crane I did the same with weed and I did the same

912
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,744
Boats and everything else so I mean it was a unique way of doing it I wanted every

913
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
I didn't sell as well some soul

914
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Better than others

915
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
When the industry down there in Anaheim saw this

916
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,496
I had some people come to me and they said they wanted it

917
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:27,616
That is a Hoosier distributor and I said well I don't have a distributor

918
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,248
So those people over there to show to

919
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
They went and got their distributor

920
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
And they brought him down they said we want these products

921
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
So they took my products on

922
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
Almost overnight

923
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:47,584
We kind of hit the jackpot and we had to go back and work pretty hard to catch up with their orders

924
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
Don't you found Distributors and

925
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
And you started to you products are there really

926
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Takeoff

927
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
It wasn't that long before you really started

928
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
The revenue for

929
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Company

930
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Was growing I think my 2007

931
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
You're sales topped

932
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
45 maybe 50 million dollars did you

933
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
I know you didn't go into this for money and

934
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,952
Did you ever look at that number

935
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
UCF over just a Halo

936
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
The Revenant

937
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Crazy

938
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,888
This little girl is doing this kind of Revenue

939
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Well we did forget

940
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Pretty good

941
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Black guy

942
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
People were always wanting to buy us I mean it was just

943
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,432
The constant you are getting offers from company different investors who want to invest in me

944
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,040
And actually different companies that just simply wanted to buy me

945
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
It was a lot of it and you just said no

946
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
No I said no because

947
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
All right I didn't

948
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
It wasn't any money any way besides

949
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
I knew as soon as they bought me out

950
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,608
Even though they always tell you that everything's going to stay the same

951
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
But everything changes

952
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Is an and I didn't want my life to

953
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
2 Chainz I thought it was really swell

954
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,032
It was it was a good

955
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
Good life guy

956
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
Alright so you have this

957
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
It is now doing at least a hundred million rub

958
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah it's

959
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
It is it's

960
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
It's well well over a hundred million

961
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
And I think it was in 2010

962
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
You announce that you want to

963
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
And the company over to your employees in

964
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
They didn't like 2/3 of it right

965
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
That's right

966
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
And you are also giving away a lot of

967
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Are most

968
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
Money is so sound like

969
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
And you a long time to eat

970
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,544
A long life ahead of you but it sounds like you are slowly

971
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
It says that you are slowly

972
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Aiming to

973
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
To end

974
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,016
You know to enter time here on Earth as a as a poor or a no Relic

975
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
I got a guy with no money

976
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Guys there's anything I can tell you

977
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
I'm giving it away because I want to

978
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,024
Time in the Bible to me was so clear

979
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
To do unto others

980
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
As you would have them do unto you

981
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
Now That's the basis

982
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,192
Of how I think and how I feel

983
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
If you do these things

984
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
The feeling the return

985
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
Your life is is

986
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
Appreciably

987
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Improve

988
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,992
And I have that feeling I know what that is it's a different feeling that I had when I was

989
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
50

990
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
Yeah

991
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Yeah of course

992
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
How much of what of what

993
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
You experience

994
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512

00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Incredible success

996

Call Guy

1001
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544

I got up at 6 here I am almost 90 I give at 6 every morning

1003
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
I go down to my own

1004
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200

1005
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,528

Hot cereal cook syrup

1008
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:57,280
And then I get in the bed a little bit early but I work till 5 or 6 every

1009
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Everyday so I

1010
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400

00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
I've done that I know what it feels like

1013
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
Can I probably never will do anything different

1014
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,944
You talk a little bit about about about your face in your Christianity

1015
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
I'm just wondering how much

1016
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
How much is a guided you

1017
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
You know

1018
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Over the years like your

1019
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Your decisions in your thinking

1020
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,696
Why think it permeates me is far as asking

1021
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,536
The whole concept of whole grains

1022
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,376
I got from the very first page of the Bible you know when you

1023
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
When you go to Seminary they start you off with

1024
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
The first page

1025
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,312
I have it at it with me I can read it to you is only a couple of lines

1026
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
God said behold I have given you every plant yielding

1027
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Seed which is

1028
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
Is upon the face of all the Earth

1029
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Free tree with seed

1030
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
And it's fruit

1031
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
You shall have

1032
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
Them for food

1033
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
And I read these words and

1034
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
14 div

1035
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
Translations

1036
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
And I learned to figure it out

1037
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
In the original Hebrew

1038
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
It still says the same thing simple unequivocal comforting

1039
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
Just made perfect sense to me guy

1040
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,496
And the fact that I can establish a business around it

1041
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
Was was just

1042
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,152
Unbelievable and and I'm not doing too bad at it it's

1043
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Working pretty well

1044
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,320
Bob Moore founder of Bob's Red Mill

1045
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,160
In 2007 the company moved to a bigger facility

1046
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,744
Outside of Portland where they make about 400 different products

1047
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
Still using the old Court Millstone from the 1800

1048
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:41,728
Billy Bob actually keeps a mason jar full of the very first product to come off of the Stone

1049
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Red wheat flour

1050
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824

Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1069
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Timeout for how you

1070
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
You built that

1071
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
Play story starts back in 2000

1072
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
15 when Mike bolo

1073
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
I was working as a lawyer in Chicago

1074
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
And then move to a new firm and new office

1075
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,488
My new desk was just

1076
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
One of those typical dances kind of mounted to a wall

1077
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,912
But yet in downtown Chicago at these beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows out to my right

1078
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
Overlooking the city of Florida ceiling windows

1079
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,663
We can relate to the main problem right it office desk that is not in the right place the person

1080
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,199
Place to be with you the window

1081
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:00,063
Get this beautiful view in the natural sunlight I'm like there's got to be something out there for that

1082
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
What Mike was looking for was

1083
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
Wedge really

1084
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671
That could be mounted

1085
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
Directly

1086
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,791
Two window so I started looking online couldn't find anything

1087
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
And that's when kind of like I always like to do I headed to Home Depot in Amazon and started to buy the parts I need the

1088
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
Ubuildit the first thing on my list

1089
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,311
Suction cups that could attach a desk

1090
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,895
To a window and could support what's on the desk

1091
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
Laptops

1092
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
Books

1093
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:32,063
So I shot then I found some good suction cups that you know held about

1094
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
40 lbs they said

1095
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,951
Mounted them with some string that I bought from Amazon and

1096
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,535
Critters really rudimentary almost kind of cat bed looking thing

1097
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
It wasn't too bad for a first try but it was bouncy and it was too narrow to really work as a desk

1098
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
And it was at that point that I stepped up and I found the

1099
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,895
Types of suction disk that they use to install commercial grade glass windows in high-rise

1100
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,039
I was like this is perfect these are Ultra durable ultra-strong and intended for this purpose potentially

1101
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
Okay so Mike

1102
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,415
Critical section he needed to affix the desk to a window

1103
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
And from there

1104
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,559
He built 18 prototypes and finally he had the desk he been dreaming of

1105
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:20,191
People started walking by my office saying what is that I want that in my office that's cool where did you buy it

1106
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,495
Kind of light bulbs

1107
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,895
Well I should really think about mass production and really bringing this to Market and around that time I went to a party

1108
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,199
Are you worried about a guy named Jason then

1109
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
Told Jason about the desk he built

1110
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,831
Immediately the light bulb went off in my head yes more light bulbs

1111
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,415
It turns out Jason grohowski was a real estate advisor

1112
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:45,023
It was huge job to help businesses improve the design of their workplaces

1113
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
So Jason's are real potential in the desk that Mike had invented

1114
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
Yours Jason

1115
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,775
I've seen how culture within spaces is changing how all the new buildings are glass how

1116
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
Everything is about bringing in the natural light for employees and just productivity and health and wellness within spaces

1117
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:08,319
And so I just got super excited other we need to we need to do this we need to take this to the next level

1118
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,719
Mike and Jason soon started working with a design firm in Chicago and made even more tweaks to the bass

1119
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,071
And by January 2017 they had a prototype ready so

1120
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
They launched

1121
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
Kickstarter that April

1122
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,775
And made $25,000 in just the first day after we closed out the kickstarter we had to fulfill

1123
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,823
Fill these orders so then it was

1124
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,615
Let's go get this made

1125
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,943
They had all these orders and no manufacture yet

1126
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
So a month later this is May of 2017 they found one in Singapore and by November

1127
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,927
Chase and Mike went there to check on the desks before they got shipped

1128
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,767
And I look at the unit unlike something doesn't seem right

1129
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
And I play with it

1130
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
And the lovers

1131
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:57,215
At that point we had 2,000 units already made all the components made

1132
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
And we were like this is

1133
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
Something that we can't let out the door

1134
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:06,943
So after a month of sleepless nights and many design revisions json and Mike

1135
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,247
Finally got the Liebherr right

1136
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:15,647
In December they started shipping their desks from their Singapore manufacturer to their customers and more than 40

1137
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:20,255
Countries they're not both working full-time on the company is called spu

1138
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
And their desk comes fully assembled so you can install it on your window in just a few minutes and then

1139
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
Enjoy The View

1140
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Refocus

1141
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
So

1142
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:36,639
Closely on our computers all of our work day is just streaming our eyes to look at close objects

1143
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,271
With dust you you're actually allowing yourself to relax your eye and look out further
