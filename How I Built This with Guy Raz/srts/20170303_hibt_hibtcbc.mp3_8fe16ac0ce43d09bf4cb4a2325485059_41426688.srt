00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,608
Support for how I built this and the following message come from Michigan Economic Development Corp

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,424
If you want to start or grow your business

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
Michigan is the place to make it happen

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,544
Learn Why by searching Michigan pure opportunity

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
We registered for the New York gift show which is the Holy Grail

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
I'll trade shows and we thought that this is going to be the ticket to R6S

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
But you were wrong it was a complete disaster

8
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
Running PR is how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
Behind the movement

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
The story of how he left China for America use Campbell's Soup cans to make

11
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Candles

12
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
Turn that into a multimillion-dollar company

13
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
So almost

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
Everything about the way Macy's life

15
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Turned out

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Is improbable

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
The fact that she started a business

18
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
That she makes candles that

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
Keenan lives in America

20
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
None of this was supposed to happen

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
And she describes it

22
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,200
Growing up in China in the 1970s was

23
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
I like living in a movie without

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Color when we grow up there was apps

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
Sweet Nothing everyone wear the same thing everyone would be

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Eating the same food everyone had the same small apartment life was very happiness

27
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
Signs that you don't have to be jealous of each other you don't have to

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
To be wanting things you cannot have in the 1970s

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
China was still a black box

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Closed off too much of the world

31
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Actually the government realized it needed better diplomats people who spoke foreign languages

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
Sail around the time a turn

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
12 1979

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
The government decided to open up some boarding schools to

35
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
Praying that next generation of diplomats

36
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
And may she

37
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
Was one of the lucky few who got it

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
So

39
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
We learned

40
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
Western culture American studies

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Renaissance art

42
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
All in English

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
And I knew more about Smithsonian and the locations of each art

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
The many Americans

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
And this was the thing about

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Learning a language

47
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,784
A language is really living it I remember it was very funny that I was watching

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Godfather at 14

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,160
Which has a lot of violence a lot of sacks in a lot of murders

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
We were enjoying it we we thought it was

51
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
You know something that

52
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,584
Everyone in the United States to honor every given day

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
It was a pretty Charmed Life

54
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Especially compared to other Chinese

55
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
May was on the fast track to becoming a diplomat

56
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
That was one problem

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
In the spring of 1989

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Chinese students started to organize demonstration

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Kids calling for more reforms

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
What we now know as the Tiananmen Square

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
After 6 weeks

62
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Chinese government

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Crackdown

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
Help me she wasn't an activist

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Time

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
That didn't matter

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
The government decided that

68
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Educated young people like her

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Wharf rat

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
So they were sent out of Beijing

71
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
The assignment

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Ode to a northern city

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Very cold

74
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Not even the city a suburb

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
My job

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
For the whole year is going to be

77
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
I'm watching a warehouse

78
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
For minerals

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Spit out going to

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
Black sports

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
So I have a clipboard

82
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
I have 2 highlights of a day

83
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,416
When the truck comes to pick up one load I put a check

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
And then it came again in the afternoon I check

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
That'll be the day

86
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Follow you

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
You must have been miserable

88
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
I was beyond miserable

89
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
At that time I was already dating my

90
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
First husband his name is David

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
So we were very close and being

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Far away was obviously not a good

93
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
Arrangement on top of that

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
What I worried most

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
What is that for 10 years

96
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
I was practicing

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
In speaking English

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
And language is very easily

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Forgotten

100
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
I barely speak

101
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,071
Chinese let alone English because my boss does not like to talk

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
He's a man with

103
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Few words

104
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
He smoked most of

105
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
What time

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
And that's my life

107
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Simei

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
She decided to quit

109
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
She dated thought about what to do

110
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
He was a trained geophysicist and she spoke English so

111
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
They decided to apply for temporary visas

112
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
To come to the US

113
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
And after 2 years of waiting

114
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
They got them

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
So I flew to Washington DC

116
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
When we arrive at Dulles Airport I was very

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
Sleepy because up to jet lag and I saw to size

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Kiwanis

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,911
American citizen and the other is a Lea

120
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,007
It's just as you arrive at immigration vs Aliens

121
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Was

122
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
Kind of confusing to me because I remember aliens from Star Wars

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
You know

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Go science

125
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
And I was so excited I said wow

126
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
They actually have a

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Section 4 alien

128
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
And

129
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
So I got very excited I said let me see

130
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm certainly not

131
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
American citizen so I guess I'm

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Going to have to go to the ATM part

133
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
That's great cuz I can see them

134
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
I never knew that the word idiom means the nun American language

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
I guess they realize

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
At 2 they changed the

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Do something

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
A little bit more

139
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
More human

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
What was it like to adjust

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
To the US and you had

142
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,991
Immerse yourself in American culture your entire childhood

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
But then you finally arrived here

144
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
Did it surprise you to disappoint you was it

145
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Lonely

146
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
Well I don't find it particularly difficult to adopt

147
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
What I find interesting is that in Washington DC

148
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
People kind of avoid icon

149
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
That's something I stood

150
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
I think was my first impression of the city

151
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
I was riding the subway

152
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
And I found a very interesting that

153
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
As quickly as I look at someone they merely change their eyes

154
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
And they try to focus on reading

155
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
And I said to myself I said wow this is a r e d

156
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Deep City because everybody's always reading

157
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
David Icke volume

158
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
Apus where you able to find a job

159
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Yes

160
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Psiphon job in New York

161
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,351
It was a job for American medical device companies to ask for

162
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Equipment

163
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
To Chinese hospitals

164
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
And was it interesting work if you enjoy it was boring I have to be honest with you it was a lot of paperwork pushing and

165
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
Import export documentation working with

166
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
You know different factories about

167
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
A SKU numbers and

168
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Pushing that line of credit

169
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Through the banks

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
But what's interesting out of all these

171
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Not so interesting thing is that

172
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
They put me in a hotel

173
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Next

174
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Bloomingdale's

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Why was it interesting

176
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Well imagine a bird out of

177
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Paige I have always been interested in

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Fashion

179
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,823
Many people wonder you know if you grow up in a country without any fashion how can you really have an eye for it

180
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
And

181
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
When I was there

182
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,783
You growing up in the foreign language Middle School China at that time already started exporting

183
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Fashion

184
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
And they would have those

185
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Rejected fashion

186
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
And they put them on sale near the universe station

187
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
So we would be jumping from one

188
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Place to another looking for

189
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Cheap fashion you know

190
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
So that was always something I'm very interesting

191
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
And when you're put next to a Bloomingdale

192
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
That was the best thing that can possibly happen

193
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
So what you would just go in

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Bloomingdale's

195
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,919
Everyday I would go starting phone

196
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
The first floor which

197
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
You Don't Own Me

198
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,367
South ladies that they spray fragrances and everybody hate them not me I love them since free on me

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
I like

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Being

201
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Sort of in the middle of

202
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,327
Something that launching and be able to tell what's in in the fragrance that I like and dislike

203
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
And then look at the packaging packages always fascinating to me because I grew up in a country with

204
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
No touching at all

205
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
But what interests me the most is a fashion floor and it's usually the second floor

206
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
And just

207
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Being amazed

208
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
And I love the women in New York the way they are so confidence and they dressed in those colors in those

209
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
The shapes and they look great

210
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,207
And then I would always end in the home Department

211
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
And it would always

212
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Give me a lot of question because

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
It look like it's in the 1920

214
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
It was supposed to what word look like

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
Furnitures will very ornate it has a lot of

216
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Dairy

217
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Gilded finish

218
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
And then the place I like

219
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,431
Laura Ashley Princeton a very small Grandma's

220
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
Wallpaper

221
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Floral

222
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
And I'm just wondering the person who is so confident walking on the street will go home to

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
See this

224
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
It's so disconnected

225
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
So I keep saying that to

226
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
David

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
When we talk on

228
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
On the phone he here in DC in DC I was in New York and I would get up at

229
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
5A Monday and took

230
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
The first train

231
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
And I'll get home at 9 on Friday so it's not really

232
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
A very good quality of life and I was

233
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
Calling him about what I discovered was very exciting and then

234
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
I continually

235
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Bring up how disconnected

236
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
The fashion and home

237
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Apartments

238
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,719
Finally he said may you seem to be really upset about this commute

239
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
So he said

240
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Maybe we should start something

241
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Cu

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Quest and you

243
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
And then then what was the plan but what was the business you guys were going to do so we knew if it's going to be home because we know where is home

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,103
Home Goods because the fashion business is dominant by Brent

245
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
And we feel

246
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
The home business is left without

247
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
And that's what we see opportunities so

248
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
It's close the gap between home and

249
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Fashion

250
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
So that's how I do it we don't know what product

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
We just quit.

252
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,023
At the same time will you just like started brainstorming in your in your apartment or your house

253
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
The time I try to figure out what

254
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,911
To do not only without each other but we reach out to a friend

255
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
So

256
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
We brainstormed with our friends

257
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
And as a result of that

258
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
When we started the business

259
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
In the middle of

260
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
1994

261
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
I would quickly got a lot of feedbacks

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
People send me samples me

263
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Pictures

264
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
And we

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Zoning on

266
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
About four categories

267
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
The first you'll be surprised

268
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Silk flowers I don't know

269
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Fake flowers that never die

270
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
The second category is accessories for your car so

271
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Seat

272
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Cushion something to make you

273
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
You feel comfortable when you drive for a long distance

274
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,031
Add a third category because I know this American Doll was so popular

275
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
Is a kind of doll that can rotate

276
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Quit music

277
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
And the Lost

278
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Something that I did

279
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
Even think it's interesting but I

280
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
I think it might have an opportunity

281
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Is a candle candle

282
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Every category mentioned

283
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
It's a huge business in this country there

284
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
Getting some dollars that are in each of those Counties have access to

285
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Because the Internet wasn't available now

286
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
It wasn't and I don't

287
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Really no

288
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
What difference we will make

289
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Other than

290
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
You know making it two times better

291
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
But I didn't even know how hard it

292
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Is that actually good

293
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
That you don't know everything that you don't know how hard it is that you just have

294
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
That something can be done to make it better

295
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
There's no amount of research

296
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
That can prove

297
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
And idea

298
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
But there's one thing you can always do which is to take your product

299
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
The market

300
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
So that's what we did

301
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
How did you get the products by the way

302
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Date they sampled us they'd send buyer

303
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,751
FedEx Store franchise

304
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Can you import into the US

305
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
We haven't imported them witches sample

306
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,919
Play December by DHL FedEx whatever it is said

307
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,551
Silk flower seat cushion flowers I think David brought some of those back by up breaking his

308
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
He's back also

309
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
And by that time

310
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
It was September 1994

311
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
All the major wholesale trade shows take place

312
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,399
Twice a year in January when people replenish their goods after holiday

313
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Adding summer when they're buying more for Christmas

314
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,847
But it was September so the only show we can possibly go to is saying Charlotte North Carolina

315
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Why what happened

316
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
90% of a business

317
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Came from the can

318
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
And what did the candles look like where they just

319
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Candles

320
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,183
Fair that you don't see them anymore they're called glow candles that round

321
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
And they look like stained glass

322
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
And when you burn them they are glowing

323
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
From within

324
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,447
So people came up to your booth and they were not interested in anything else is up flowers of the car says it was

325
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
It was at that stained glass looking cattle

326
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Because holiday

327
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And it was gift-giving season

328
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
And it's a great gift

329
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
Pakistan after the show

330
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
His orders

331
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
How did you

332
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
How did you deliver them how did you get them to the customer

333
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,135
We rent a very inexpensive Warehouse with office in the front

334
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,975
I was kind of Ford many people four times we just have one part-time

335
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
To help us

336
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,631
We were able to use our savings and our family and friends

337
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Helped us

338
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
To the first container was a 20-foot container not even a 40-foot container

339
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
And then we ship them

340
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
Very fast we got reorders

341
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Yes

342
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
So what was the candle

343
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Retailing for

344
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
$15 the most

345
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
We probably will take

346
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
50%

347
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Margin on them

348
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
So it was

349
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
Almost half a million dollars of business we did

350
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Informant

351
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,911
I mean were you David just like shocks by the candle thing do what we were taken surprised by

352
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
We would not expect it to do so well for the first

353
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
4 months of our business

354
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
And we were shipping everyday

355
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
I'm

356
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
I was a sales manager

357
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
I was assistant

358
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
I was accounting

359
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
I was

360
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Taking products out of the

361
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Containers I was everything

362
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
Okay so you shut this container from China and then you deliver all the stuff to your clients

363
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
And then what did you guys do after like what was what was the next move for the company

364
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,887
The second year I decided since the trade show it's so important

365
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
We registered for the New York gift show which is the

366
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
The Holy Grail

367
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
I'll trade show

368
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
So we went to the New York Gift Show

369
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
And we thought that this is going to be

370
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
The ticket to R6S

371
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
But the show which is 10 times bigger with an international audience told us that we were wrong

372
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
It was a complete disaster

373
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
You

374
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
Are trying to sell kidney sink handles that you're importing

375
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
From China and

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
They're not selling

377
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Fennel salad

378
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
And

379
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
I was devastated

380
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
Because it's a very expensive trade show

381
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
I'm assuming at this point I mean

382
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
You must have

383
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Certified senior mind that maybe this candle business

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,383
It was a fluke maybe the fact that we did so well that first

385
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
4 months

386
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
Just had to do with Christmas

387
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Exactly

388
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
That was the thought

389
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
But I wasn't giving up I was always more International minded

390
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
I was already scheduled to go to visit

391
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Frankfurt

392
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Germany

393
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
Because every year in February there's a big

394
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Home Products show called on Beyonce

395
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
An Ender

396
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Be my very depressed

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Moments

398
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
I need it

399
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
To go there to see what

400
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Could potentially be the next thing

401
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Because what I envisioned

402
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
For home

403
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
It's already

404
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Be there

405
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
The design is very streamlined

406
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Everything France

407
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Home furniture

408
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
2 lighting and table

409
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
The colors are very bold

410
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
They have oranges lavenders

411
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
And they have those beautiful contrast

412
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
With white

413
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
And

414
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,887
I was so happy that I went there because it's confirmed

415
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
That home and fashion could be in sync

416
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
Soap soap is it change your trajectory Avenue still

417
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,431
Have a candle business where you're bringing these like stained glass window candles

418
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
In from China

419
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,783
Yuan Frankfort you see these beautiful streamline designs

420
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
And you think

421
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
What

422
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
So I could use that design elements in candle design

423
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
That you would design your own candles

424
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
That was always my thought even though you were trained as a diplomat

425
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
People end up doing what they're trained to do but that's

426
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
Training is very helpful because I was

427
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Exposed to a lot of Art

428
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Education when I was

429
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Very young kid

430
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
So I started

431
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
From the very high level of Art

432
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
And that trickles down

433
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Fashion

434
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
It finally goes to home on the Frankfurt Rachel how did it change your approach to two

435
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
You're doing so I came back

436
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,535
Very refreshed from any invigorated from what I see and really I was determined

437
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
That I'm going to really start to do something

438
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,215
And another thing I discovered by starting to pay more attention now to candles

439
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
Is that my competitor in the US

440
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Vapcell candles

441
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
In the Millions

442
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
And probably the billion

443
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
And I ask myself

444
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Why do they buy it

445
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
All year round

446
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
It's not because they have it

447
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Patton it's because of the freeway

448
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
The power of fragrance has been

449
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Men and women over the years have been wearing fragrances

450
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
For many reasons

451
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
But for home

452
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
It takes on a very new meaning

453
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
So that was it you

454
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
You basically decided to

455
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
That point to start making

456
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Scented candles

457
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Yes

458
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,775
At that time we were for the first time joined

459
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Buy a permanent

460
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Employee which is

461
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
A friend of David's

462
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
His name is Richard

463
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
And he and I went to visit

464
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,015
One of the fragrance vendors in New Jersey

465
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
Need to learn how to make candles

466
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
So he and I went in

467
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Speed up

468
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Hunchback

469
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
And

470
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
For 4 hours we learn everything

471
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
That one need to learn

472
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
About making frozen candles

473
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,935
So many people think about candles and they say how hot can it be I can make it with my eyes

474
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Say that you just pour some waxing perfume and then you pull that with there and then it's going to be a candle

475
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,943
But if you want to make it a business and you want to make sure it doesn't burn someone's house down

476
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
She actually have to study how to make it because

477
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
A candle is both

478
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
A piece of art

479
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
And a lot of signs

480
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
Five things that are interacting with each other

481
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Is the fragrance

482
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
It's the base which is the wax

483
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Is the color

484
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Pigment

485
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Eastwick

486
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
And finally

487
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Is Sebastian

488
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
Which is the glass or a container

489
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,847
And if you don't do all those five things perfectly would like what was the wrong

490
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,687
Well have you ever seen candles that has a lot of black soot

491
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
That's because the wick is too big

492
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Or you could have

493
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
A candle

494
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,599
That simply tunnel burn into the middle

495
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
And you don't

496
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Smelling

497
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
That's because

498
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
The formula

499
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
And the WIC

500
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Optimize

501
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
So half a day you visit there and

502
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
What you drive back to Maryland and you start to experiment

503
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,703
We were forcing out of excitement we sell wow we're going to start making freaking

504
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Is candles for the first time and

505
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
We decided to experiment what we learned

506
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
We have two modes when we were

507
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Home

508
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
So instead

509
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
We will always

510
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Eating a lot of Campbell's Soup

511
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
You were startup you waiting lot of Campbell's Soup

512
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,111
Exactly a lot of Campbell soup noodle soup

513
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
So we said these are great sizes

514
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Just so let's use them

515
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Foremost

516
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,791
Pamoate so we started mixing in our kitchen

517
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
With our regular pods

518
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
Oils with wax

519
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
With colors

520
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:56,799
One thing we forgot in our excitement is a chemical that blend the oil really well with a wax

521
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
So that when you

522
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,175
Take it out of the modes it looks very smooth we forgot that chemical

523
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,503
What happened is a random Harvest because

524
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
When we took the candle out of the mode

525
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
The candle look

526
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Fossilize

527
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,695
Fossilized because of the oil not blending very well

528
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,535
So can I have this aged look around if it has a snowflake on

529
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Endnote

530
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Candles I like

531
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
What is snowflake would be on different part of

532
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
The candle

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Everything looks

534
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Handmade

535
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
And on top of that

536
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
I blended fragrance differ

537
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
I put vanilla with

538
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Lavender

539
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
I put

540
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Watermelon with mint

541
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Where many people just have that straight

542
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Vanilla or straight

543
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Watermelon

544
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
Is that the secret sauce

545
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
The fragrance

546
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Yes

547
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
And many people say

548
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
The reason why they burn fragrance

549
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Is the finishing touch

550
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Touch two

551
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Cleaning at home

552
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
When they want

553
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
2

554
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Finish

555
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
And since that

556
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Thomas ready for the

557
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
You know friends and family to come

558
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,359
For entertaining or when their husband and children come back to home

559
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
You want to put something

560
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
To markdown

561
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
It's a clean house

562
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
So they put a candle

563
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
It smells like a cookie it smells like

564
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Fresh cotton

565
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
That's why people continually by the can

566
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,208
Because they need to fragrance

567
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
As You Are

568
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
Really kind of honing in on what what

569
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
This product is going to be is that when you came up with the name

570
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Yes

571
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
So think about those collar

572
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
Beautiful cobalt blue with a lavender with a honeydew green

573
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
Not home to Greenwich everybody use

574
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
Sunflower yellow white

575
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Think about what it means

576
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Sit means energy

577
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
It means fresh

578
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
And this is where we give the name

579
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Because we were living in a placenta

580
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Annapolis Maryland Annapolis Maryland

581
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
And many times I would take my dog for a walk

582
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
I like how Annapolis

583
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,328
British steel today is to very quiet

584
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
It's not the Hampton store

585
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Any other

586
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Yuno sushi

587
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
You placed a very down-to-earth

588
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
It's very real it's very

589
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Christina sent that to me

590
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Coming from China

591
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
It is very untouched

592
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
And

593
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
It stand for natural

594
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
And I want

595
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,808
Communicate that because our

596
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
Candles are not touched by a lot of chemical

597
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,672
Natural finish on AR

598
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Texture

599
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
So we just called Chesapeake Bay candle

600
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
When we come back how many she wound up making an enemy out of the one person she needed to get her candles

601
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152

And thanks

636
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
It's how I built this from NPR

637
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
A guy Roz soap

638
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,288
Picture experiment in her basement with Campbell's Soup cans

639
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
Nishi is

640
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
Stumbled across a new kind of can

641
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Bold colors mix

642
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Fragrances

643
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
And now

644
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Chesney

645
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Convince someone

646
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Dubai

647
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
So I called Bloomingdale

648
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
And I was

649
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
Working with the secretaries

650
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Bagging a

651
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
Pleading that I have a great product

652
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
So finally she gave me the name of the buyer

653
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
The fire is really important

654
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,472
They are the eyes and ears for any company and particularly for Bloomingdale's

655
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
You can imagine that

656
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
That the standards really high

657
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
When I described a candle

658
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
The textures

659
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Fragrances

660
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
And the colors

661
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
She was very intrigued

662
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
So I got it

663
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Appointment

664
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
By the way

665
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
You know when I went there didn't even sit down

666
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
They started

667
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
Taking a candles and show

668
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Everybody around in the office

669
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
And you New York Gotham

670
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
So I take it Bloomingdale's maiden maiden order

671
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
They loved it

672
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
They just showed it to their

673
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Bosses

674
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
And we got

675
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
First order

676
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
To ship to

677
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
The store said I have been

678
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Going so many times

679
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
How did you

680
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Produce enough candles to

681
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
Still that order so here comes the best

682
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
I was frustrated because

683
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
At that time China did not have

684
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
The home fragrance industry

685
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
To produce that kind of oil

686
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
You need a chemical compound

687
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Facility

688
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
And they were not used to that

689
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
They used to

690
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
Zelda cinnamon said they're Jasmine's overseas

691
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
The French and the US will then

692
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Turn them into

693
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,800
Oils for fine fragrance oil for

694
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
Food flavors

695
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
But I don't have industry themselves

696
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
So is it the Chinese weren't weren't

697
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Making fragrances like this

698
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
Like how are you able to do even

699
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,856
So I talked to a few factories in China

700
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
They look at me like a

701
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
You know that's a problem because

702
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
They certainly wouldn't take on a project

703
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Like that

704
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
I was frustrated I told my sister about this

705
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
And she too

706
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Was very determined to help me

707
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,960
So she said I'm going to quit

708
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
And she said I'm going to start a fact

709
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
In 1995

710
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
So that was the year

711
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
When we started have our own Factory which changed everything to me perfect look is it you can do that you can just

712
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,648
The factory is already 95 so you can put ukulele in that part of China

713
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Spherion pineiro

714
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
There are Villages that make nothing but buttons

715
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Or Village that make nothing

716
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Candlestick

717
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
So

718
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,144
Having a factory is possible

719
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,728
But we have borrowed very heavily from friends and family

720
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
To build that

721
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
From scratch

722
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
So your sister build his Factory and start manufacturing the candles and

723
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
We do working like crazy where you always working

724
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
I'm always thinking

725
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Because I'm

726
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
I was always thinking about the next color

727
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
The next fragrance that can mix

728
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Packaging that we can play

729
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
So

730
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
I was always doing a lot of things have the same

731
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
What were the things at that time that that

732
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Kept you up at night what were the

733
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Anxiety

734
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
I was never have time to worry I'm a very optimistic

735
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,288
Sick person but I was always wondering who is our next

736
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Customer so we stole

737
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,176
To Nordstrom right after Bloomingdale they're very similar companies

738
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
But in 1995 and 96

739
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
My eye started

740
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
To search for

741
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Who is this

742
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Company that's

743
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Trending

744
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,952
Represents some demographic change

745
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Stop

746
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Shopping list

747
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Yeah and I I started to focus

748
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Why Target

749
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
They stand for style and Design

750
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
Versus Walmart which stands for value

751
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
And it really inspired me

752
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
Because I really subscribe to design for all

753
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
That philosophy because I came from a country

754
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
A lot of people that are very poor

755
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
I know a lot of teachers of mine

756
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Who has

757
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Great taste

758
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
Who would never be able to buy things

759
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Bloomingdale's

760
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
So

761
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
How can I make it more fertile

762
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
How can we make it so we can sell it for $20

763
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
$80

764
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
So

765
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
I knew it's going to be the

766
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Growth for us if we can get in

767
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Because it's already 705

768
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
50 stores

769
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
National

770
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
And they have

771
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
Two dedicated Isles

772
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
With 48

773
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Feet of

774
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Candles

775
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
So who do you who do you call there

776
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
So it was pretty straightforward

777
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
You can find a name of a buyer

778
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
There's a telephone

779
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Extension

780
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
End

781
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
You can leave message

782
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
And you

783
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
Call a person so this is the time when I always say you

784
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,312
You cannot give up even if you call for a whole year which I did a whole year every month at the same time

785
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
I called and left message

786
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
And you said

787
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
I said Haim

788
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
Same thing I did with Nordstrom and same thing I did

789
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,112
Like I said I have a great candle and now I can't even say it

790
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
It's sold at bloomingdales Juicery

791
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
Target buyers

792
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,792
Listening and those say wow they already at those doors we want to be those

793
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
Or so they would usually return your

794
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
Your phone but not

795
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
The buyer

796
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
And nothing silencing silence

797
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
So how did you

798
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,544
Had you finally break through what so I have to say this

799
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Probably one of my biggest failure is that I started to get frustrated and I sent to the receptionist she's not rich

800
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Returning my call

801
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,272
So she said I think you could

802
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
Call her boss

803
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
And make

804
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,952
Which I did I basically say well you're one of your buyers have not met

805
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
Any return phone calls

806
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
2 minutes later to buy a call

807
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
And she said this is so and so

808
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,192
And just so you know this is not a way to start a relationship

809
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
And she hang and she hung up on you

810
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
Wow so you were

811
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Finish time

812
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,784
Every time I call her again if it's her voice I didn't even leave my voice message again kept calling

813
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
I can't call that you were shut out of there

814
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
I basically

815
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,464
So I waited until the next year in April

816
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,560
And it was a very different voice it was a very cheerful voice

817
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
It was a new buyer it was a new buyer

818
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,728
And I left my message and I got it back in 2 days

819
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Finally

820
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Come

821
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,360
Because as you can imagine every new buyer wants to make a difference

822
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
I want to make that

823
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
Denmark

824
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
And she hurt me

825
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
So she said why don't you come

826
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
And I did

827
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Razer headquarters

828
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
TPC Minneapolis

829
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
Right

830
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
So I flew there

831
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
And she was very young she was probably in her

832
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,256
Late 20's and she coming

833
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
And she was sitting down listening to my pitch but

834
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Halfway through Shattuck

835
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
And smell the candles from the bottom

836
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Candle buyers

837
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
You should want to smell the candles

838
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
From the bottom

839
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
That's when the oil settle into the body

840
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
And you smell the most

841
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Song about

842
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
And so what you saying to Chief

843
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Panora

844
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,528
She basically in a big store

845
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
It's a lot

846
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Process

847
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
They asked you

848
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Capability questions pricing questions

849
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Cherry pick what they want

850
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
So I didn't expect

851
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Anything to happen

852
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
But

853
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Jasmine

854
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,632
If I put it in my store how soon can you ship

855
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
That was the moment when I froze

856
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
Because I said what do you mean

857
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,544
Are you going to test because I heard they test a lot

858
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
That do testing 50 stores

859
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
100 stores

860
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
She said no me

861
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
I wanted

862
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Put it in 750

863
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
And I said

864
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,088
Oh in that case and I started

865
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
To calculate in my head

866
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
How fast

867
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,208
My sister's company can produce

868
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
With 700

869
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Des tours

870
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
And I set

871
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
6 months

872
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,424
I just have perfect that would land Us in October and you can ship it so it arrives

873
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
In December

874
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
And that's when we set for spring

875
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
An end how big was ever

876
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
That order and up

877
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Bing

878
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Over $1000000

879
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
And the forecast for the year

880
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
And it being over 3 minutes

881
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,088
How did Jamie soap so basically it mean when you call your sister and you said

882
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
We have a sword from Target we have to make how many

883
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Can you even remember how many candles you had to make it's probably

884
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Half a million candles

885
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
How many candles

886
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
What was

887
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Zachary Abel

888
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Mapreduce

889
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
That was going to stretch them

890
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
They were going to have three ships

891
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Everyday of the week

892
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Just like 24/7

893
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
Yes we will have to hire people

894
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
To work 7 days a week

895
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,688
And the thing about the to Target

896
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Shipment is that is really daunting

897
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
When you think about people scaling that business

898
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
That's one of the things people

899
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Overstock

900
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
Think about this Finance how to finance a big water

901
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
I mean it.

902
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
The second email ask is legit

903
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Physically how do you turn over

904
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
20 containers

905
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Oquendo

906
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
In two days

907
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
And we don't even have to

908
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
The physical space

909
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
To turn 20 containers in 2 days right

910
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
So we rented

911
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
A very big empty

912
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Warehouse in Laurel

913
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
In Laurel Maryland Maryland where are

914
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Other warehouses

915
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
But there's no electricity

916
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
So we parked up

917
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Two cars

918
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Used to headlight

919
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
To light up the warehouse in the evening

920
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
And we literally

921
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Packed and unpacked

922
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,280
Using aqua love you you

923
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
David your husband shirt

924
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,168
And two or three of our warehouse workers five of us all together

925
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,776
Witch Hunt over 20 contains your company was five people in the US have the time

926
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
5 to 6

927
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Full-time people

928
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,200
And we went into holiday season some somewhat absent-minded

929
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
Waiting to see when the product will show up on the shelves

930
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
And showing up right after Christmas

931
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
Are products with their

932
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
But it was radio silence

933
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,464
There was nothing coming from the buyer from Target

934
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Until when

935
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
Hunter 2 weeks after it was set

936
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
And I get panic order

937
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Call from the buyer

938
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Samara

939
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Big trouble

940
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Oh no they didn't get all the

941
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Products or

942
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Then I'm moving at all

943
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
No

944
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,872
We are under forecast

945
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
We could have sold 8 million dollars off your candles this year

946
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,368
And you need to go back to China and build a bigger factory and we need to catch up because I don't want to be empty shelves

947
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
In April or March

948
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
So is that what you did

949
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
That's what we did

950
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
And we found a much bigger facility

951
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
And we all fit it

952
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
So that

953
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
By March

954
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,448
We started shipping out of the new facility how many factors do you have

955
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,752
So we have one in

956
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,544
Hangzhou China

957
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
As the first factory

958
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,152
Now we have whining haiphong in Vietnam

959
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
And now in Glen Burnie Maryland

960
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
Cloud

961
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
It's a lot more expensive to

962
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
To manufacture candles in the US

963
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Why are you doing it

964
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
I came to this country

965
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
And I'm a citizen for many many years

966
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
Always want to find product that said meaning

967
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
USA when I go back to China

968
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
And I couldn't find them

969
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Everything is always made in China

970
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Made in Indonesia Made in India

971
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
I think made in USA

972
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
We may have not realize

973
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
People believe that

974
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,920
There's integrity

975
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
Andeavor stock

976
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Cool fact

977
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
With product says made in USA

978
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
And we haven't explored that

979
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
As a country

980
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648
Did you think you had a competitive

981
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Advantage

982
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
In part because you are an immigrant and a part because

983
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
Everything in America was new to you and your kind of

984
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Knife

985
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
I think that's

986
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Precisely

987
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
I think immigrants are self-selected

988
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
They are self-select

989
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
The group that is

990
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Dairy Pig

991
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Taking risks

992
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
In some ways they have

993
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
The same Trace

994
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
It sounds pretty hurts already

995
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
Instead of taking what's easy

996
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
What's already

997
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Familiar

998
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
They choose

999
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Unfamiliar the unchartered

1000
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Because they have more confidence

1001
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,672
And they have more curiosity

1002
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Sew in

1003
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Selecting themselves as

1004
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Immigrants

1005
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
They're already

1006
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
Facing big risks

1007
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
From a company that you started

1008
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,984
Is it is an afterthought with

1009
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
Silk flowers and car seat covers

1010
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
To accompany that

1011
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
I seen does

1012
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,200
Reportedly like 60 to 70 million dollars a year in Revenue

1013
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
It's a pretty amazing

1014
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,576
We could you have imagined that when you came to the US

1015
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
A temporary Visa that

1016
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
That you would be running a company that

1017
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
It's so big

1018
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
So remember the alien story

1019
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
Yeah remember I thought I was

1020
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
You know going to meet an alien and discovered that I was

1021
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Actually the alien

1022
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
How cool is it that an alien

1023
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Next president of United

1024
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
And talk about

1025
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
How to create a job

1026
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
In America

1027
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
That was me

1028
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
In mm

1029
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
12

1030
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
I was creating jobs in the United States

1031
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
Cuz I'm a factory and

1032
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
The president's office

1033
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Took note

1034
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,744
And he invited 13 of the biggest manufacturers such as

1035
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Ford

1036
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Intel

1037
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
And I was invited because I was a small business

1038
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
And

1039
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
I was giving advice

1040
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,008
As to why it makes sense to revitalize

1041
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Manufacturing in this country

1042
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
But why

1043
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
That we have not done enough

1044
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
For those company

1045
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Needs to bring job

1046
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,480
So I feel very fortunate not on me

1047
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Was I accepted not

1048
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,880
Just as a learner you know I was able to giving a path

1049
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,304
To realize what I want to do and more

1050
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,608
OKC Thunder of Chesapeake Bay candle

1051
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,960
By the way to this day Target is by far her biggest customer

1052
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,288
I need to know the average price of a candles is around fifteen bucks

1053
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,408
American spend more than three billion dollars just on candles

1054
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
And 90%

1055
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,624
About by women

1056
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,512
Please don't turn us off just yet in a moment

1057
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,584
We're going to hear from you about the things you guys are building

1058
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,680
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsors Cleveland Clinic

1059
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,264
Cleveland Clinic is ranked number one in the nation in Heart Care

1060
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
22 years in a row according to US News & World Report

1061
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
For more information or to get a second opinion

1062
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,712
Is it clevelandclinic.org

1063
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Heart Care

1064
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,952
Hey thanks for sticking around it's time now for how you built that and we can hear from Louise bigger who lives in

1065
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Toronto and describe the product

1066
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
They're these fruity tones that

1067
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
Travel through your mouth at different times and then Citrus notes

1068
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,128
Undertone Cedar citrusy notes

1069
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
Louise Baker As You Guessed sells pepper

1070
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Pepper

1071
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,088
As in this salt to your pepper actually peppercorns

1072
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Louis

1073
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
Came across this was very special kind of pepper on a family trip a few years ago at a plantation

1074
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
In Cambodia and when is grown

1075
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,936
Cassidy using centuries-old harvesting techniques and the proper soil in the proper

1076
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:14,336
Time it then it takes on the flavor that is entirely different and we felt like we tasted Pepper for the V

1077
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,736
First time it was amazing return to Toronto from their trip every time they would be

1078
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:27,136
Peppermill on the kitchen table tastes like ordinary boring pepper they've been spoiled by

1079
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
Cambodian peppercorn

1080
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
Maybe there's a market for complex and nuanced artisanal pepper

1081
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,912
Here in North America about

1082
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,216
25% of the world

1083
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Spice trade

1084
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,848
Is peppercorn so everyone uses pepper and when we started

1085
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Take me to the felt

1086
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
I could do this

1087
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
So they emailed back Farm in Cambodia

1088
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
And got them to ship a big bag of Capricorn

1089
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,952
Louise built a website of course and then designed a nice little package for them and then

1090
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
Givens the printers the green light

1091
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
And then realized

1092
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
That's the dimensions weren't quite right so we would have ended up with 13,000 packages that we wouldn't have been able to use

1093
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
Good-looking corpse husband launched their

1094
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
Business they sell black and red Cambodian peppercorns to foodie is it a few retail stores but mostly through there

1095
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:31,136
Website and the color company drum pepper stream in Danish and I'm I'm Danish

1096
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,536
Via the trip that we took that was a long-standing dream of ours and setting up the business with social something we dreamt about

1097
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
So beautiful dream theme throughout

1098
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,192
Leslie speaker she's the founder of drum pepper in Toronto Canada

1099
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:49,056
