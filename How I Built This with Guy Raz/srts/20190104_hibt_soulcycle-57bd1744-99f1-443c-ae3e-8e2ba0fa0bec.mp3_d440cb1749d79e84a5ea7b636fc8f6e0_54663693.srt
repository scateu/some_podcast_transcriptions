Is kind of what the founders of

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
SoulCycle envisioned when they set out the building

Julie rice and Elizabeth Cutler met in New York

59
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
In 2005

60
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
The time Julie was working is it

61
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Talent agent

62
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
And Elizabeth was doing acupuncture and realist

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
On the side

64
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
They were both in their thirties and both of them

65
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Married with young children at home

66
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
But they were

67
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm so hungry to start something new in their lives

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Here's Elizabeth

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
After our second daughter was

70
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Osborne

71
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,240
I started to really have the strong at entrepreneurial urge

72
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
And I really wanted to dig into some

73
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Something and I

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
I kept on thinking about

75
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,760
Let the struggles that I've gone through and having the kids and how much weight a hurricane and how difficult it was for me to lose it and

76
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
And I joined Jim's I went everywhere I beg friends of mine who belong to other gyms to take me as their gas so I could try to

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
Classes I really want to find my class

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
I couldn't find it was what was wrong with it

79
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
From me

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
What was going on in there it just wasn't inspiring

81
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
People play the same playlist over and over they would phone it in it was

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Boring

83
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
It was I remember somebody yelling at me

84
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Pretend there's an 800 pound gorilla on her chest

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
My father myself are you really kidding me right now has no last my music system cells in the mirror oh my God

86
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
What is yeah you know

87
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Bright lights

88
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Bad smells and

89
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
People walking in and out of class

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Exactly

91
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
I guess you kind of found yourself in

92
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
And kind of a similar

93
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Situations you'd move to New York from

94
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
From California

95
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,888
I guess an in 2002 what was

96
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Going on in your life at the

97
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
The time when you guys met

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Well I really missed

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,360
What I had had in Los Angeles in terms of an exercise

100
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Community

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
Exercise for me it was social

102
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
It was a huge part of the way that I connected with people it was a big part of the way that I spend my time bonding with my friends we would go

103
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Hiking I can think about some of

104
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
The most important moments that we had together having really deep talks

105
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,583
Going up the mountain and then solving problems coming down the other side of that mountain

106
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
And I got to New York

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
And

108
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
All I can really find were gym class

109
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Glasses in boot camp

110
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
I swear you are definitely going to burn some calories

111
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
But not get much more out of it than that

112
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Actually when you

113
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
When you were calogen

114
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
At this time

115
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
For you blonde before you meet Elizabeth

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Do you remember starting to sing

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
I think I'm lost

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Business

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,719
I definitely didn't think so I want to start a business

120
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
But what I did

121
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Tsinghua

122
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
In Los Angeles

123
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
There was

124
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
Boutique Fitness that was starting to happen in New York nothing like that existed

125
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
And I had them I had taken some indoor cycling classes in Los Angeles

126
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
And I had been

127
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
I really actually loved it and I had

128
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
I found a community in a small Studio there

129
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
And because I had been in business wear

130
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
You know I build businesses out of people

131
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
I kept thinking about how this could be different

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
And how can this can be marketed differ

133
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,279
Currently in position differently and what would make this unique and it could be about empowerment rather than about

134
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Putting pressure on yourself

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
And so it wasn't that I just had this need to start a business

136
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
I had a need for a very

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,543
It was really more about a need for a product than it was

138
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Oh I just want to be an entrepreneur

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
People have ideas

140
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
I've walked into like kombucha shops inside

141
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,063
Do a better kombucha shop than this

142
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
I'm going to talk to a friend

143
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Want to do

144
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
But then I just move on I keep doing my shows

145
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
What did you start to say to people

146
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
I'm really intrigued about

147
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Do they have these in LA and I think

148
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
I want to do one

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
Which is that would happen if you start to talk

150
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
People

151
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
I did I started to

152
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,615
Say it first to my husband who told me I was insane

153
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
I meant to my parents and told me that I had good health insurance

154
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
And then to a couple of friends

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,599
Who told me that you know they love the gym that they belong to and why would anybody ever do something

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
But it was one of those things that just would not go away from me it was one of those things especially because exercise with such

157
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Daily ritual of mine

158
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,399
But everyday I would wake up and try some sort of exercise

159
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Leave feeling unfulfilled

160
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
And go back to thinking

161
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
About this ID again

162
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
And remember what made it one

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
You know one notch even more difficult

164
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Was that

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
I was talking about charging p

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
People

167
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:49,087
To pay per class for this where is Jim's already offered cycling classes they were on the buffet

168
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
They were included in membership zactly they were plenty of them

169
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Around

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
I got my cycling class

171
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Exactly

172
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Elizabeth Eaton parallel

173
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
The parallel universe you're living and also New York City

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Not knowing Julie

175
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Were you thinking hey

176
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
We could

177
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Do a cycling Studio or was it much more soda

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Abstract

179
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
No I was

180
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
I was thinking that I wanted to start indoor cycling Studio

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,063
Because what I felt like I could find on that bike wasn't out there

182
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,183
And I started researching what it would take to open one and I started talking to

183
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Took a couple of friends

184
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,535
And one of my friends said you know I really don't have the heart to

185
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Tell you this but you know spending is over

186
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Over

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
October 2005

188
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Over it was over

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
It had it had been

190
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,335
Really popular in the 1990s rap for cyclists butthead.

191
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
And had mainstreamed in gems for sure

192
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
But that trended kind of falling off and

193
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
He just said they're Gill never make anything

194
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Sing happen out of this

195
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
We're either because like I don't know

196
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
A little bit embarrassed when when you talk about in people kind of throws

197
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Dad that concept just doesn't make sense.

198
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
I was not embarrass I was

199
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
For sure doing this

200
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,727
This was a calling this was definitely happening

201
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
My husband told me I was going to ruin my life

202
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
And I was going to work 24/7 and I said

203
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm going to handle it

204
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
It's going to be fine

205
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,991
I was I was also not embarrassed I had such conviction in this idea

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
This was something that was definitely going to work

207
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
My husband was definitely embarrassed and I can remember several times

208
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Before we went out to dinner who would say

209
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Please don't talk to my

210
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Friends that don't talk about this weird yet but I think

211
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
For me

212
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
You know it was meeting Elizabeth

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
That really

214
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Allowed me to take the leap

215
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
You're not I'm not I'm not

216
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,031
Quite I'm not quite as convinced that if I had just been on my own that I wouldn't have been you know like he with the kombucha

217
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
But but

218
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Two of you

219
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
MTG how did that happen how did you even

220
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
Get connected

221
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,063
I have been taking This Woman's class and indoor cycling class out in East Hampton

222
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
And I tried to find one in the city

223
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
And eventually I ended up

224
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
As a guest at a class at

225
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
At one of the clubs Uptown in New York switch

226
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Churches near Julie's

227
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
Apartment and I met this teacher that I like tonight

228
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Talk to her after class

229
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
It's a listen I'm thinking about trying indoor cycling Studio

230
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
It's really funny

231
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,055
There's another woman who takes my class on Saturday and she's been talking me about

232
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Same thing YouTube we should go to lunch

233
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
That was so she said you should contact her and what happened like

234
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
She gave you

235
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Her number

236
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
We went to lunch all three of us

237
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
A my husband so the four of us had lunch

238
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
Yep and Julie and I started talking and we just

239
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Like what you like about her

240
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
We

241
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
We you know we very quickly

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,679
Babies that were the same age and we made some small talk and then

243
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,335
I think we quickly got to a conversation that was that was even more philosophical than just what we wanted

244
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
The open I think that we fundamentally saw two different

245
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,503
I think we both felt that exercise did not have to be torture

246
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
They could be joyful

247
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
And that by creating a place that

248
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
What was she going that way

249
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Aspirational

250
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,511
And turning our instructors into more like spiritual gurus and being drill camp

251
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Sargent's

252
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,631
We felt that we could really create something that people would value

253
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
And then

254
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
At the same time we could create a new product and there was no mark

255
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
A place in New York at the time there was no

256
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Opportunity

257
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,919
To take pay per class Fitness at the time we're talking about 2005

258
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
There were some yoga studios but other than that

259
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,807
You know the model for Jim's and this is a lot of what we

260
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
What about we talk about how

261
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Traditional gym model was

262
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Take your credit card

263
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Charging for monthly membership

264
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Hope that you don't show up

265
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
So that then you can you know add more people's memberships you know

266
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,167
Trying to understand what the utilization rate of your gym was

267
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
We said you know what we're so confident

268
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
That we can make people feel good

269
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
That we are going to challenge ourselves every time

270
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Every time you come you'll have a great experience because you'll have to

271
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Pay all over again to come back

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
An end

273
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
And what you say

274
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,623
Hey let's do it you just like leave the laundry like let's do this

275
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Yes that's exactly right

276
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
So we leave so we leave the lunch

277
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
And

278
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
You know I leave I get in the cab my cell phone rings

279
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
And Elizabeth says to me okay here was here's what's going to happen

280
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
I'm going to look for real estate and you research towels

281
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
I'm going to call you on Thursday

282
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Intruder word Thursday the phone rang

283
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
And she said I found something on Craigslist

284
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
It's on West 72nd Street you should meet me there tomorrow

285
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
And on Thursday we met at the

286
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
The studio at what would become our first SoulCycle

287
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Go studio

288
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
It was an old dance studio

289
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
That they were subletting for 5 years we could

290
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Dick sublease on it

291
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
The entire thing was about 1200 square

292
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Are feet

293
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
And we walk through and we looked at each other and we said it's

294
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
You signed

295
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Five-year lease like

296
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Pretty soon after

297
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Yes

298
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Within three weeks. I had the least sign

299
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
Kayla just passed

300
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Cuz I want to break this.

301
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
Did you do formal partnership agreement that you do all that stuff it was still pretty much handshake like

302
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
You and me are partners and we're just going to figure it out

303
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
So at lunch that day

304
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
The woman that introduced us

305
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
VI resorts

306
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
Fitness instructor our third partner and I were friends

307
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
And so we decided at the end of the lunch that

308
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
We each bought a really particular skill set to

309
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
The business and she was going to be

310
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
The fitness instructor and she was going to help us to find other

311
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Are teachers and help us create

312
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
The program cuz neither of us had ever created anything in

313
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Fitness before

314
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,855
And Elizabeth was going to work on all of our design

315
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
And all of our business and all of our technology

316
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
We're going to work on The Branding together Elizabeth and I since we had

317
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Such a similar vision

318
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
And I was going to work on the people

319
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,423
How soon do the PRI was going to train the studio staff

320
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
And so that's the way that we were going to divide

321
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
And Julie did you have any

322
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Money at that time did you have like

323
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Welfare

324
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
Personal you know it's like a huge stash of cash

325
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
So ironically

326
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
I had actually milk

327
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
What am I

328
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,135
Very close girl friends had just gotten married and she had one of the Great

329
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Blaster glass rate rent control Apartments left in New York City

330
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
It was the first floor walk-up

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,887
Over Harry's Burrito on the corner of West 71st Street and Columbus Avenue

332
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
And she was nice enough to

333
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
To say you know what forget for as long as we can

334
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Police why don't you take

335
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
The sublet

336
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
And so it was nine hundred and something dollars a month

337
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
And that apartment

338
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Really allowed

339
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Need to take that kind of risk

340
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
Sweet a 5 month old baby at the time

341
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Can you quit your job

342
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
Well I worked I worked while we plan seoul

343
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,743
Cycle we met we met in January and we open SoulCycle

344
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Ome

345
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
An integer husband really die

346
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Continue to have a job at the time

347
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
It was actually perfect

348
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
What time it gets heated just got a new job he just figured out a way to

349
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
We have this $900 a month Apartments

350
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
And I remember at the time

351
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Once we made the decision

352
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
SoulCycle

353
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
We got a bar credit

354
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
And on every Sunday night

355
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Spencer would have me an envelope

356
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
What's $200 in cash

357
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
And he would say here's your money for the week

358
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
And so I know I remember

359
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
How is my baby

360
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Folding up the

361
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
But the stroller and taking it on the crosstown bus and

362
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
You know Starbucks wasn't really an option I drink a lot of coffee at home and

363
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
All of those things it's

364
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
It's amazing

365
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
It's it's it's amazing how quickly $200 can go in New York City when you're walking down the street

366
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Everyday but but we did it we really

367
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
We we we did it because it was something that

368
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
We really had

369
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Well I really had

370
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Convection oven

371
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
And he's always been real

372
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
It is okay so Julie you

373
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
For a weekend

374
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Elizabeth did you did you guys have

375
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Any money

376
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,071
I had had I had bought a little studio apartment and I had recently sold at

377
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
I had about a hundred thousand dollars

378
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
And then Allen

379
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
My husband had a great job working at this Investment Bank

380
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
Cod Lehman Brothers

381
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
And so

382
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
I said am I said I really want to start this business

383
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
And he said I did I get it

384
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
If you want to do it I'll let you know

385
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Let's we can do it

386
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
So we took $250,000 and

387
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,879
And started and started SoulCycle with that

388
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
And we built the studio out inexpensively

389
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,071
We built a website in a reasonably inexpensively I feel like we got a lot done for 250

390
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
$2,000

391
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
And the worst thing that could happen was that in five years Julie and I could look at each other and say you know what we tried it and it

392
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Didn't work

393
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Yeah we would give it we would we would commit

394
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
To that.

395
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,151
So in that way didn't really feel like a huge rest

396
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
Yeah that's when you sign a five-year lease

397
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
What do you what do they want from you, do they look like

398
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Six months rent

399
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
I think we gave them three months security

400
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,511
And the rent on the on the studio is $5,000 a month

401
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Oh so that's

402
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Upper West Side New York

403
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
Well it was hidden in the rear Lobby

404
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
Former Mortuary so

405
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
A very fancy location

406
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
You sending them what like how

407
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Menu at the start of

408
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Get the bicycles and

409
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Get furniture in like

410
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
That must have taken

411
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Sometime right

412
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,623
It took a little time but it really didn't take that much time there wasn't a huge bill.

413
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Today which one is it

414
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
One of the things that we liked about the

415
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Space

416
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
And our front desk original front desk had no access to it so you either had to climb over it to get behind the front desk

417
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Or vice versa

418
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,239
Or you had to walk through the studio to get behind the front desk it was it was very

419
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
We don't we don't for maitreya

420
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,663
United and we had a we had a huge mural on the back wall that was referred

421
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
Vicodin the mirror that was a road probably Texas like one of those roads

422
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
It just goes straight into the horizon

423
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
And we thought that that was like a metaphor for the Journey of getting on the bus

424
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Oh and we planted some bamboo outside the window so then

425
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
In the press release we could write that we had exam guard

426
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
OIC

427
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
I forgot about the bamboo

428
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
And how did you come up with a name SoulCycle

429
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
It was matter of us

430
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
We have been thinking for a long time he has a lot of really bad names

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
See

432
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
They were not good

433
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
They were not going to

434
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
And I cannot

435
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Tina my husband eye Willy

436
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
I kept on describing that the

437
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,135
The feeling that I wanted to have when I was on the bike and when I got off the bike

438
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
And he got out of shower one day

439
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
What about Saul

440
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
What about SoulCycle

441
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
Yes yes it was like that you could have paid branding company under thousands of dollars he was just like shaving in the mirror

442
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
That's what happened

443
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Or do you even open the door

444
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
Liking this. Of time where you're like between when you sign the lease

445
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
And when you're building it out and building Ikea furniture and

446
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
Did the three of you like surround say

447
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
Cute we are going to French to ask me all over the

448
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,719
The country it's going to be massive like was that your ambition or was your ambition to just

449
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Make this one studio and see what happens

450
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
All three of us were ambitious I don't think

451
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Vicious but

452
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
When Elizabeth and I first saw the space we went across the street

453
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Starbucks in the business plan

454
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
In our business plan with it if we

455
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,871
We can see between 75 and 100. Julius always been a hundred

456
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
100 people

457
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,247
You know we brought them back of this afternoon which Elizabeth

458
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Has rained in Harrah

459
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
Is it true that if if we can see a hundred Riders a day

460
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
You know that we would have enough money to

461
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
You know pay our rent

462
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
To pay the minimal staff that we had to keep the lights on and have a little bit of money left over to pay for you know

463
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
People that were helping us raise our children

464
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
And that was really our goal

465
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
To explain something to me because

466
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Core SoulCycle

467
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
First

468
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
Spin cycle Studio

469
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
In the world that they existed not not

470
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Quite like that

471
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Do today but

472
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,271
What what was it that was going to make it

473
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Different

474
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
You talk about community and

475
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
And I get that but

476
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Specifically like

477
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Was the music going to be different

478
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
What is the lights going to be different what is the

479
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
The design the

480
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
Spirit house experience going to be

481
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
So different

482
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Fat people with half

483
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
To go to SoulCycle

484
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
I just need

485
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Well the first thing was that we were going to have to

486
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Technology so that people could

487
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
It was 2006

488
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,223
So the sounds crazy to talk about now but there were

489
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Very few booking apps

490
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,343
We found that in order to become part of someone's life

491
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
We had to help them plan their weeks

492
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,279
So we worked on this booking app you get on your computer at noon on Monday and you could sign up

493
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
For your class

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
Search for the week and then that way you would know what you had to look

495
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Forward to

496
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
The second part was the people who worked

497
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
At the front desk

498
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
Square trains to

499
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Remember your name to ask about your vacation to remember if you liked your water or room temperature

500
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Cold

501
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
We wanted people to cross the

502
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
The threshold of

503
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Studio

504
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,343
And feel like they had gone from

505
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,927
The crazy in a world of hustle that is New York City

506
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
And that they had walked into a place that

507
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Was fine that was a sanctuary and that was

508
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
The place that welcomed everyone

509
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Before you even opened up

510
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
How how did you determine what you

511
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Wood chart

512
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Did you look at like

513
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Did you look at like how many people you needed per day and rent in like how did you come up with the number and then what would initially were you

514
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Are you charging

515
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
We started at $27 a class

516
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
We thought about it as

517
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,647
To cocktails or inexpensive personal training

518
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Because we

519
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
We thought it was actually important

520
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
For people to pay for the

521
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
The class

522
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Because people value what they pay for

523
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
And if they pay for something then when they walk in the front door

524
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,495
And they participate they are going to bring something different than if they aren't paying

525
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,055
Forest and Julie what was the idea that there's like

526
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,943
Open the doors and put some balloons out and hope people come in or or Gigi how did you get even

527
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
Get people to know that this was

528
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Going to be there

529
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
So

530
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,440
We did a few things we we may postcards and we went door-to-door I remember pushing my baby carriage around the upper west

531
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Sidon

532
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
You know making friends

533
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
The doorman hoping they would let me in and put

534
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
Flyers in mail rooms in

535
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,936
Asking other business owners if we'll be okay if I left some postcards near their counters

536
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
Then we had one other plan

537
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Which was when we were all done building

538
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
The front desk and weed

539
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,128
Saved enough money so that we had enough of a run rate for a year

540
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:40,736
Elizabeth looked at me and said okay we have $2,500 left over what do you want to do for Market

541
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
We decided that we were going to make a t-shirt

542
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
The time people were just starting to come around to the concept of

543
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Swag

544
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,000
Only printed this yellow camouflage T-shirt with the logo of the wheel on it

545
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
Spider-Man said SoulCycle over it now remember

546
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
Taking the first t-shirt at about that bass and I looked at a lizard

547
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
I said you know one day is not even to need to stay Soho

548
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,056
SoulCycle it's just going to be like the Nike Swoosh people just going to know what it stands for

549
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
Can we were like yeah yeah that's definitely

550
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
We decided that we would make 202

551
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
And we would try to get in

552
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
250 you know coolest people in New York City to wear them so that there could become some sort of brand recognition

553
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
Looking back on it it's kind of funny to think that 250 of Anythink

554
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Make an impact

555
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,352
And so we put on cute outfits and we thought I told great today is the day that we're going to deliver the package

556
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
To the editor of Glamour

557
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
Thinking somebody is going to let us upstairs

558
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
Trey little little do we know that we would now spend the next

559
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Two weeks in car is getting

560
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
You know rerooted from

561
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Confront nail desk

562
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
The back Alleyway is where you're allowed to ask

563
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Drop off

564
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Packages that may or may not ever make it up

565
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Did you get guess you you're finally

566
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Get ready.

567
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,440
That's right April 26th 2006

568
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
And

569
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,792
I'll never forget the first time I took my parents

570
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,144
They came to the studio my my dad looked around and my mom sort of

571
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Open doors in

572
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,520
Antique under desks and my dad looks around he says to me no showers

573
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Who is going to come here

574
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
I live in this is not a battle worth fighting

575
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
When we come back

576
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Patchouli rice

577
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,648
And Elizabeth Cutler drew that no shower bike Studio into a big business

578
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
Why they sold it

579
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
And what it was like

580
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
Stay with us

581
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328

Welcome back to how I built this

595
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Stuntman PR

596
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
So it's 2006

597
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
And Elizabeth Cutler and Julie rice

598
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Just open their first

599
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
SoulCycle studio in New York

600
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,264
And I'm freezing a problem that many brick-and-mortar businesses face

601
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,848
Getting people on the street to actually take notice

602
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Come in

603
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Soda

604
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Julie Elizabeth

605
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
They had to get

606
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Creative

607
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Elizabeth auto rickshaw

608
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
On eBay

609
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,392
And she spray-painted the Rickshaw yellow and silver

610
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
And we will assign on it

611
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
It said SoulCycle with an arrow point

612
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
To the front door be

613
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
Because you put this on the on the sidewalk

614
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,168
On the sidewalk because you know we didn't have a sign and so is death if you know starting a business

615
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
New York City

616
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:45,824
Without the ability to use the density of the passer Byers on the street is sort of a disadvantage

617
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
And you did not have a sign because why

618
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Because we had signed our lease

619
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
We had sort of our landlord had pulled a bait-and-switch when he told us he had a sign he meant it would be on an interior door

620
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
In the rear

621
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,696
Exterior side of the building because the building would not allow

622
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
Correct with Landmark so we had no exterior signage and so you took a rickshaw and

623
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,424
SoulCycle this way and you can park it on the

624
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
China Wok

625
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
So we changed it up to a parking meter

626
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,944
We didn't and unfortunately the community board did not really like

627
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,344
The Rickshaw in the middle of every night so we would get a ticket for $65 a day for each day that the Rickshaw was chained up

628
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
Parking meter

629
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
But what we what we could we did was we we study the traffic

630
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Batteries outside

631
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,608
Because $65 a day was actually a lot to us you know some of your classes have nobody in them and some of them had two people that could be

632
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,960
You know the whole price of the earnings of what we made on on running a whole class and so

633
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,800
We learned that you know Saturday is it might make sense to put the Rickshaw out there because

634
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
They'll be a lot of traffic

635
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Walking by foot traffic

636
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Pek tune from Central Park

637
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,736
But maybe Wednesdays around lunch time on the upper west side not so busy not worth

638
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
$65

639
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,880
And so we would put out our marketing vehicle on days that we thought the returns would be

640
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
And

641
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,512
So this is a slow burn people are coming in

642
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
And I don't know what's like Julie was your husband like

643
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
You know

644
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm nervous

645
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Department

646
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
Stop making that much and

647
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
I know you quit your job like

648
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
Are you sure about this daddy

649
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Ever say that

650
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
Infairness

651
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
It was a Slow Burn

652
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,248
But the truth is in a note in business years

653
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
We started

654
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Cashflow pretty quickly

655
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Like how fast

656
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
Restart Cashland buy V

657
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
So we're positive cash flow

658
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,048
And we stay lean and you know we do we did all the jobs ourselves and we certainly weren't out there do you know

659
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,400
Buy expensive dinners but we definitely began to make money

660
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,752
And we also like keeping it lean because it allowed us to learn every job

661
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,104
So we put ourselves in the position of understanding how the website works

662
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Do you know what could work better there how the what was the

663
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,736
Functionality of somebody checking in

664
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,600
How was it for something what works cleanliness standards like how would have the bathroom.

665
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Look like

666
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,184
Are we just had to make sure we started doing checklist

667
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
To make sure that when there was downtime of

668
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
People are always doing things

669
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Because we're always do

670
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
So you are cash flow positive

671
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
5 months

672
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
IMS amazing

673
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
2 after

674
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
You know you start to see

675
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
People coming to classes in the classes filling up

676
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
It becomes apparent you got to open up a second

677
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Studio so what you do

678
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,552
Well we weren't quite ready to open up a second Studio but Julie had the idea to open a studio up in the Hamptons in the summer which way

679
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,440
Does a great idea at the tip of Long Island we were concerned about the summer

680
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,536
Though studios located in a residential area and we

681
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,888
Does you listen to your customers you hear them talking about what their summer plans are

682
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
We realized

683
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
A lot of people are going to be leaving

684
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
And we wanted to

685
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Captivate

686
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
Keep them captivated with the brand we don't want them to get distracted and get interested in something else

687
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
In New York City

688
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
A lot of people do my

689
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
22 East Ave

690
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Summer and

691
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
Simultaneously Elizabeth got a phone call

692
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
I'm from friends of ours

693
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
Who had said that they had heard

694
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
That there was this old barn

695
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
Butthead house an exercise Studio Buffet

696
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
Foreigners coming up for rent at summer

697
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
I was a legendary was body bark

698
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,520
People have gone there for 20 years and then somebody was doing pole dancing there one summer and that didn't really work on it was going to be available

699
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
And Elizabeth and I looked

700
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Said you know what

701
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
This is a three-dimensional Market

702
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Experiment

703
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,528
You know we had to rent houses out in out in the Hamptons to house our instructors in our staff we had

704
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
But on top of our rent

705
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,392
For the for the actual fitnessstudio to operate this thing

706
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
With our New York City organization and its

707
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Steak houses in rent cars

708
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
And I will live delete okay

709
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
The second floor for the first

710
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
So we didn't get the car and the houses until the 2nd

711
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,056
We were happy we were having employees in the upstairs or very Scrappy

712
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,152
SoulCycle Studio

713
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
In the Upper West Side you decide

714
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,784
Next summer summer 2017 open up in the Hamptons like

715
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
Did both of you just like constantly go back in

716
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Enforcing back and forth

717
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,744
We made a decision that the Elizabeth would spend a little bit more time out and run the studio out in in

718
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Bridgehampton

719
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
And I was going to come back and forth

720
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
We were actually talking today about how

721
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,728
I'm our retail operation actually exploded that summer and we had this

722
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
This older gentleman on the upper west side who basically printed you know

723
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,176
Buffet at a friend's birthday party and you want to print 10 t-shirts that said you know

724
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,064
Happy birthday that's the kind of printing he did but somehow we made him our printer because our quantities were very small in the beginning

725
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,368
And then slowly but surely people start

726
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,720
Fanatical about the soul cycle clothing and so we would Design One collection a month in

727
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,840
I remember I was going to Harvey's office on East on West 83rd Street had a cat that sat on his desk

728
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,240
Now it's a harvey you know I know that I only needed 50 but now I need 250 can you get them to me by you know Friday

729
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,640
And every couple weeks I would go back to quantities would increase and I would load up my car on Friday nights and bring them out

730
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,456
To the barn Bridgehampton with all the new merch

731
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,832
And we would we'd stay up late on Friday nights and we'd set up the merchandise and I would stay for the weekend

732
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:22,720
And then during the week Elizabeth would run the Hamptons studio and I would run New York and then we get back together on the weekends

733
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,632
I need to take a break from his interview just cuz I'm exhausted by the descriptions of the head

734
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:35,008
The studio New York the studio in the Hamptons you were making a line of clothing by the way who is designing

735
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Lakeshirts

736
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
It's just shirts Orlando

737
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
T-shirts and sweat

738
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
T-shirts and sweatshirts and hats and tote bags

739
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,320
When the leggings don't forget about the leg Incorrect and then we we branded leggings

740
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:53,696
And then we went to two sports bras and then after sports bras we went to athletic shirts and

741
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,024
I would say by the time the collections really got into full swing witch

742
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Probably about

743
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
34 years into

744
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
The business we were designing

745
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
65 to 125 SKU Zaman

746
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
Unbelievable

747
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
Essentially people are

748
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Hang you money

749
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
To advertise

750
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,992
I always say that the the merchandise at SoulCycle is almost like

751
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,832
Like having to buy the t-shirt from the best vacation that you've just been on

752
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
My mom still calls me when

753
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
She's somebody missile cyclist

754
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
I don't have the heart

755
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
Explain to her the tens of thousands of

756
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
People come to SoulCycle day

757
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
But yes my mother still calls me

758
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Thumbelina full cycle shirt

759
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,192
And so we went to when you opened up in Bridgehampton the summer of two

760
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
7

761
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
Was it also a slow-burner world two people know about it

762
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
What happened

763
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
Game changer

764
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
There wasn't much to do out in the Hamptons

765
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,784
And people thinking of all the kids are at camp and then people come out as if people are on vacation and

766
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,344
The adults needed something to do besides drink

767
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
And

768
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,208
So people would do what they did all day but in the morning everybody was

769
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,608
SoulCycle it started at 7:30 in the morning and it had ended at 2 in the afternoon and on the hour everybody was there

770
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
And that was

771
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
Profitable probably from day one

772
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,264
Day one and then after that we came back from that summer and

773
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
We had gone from being a neighborhood

774
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
Business to being a

775
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Full Citywide location

776
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,992
People were taking Subways up from downtown several times a week

777
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,808
People were really coming across the park

778
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,368
If we were like what what is going on and then

779
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
We would walk out because our studio was in the rear Lobby we would walk out and we would see the Town Cars and SUVs why

780
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Signed up for

781
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
Back-to-back-to-back-to-back and this is

782
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
Uber so no

783
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:42,240
Fancy people would have there that have their cars and drivers and all the cars and drivers were lined up

784
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
In front of SoulCycle in the neighbors are wondering what was going on

785
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
And

786
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
Everybody was there rioting and it was

787
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
So fun

788
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,272
A certain point I don't know if it was at this point but at a certain point

789
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
The original third partner Ruth

790
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
Leaves

791
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Why

792
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Why did she go

793
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,072
There's not much we can really say about it but what I can say about Partnerships is that

794
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,192
It's just really important that everybody has the same vision in the same work ethic

795
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
And

796
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,824
If you have those two things you fight a lot of battles and then

797
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,688
You know your struggle is not internal your struggle is more external and that's really where

798
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
You know that the focus

799
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Needs to be

800
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:31,136
And universe amazing teacher and she can hit as he tries for years and

801
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,304
Was that was that a heart was it hard for the two of you when when when I have my mink Julie she was your friend was it

802
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
Difficult at all

803
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
I think it was it was it was very early on in the business it was we don't need it only been open for

804
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
About a year

805
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,992
So it didn't it didn't feel so dramatic

806
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,392
The time business was very small and also she she stayed on for several years and continued

807
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Teach

808
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:10,816
Another really interesting thing is that you know after that happened Elizabeth and I kind of decided that we were going to

809
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
To really invest in our partnership

810
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Because we had

811
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
We had seen partnership not work

812
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
Doubt and I think that we

813
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Really felt

814
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
Like

815
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,360
The success of SoulCycle with a real combination of the two of us and so

816
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
Elizabeth found us

817
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
A business therapist coach

818
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,552
And I remember she called me one morning I didn't even know her that well we've been busy

819
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
Together for a little over a year and she said

820
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
You know I

821
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,488
I Googled in the middle of the night last night and I googled NYC life coach and I found somebody

822
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
We're going to start seeing

823
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Panda

824
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:47,936
Chuseok I'm not going to see anybody that you meant on the met on the internet

825
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Let me explain to you I am

826
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,056
A very relaxed person and at 11:50

827
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
85 on a Sunday night I'm having

828
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Fault

829
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,456
I get some help so I'm going to talk to her I'll let me see how it goes

830
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,784
If she's good maybe you'll be up for meeting her

831
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
And so and so that started us down this journey of

832
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
We have an amazing coach that we still work with

833
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
Today and

834
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
The person that we met on the internet first night we met on the internet

835
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,608
Wow and it was amazing was you know we really made a commitment at that

836
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Time to saying

837
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,704
You know there are going to be moments in this business when

838
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
You see it one way and I

839
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,360
I see it another way or you know you want to grow another five Studios and I don't want to or whatever it's whatever it is

840
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,480
But we are going to make those decisions together we're going to really communicate about them and

841
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
I think that

842
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
That was

843
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Ultimately one of

844
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,648
One of the things that I think made the business most successful with our dedication to our partnership

845
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
Okay so it eats I guess round 2008

846
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
And

847
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,840
You guys decide to open up another Studio New York in in Tribeca

848
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,448
I need this was 2008 this is the start of the recession so

849
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Where did you get that money

850
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah it was it was

851
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,128
Timing so a couple things happened one

852
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,480
I checked the bank account after Lehman collapse and I was

853
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Fleming Island

854
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Shenzhen

855
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,600
I was so proud of him cuz he had

856
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
He had sold

857
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
Then I went stuff invested he had sold it and so I was

858
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh my God there's money in the bank account it's so awesome because

859
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Julie and I

860
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
Need some cash to open Tribeca

861
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,168
And I want to borrow $600,000 and he was

862
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,544
I'm having the worst month of my life

863
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Are you kidding me

864
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,384
I said no I'm super not getting you offering to pay you

865
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Huge interest rate and you are going to let me that money

866
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
I tried to be honest with you I tried to get money from other places I had a friend that I grew up with it ran a private bank at one of the big

867
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
Big banks in New York

868
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,768
And it was after the collapse in the feds are funding these Banks and I said I need a credit line of $3000000

869
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
I can start with Millie but I need three

870
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
And they looked at me and they said okay well if you put up

871
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
For collateral

872
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Your apartment

873
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:03,360
And equities that equal the same value as the amount of the credit line then we will lend it to

874
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
I was so Furious

875
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
How dare you do that

876
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
A my taxes are funding you right now

877
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,368
I am not asking for that much money we are running 10 million dollars

878
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
Farm

879
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,280
Aren't all of our transactions through your bank and that you that is your message to me

880
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
And they said that is our mess

881
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,400
Once you have 60 million dollars of Revenue we can help you

882
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,776
I said by the time we have 60 million dollars of Revenue I will not need you I got up and left the room

883
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
It was a really stressful I was so mad

884
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,248
But that's what I that's actually when I called Alan and said

885
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Hey

886
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,928
I checked the bank account and I realized you have some cash in there and then we can probably do it for that but it was tight I mean we

887
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,256
When we open Tribeca we almost didn't make payroll we didn't have might we

888
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
Somebody called up to the office

889
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Jason said

890
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Oh my gosh

891
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,656
Elizabeth do you know we need to buy some toilet paper and

892
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
Credit cards aren't working

893
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
How much toilet paper do I have

894
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
Well we got about 20 rolls I'm like that's great will you better wait till tomorrow

895
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,712
But we never miss payroll and we always had toilet paper and

896
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
That part that part really were

897
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
Worked out well

898
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
Alright so you guys

899
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,880
In Spanish open up a couple

900
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Locations of New York

901
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
You're doing well

902
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Run 2010

903
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Competitors tried to come

904
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Including one

905
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Called

906
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Flywheel

907
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
And this was started by

908
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
Your former partner Ruth

909
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,336
You shocked by this to do to make you nervous to upset you

910
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
That

911
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
Well when flywheel opened and they were going to become

912
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Competitor in the

913
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Fitness space

914
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,624
I think rather than sort of freaked out about it which

915
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,232
Of course we did for you know the first year or so kind of monitoring the scene and what was going

916
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Yunnan

917
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,328
And there were some new bikes that were coming out there's a bunch of stuff coming out

918
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah it wasn't just that the time I think that you know

919
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
Milkweed we started of

920
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
Boutique Fitness Market Place in a lot of things were now coming into the market

921
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
People had

922
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
Going to be on just flywheel peep

923
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Other choices that they could

924
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Hindu Purp

925
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Paper class so

926
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,528
We were no longer the only option in that

927
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Marketplace

928
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
But we really we really took the opportunity

929
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
We talk to our coach

930
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
Only really took the opportunity to say to each other you know

931
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Who do we want to be

932
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
You know let's not react

933
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
You know we always did things that

934
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Many times

935
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
People thought we were nuts

936
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
To do that

937
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,360
But we always made the choices that felt good for us and I think we really just tried to keep our heads

938
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
Yeah I'm really curious about

939
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
The relationship between the two of you

940
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
China Grove businesses

941
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
The fraud and filled with tension and

942
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
But it strikes me that

943
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
That getting a coach

944
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,744
Like a kind of like a therapist

945
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
That you forced yourself to go and talk to together

946
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
Was kind of a key that that

947
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
That that really

948
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Help you guys

949
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Develop your leg

950
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,080
There's no question that it did I mean I think that

951
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:20,224
We also lived by this this one saying we only said to each other High Road Longview

952
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,296
Hi Road Longview we would never allow ourselves

953
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
Get down in the mud and get dirty we would

954
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
We went we would do that if something needed

955
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Was broken and needed

956
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
To be fixed

957
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
But once we did that

958
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,864
We really kept our eye on what was most important so

959
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
I think that that that's it that's

960
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Cheese fat

961
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,544
You know both of us decided matter

962
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
You have to remember

963
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
You know we actually weren't even the stars of this business we haven't really talked about our instructors yet

964
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
Who were the face of the company

965
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,856
So we were sort of we sort of thought let's build the stadium

966
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,928
Let's put these rock stars on the stage

967
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,072
Let's let them sort of the phases of and bask in the glory of and change these people's lives

968
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,632
That was really what we were doing we're building a

969
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,216
Brand we weren't in a we weren't in it for either of our egos

970
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
What's the point where

971
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
We really turned other people into

972
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
The faces of the brand

973
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,896
So I think it was around 2011

974
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
Pretty big steak to Equinox

975
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Status

976
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Future of high-end Fitness Company

977
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Why

978
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
Real thing going you were running it

979
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Did you leave

980
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
The further scale business

981
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
Yeah we felt like

982
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,656
To have someone to have a strategics

983
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
Play book

984
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Would be really valuable

985
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,288
We wanted to expand to the West Coast

986
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,151
And we felt that by being able to work with these guys that it would

987
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:58,015
It would allow us to do that and so we we did do a partnership with them in 2011

988
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,087
Let's just be frank at this point

989
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,439
Both of you are rich you know that you are going to have money and

990
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,255
Truly for you you didn't have

991
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
A whole lot of money was it

992
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,679
That must have been amazing to to know that you were going to be financially secure

993
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
Yeah that that first part of our sale

994
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
2

995
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Equinox was really

996
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
That that was life

997
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
Obviously for me and for

998
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
My family in

999
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,759
In a bit beyond what we could have ever imagined tonight

1000
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,855
I remember thinking you know the day that we actually got that wire to come through

1001
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,439
My kids are good and I ll remember

1002
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:42,303
Did the time that I was able to put them each in their own bedrooms and then each child having a bedroom in New York

1003
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
York City is a monumental

1004
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
It's a Monumental task

1005
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Sure

1006
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
And so yeah it was it was truly life

1007
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
How many SoulCycle

1008
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Studios are there

1009
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Today 88

1010
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
Couldn't have happened without

1011
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
Unsend messages

1012
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,479
It gave us the confidence to

1013
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
To do it

1014
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
The truth is

1015
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
Looking back

1016
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Yes we could

1017
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
Yes we could have done it

1018
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
But it really gave us

1019
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,279
The confidence to do it and sometimes that's what you need I mean I think that

1020
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,815
Listen people always say

1021
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Entrepreneurs are

1022
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
They're such good Risk Takers and

1023
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
And the truth is sometimes you do take a rest but Allah

1024
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
A lot of times it's really terrifying

1025
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
And we had a lot on the line

1026
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
2

1027
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
SoulCycle did it

1028
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
Expand

1029
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
But there

1030
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
I guess it was some tension after Equinox

1031
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Took over

1032
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,735
And eventually you both

1033
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Divested you you left

1034
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
The company

1035
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Today

1036
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Neither

1037
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
Neither of you are owners of

1038
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
SoulCycle

1039
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Correct

1040
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
You are not a piece of

1041
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
That's right that's

1042
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Is it weird

1043
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
Tok to walk

1044
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
Down the street SimCity and see a soul cycling

1045
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
I don't know that

1046
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,311
For me at every time I see a SoulCycle I still feel like

1047
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
It's a love child and I feel proud of

1048
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
I feel proud of the

1049
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:07,295
Of the energy that I know is contained in those rooms and what it what it does for the people who opt into that

1050
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Experience

1051
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
I will say

1052
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
That

1053
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,207
There are those who said to me when we were getting ready to

1054
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
To do our original deal in 2011

1055
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
You know selling a business is not like selling a child

1056
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
I mean

1057
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
Do you have children this is your business

1058
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
In a very detached

1059
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
And I will say that that is

1060
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,359
Supernatural I obviously didn't know back checking

1061
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,431
As to whether or not the person who said that

1062
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
It's me or the people who said that to me it ever started a bit

1063
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
Because it is a child

1064
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
In fact

1065
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
When we were

1066
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Funny story We Were

1067
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,279
People at 70 was coming to an early out in the distance and you should franchise

1068
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
And I looked at you in

1069
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
Are we already have

1070
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,935
For children between us how many children

1071
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
So we just

1072
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Kind of felt like

1073
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,847
SoulCycle each one of the studios was like a child and

1074
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
And I'm when we left

1075
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Sweet and we left a few

1076
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
Days of our heart there because

1077
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
That's what you do

1078
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
I think Elizabeth's right look

1079
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
I think that

1080
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
Somebody should write a book

1081
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
44 founders

1082
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
About what it is like

1083
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
2

1084
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
To sell their businesses you know it

1085
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
I think that there is

1086
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
Yeah there's there's definitely a morning.

1087
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
There's definitely

1088
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
There's definitely you know. Where you spend some money

1089
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:29,215
And then there's definitely. Where you begin to think about you know what am I going to do next

1090
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
For me

1091
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
I'm it still is a really

1092
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,359
Significant part of my day in my life meaning

1093
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,943
Moore's I was a customer than it is as somebody who founded the business

1094
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
I'm able to go there and sort of

1095
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Enjoy the product.

1096
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
We created for ourselves

1097
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,855
I'm curious cuz a lot of

1098
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
A lot of

1099
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,767
Very experienced and entrepreneurs listen to the show famous entrepreneurs but most people who listen are

1100
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
Starting out you know or there

1101
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
In the middle of

1102
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
The chi grinding away

1103
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,423
And

1104
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
Curious if you had to go back

1105
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
2 mm

1106
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
And you had a crystal ball what you said

1107
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,663
Let's try to just do this on our own and not bringing any

1108
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Investors let's let's keep bootstrap

1109
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,599
I mean if there were two alternate universes I would certainly play that out

1110
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,879
But on the other hand

1111
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,695
You know we never forget why we started the business and

1112
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,535
Like we said we we really started the business to

1113
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,655
Create an environment for people that was like the secular sanctuary

1114
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,215
People could feel safe coming in there and they could

1115
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,311
Berner cheesecake from the night before or the tap into some

1116
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,407
Something tribal on that bike and that was why we did it we never ever ever forgot why

1117
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
We did that

1118
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
Sure would have been

1119
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
Interstate Econo play that out but

1120
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
The thing is on the other hand

1121
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
The way that it did work out we

1122
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
We still got it

1123
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
To do all those things

1124
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,207
Baby must be weird to go from

1125
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
Dislike fast-paced like

1126
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Really

1127
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,863
No special your co-ceos you to staff your people around you play Everyday

1128
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Second day was scheduled

1129
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,727
It was a teen that was energy and then like one that you wake up

1130
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
Xiamen airlines

1131
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Having coffee with

1132
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Kitchen in your life

1133
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
Play cuz it wasn't like that

1134
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,967
Well we're busy still I mean you know we tried

1135
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
Catch our breath of Denton

1136
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
We we actually remember Saint Elizabeth

1137
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
Set them on the day that we made the decision to

1138
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
I said okay but you have to make sure that we get an office

1139
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Together

1140
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:30,559
So at least I know that we're going to have two computers and sticky notes and we can have a place to meet in the morning and I can do this

1141
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
As long as we know that

1142
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
Somewhere there's an office where we have to desk

1143
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,447
Twitter side by side we did it we took an office

1144
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,519
And there was definitely something psychological

1145
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,079
About sort of knowing that there was a

1146
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,151
Place where would that we could touch base with which with each other every

1147
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,479
And I think I think we're kind of just coming up for air right now

1148
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
I think it helps

1149
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,319
But for the first time it's like the two of us can look at each other and

1150
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Kind of

1151
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
You know it's like you're at your eyes adjust to the light a little bit differently weird

1152
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,487
Coming conversation this morning about how much the world has changed

1153
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
What what do you think the world needs now

1154
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,607
Is you know I asked this question

1155
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,167
Everyone come to the show and I want somebody truly

1156
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
How much of what happened

1157
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
With your cycle do you think is because of

1158
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
Your intelligence in your skill and how much

1159
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Because you

1160
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Just got lucky

1161
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
It's interesting you know and thinking about the neck

1162
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,783
Time around now that you know so much it turns out that

1163
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
The lesson that I would help

1164
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
People live in ignorance is actually Bliss right

1165
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,207
We made so many decisions we made so many mistakes but we just kept

1166
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,743
Keep going because we didn't know any better

1167
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:37,887
Now you know how to look at all those Excel spreadsheets and p&l and all that stuff and you can make yourself crazy but I think it's

1168
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,655
Time

1169
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
You know what we didn't know helped us

1170
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
And weed

1171
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
Trust in our God and we went

1172
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:49,151
And I don't think anything about it was lucky I think the only lucky thing with Elizabeth and I bumped into each other

1173
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:50,943
Elizabeth

1174
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
I mean how do you

1175
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Outback

1176
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
David on top

1177
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:04,511
I think it was lucky that I got time that we got to meet each other at I got to meet Julie and then she got to meet me I think it was lucky that we got

1178
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Houses in

1179
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,911
Incredible writers who inspired us every day and get to work with people that we loved and

1180
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
It was extremely high touch

1181
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
We always had our office

1182
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
Is attached to Studio we never

1183
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
Using the product then

1184
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
I meant I think

1185
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
You know that kind of effort

1186
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
That we would that we brought to it created

1187
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
I guess you could call it like a certain kind of

1188
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:32,671
Cumulative magic that happened over the years that everybody participated in and created

1189
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
Elizabeth Cutler and Julie rice

1190
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815

00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,687
Elizabeth says that her husband said give her a hard time about opening a cycling Studio

1198
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,759
Even the SoulCycle really started to take off

1199
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
He still had his doubts I could tell he was getting mocked at work because one day he comes home and he's like

1200
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463

Time now for how you go back

1229
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
And today story starts

1230
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
About 7 years ago

1231
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Columbia South Carolina

1232
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Gabby Goodwin was

1233
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
About 5

1234
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
And everyday

1235
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
She went through the same routine

1236
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,639
Mama will put Pigtails in my hair

1237
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,199
And for every pigtail that was in my hair

1238
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,783
There was plastic barrettes on every single one of them

1239
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,855
I think you know Gabby talking about and usually

1240
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
She had one of these plastic barrettes in

1241
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
10 / pigtails

1242
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:47,839
But me when I was little I will be running around at school and my mom would pick me up and my hair will be

1243
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,727
I would say in what happened to your bones like what were you doing

1244
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,543
Pep Boys in courses Gabby's mom Rosalyn

1245
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Really

1246
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,151
Set up that her daughter's Brett's kept coming over hair

1247
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
One day

1248
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Roslyn

1249
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,783
Actually went on Twitter to complain about it just to blow off

1250
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:13,183
Christine I didn't think anybody would respond I got off Twitter came back on and probably about an hour and had all of these respond

1251
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Bosses from Mom

1252
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,351
Who felt the same way all these mom saying yes our daughters barrettes are falling out to

1253
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,167
Emma wasting tons of money replacing them

1254
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
The Roslyn wasn't necessarily looking to solve this

1255
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,567
This problem she was working full-time as a healthcare Lobby

1256
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Austin

1257
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
She has no interest in

1258
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
Starting a business

1259
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
But

1260
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
A couple weeks later as I was

1261
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,527
Styling Gabriel's Hair I mumbled under my breath

1262
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,903
Somebody needs to make a bowl and she jumped out of the seat and said Mommy

1263
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,231
Are we going to make a bow until every single day after that

1264
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,023
Gabby would ask Rosalind

1265
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Same question

1266
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
When my phones coming when I'm at those coming when are we going to make a bowl

1267
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
So trifling figured okay since Gabby is so into it maybe we can just do this as a kind of

1268
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,199
Work on a design for a buret and see if we can make

1269
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Chest

1270
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
One just one threat

1271
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,319
The first aid Reddit design

1272
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
Two-Face

1273
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,695
So you could see a pretty decoration no matter which way the buret was turned

1274
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
In each case

1275
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Has teeth

1276
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Annie's critters

1277
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,839
To trap and gather the hair

1278
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,631
So you're basically creating this

1279
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
Sandwiching mechanism

1280
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
To make sure the hair

1281
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
It doesn't slip out of hair

1282
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,311
Tourism looks at this design and she's thinking

1283
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,871
This isn't half bad maybe

1284
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,223
Maybe we can make a prototype so she gets the number of a couple of Engineers

1285
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
End

1286
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
She calls him up

1287
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,343
You can just kind of hear them sigh like oh God

1288
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,903
Can I sit me up listen you got 15 minutes

1289
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,487
Is it good to meet with these guys in North Carolina and it first

1290
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,791
Things do not go well

1291
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:58,399
The engineers are looking at the sign of a hair clipping not getting it

1292
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
And I said well you know what

1293
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,495
I'm going to run to my car and I'm going to go

1294
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
In my backseat

1295
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,639
Promise you there's a standard burette that is falling off Gabrielle's Hair

1296
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
And sure enough

1297
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
@doug in the backseat of my car

1298
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
Founder Standardbred

1299
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,623
Brought that back in at that point Roslyn use the mannequin to demonstrate how easy

1300
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,439
Standardbred just fall out of your hair

1301
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,023
And how her and Gabby's design works a lot better

1302
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
As soon as I did that

1303
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,607
A light bulb went off

1304
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,143
Playset ma'am

1305
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
You think you're onto something

1306
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
So these two engineers

1307
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
Weed to help her make the Prototype

1308
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,823
It had a manufacturer in China

1309
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
They made an initial run

1310
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
500 Bose

1311
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
And in early 2014

1312
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,503
Roslyn and Gabby put them up for sale on their website

1313
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
And in like

1314
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
20 minutes

1315
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,391
They get their first order we can offer sale and we're like

1316
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
This is actually happening like

1317
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Oh my God we're business

1318
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
And they sold out all 500 barrettes

1319
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Pretty quick

1320
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:03,167
Aliso Rosslyn and her husband took out a few loans to fulfill more orders

1321
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,703
In last year

1322
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
They became profitable for the first time

1323
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
With over $100,000 in Revenue

1324
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,687
Gabby is not 12 years old and is the CEO of Gabby bows

1325
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,759
And even goes around the country sometimes giving talks

1326
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
About how to be a kidpreneur

1327
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,879

00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
