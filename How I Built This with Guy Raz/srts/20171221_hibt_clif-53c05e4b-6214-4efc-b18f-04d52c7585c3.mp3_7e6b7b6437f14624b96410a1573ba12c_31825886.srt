18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,424
I left that morning for the office knowing that's the day and I was

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Sitting in the office waiting

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,336
Heard was on the phone talking to the lawyers you know. Ended on the eyes and crossed

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
Cities on the contractors that day you're you're you're about to go and sign your name on the contract

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
That very day

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,856
Like within an hour We're we were ready to get in the car and go over

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,952
And I said I got to take a walk around the block

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,816
And so I did I went out to the parking lot and

26
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Just started weeping

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
You couldn't even want to do it

28
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
Ramen PRP is how I built this a show of innovators entrepreneurs idealist

30
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
I got a show today

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,448
Dad's first name to create Clif Bar what are the most popular energy bars in the country

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
Energy bar with something you shut down your throat before running

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
A marathoner going skiing a whole aisle of Laura Luna and chia bars

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Supermarket

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
And they weren't in the bottom of our backpacks are in the glove compartment of our cars

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
In around that time the late 1980s

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,216
Gary Erickson was living in the Bay Area he was one of those guys who would inhale energy bars

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,032
Right before a climbing or racing his bike

39
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,104
And also the time he was working at a bicycle

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
Which was fine

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
For a little while I think

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
All along I even through high school I think I always wanted to have my own business and even though managing

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,744
A manufacturing facility make your bicycle seat supposed felt close to have my own business and it wasn't my own business

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
And then

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Crazy thing happen

46
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
That was my mom's

47
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
Kitchen table and she was serving me this

48
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
My mom's Greek and my grandmother's Cragin

49
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
They taught me how to bake a young age in my my

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
Mom is serving me something was like a calzone and we called a Greek calzone

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
And I looked at that and I said

52
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
You know I bet I could sell these

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
And so here I am of God

54
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
I work for the bicycle company and racing by his clothes and now I'm going to start a business

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,512
So we made a few in her kitchen I went out to some delis around Berkeley and San Francisco and

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
People will pick them up but what's inside of them

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
So we had different feelings

58
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
The typical Greek filling the spanakopita which is a spinach and feta cheese

59
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
They were really delicious

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
This wonderful brioche

61
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
What kind of dough

62
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
But

63
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
When I started this business I needed

64
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
To keep working so cuz I

65
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Didn't have enough money size funding the business

66
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
With the bicycle

67
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Tow company

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
2 fun

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
The small bakery that

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
I started called Kellie Sweets & savories with

71
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Which was named after my grandmother

72
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
So at night you would like

73
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,584
The baking like all through the night and then get up in the morning and then let go work in the factory likes

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Exact exact

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
And then one day in 1990

76
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
I was out on a

77
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
A ride with

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
A really good friend

79
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
We did this one long day trip in the Bay Area

80
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
Is 175 mile one day ride we thought it was going to a hundred

81
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
25 MI

82
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
And we took along with us

83
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
6 energy bars are on the market at the time the only energy bar really

84
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
That was on the market at that time that

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
So many cycles for eating does power bar

86
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
And they were also

87
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Coincidentally

88
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
And so

89
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
We reach pack 6 of them

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Pythor banana near to Andre

91
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Did this ride where there was very few stores and

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
When were at the top of

93
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
Mount Hamilton I didn't five of those

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Bars NEARBY

95
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
And I looked at the six month I just said no way

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
I can't I can't do one more

97
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
I would rather starve than eat another one

98
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Why

99
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Latest dare hard

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,975
They were they never really did taste good but we always as bike races we always thought of them as the bitter pill

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
They do the job but

102
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
It's not about taste

103
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
And here I have a baker

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Free and everything we do taste great

105
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
We're riding down the hill or coasting down into San Jose to go

106
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Get to a 7-Eleven

107
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
And I turned my friend Janice said you know what I can make a better energy

108
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
That was it

109
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
That wasn't me that was it and how was it

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Literally the next day

111
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
I call my mom

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
And she had help me with all these rats

113
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
It's for the bacon

114
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Mom I'm coming over and we're going to make

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
And energy

116
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
She's like what's an energy bar

117
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
Try to explain it to her and I said it's kind of like that great oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookie that you make but we can't use butter we can't

118
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
You sugar we can't use oil

119
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Chisel that's him

120
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
I said well let's just try so for the next 6 months

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
I brought over

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Bags of

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
Ingredients that I have been researching on

124
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
And we're not talking about

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
Exotic ingredients were talking about whole ingredients cuz PowerBar was

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Made with

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Stuff that

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
Was more kind of Highly produced and highly refined

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
And

130
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
I wanted to be more like my mom's cookie

131
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
What kind of ingredients are you using

132
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
We were using whole oats

133
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Real fruit

134
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
And a sweetener

135
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
We didn't use oil

136
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
Or better but we use a sweetener that was made from rice

137
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,127
And we met I met him in a rectangular so they were like a bar and wasn't going to be a cookie and had to be like a bar

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
And

139
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
We've had many failures

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
And at times you tried to talk ourselves into that this is great and it then I would

141
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Bring it out to my friends in

142
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
Plastic bags that I was racing with and training with

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Nice to hear try this but keep it a secret

144
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
And they be like who this

145
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Terrible

146
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Okay

147
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Go back to the kitchen

148
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
At what point did you

149
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Do you say okay I've got this

150
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
Think we got it so it was after about six months

151
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
I was

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Sampling

153
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
Continue to sample it but we just knew my mom and I just knew like

154
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
Okay this is what we were looking for

155
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
And then you take a risk

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
You're not sure

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
And then you put a package around it

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
And that stories

159
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,623
You know what another real good friend that I was working with name Doug Gilmour in a week

160
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
I help them out with somebody advertising for the bicycle company and I knew that you was

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
Very very creative

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Person

163
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
I said you need to design the package

164
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
And

165
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
She came up with

166
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
The climbing image

167
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Which is now

168
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Nephrosis iconic

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
And has a very

170
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Deep meaning of

171
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
You know what that the introspection of climbing and

172
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Especially an overhang the wait is yeah

173
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Then we needed a name for it

174
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
And they're all kinds of names were where

175
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Where

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Considering

177
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
He wanted it to be Gary bar I didn't

178
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
And one day I was

179
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Crescent

180
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
Does the Bay Bridge coming over to work on it with him and

181
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
My dad's name popped into my head

182
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
I'm picking

183
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
That makes sense I name the bakery after my grandmother

184
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
I can name this after my dad he's the one that influenced me

185
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,775
With the Great Outdoors this is about the outdoors this is about this is a connection with adventurous

186
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
You know taking it on the go

187
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
When you are Outdoors you and your adventures

188
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
Any perfect sense

189
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,063
And so we made a Clif Bar after my dad my dad's name is Clifford Erickson

190
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
Once you have the bar down the recipe down

191
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
How do you even have the money the resources to

192
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
Turn this into a business

193
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Product that you were going to like put your whole life

194
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,775
I never ever would have thought it's turned into it has but all I was thinking was

195
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
I've got this Bakery

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,687
I can figure out how to make this if I can just take a small market share from power bar then I can

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
Continue my lifestyle and have the freedom of my own business

198
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,647
And do something that I love to do which is both run a business and make a great product

199
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
And that's that was easier said than done

200
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Why is that

201
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
So

202
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
We

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Try to make it in our Bakery we just didn't have the equipment

204
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
To do it

205
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
So I found a bakery down the street

206
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Dad agreed to help me

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Produce it like a like a mom

208
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Like a cookie bake

209
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
And we

210
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Leverage

211
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,943
The packaging companies and said

212
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Will pay you

213
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
Will make a small run will give you what we can

214
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
And

215
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
When we sell the first

216
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Amount will pay you

217
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
I mean back then I didn't really you know whatever

218
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
I was doing I was

219
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
I didn't learn this in college

220
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
And maybe it's a good thing I didn't learn this in college cuz I wouldn't have done it this way but I just started thinking out loud like how am I going to do

221
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
I have no money

222
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
So basically

223
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
You went to these

224
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
To the bakery you said I'm not going to be able to pay you right away

225
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
But then you would turn Rancid

226
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Distributors in USA look

227
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Can you pay me on delivery

228
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
And then use that money to

229
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Pay the

230
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
Once you start a manufacturer

231
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
Clif bars like how did you even get

232
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Anyone interested in them

233
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
You do did you like walk around or just shops

234
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
Saint stores in a couple things one is

235
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Would go to

236
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Bike races

237
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
Or went to running events

238
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
I just started passing out the bar

239
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
We did one ad

240
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
One advertisement

241
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
In bicycle magazine and a few other maggie's

242
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,615
That was pretty hard-hitting

243
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
I guess power bar just like

244
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
Okay there's a new kid on the Block kind of thing

245
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Now the title or the headline was

246
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
It's your body you decide

247
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
So did you want

248
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
You want refined ingredients or do you want whole ingredient

249
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Pictures of both ingredients

250
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
That cause

251
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Has to be sued immediately

252
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Oh wow

253
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Car insurance picked up the

254
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
The tab and we ended up settling with tar bar

255
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,543
But it created this buzz in the bicycle industry where people said have you heard of Clif Bar

256
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
I don't think I don't know if you could pull that off now

257
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
And we were the

258
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
You know now there's

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Hundreds of bars out

260
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Just us and Them

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Did you have to

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Like go out and raise money that you have to ask

263
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
People to invest

264
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
In the company or were you able to do

265
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
To do

266
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Somehow do it with very little money

267
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
You know I never thought of

268
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,887
Either looking for outside money or wanting outside money and maybe that was

269
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
A good thing if my knee naivete because

270
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,031
What you do that you know you lose control of your destiny

271
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
I tried to get a bank on my

272
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
I did

273
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Get a $20,000

274
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
My father gave me

275
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Office credit card $20,000

276
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
But most of it

277
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
Man I look back and I kind of think how did I pull this off

278
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Because

279
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
And it wasn't big

280
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Yeah this was just

281
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
A few bike shops in a few natural food stores

282
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
And

283
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Yeah I remember being at a show like that

284
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,655
Marathon LA Marathon setting up a little table

285
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,263
And standing out there in the aisle with a tray of cut up bars and

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,895
And if people walk by say try to try this new energy bar and they were like no no no I've had energy

287
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
I'll come on just try it

288
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
And they try and then they would walk along and they wouldn't want to look back

289
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Lyrica. You know

290
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
Did my embarrassment and then

291
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
32 minutes

292
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Turn around

293
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Come right back. What is that

294
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
And I knew I knew you had it then when

295
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
You saw that kind of response

296
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
And so the

297
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
It was Word of Mouth

298
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
And the word spread throughout the country

299
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
So what happened in that first year after you

300
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Like like

301
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
I mean we were still

302
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Working at the bicycle company

303
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Yeah I was working the bus company for 2 more years still in it and I was using that money to as living hand-to-mouth in

304
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
No sleeping in the garage

305
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
And I was just using that money

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
To also fun

307
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You know some of the extra bills

308
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
And then there was a Tipping Point

309
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
By the end of 1992

310
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
We sold $700,000

311
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,887
So you were making money within a year

312
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
I'm probably year-and-a-half

313
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
2 we really started

314
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
We started making

315
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Hand

316
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
From there on it was

317
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
It was like a wild toads like a

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,735
Getting on a wild horse and hanging on we almost double tails for the next eight years in a row

319
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
You basically were the owner of the company right like did you

320
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,183
Did you make any mistakes by that point where you just sailing on was it like Smooth Sailing

321
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
No

322
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
One of the larger mistakes was

323
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
You know I caught a handshake deal with the time I

324
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Didn't use

325
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Corporate counsel very very effectively

326
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Back.

327
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
You know what is vertu expensive

328
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
So I didn't really use a lawyer so I did a handshake deal with it

329
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Distributor

330
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
In the early 90s

331
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
Where it ended up biting me

332
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Because

333
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
They weren't performing and so I cancelled

334
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Quote contract

335
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
And they came back and sue me for under

336
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,719
Too long of a story but it but it ended up we went to court

337
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
We settled in

338
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
It cost

339
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
A lot of money

340
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
I made a big mistake I never should have done a handshake deal on a distribution

341
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
International distribution deal like that

342
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
You almost lost the company

343
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
It yashow it was

344
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
It was a knockout dragout

345
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Fight in

346
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
I

347
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
That was the most sick to the stomach

348
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,223
I had felt up to that point about business

349
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
One day when I we went to we went to mediation and I

350
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
At the end of mediation.

351
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Oh my God I could lose this whole thing

352
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,487
So we fought we fight we negotiated it ended up being just pay him off

353
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Cost a lot had to go get a bank loan

354
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
I went and visited like five or six Banks finally found one at a party

355
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
This guy talked to me and said yeah

356
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
I'm on

357
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Tristan we went to visit with him and

358
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
They gave us the loan

359
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
And we paid it off in a few years

360
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
And then we're free

361
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,479
How did you like Coke without emotionally mentally like you had to run your company and you are fighting off

362
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
This other company that was trying to take you over

363
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
I I think I've learned a ton

364
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,207
With other things I've chosen to do in my life like rock climbing

365
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
My friend uses the term sharp end of the row

366
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Which means when your rock climbing

367
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
You're either leading or following

368
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
And when you're leading are on the sharp end of the road

369
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,287
You could take a pretty big fall and I had done a lot of leading in my life on

370
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
In rock climbing

371
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
And I wouldn't you I was used to being in that

372
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Position of

373
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Facing danger but being able to stay composed

374
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
The weird thing is actually climb better when I'm on leave then

375
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Phone

376
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
And I'm still trying to figure out that

377
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
How that metaphor works but it

378
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,231
Cuz you are you're in more danger if you're leading but I think I'm more focused when I'm

379
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
And so

380
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,839
I was on this big lead now I've got this

381
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Lawsuit

382
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,447
I got the company drawing of got all the manufacturing issues and

383
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Collections Bubba

384
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
But I think

385
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Because that I was so focused

386
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
Nothing was going to stop me except something did Alma

387
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,623
Stop it and offer Gary Erickson and almost couldn't refuse it with this guy Roz

Garage

417
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
Okay let's fast-forward a bit this is now

418
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
The year 2000

419
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
What about 8 years after a Clif Bar has large Den

420
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
It's doing incredibly well it's got a growing staff

421
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
Almost 40 million dollars in sales

422
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
And I should mention Gary Erickson has a partner in this venture

423
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
Beach have 50% ownership in

424
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Company

425
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
And something else is going on at the same time

426
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Big food corporations start to get into the game

427
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Competitors

428
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Empire Barbers already

429
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
Already sold and balance bars sold so it's just

430
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
It was kind of just us

431
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Is the third

432
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
As a third

433
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
So we got approached

434
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Bye

435
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Travel companies

436
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
And

437
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
In a very uncharacteristic I kind of

438
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
Untied from the Rope

439
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Abby non-lead and said

440
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
All right

441
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
I guess this is what you do

442
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
What do you mean what happened

443
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
We

444
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,031
Tired investment banker I mean long story short with her investment banker to put the company up for sale

445
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,615
Instead of us talking to companies which hire somebody to talk to companies and

446
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,479
It was an odd moment I can remember the exact moment that I got a call from my partner

447
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
She said I want to sell the company

448
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
All right

449
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
So

450
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
There we were we

451
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
But the company up for sale

452
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
And started traveling all over the

453
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
All over the country

454
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Visiting

455
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
These large companies that wanted us to be part of their portfolio

456
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,471
And we got an amazing deal from one of the large companies are we got to do we got an offer for

457
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,055
$129 on $49 in sales on Quaker Road

458
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
I guess you heard

459
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
So you guys are sitting at the table

460
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Quaker Oats as

461
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
120 million baht

462
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Foxes in mm

463
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
He that meant you would have gotten 60 million

464
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
60 million

465
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
And you could walk away

466
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
And like

467
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
Did you seriously I mean you are seriously thinking about doing this

468
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
More than serious

469
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
We

470
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Had

471
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
The deal

472
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Essentially done

473
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
On April I know the date April 17th 2000

474
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
We were going to meet our investment banker

475
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
The people from

476
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
Quaker and as well as all the lawyers to sign the deal

477
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
And I would have been at

478
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,903
And we have told the company what we're doing till all the employees and they trusted us

479
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
It was a naive

480
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Nice thing to say that things wouldn't change

481
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
But I still said it

482
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
And it was not true and I knew it wasn't true

483
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Corset

484
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
It's going to change

485
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
It could be better could be worse but

486
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
You can't say

487
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Change it

488
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Yeah

489
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,127
And so I left that morning for the office knowing that's the day and I was

490
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Sitting in the office

491
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
Waiting

492
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
My partner was on the phone talking to the lawyers you know.

493
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
Donnie Isaac Ross

494
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Maggie's on the Contracting

495
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
She was she was ready to sell

496
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Absolute

497
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
It was done deal

498
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
And her in her eyes

499
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Could weight be

500
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Because she was very fearful of the future

501
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
And understand that to some degree but

502
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
Why would people walk away from buying our products

503
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
If

504
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
We didn't

505
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Sell the company

506
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,103
I never said I was for the three months that we were selling the company I was just living in the dark

507
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
I was not sleeping well I was not riding my bike I was

508
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
Probably not very fun to be around

509
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
And I said I just

510
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
I was fighting it

511
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
You're internally but not really

512
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,975
Picture of a counselor and talked about it probably would have gotten to that point

513
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
But there was and I started I started to

514
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Have that

515
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
An amazing moment of just shake

516
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
I'm shaking right now is thinking of

517
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
Will you add that day your your your about to go and sign your name on the contract that very

518
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,247
Like within an hour We're we were ready to get in the car and go over

519
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
And

520
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
I said I got to take a walk around the block and so I did I went out to the parking lot and

521
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
I just started weeping

522
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
You couldn't even want to do it

523
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
They want to do it

524
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
I guess it's like

525
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Noah walking

526
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Kilt

527
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
I mean this was everything that you built right

528
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
Yeah this was

529
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,015
This was I put everything that this is my this is my life and this our employees and this is my family is named after

530
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
My dad

531
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
So what did you

532
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
What did you do what did you tell your partner

533
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
So halfway around the Bloc

534
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
I decide not to self company and then I felt completely free

535
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Is like

536
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Oh my God I'm free again

537
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,632
Now I had to go back around the rest of the block and forgot what I was going

538
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Inside my partner

539
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,776
And I told her she's on the phone I said you can you need to put phone down

540
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Tuna sandwich

541
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
And she knew immediately when I said that

542
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
That I was serious

543
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
And so

544
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
She was on the phone with the lawyer she said

545
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
We're not selling it.

546
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
She's in the room with all these

547
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
People

548
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,976
On the 30th floor of the Comerica building.

549
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Deals off

550
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
So

551
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Now

552
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
I'm in a new situation where

553
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,776
I got it now go back and convince our people that we're not selling the company and that it's going to be okay

554
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
We told him he couldn't do without selling and now we're going to know I'm saying we can

555
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Secondly

556
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
My partner wanted out so I had to negotiate a deal

557
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,784
Until that was 7 months of negotiation and

558
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
And third was added as

559
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Our attorney says Dialing for Dollars

560
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
I had to go find

561
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
$69

562
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Ua256 $2000000

563
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
2

564
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Basically by your partner

565
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,680
Because that's what you were offered to her argument was look that's what it's worth

566
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Exact

567
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
So

568
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,824
I mean just think that you don't want to have to deal with as you're growing your business cuz

569
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,128
We were growing like crazy yeah

570
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Sonoco share this deal

571
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
And

572
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
Decided that I would

573
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
Try to meet with the entire company every week

574
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
And hold a meeting

575
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
Two so that I could be in front of them

576
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
So they could see me every week saying we are not selling the company cuz they were convinced this is going to be a short-term deal and then I would go back

577
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
And sell the company and

578
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
I got calls from like

579
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,568
Private Equity groups that they heard what happened there like you are out of your mind you're never going to make it

580
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
You're going to get your never going to make it if you didn't have the debt and I have $69 with Dad and did you do things.

581
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,832
Did you ever think like maybe they're right maybe I'm not going to make it maybe I'm crazy like what am I doing

582
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,416
I must have been serving some good Kool-Aid at the at the office could people

583
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Started believing that we have to do it

584
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
And it took us nine years to pay off that thing and we did it

585
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Play nighttime Gary like

586
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
You could have

587
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,640
Taking the money and then like how this Charmed Life

588
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Fan bike

589
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Fish Den

590
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Start a foundation and just kind of like

591
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,576
Gitana conferences and just given toxin

592
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
But there was something like what

593
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,488
What was the thing that prevented you from doing that from because that would that would have been an easier

594
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Route you would have in the quality of your life

595
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
Like the things you can buy and own and Waco to live would not have been so

596
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Substantially different

597
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
The Way You Lie

598
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Live today

599
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
True to it would probably the same

600
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Well obviously wasn't about money

601
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
There is

602
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
There is something deep about

603
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
You know wanting to

604
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Grow this business

605
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
And

606
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
I mean I think my wife has

607
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Very well you know what

608
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,464
It's the popular the power of yeah the power of a lot of money could be good you could

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Don't need a lot of money to start a foundation

610
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
But the power of

611
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
A business

612
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Done the right way

613
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Is way more powerful than

614
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
To rich people

615
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
I don't want over to say that because

616
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,336
You know there's people that are doing some great things but yeah

617
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,736
As the company has grown be gone from 60 to 400 employees now you know our community service program Malone

618
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
Contribute over 10,000 hours of community service last year we couldn't we can't do that as two individuals but we can is a

And the growth of the company

636
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,584
Yeah I'm just so happy that he did get to experience it for a very long time he was from Door County Wisconsin he would go to

637
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632

00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Successful entrepreneurs are like

652
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
Single-mindedly focused

653
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
On the goal

Stick on in a

Believe in themselves

656
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
And have very little or no self.

657

Is that does that characterize you did you ever have

Did you ever

660
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
Did you ever have sleepless nights about what would shiver think what am I doing

661
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
I doing the right thing

662
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Or were you just like totally focused and and

663
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Confident in what you were doing and

The ladder

666
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
I can't remember a day where I didn't believe

667
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
And we would get through anything

668
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
I don't know where that all

669
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
I'll come

670
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Comes from

671
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
I don't

672
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
No that's

673
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
That unique but

674
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,656
And I do think

675
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Back to Summer

676
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
The

677
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Adventures that I

678
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Chosen to do

679
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,080
You know I'm not I'm not a super high risk

680
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
Person I don't believe in

681
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
I believe in climbing with a rope

682
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
But I do think it teaches you a lot

683
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,064
Because I remember years ago I climb the face of Half Dome and

684
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
I never once thought I was going to make it up

685
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
That face

686
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
It was just I was tapping her I call Happy nervous

687
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
I was nervous and

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
I was happy at the same time

689
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
There is no doubt we're going to make

690
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Enough for a second

691
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
That anything would stop

692
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
What's for doing that mess just one of many

693
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

710
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
I know for how you built that and today were upsetting story we first ran last February featuring

711
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,968
Alec avedissian who had the idea

712
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
While he was working at

713
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Surfing in a fishing Village in El Salvador

714
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,672
And one of my friends that was living in the community actually showed me the roofing

715
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
I want to go home

716
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
It was colorful and bright

717
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,376
And so it made us just look at it again today I think that's a billboard and it was the roof was made from

718
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Part of a billboard that

719
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
You'd see on the side of any road

720
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,800
Metallica members thinking how could that work on billboards

721
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,896
Paper right that that roof is going to fall apart in a day

722
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
But then he started to do a little research

723
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,344
And I was like why I had no I didn't know the Billboards were made of PVC so it's a heavy-duty vinyl material so

724
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Directly UV protected waterproof

725
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,304
Southern Roofing and durable enough to last me to keep the water out then they could definitely

726
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,912
Turn into some sort of product Alex figured all of that bright heavy vinyl

727
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,008
To be made into a really strong duffle bags and backpacks and things like that

728
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,104
So after you left El Salvador and move to Southern California

729
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
He started to make a few calls

730
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
I don't know anything about billboard companies

731
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,600
But I just started calling and once I told him hey you know I think I can save you guys some money can I have a few of them

732
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Basic yeah sure

733
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,976
Turn that the ad companies were happy because they didn't have to pay to dump

734
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
The vinyl in a landfill

735
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Alec was happy because it didn't cost a lot to

736
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Get the stuff

737
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
Pretty much the cost of shipping

738
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,216
And we had his very first sheet of vinyl to cut up

739
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
He designed something he actually knows something about

740
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
I carry bag for his surfboard I figured a surf bag is like a pancake there's only two sides to it so I did Easy A

741
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
Best thing to make let's start with that but

742
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
It took him a while to figure out how to actually get it made so my first bag I took to a car upholstery manufacturer

743
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,024
Try to know anybody that did sewing and that first bag actually looked good enough for Alex have want to make more

744
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,424
So fast forward a couple months and Alex start selling these surf bags in sport shops around La

745
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,544
They start to Branch out into other products like backpacks and phone covers

746
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,128
From one billboard we can get upwards of 150 backpacks and

747
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:46,528
Probably around a thousand phone covers at least almost every one of their products is unique different shapes

748
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
Different splash of color because

749
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:54,720
Each item is cut from a different part of a giant Highway advertisements Virgin Airlines

750
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
Alaskan Airlines

751
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
Gucci Pepsi Billboards washed and cut at a warehouse in LA County

752
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
Eventually found a factory in Mexico that does all the sewing turn it into product

753
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,944
That's Alec avedissian on the company rareform in Agoura Hills California

754
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,832
Since Alec was first on the show rare form has been on Shark Tank and the company started turning a

755
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Profit and has grown a lot

756
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
It got a partnership with Coca-Cola

757
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
He started selling their bags

758
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Disney parks

759
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
And REI

760
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:34,656
And all this growth means rareform is now repurposing over 1000 billboards
