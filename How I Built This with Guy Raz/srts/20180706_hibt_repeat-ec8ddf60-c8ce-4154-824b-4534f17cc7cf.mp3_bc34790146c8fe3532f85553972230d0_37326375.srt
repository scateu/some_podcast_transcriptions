People stop traveling on travel guides then just stopped

24
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176

25
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,992
Possibility that

26
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392

Sergey Brin and Larry Page never met

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776

They all happened

46
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
Because of a chance meeting just to

47
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
A moment in time that

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Could have passed

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Witches

00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
Story of Lonely Planet guide book

51
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,232
Because it all started on a bench in Regent's Park in London on an October afternoon in 1970

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Marie wheeler was

53
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Just looking for a

54
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Quiet place to sit and read

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
And as I was walking around the park there was only one bench that had son on it and I

56
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,848
What can I several times because on the bench was also a young man I thought if I sit in that then she's

57
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,664
Neutron pick me up and I really don't feel like that

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
This is 1970 I can sit wherever I want

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
So I sat in the sunny bench

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
I'm turned my back to the young man and started reading my book

61
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
What were you doing today

62
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
It support

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Atacama gisin

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
New edition of it and I was just reading that

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,496
When this heat young woman came along

66
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,384
What are you doing I said place to read on a Thursday afternoon

67
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Hand

68
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
Reply positively

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
How to say get lost and then

70
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
He's got my thoughts and I like them so I said

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
I don't know I haven't been here that long

72
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
We started chatting and

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
After a while Tony ask Maureen if

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
She want to go see a movie

75
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
They went

76
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
And I'm on the way home and got lost

77
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
We wandered around for quite a while before I realized you

78
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Cos 20

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,360
Just sits over the confidently and keeps going thinking he's going and not be the right

80
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,176
And the thing is that's being our entire lives.

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Anyway that first date

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Blade 2

83
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Play second and then

84
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
3rd and then

85
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
12 months to the day later we got married

86
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
And when his proposal was very precise

87
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
If we was at was May

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Iran in May

89
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,864
And he said I would have known you a year on October 7th

90
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Get married and I said

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
You don't get married because you've known each other for a year

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
She said no

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
But we would save tax

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,432
But I think I know I wasn't a business schools

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,016
Excuse for that I'm afraid it wasn't the most romantic

96
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,880
So when she got married did what did you think you would just have to get jobs in London and start your life

97
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
That was pretty much the plan that died

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
We met just at the start of my 2-year

99
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Course in London and

100
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
We got married halfway through that 2 years

101
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
But time sometime in that second year together we decided we were going to take a year off and go traveling

102
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
That's certainly

103
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
Change things

104
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
How did you guys

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Smack That

106
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Decision what was the

107
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,551
Don't know it was very much a thing to do with a deer at a later on they started calling it

108
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Happy trail

109
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
And we we just coated the Asia Overland trip that you

110
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
You left London and you headed east

111
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,791
But this was the air right now the music of the times

112
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
Riding the Marrakesh Express Wilma

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
The Beatles were off in India so that was a lot of sort of cultural significance to it

114
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
But we join what

115
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Became known as the hippie trial and we

116
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Headed east

117
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
So this is I guess around 90

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
1870

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Shoe issue

120
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
In what was the plan

121
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
The plan was to drive from London

122
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,695
There was this car and it was so cheap that breaks down will

123
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Get out of it and leave it by the

124
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
We were going to go as far east as we could go have to dispose

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,191
Hollywood breakdown would sell it one of the other

126
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
You just start driving through

127
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
You're up and then

128
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,151
And then what just keep driving

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
The check in around and you go right across the room and you can ride

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Afghanistan

131
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
You just keep going for Pakistan and then you go through India and then you

132
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
Couldn't get across yet

133
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
And then we just carry on the plan was

134
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
We get to Australia

135
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
And then we would stay in Australia and work for a while

136
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
I would save up enough money and would fly back to London and that was

137
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
That was the plan

138
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
We had so little money we left London with

139
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
400lb

140
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
So that was our money

141
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
And you just stayed

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
You slept in the van

143
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
We could have X but generally we camped

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,551
Most of the time across Asia until we really understand

145
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,623
In Afghanistan you know a lot of the hotels in those days

146
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Debian Gardens and you could camp in the garden

147
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
At that time

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
How did you even know

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Where to go in and

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
What to do in

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Get the ride bus I mean how did

152
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Figure all that stuff

153
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
Hart bus station in Afghanistan and you're kind of pointing towards the board

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
Somebody will put you on the right bus

155
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
Mature wondering Dyna straight with a bag and you're looking at you now look at you look like you look like you're lost someone will punch your Twitter

156
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
I'll tell her you'll see something that looks like a hotel

157
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
Haven Restaurant

158
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
You just pull out your Lonely Planet

159
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,727
1972

160
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Really immature you know you manage and actually you know

161
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,639
What book was great is that you can travel for weeks without

162
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Sing another Western

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
But then suddenly it pollen summer like Kabul or somewhere you know

164
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,647
Are hair up and did the others and you just spent maybe an afternoon just trading information

165
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
You know

166
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
When you get here this place is good

167
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
This place is a need swap information that way

168
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Pacific old fashioned communication

169
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
All all along you are keeping a journal

170
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Tony about you guys

171
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
I did keep a diary I've always been

172
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,823
Reasonably assiduous about documenting things and

173
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Keeping records of things

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Where we stayed and what it cost and

175
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,039
How many miles to Carthage

176
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,671
And they did I know I think about the Palaces in the walls in the Fortress

177
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
Just as important but those days it was very much

178
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
The information which

179
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Later on selling

180
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Nmd

181
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
All this would like next to no money right

182
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Yes

183
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
We had to do everything is cheapest

184
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,127
Como solicitar cast real and it was hitchhiking we hitchhike from

185
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Bangkok all the way to Singapore

186
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
To get down there and then we went across

187

In Vale we were really run out of lock the airline that was

190
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
Supposed to that we're supposed to have

191
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Tickets on to take a

192
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951

Broke down and didn't have any more

194
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Planes

195
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,911

Ocregister

199
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Was that

200
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Like a scary at all

201
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Anytime I think I

202
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Got really weird

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Storm in the boat

204
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
And if I had to have more sensitive being terrified.

205
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
But you're so busy hang onto the boat

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
And then the thing thing

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Australia and I remember

208
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
Standing on the out looking at this

209
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Coastline that has nothing on it

210
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Nothing at all with coming out of place

211
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,399
Miles from anywhere on there was nothing

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Spiders I don't even know

213
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239

00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
You know what are we doing here

00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
Printed but it was it was a very base

272
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,927

Phantom the end of the day I sold a surprising number

283
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863

Tracy went through 96 pages

286
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
Suppose I went into one book shop and she's

287
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Buy this book and she said

288
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831

289
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Is it Lonely Planet

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Never heard of them and I said no you wouldn't

291
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Show to the book until she's at all

292
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
What's your telephone number and case

293
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
I want to

294
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Get my books that we didn't have a telephone

295
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
So I had to give her my work number

296
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
She called me and she said

297
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
My flatmate

298
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Is a journalist

299
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
And she wants to interview you and your husband on television

300
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
So we went on television to talk about our

301
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Tripping doing this book

302
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
That was our first big

303
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039

I'm pretty different things in there right like I mean like it tells you where you can find marijuana

307
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Oh yeah

308
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Where to get a fake ID in

309
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
I have to assume that you

310
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
You know you guys could not have been

311
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Stone hippie

312
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Motivated to write

313
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Everyday and to go places

314
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
The catalog we were actually really boring we didn't do a lot of that

315
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Stuff at all occasionally

316
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Very rarely

317
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Years later Lino's Lonely Planet became

318
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Better known

319
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
All these people

320
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
Who wrote using any kind of Uno and what they were really cool

321
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
Old people use.

322
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Antonio and I would be

323
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
At the cafe in old coop

324
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
People but we just didn't look

325
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
Cool and yet we were the ones who

326
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,151
Sit there quietly

327
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Interesting

328
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
How did you come up with

329
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
With with the name

330
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Lonely Planet

331
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
There's a story behind that we got the book done you never had we had everything that a title for is there was a cross

332
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
On the cheat for the Publishing House

333
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
I'm weeping out to the restaurant and drinking too much red wine

334
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
How many just been to see the rock and roll band on the

335
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
Roadkill Mad Dogs and Englishmen

336
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
Joe Cocker and Leon Russell

337
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
Traveling around the US in the late 60s film

338
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,527
I'm one of the songs in that that that movie and that that help MS

339
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,343
Joe Cocker singing a song called space captain

340
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
On the first line of the song goes

341
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Once while traveling across the sky

342
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
This Lonely Planet caught my eye

343
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,263
Peanut Sunrise what do we call the company Lonely Planet

344
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Which moron said

345
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Actually the first line is lovely planet

346
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
And I wish you would stop singing

347
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,783
And he said bologna plants even better and I said how he said what Just Dance

348
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
The Great Dane

349
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
You know we're learning to live

350
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Together on this planet

351
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Soap to the first book

352
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Like make any money

353
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Not much

354
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Didn't lose money on it but it wasn't.

355
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
A real money making proposition

356
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
But around that time when we were thinking of me okay

357
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
This is when we quit and head back to Europe

358
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
I'm done with began to figure that has sold surprisingly well

359
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Maybe we should do another book

360
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
And what we thought was

361
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Towards the end of the trip from London

362
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
With come down through Southeast Asia

363
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
The Vietnam War was still winding down so

364
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Southeast Asia wasn't seen as a

365
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
No hotspot for a

366
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Holiday

367
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
It was able to place next to a war zone

368
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
But we could see that was about to change and we thought okay

369
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,455

00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
20 was doing the right thing and then it says

559
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
Planning and all that and I was doing the

560
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
Carpentry

561
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Keeping it together

562
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
Yeah I'm actually moved out of the house

563
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
A lot of kind of

564
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Loose

565
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Comfort

566
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
In and out do a bit and flowed out again and we paid them

567
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,400
By the hour

568
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
As a real business

569
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
When and what point did you

570
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
She stopped having

571
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,824
Sleepless nights about whether you were going to

572
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
It's nice

573
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Every year

574
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
How to say actuator

575
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Late 80s

576
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
3090

577
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
I think was more when we

578
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Became

579
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
Obviously

580
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Sting

581
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
Momentum and it was carrying us as much as we were

582
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Pushing it

583
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,328
Can I talk to people who are doing that and handing the publishing it out at that time

584
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
And they said it just seems like

585
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
We couldn't do anything wrong

586
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
Did every book we did Zeno sold and

587
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
I think when we started doing Europe guys because we

588
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
We were just little publisher at the other end of the world

589
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Who started off doing Asia

590
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
How many finally did get around to doing Europe

591
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
We would think enough by that point we could really do it well

592
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,160
I think people in the office really got a kick out of that but it was such a thrill

593
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Doing that

594
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
Taking out anybody in the world who wanted to try and compete with us

595
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
I mean people everywhere you went

596
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
When using any kind of

597
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:45,728
I mean I used to give me a thrill you know you going to New York sing someone coming with a German copy of

598
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Chinese cup

599
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
You know whatever I just I still love that

600
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
But anyway

601
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Were there ever any moments where

602
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
It wasn't going well

603
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,552
Not looking very good

604
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
1000 and grown so fast

605
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
We had television going

606
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,864
We had started investing heavily into the digital side of things a lot of stuff a lot of

607
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
You know we created a whole lot of desktop

608
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,472
Publishing before receiving the term

609
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,824
The money the books were still selling like crazy but we were just doing

610
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
So

611
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,408
And in the middle of that

612
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
When 9/11 happened of course

613
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
PPL stock

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Traveling on travel guides then just

615
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Stopped

616
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
Did you think that there was a possibility that

617
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Stunning

618
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
His

619
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,168
Charms but it's also on his list infuriating things because we were definitely looking

620
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
At a really bad time we were looking at

621
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
We just have to let

622
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Go

623
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Back on our offices

624
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Embassy Suites

625
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
The number books we did

626
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,968
And it was looking I honestly didn't believe that

627
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Possible housing pictures

628
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,624
In retrospect I think it was much more accurate the month

629
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Deadpool start pulling everything

630
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,472
I guess it was a wrap around that time I guess it's the mid-2000s where you

631
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
You wound up

632
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Selling the company right now

633
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,384
I think we both felt that it wasn't the same company anymore it was

634
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,712
It was turning into much more of a digital company in that has a way of

635
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,320
Taking over everything it's not something I'm excited about

636
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,648
It wasn't going to be a dentist going to hand it on to our kids

637
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
Arcades in the company of one stage but

638
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,024
Not going to take it over from us

639
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Panda

640
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Now move on to something else

641
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
And I mean that you

642
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
Fuel

643
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Great to sell it

644
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
Still sad

645
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
One of the saddest days

646
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
I remember walking to the BBC with Tony to sign the

647
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Define

648
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,320
CBC ubota

649
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
And I said 222

650
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Your password

651
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
And he said no I said no

652
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Signal github password

653
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Cuz I just gold

654
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Straight up the hill

655
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Get out of here

656
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
We could still Escape

657
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
Yeah I think I drove the Salem

658
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
More than Tony did

659
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
And I always wondered you know if afterwards

660
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
He would really regret

661
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
I haven't

662
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,408
I know his son

663
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Add Worcestershire to my

664
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Grief about it

665
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
It took

666
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Months

667
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
For me to

668
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Like I still find a very high

669
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Hard to go back

670
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
To the office and you know I just

671
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
It's just hard

672
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
I mean from from somebody listen to this like

673
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
An outsider's perspective

674
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
People who said

675
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
You just let the

676
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
The dream I mean you got

677
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
I can travel around the world in

678
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Company

679
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
And yeah you sold it and it's not yours anymore but it made

680
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,800
Rich and look at your life

681
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Like that everyday

682
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,760
Every year we do trips together

683
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,088
Are there every year I go places

684
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,904
Rhino morning would not want to go to

685
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Chernobyl

686
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:24,096
I wanted to check the radiation to hobos these days

687
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,472
My consumption of output

688
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
Serious because I I interviewed

689
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
John Mackey

690
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
The founder of Whole Food

691
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
The show and

692
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
He he was talking about in early relation

693
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
He had with with

694
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
The woman that

695
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
The help him start Whole Foods in and how it really

696
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Destroyed their

697
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
If it broke down

698
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
He said you know business can really bring people together

699
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
As apart I can do both

700
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
I mean you you guys are approaching

701
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
50 years of marriage

702
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Sounds like you would have credible

703
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Partnership in

704
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
Border X

705
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,056
Weather times when you were building up his company where there was tension and there was

706
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,112
So we we've had our fights even our squabbles haven't always been playing silly

707
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,928
And you know you cannot

708
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,232
Couldn't run a business will you bring

709
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Stuff into the office

710
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
You can't avoid it to some extent

711
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,888
And it was funny but Lonely Planet people always knew

712
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
First of all you come and talk to me about an idea

713
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
And I'll tell you whether it's with

714
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Tony has what

715
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
What's called the 5c

716
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Second

717
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,896
5 Second window to engage.

718
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,712
You know it's like the lifespan of a mosquito

719
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
So they would come to me and say why not

720
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
I think this is great what do you think

721
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Goodness

722
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
You let me

723
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
Talk to him first

724
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
How much of your

725
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,888
And what happened with his company and everything

726
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,240
You think is due to luck and how much because you're just really smart and skilled

727
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,592
You definitely need person is that saying about you know whenever I'm working really hard I

728
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
I seem to be lucky

729
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
More interesting places near parents did

730
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
So is that element they were a big Market

731
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
I don't know that

732
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Skill

733
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Him and it was Tony and I there was

734
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
Judgement

735
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
I suppose and

736
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,752
And the fact that we were doing something that we knew everything about

737
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
But it's clear that the

738
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,104
This company could not have become what I became without

739
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Without the both of you

740
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Me and you both brought

741
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
Different skill sets

742
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
An amazing what you know this like

743
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,320
Chance meeting on a bench in Regent's Park resulted in this

744
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Incredible

745
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Company what is

746
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
What were the

747
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
Traits of both of you had like

748
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
That you brought to the company

749
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,304
The Mooring sends me nonsense

750
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Tony

751
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
Let me find it would never be

752
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Tony

753
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
He

754
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,264
Was a dreamer the vision but he also very

755
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Kind of late

756
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
New hires going to place them

757
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
I'm very early on

758
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
And he never ran out of that

759
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
That kind of mad

760
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Enthusiasm

761
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
Which parish you through so many things

762
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
However

763
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
He was not good

764
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,696
He never wanted to sit through meetings he never wanted

765
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
Bonkers

766
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,144
He liked all the stuff but you know he didn't want to hear what their problems

767
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,984
That wasn't terrible it was just really

768
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
He just wanted to know what we were going to do okay

769
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
You know how big was going to be in where the maps and pictures I mean with the book so we did

770
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,272
If you look at our covers and inside they just got better and better looking which was good

771
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Animals

772
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Tony you know 20

773
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Snead's

774
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
You know this is what we need to do with

775
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
So I would say that

776
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
I guess I've always said that Lonely Planet

777
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
I could never existed but that Tony

778
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
But it probably wouldn't.

779
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,144
Held2gether long without me

780
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Not agree with it

781
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
Tony and Maureen wheeler

782
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
Founders of Lonely Planet

783
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
By the way and its height the company was valued at 8

784
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Quarter of a

785
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
Billion dollars

786
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,064
The wheelers are no longer formerly involved with the company that sold all their shares but Tony didn't recently

787
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
Score a gig writing a chapter for a new Lonely Planet book it's called epic drives of the world and as

788
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,328
Cuz I speak Tony is a size 3 and 1/2 month drive from Bangkok to London

789
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
In a classic

790
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,144
British mg sports car

791
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
And one last question for you

792
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
When you travel like what is the thing you have to have in your carry-on bag

793
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
My passport my credit card

794
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
Bruker customer support

795
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,320
Cozy and comfortable and when I get on a plane and I'll put them on the neck

796
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Kind of Camelot

797
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
I never seen that

798
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
And please do stick around because

799
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Just a moment

800
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
We're going to hear from you about

801
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
But the things your build

802
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
But first a quick thanks to one of our sponsor

803
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Smart Water

804
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384
Taking inspiration from the

805
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Clouds themselves

806
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
SmartWater 1 Epsom

807
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
By adding electrolyte

808
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
Clean Chris

809
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Taste

810
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
The water you deserve

811
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Smart Water

812
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Vapor distilled

813
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Purity

814
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Electrolytes for taste

815
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,072
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

816
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Time now for how you built

817
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,216
And today we're going to the story we ran last year

818
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
One that you can

819
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,360
Probably relate to If you happen to live in apartment building and share a wall

820
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
With your neighbor

821
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
Which is exactly what happened

822
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,272
To Melanie cologne sleeping

823
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
And all the sudden I heard this huge

824
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,904
On the other side of

825
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
The wall

826
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:15,072
And what was going on is my neighbor was watching some sort of Thriller movie the bases

827
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,400
Literally shaking my bed I have been there

828
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
First try to

829
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
To talk directly to them

830
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
One time I went to my neighbor's door

831
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:31,712
I knew they were in there I could hear them talking but they wouldn't answer their door Melanie and her husband Louis

832
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,832
Tried everything you know the creative note leaving or hitting the ceiling with a broom Earth

833
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
Stomping your foot on the ground and none of it

834
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Woodworking for

835
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,792
So we looked around for a solution we asked her friends in the apartment industry is there anything that we can use

836
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
To help us with this and

837
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
There is absolutely nothing

838
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,984
And so we thought of being neighbor to neighbor notification tool where neighbors can notify each other

839
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,568
Completely anonymously and confidentially about a disturbance

840
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,176
From the neighbor until finally Melanie and Lewis hired a team to start developing a

841
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
An app which

842
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
They named

843
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
After

844
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
As an apartment app

845
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Answer that works

846
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
The property management agrees to use the app

847
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Send over the blueprint

848
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Of the building

849
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,208
And then when neighbors have issues

850
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
They can log onto their app and anonymously contact

851
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
The actual unit they're having an issue with

852
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,960
So let's say Joe has a neighbor that is playing their music too loud

853
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
Chicken selects at Square

854
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
Choose a preset notification so this one would be bidding for a please turn down your music so he

855
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,992
Celexa and then send it to the neighbor upstairs

856
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
And then that neighbor is able to respond with

857
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Resolved

858
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
Or sorry not me

859
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
Property manager can also see if the neighbor has

860
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,488
Responded or if an intervention is

861
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Is required

862
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,144
Johnny Lewis beta-tested it in a big apartment complex in Missoula Montana with a hundred units

863
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,752
It really well everyone is really excited about all the tools that were available

864
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,336
And how easy it made communication with staff and residents

865
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Since we last spoke with Melanie xi'an Lewis

866
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
Started working with apartment buildings in

867
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
The Denver area

868
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
Where they hope to sign up

869
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
About 75 of them by the

870
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,416
End of this year and they also want to Branch into a new market

871
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
University Housing

872
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,792
And by the way Melanie quit her job as a nurse around the end of

873
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
2016 and is not working

874
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Full-time

875
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
On app

876
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:30,240
There's definitely been times where we thought how easy would it be

877
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
To go back to our day jobs

878
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,128
But at the same time we can't even stand the thought of it and we get right back to work

879
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
