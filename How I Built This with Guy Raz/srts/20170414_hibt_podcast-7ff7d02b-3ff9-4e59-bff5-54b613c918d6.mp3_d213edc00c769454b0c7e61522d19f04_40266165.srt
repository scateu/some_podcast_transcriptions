Business insurance

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I was learning much more running a business on the streets versus studying in school and iron

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Remember sitting down with my father who's a liver transplant surgeon wow but I remember having to sit down to him and just say Dad

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Got some good news for you and I presented it is as good news cuz to me it was good news and I thought if I could get him a

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
Excited you might agree with me and I told him I was leaving school he said you're dropping out of school to become a junkman

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
How I built this

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
Show that innovators entrepreneurs idealists

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Stories behind the movements they built

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
I'm Gyros and old pickup truck

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Idea inspired junk hauling service in the world

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
By this point if you've been listening to the show

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
You know all about the inspiring people who

21
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
I had an idea and then ran with it

22
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Whether it was Sara Blakely with

23
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Spanx

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Tony Shay Zappos

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
They had a vision and they pursued it

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
But almost all of them

27
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
They had to go through a complicated process to get from idea to implementation

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Which is why today story

29
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Is such a contrast because

30
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Well junk hauling not sound sexy

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
Brian scudamore zydia welcome

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Terribly elegant

33
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
And symbol

34
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,600
He didn't need a whole lot of money to start he didn't need any outside investors

35
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
And he didn't need to hire anyone

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
The first

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,768
And to be clear Brian did not dream of a life

38
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Hauling away other people's trash

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
But he did dream of starting a business

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Even as a kid

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
In Vancouver Canada

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
Etsy seventh grade

43
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,288
I remembered in Vancouver

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
Starting a car wash one summer

45
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
I saw my neighbor across the street

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Eric it started this car wash

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
And he was charging

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
3 box of car

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
And I thought wow what a great way to make money I saw him washing cars and making money so I went and took a piece of plywood made my own

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Sign

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,560
And I decided to charge to box you undercut your neighbor across the street

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
I undercut my neighbor

53
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Buy a full dollar

54
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
And I thought

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
This is cool and there I was learning about a price war and it was awesome because literally cars would show up on my side of the story

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Free wash their cars

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
You get more cars we start competing on price

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
So the funny part is I got down to $0.65

59
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
You were a ruthless

60
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
Rules heartless businessman in 7th grade

61
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,000
You know it's funny we've both made money we both had fun and we would do this

62
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Several times throughout the summer

63
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
And we

64
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
Weed up the marketing so I'd get some friends you know a couple of girls that were in my class and I get them to go

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,824
So hold signs at the busier Street a block away to flag people over and

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
You start to learn about

67
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Pricing and profit

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,504
And I was making so much money that I just I couldn't even believe it would you like a

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Genius students

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Like where you super

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Go to school

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
Whatever the polar opposite of Genius student would be would be who I was

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
What happened is things like reading light

74
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
I just that was one area I got stuck

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,192
I'm so add that I couldn't focus on the words my mind would go to other things and I

76
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
I would have a hard time with that so

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
I learned to read but I didn't learn to understand

78
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
And that became a challenge through school and

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Andrea Lee

80
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
Serta help me back from from learning through books

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
So

82
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
I failed

83
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Many years throughout High School

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
I ultimately was 1/4 short from finishing High

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
12th grade

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Didn't finish

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Didn't graduate

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,863
But then I saw all my friends every single one of them get accepted into colleges

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
I said I want to be left out

90
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,239
Yeah so I went to one of the universities and said I don't have

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
My high school graduation

92
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
I'm smart enough I can do this

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
I wrote them letters and I

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Spent time

95
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
In the admissions office and finally they said okay

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
We're going to let you in

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
So you were

98
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
So you were what 18 I guess

99
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
The time we were you working like a

100
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
For your parents helping you out how did you even have money to go to school

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
My parents

102
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
When I approach them and ask for some money for

103
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,911
Her school they said are you kidding me you didn't even finish High School why are we going to find your college education and

104
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Turns out they were probably smart

105
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
But what it taught me is I had to get out there

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Fund my own education

107
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
And what I did was I was in a McDonald's drive-thru

108
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,223
In Vancouver I saw this beat up old pickup truck plywood sides

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Chunk filled up in the truck

110
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
And have a sign on the box that said Mark salling

111
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,927
I was having trouble finding a job I didn't know what I was going to do to pay for

112
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
College

113
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
And when I saw that truck

114
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
I immediately connected with that something I can do

115
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
I looked at the truck and I thought

116
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
I started those car washes as a kid

117
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
You can see how easy that was to get out there and

118
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Advertising

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Wash people's cars

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
And so to me this was

121
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Buy truck and haul junk

122
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
Rhapsody to be like rush out and go

123
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Woodford

124
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Yeah grab the classified

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Section of the paper

126
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
It started looking for trucks

127
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
And I found one that I

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Google 5000 love with it but I certainly could afford

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
It's price tag of $700

130
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Add $1,000 of my own money

131
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
And I spent $700 on a beat up truck of my own and it was this little

132
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
Blue Ford F100

133
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
And I got my

134
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,895
Girlfriend's father at the time to help me build plywood sides on there and

135
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,039
If I went I spray-painted 738 junk which was the phone number I was able to get from the phone company

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Has my phone number and my company was called the rubbish boys

137
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
You know lipomas we are here about them but the reality is there in the arm

138
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Many lipomas usually

139
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Iterations in trying things and failing in life

140
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
This was a lightbulb moment that just

141
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,335
Happened to pass by you at that moment at the McDonald's

142
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,967
You would not have seen that truck and you may not have thought of that idea absolutely true but I would have found something else

143
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
It's in my DNA it's how I think

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
And so sure

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
How to jump truck

146
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,719
Hey I'm not passionate about junk I never will be but I love customer experience and I love building

147
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Businesses I love building things

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
So I didn't see the junk truck I could have seen

149
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Completely different I could have seen a carpet cleaning business and said hey

150
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
That's what I'm going after

151
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
So you two you go out

152
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
You get the truck

153
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
And how did you even know what to do with it

154
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
The charge peep

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Customers

156
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Orange

157
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
DIYs I just started looking around in the classifieds

158
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
I started looking and going okay

159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
There's other people

160
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Doing what they called rubbish removal

161
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
And they say they charge by the truckload or the portion of a load

162
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
I called them up and find out how much they charged in

163
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
You call someone up and you say I've got a couch they're going to tell you

164
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,751
Anthony hundred bucks hundred fifty bucks dumping fees whatever it would be

165
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
And I would pay attention and

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Make notes

167
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,151
And then I decided I started my my charge rate

168
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
At $80

169
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Truckload which is pretty cheap

170
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,295
Yeah it was pretty cheap but it was it was probably too cheap because

171
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,647
In the beginning I wasn't really making money I underpriced myself thinking

172
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,511
When you go out as a business specially as an 18 year old kid starting to company

173
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
How to be the cheap

174
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
How are you getting the word out

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
How did people know that you were even

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Available to do this

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
So

178
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
I painted my phone over on the side of my toe

179
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
738 junk it was just the emblazoned on there was

180
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
What's bigger than anything else you could possibly see

181
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
And I would park my truck

182
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
It at a high-traffic intersection

183
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
It so people would see this and then call

184
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
And I really quickly

185
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,719
Figured out that people tell I thought you were your 78 junk truck parked at

186
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Arbutus and 12th how much you guys charge

187
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
And so I I learned very quickly that that was my mobile billboard

188
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
And what would you do you do to a house

189
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
And you would

190
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Yourself no help clear all the stuff

191
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
But they wanted removed

192
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:50,175
I wouldn't just go into the attic to basement wherever the junk was in the garage and and haul it away

193
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
But I realize there's a lot of things like refrigerators and deep freezers that were too heavy for just myself

194
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
I need employees

195
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
And I recruited my best friend David snyderman

196
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,327
He became too connected to the junk I mean we're still best friends today but it was pretty funny because

197
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
He would just look through the junk

198
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,983
It says check this out you know the history behind this and he would keep things and I'm like

199
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
This is not going to work out

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
We need to work here

201
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
So how did you figure out what you do with it

202
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
You have to

203
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Pay

204
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Fbm seeming to like I

205
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
Site like a landfill site where did you

206
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
Where'd you find this

207
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,927
I called up the city the municipalities and they said

208
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
Where do I take a load of junk if I've got summoned

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,327
They gave me the addresses of all the different places and

210
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
I tried them all out somewhere we're closer than others

211
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
Somewhere cheaper but farther away

212
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Experimented a bit by

213
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Pretty easy stuff I mean it really was a business of

214
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Pick up someone's junk

215
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
See the smile on their face

216
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Take their stuff off to the dump or to be recycled

217
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
And repeat

218
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
So simple

219
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
How how how long does it take to

220
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Are you actually

221
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
You know you paid off the truck

222
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
The cost of the cross

223
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,023
So within two weeks I've made enough money that had paid for the business

224
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Adjusted my prices

225
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
This quickly I worked hard

226
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
And I made $1,700

227
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Net profit

228
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
That summer 1989 roughly 1989 all I remember was that $1,700 was a

229
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Enough to pay for my school

230
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
And some leftover

231
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
And I would do this every summer

232
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Until I finally

233
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
Have the Bold decision to drop out

234
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
I was learning much more

235
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,535
Running a business on the streets versus studying in school and I remember sitting down with my father who's a liver transplant surgeon

236
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
Wow just got done more school than anybody I know and very successful very smart man

237
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
But I remember having to sit down to him and just say Dad

238
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Got some good news for you and I presented it is as good news cuz to me it was good news and I thought if I could get him excited he might agree

239
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
With me and I told him I was leaving school

240
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,319
You're dropping out of school to become a junkman

241
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
I mean he was just

242
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Destroyed

243
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:14,047
My oldest son is leaving school to become a junkman and then I said

244
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
On the glamour Spectrum I mean it couldn't be

245
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Closer to the bottom

246
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,311
And I just said now Dad I'm learning so much more he said you know bright you got a year left in your University education

247
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Costco finishing

248
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
I said Dad

249
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,223
My business opportunity might not be there forever

250
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,855
I said I guarantee the University of British Columbia will be there for years and years to come if I ever choose to go back

251
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
So we agreed to disagree and

252
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
I dropped out

253
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,303
At this point this became your your full-time

254
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Get right

255
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Look at this point

256
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
It's you and

257
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Is it you in a partner over

258
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Miss you alone

259
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
So when I dropped out

260
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
I ended up having a guy went to school with me

261
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
John and John Redal and I

262
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
We went from one truck

263
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
The three trucks

264
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Right after I

265
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Quit school

266
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
And whole thinking there was

267
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
These mobile Billboards work

268
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,647
If I can add two or three mobile Billboards around town we're going to get that much

269
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Busier and things are going to grow when we're going to have this

270
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Little Empire

271
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
You weren't even

272
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Paying for advertising cuz you g

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Just had

274
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
It's on the side of you

275
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
We weren't paying for advertising and

276
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
My girlfriend at the time said

277
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Why don't you call up the local

278
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
Compress call the newspaper and tell them

279
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Your story

280
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
So what story

281
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
And she said well that you guys have created your own job it's a

282
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Tight summer

283
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
Labor market nobody can find work

284
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
You guys created your own job and I said okay

285
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
I picked up the phone

286
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
And I called up the Vancouver Province our biggest newspaper at the time

287
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
It must have been a slow news day be

288
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Because

289
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,863
I said I got a great story for you and they said what is it and I told them and they sent a reporter and they sent a photographer

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
And the next day boom We are on the front page

291
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Of the paper

292
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
We got a front page ad

293
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
For free

294
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,103
With your phone number on it yeah and I remember the photographer saying

295
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
You guys are going to be busy tomorrow

296
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,247
And sure enough he was right we had bus drivers driving down the street

297
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Waving their newspapers with our picture on it

298
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Out of the window going that to you

299
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
And that was pretty fun

300
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
By the way did you ever have to

301
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Like get a bank loan or or

302
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Outside money

303
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
I didn't I was lucky I

304
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,239
Built a business out of cash flow

305
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
You and your partner and you were just

306
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Hauling the stuff out

307
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,407
Yantai ultimately bought my partner out after about a year

308
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,759
And what I did is I just invested everything back into the business to grow it

309
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
But I never

310
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Expanded beyond my means

311
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Not in the early stage

312
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
What's the kind of stuff that died

313
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Yuki Woodhall out of

314
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
We would haul away old furniture

315
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Appliances

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,607
We're very much a

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Keep up with the Joneses type world and I think unfortunately

318
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,823
We people renovate too much and always want new furniture and the latest and greatest in TVs and so

319
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
We haul away their old stuff

320
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
We try to recycle as much as we possibly can but

321
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,247
Furniture appliances yard debris when someone cleans up the yard

322
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
And

323
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
It was a simple model but it was

324
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
It was fun because you

325
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
You find weird things

326
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
I remember there was a woman who

327
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,303
Had Soup cans should a whole wall of Campbell Soup cans made it look like a real live

328
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
Art piece

329
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Right end and I remember you know looking at this and going

330
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
What are you doing in jail she just said well

331
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:40,127
If she was saving up for the next big war and then just wanted to have all this food stocked away and

332
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
Finally her kids to said like

333
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
You even if there was a war you couldn't eat

334
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
That stuff it's no 50 years old so we ended up cleaning out a whole wall OU Andy Warhol

335
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Wallace

336
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Campbell Soup can

337
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
What were some of the challenges that you faced

338
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
What were there any

339
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Regulation that you have to get around or

340
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
Competitors that tried to you know shut you down or anything like that at all

341
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
And the biggest

342
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,103
Challenge I faced in the early days five years and we are about a half a million in Revenue

343
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
And I realized I wasn't having fun any longer

344
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
I was avoiding spending time with my employees

345
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Nigist

346
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,367
Have the wrong people and I realize that One Bad Apple spoils the whole bunch and

347
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
At 9 of my 11 staff were bad apples

348
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
I just decided to

349
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Clean house and II

350
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
I got rid of everybody and I did it in one city and then

351
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,703
I took responsibility as their leader and said he had let you guys down and I'm sorry but

352
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
This isn't going to work out

353
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
What was the problem with

354
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
They weren't clean-cut they weren't professional they didn't see what I saw

355
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
And it was a simple as

356
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
I don't care about the customer

357
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
They were hauling away the junk

358
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Taking it to the dump and they didn't have the sense of lips

359
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
Allow the customer to have that sense of relief

360
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Set their junk is gone

361
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
They've got their space back

362
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
Let's chat them up a little bit and make them happy

363
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
And

364
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
They weren't aligned with

365
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
My vision

366
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
How are you able to

367
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Like how he able to run the business

368
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
Stay all the sudden

369
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
You fired your in

370
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Fireteam

371
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
And presumably you had jobs

372
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Ways to do then

373
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Next day in

374
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
That was hard I went from five trucks down to

375
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
The ability to only run one at a time

376
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,183
And so I had my truck I have my cell phone I was the call center I did the booking the dispatch

377
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
The junk hauling I did everything

378
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
But what it taught me was

379
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
PE build a company that's all about people find the right people and treat people right so I got out from that day.

380
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Never make

381
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:46,335
The same mistake of course I've made hiring mistakes but relatively few

382
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
I really focused on finding people that I wanted to work with

383
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
When we come back out Brian scudamore pleaded with the state of Idaho to get the number

384
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743

Hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR

411
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Gyros

412
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
It's the mid-1990s

413
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Brian has

414
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
Fired all of his employees

415
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
And after a rough few months

416
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
He begins to rebuild the team

417
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
But at this point

418
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
His company is

419
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
Still a small business

420
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Running in

421
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Just one city

422
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
When did you decide that you know it's going to be bigger than just like a

423
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Junk Hauling Company in Vancouver

424
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
So you know what that this point 1997 we are actually two million dollars in revenue and I joined something called

425
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,127
Yeo the young entrepreneurs organization

426
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:01,759
And found myself surrounded by people who had some pretty cool businesses

427
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Tech companies in

428
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,415
Growing ad agencies and just stuff that seemed a little sexier than junk removal

429
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,023
And so I think I found myself feeling sad because I was comparing myself to others

430
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
And I didn't feel good enough

431
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
So what I ended up doing was I

432
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,215
Went to my parents summer Cottage that this little cottage and I

433
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
Saddled on their dock

434
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
I said okay this isn't who I am I'm an optimist

435
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
So I pulled out a pen and a sheet of paper

436
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
And I said okay what if I could just

437
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Dream up

438
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Possibility

439
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,807
What could this business look feel and act like

440
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
5 years down the road

441
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,207
And I said we'll be in the top 30 metros in North America even though we were only in one

442
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,327
We would be the FedEx of junk removal clean shiny trucks friendly uniform drivers

443
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
I just started to put these

444
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,191
Big hairy audacious goals down on paper that we would

445
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,335
Be like the McDonald's of of junk that we would you know just what Ray Kroc did where you got all these owners on board

446
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
We would do the same thing with a junk removal business

447
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
And I took Paul guy who was the

448
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
Operations manager of mine in Vancouver

449
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
And I said you're going back and forth

450
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Toronto

451
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Every couple of weeks

452
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
To see your

453
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Why don't you move there why don't you take a truck

454
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Why don't you start the first franchise

455
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Did you even notice structure

456
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
Efrangeliz how did you figure out how that would work

457
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
I looked at other franchises I looked at Subway I looked at

458
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Businesses and thought

459
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
What kind of royalty are they charging

460
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
What what's the business model

461
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,943
I got out and talked to a bunch of experts so again being a guy that doesn't learn from school

462
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
Just picked up the phone and I called people I called

463
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
And I approached a bunch of XP

464
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
Burt's and said this is what I'm thinking of doing what do you think

465
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
They gave me some

466
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
Feedback and advice on how to structure

467
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Fees and royalties I

468
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
I brought on a franchise lawyer who still with us today

469
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,935
And I remember that he helped to give me a lot of the advice in the systems

470
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
He believed in us and knew that we build something

471
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Much bigger than where it was at

472
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
About time

473
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
So you get your first franchisee in

474
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Toronto and

475
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
How old

476
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
It was funny because I got a phone call from Paul guy so he took them I don't know a week to get to Toronto you made a few

477
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
Stops and he calls me up within the first couple of weeks

478
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
And he said

479
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
This isn't going to work here

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Hello what are you talkin about Polly Sidwell

481
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
I found out that the city will Holloway

482
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Anyting

483
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
For free

484
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,240
He said you can just put it out on the curb side that got special garbage collection days.

485
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,800
Take fridges stoves couches you name it it doesn't matter

486
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
I said Paul you've driven across

487
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Country trust me please just try it

488
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Until he did

489
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Any start to get business

490
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
And he started to hear from customers

491
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
That

492
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
You know someone was doing a renovation maybe they didn't get a city permit so they didn't want to call the city to all the way the junk or maybe the junk

493
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
Was in the garage or the basement

494
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
The city workers wouldn't come collect it from anywhere but

495
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
The curbside

496
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
And Paul started to realize wow

497
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Okay this is going to work

498
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
You get a million dollars in Revenue

499
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
In this first full calendar year

500
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
So at that point you're thinking okay we've got to expand we've got to move Beyond Vancouver and Toronto

501
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
And what was the next step was next place to go next place to go was in the United States

502
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,792
And just to clarify at the beginning is called the rubbish boys when did you come up with

503
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,840
Did you become 1-800

504
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
Paul was in my office we were working and I said

505
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
We're going to go for this franchise model and build something

506
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Across North America

507
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,896
I knew the word rubbish was going to be a problem it was more of a

508
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Canadian British term

509
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,344
And the other problem we had was people would either think of the company is being the rubbish boys and some people thought of us at 7

510
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
3 junk so effectively they sauce of two companies

511
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Remember sitting down with Paul and we were

512
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
We are brainstorming and

513
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
I said

514
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
If we did a 1-800 number

515
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
Something like 1-800 Flowers something that was more descriptive

516
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,776
So we started brainstorming in the whole got milk campaign that was running at the time

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
Inspired me to

518
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
1-800 got junk

519
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
And

520
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,760
Are phone number at a? In it and it would ask the question got Shopkin of course I do

521
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
Then give us a call and so

522
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,672
And so I try to find who owned 1-800 got junk

523
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
It wasn't available it wasn't available

524
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,560
The phone company said they couldn't get me the number so

525
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
How to dig around

526
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,472
I ended up making about 60 phone calls I had people friends and family in the United States

527
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Calling the number

528
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
It was only working in one state

529
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
And that was the state of Idaho

530
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Kuna Idaho had this number

531
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
The Department of Transportation in Idaho own

532
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
This 1-800 got junk phone number

533
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,064
They didn't know it's spelled got junk

534
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
They were using this phone number

535
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,464
And I thought okay I need this number so I called into their office

536
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,816
Called up there's main switchboard asked for the phone room and I got the sky Michael

537
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
And Michael ends up

538
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
You know talking to me any

539
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
Because why do you want this number and I just said it's it's a business idea I really want it

540
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
That's why we're not really isn't it that much

541
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,128
It took three phone calls to him before he finally said okay

542
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Here's the AT&T forums

543
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,712
Fax them over to me

544
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
The number is yours

545
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
I signed and wechat

546
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
How to deal with the way he just gave you the

547
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Gave you the

548
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
The phone number for

549
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:33,536
I think he wanted to get rid of me I think he was sick and tired of me calling you really needed that phone

550
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
That was incredibly lucky break

551
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,192
It was a lucky break that you make your own luck I mean I could have given up after

552
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Call number

553
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
54

554
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
Or 55 I just kept going and

555
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,712
I've heard so many stories of going to Colonel Sanders knocking on 183 doors and then the hundred 84th the guy goes yeah

556
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
I love the recipe

557
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
And so

558
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
He just can't give

559
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
So how did you expand into the US

560
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
So we

561
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Expanding through franchising

562
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
We found a lawyer

563
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:09,120
Started networking for a Canadian lawyer found a great attorney in the US we created a franchise documentation

564
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
You got approved by the FTC in

565
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
I said okay

566
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
Off you go

567
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,056
And then we just really started to aggressively go after the US press

568
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
The big turning point for us

569
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,664
I said that the big media hit in the US

570
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Was Fortune Magazine

571
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
Why did you think it was so important to get

572
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
I saw that

573
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
When we were

574
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,416
This little local businesses the rubbish boys

575
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
And we would get stories in the newspaper

576
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
People would repeat our stories back to us

577
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Like wow

578
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
You dropped out of college in your building this business and

579
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
What a great thing that you're doing and you know

580
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
It's an awesome story

581
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
So we just started telling the story

582
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
So okay so you get this article and then what

583
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Like as a result

584
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
People calling you saying hey you don't want to buy it like I want to buy a franchise

585
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,344
Guess we ended up getting article Fortune Magazine they saw one of our trucks in San Francisco

586
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
Adam lashinsky the writer called and said

587
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
Saw this truck

588
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
Heard about you guys

589
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Seems like a crazy business

590
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
Casino you're building a brand

591
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Junk removal

592
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Who does that

593
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
And

594
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Story came out

595
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Hit the ground on a Thursday

596
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
And we ended up getting 506

597
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Phone calls

598
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
From Thursday to Sunday so that we

599
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
We were flooded with

600
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,992
These are people who are interested in buying franchises

601
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Yeah

602
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,648
M506 calls imagine listening to that and trying to write them all down and calling everyone back we were overwhelmed

603
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
So

604
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
I got on the voicemail

605
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,608
I said due to an overwhelming response from Fortune Magazine we are unable to call people back

606
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
If you would like to learn more about our opportunity

607
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,752
Please call into this conference call at this time

608
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,592
And what we did is we have like a hundred people show up on a conference call

609
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
And we would do a roll call

610
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,040
Of you know okay what city are you from in and we going to go through one by one all these different people

611
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
So everyone's like what I got all this competition I want to get in

612
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
And it drove the process quickly

613
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
And we ended up doing 53

614
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
French ideals that year

615
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
Which was just unheard of in the franchise space

616
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
And

617
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Things to start at the hockey

618
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
Completely explode

619
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,800
You are to adjust from running a small business too

620
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
2

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,408
Pretty big company like almost overnight riding with all of a sudden you had

622
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
Always new franchise Partners in a huge

623
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
When the beginning it was

624
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Great exciting

625
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Things were

626
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Building all this great momentum and we

627
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
We raced

628
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
Pretty quickly to a hundred million dollars in Revenue

629
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
What year what year did you

630
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
2006

631
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
And so

632
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,216
It was exciting and in there was an energy in this momentum

633
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,056
But what was interesting about that time is it 2006

634
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
I realized I had my

635
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,200
President of my company my cool Cameron Herald

636
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
I was the best man in his wedding great friend we're still friends today

637
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,624
We Grew From together from 2 million to 106 million

638
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
Very short period of time yeah but what started to break

639
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Was that

640
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
You had to add

641
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,376
Fire Ready Aim types at the top of the company

642
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
Yeah and and that just doesn't work

643
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
We we started to make poor decisions together

644
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Like what you do

645
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:33,664
We would overspending in areas where we would we would take some risks and we wouldn't really think

646
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
Through with any rigor and discipline

647
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
How would affect our franchise partner

648
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
We had a truck roll out program where we said hey

649
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Everybody needs more trucks

650
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
Get more trucks out there and we

651
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:49,792
We put it in the franchise agreement that our franchise Partners had to increase their fleets by a certain. Of time and

652
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
There's some Rebellion

653
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
I mean it and I don't blame them

654
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
It was too aggressive

655
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
And

656
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,520
I realized it we were making mistakes and you can't have the two add types

657
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Topton

658
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
And I needed to find

659
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
A new leader and

660
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,200
Having to tell your best-friend that this is no longer going to workout is

661
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
Tough tough painful thing to go through for both of us

662
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,672
But we filled and moved on and and you know Cameron would tell anyone today Bryan made the right decision

663
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
So obviously I'm assuming you

664
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Someone else to tell Romeo

665
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Operation Saturday

666
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
I did so

667
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,192
One of the biggest mistakes I made was the second person I brought in as

668
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
Is it the second president

669
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
And I brought in

670
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Annex Starbucks

671
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Cool

672
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
And this person had

673
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,152
Can a president of one of the US divisions of Starbucks

674
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
And done amazing things for that

675
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
30000 employees

676
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
To report so you're thinking this person

677
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
Sister slam dunk they're going to do a great job for me

678
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh yeah I'm

679
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Jackpot

680
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
This is just unbelievable

681
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
But

682
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
We almost bankrupted the company

683
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Wow

684
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
After 20 years of growth

685
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
We went

686
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
From

687
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
119 million in revenue is what

688
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,080
Weedhead about peek at that time and we drop down to the 80s

689
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
What happened

690
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
Will the recession-hit witch

691
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Didn't help

692
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
But I don't buy for a second that that was really

693
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
CSUB

694
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,296
Because what really happened was

695
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
My president's leadership

696
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
In my vision

697
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
Weren't aligned

698
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,536
I needed an Executor who could translate my vision and say

699
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
Here's the vision let's translated into a plan here's all the steps let's make these things happen I needed somebody that believed in me

700
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
And where I can also believe in them

701
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
So I

702
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
I got that person out of the business

703
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
How close to the company to falling apart

704
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
We couldn't have been closer

705
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,552
I mean I I would have given us another 90 days if we continue down that path weed overspent so drastically

706
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
On big bats that didn't pay off

707
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,952
And Ida hunkerdown I had to lay off 52 people

708
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
I needed to elevate another team

709
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
The middle level managers up

710
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Can I said

711
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,888
You know I know you might not agree with my decision

712
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,448
You probably think I'm crazy but I need your help and

713
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
What's the hardest. In my

714
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
Professional life

715
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,896
Well my middle level management team who is elevated continued to run the business

716
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,200
I scoured the country for

717
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
The Right leader

718
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
I interviewed 75

719
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
Potential president / cos

720
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
I said I need to find someone

721
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Whose strength

722
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
And talents

723
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
Wood

724
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Take all the things I'm bad at

725
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
And make them happen

726
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
And I painted this little vision describing exactly who I was looking for

727
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
I got it up to my network

728
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
And three different people totally unrelated

729
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
Said the person you describe is Eric Church

730
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
Because you've only described one person on the planet

731
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
And

732
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
I reached out Eric and I got connected

733
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,112
He was very happily employed he was president of a big travel tourism company

734
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
And when the magic happened

735
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Just okay

736
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,280
We can see building this thing together we can see how we would

737
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Each contribute

738
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
Strengths to the rest

739
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
And we entered this partnership and

740
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
It's been almost 6 years

741
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
And together we just

742
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
I mean we can

743
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Bait

744
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Discuss

745
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,384
And work together on the culture guy

746
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Division guy

747
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
He's implementer the rigor

748
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
He's the team building guy and it's

749
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
I mean it's

750
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
At what point did you stabilize they'll appoint were you able to say okay

751
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Totally passive

752
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Would Eric Church came in

753
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,120
The first thing he did is he had the goals that I had put in place

754
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
He lowered them

755
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
He said listen Brian it's not that I don't believe

756
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,032
In you and that I don't believe in the goals

757
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
We're going to lower the bar

758
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
Because we're going to teach people

759
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
What it feels like to win again

760
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,016
We are going to make sure we win we are going to put the bar low enough

761
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
That there is no way in the world we're not going to win

762
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
When people start

763
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Feel and taste that winning Feeling Again

764
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Confidence will build

765
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
Team will come back and so he thought about it a very strategic plan for way and we made money in the first year

766
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,192
Fear of this new this new business

767
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,568
Really taking 1-800 got junk and restructuring honking country down with we made money

768
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
Cities did you guys operate in now

769
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
We are in every major Metro in

770
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
United States Canada and Australia

771
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
So you name the city where there

772
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,672
I talked to obviously lots of entrepreneurs

773
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Michelle Wright and

774
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,512
Some of them go to the franchising route and then some of them

775
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
Decide not to do that

776
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Why why did you

777
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
How to do that

778
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,960
I think the answer ties to the person I am and what motivates

779
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
I've never been a Money Motivated

780
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
I probably would have made more money in the long term

781
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,920
If I done a corporate model in an IPO and raise money

782
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
But what motivates me more than anything is

783
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,552
Taking someone who's got the American dream

784
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Build your own business

785
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
But they don't know how

786
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
Giving them a recipe giving them the cheerleading in the support and

787
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,024
Team of other franchise owners who can come together

788
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
And so the franchise model to me was the

789
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,912
You got skin in the game this is your business

790
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
And we could build something much bigger together

791
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
Versus what we could have ever done alone

792
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
NFL schedule

793
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Who is Europe to go back to the

794
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
18 year old Bryan

795
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Like in that McDonald's drive-thru

796
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,272
And you could you just there and you like dude

797
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
I know it's going to happen

798
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
To you over the course of your life

799
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,392
Listen to me

800
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
Would you say that

801
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
I would say Brian

802
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Listen to your gut

803
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
Make the right decisions that you know with

804
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,984
All your heart are the the decisions that need to be made

805
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
Don't be afraid to make them interested everything's going to work out and I've learned that

806
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
You have storms in life

807
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
Just like any storm

808
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
In real life

809
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
They don't last forever

810
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Yeah

811
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
One more question for you Brian which is

812
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,720
What is the weirdest

813
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Thing that you ever hauled off

814
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,376
I the weirdest thing I probably hauled off was I had a

815
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Entire truck load of

816
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Escargot shells

817
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
So some company who imported escargot went bankrupt

818
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,848
And I we loaded the truck and it was very light

819
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
Kissing of the shells were all there

820
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Sky says to Migos

821
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,552
Come on you can fit more in than that and I said you got a full truckload so you can see the trucks full

822
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
So he came up with this idea on the customer is always right so we did it

823
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
He said

824
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
Go up into the Second Story the office

825
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
Jump into the back of your truck

826
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
Collapse all those

827
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Shells

828
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
And set another load

829
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
So I we did it

830
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
It's kind of fun you know screaming who is your jumping out the window into the back of the truck and we did we got another load in and

831
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
We had fun he was happy Brian scudamore founder of 1-800

832
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Got junk

833
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
How do I get last year the company and their franchise Partners made close to 8

834
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
Quarter of a billion dollars in Revenue

835
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Calling of people John

836
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
Sometimes that truck is

837
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,328
In recent years

838
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
They've come across

839
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
A Bible that belong to

840
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Did John Wayne

841
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,472
An old airport X-ray scanner

842
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
And an ATM machine

843
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,616
It still had $26,000 in cash

844
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Inside

845
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,552

Hey thanks for sticking around because it's

861
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
I know for how you build that

862
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,600
And a story comes to us from Robin Gerber who works for a bank in New York

863
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,440
And she wanted to solve a problem that actually has nothing to do with

864
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Her day job

865
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
Super frustrated looking for parking

866
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,888
If I'm driving if I'm a passenger in a car

867
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,472
It's probably one of the most annoying things about having a car and a big

868
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
City people fight with their spouses

869
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Trying to find a parking space

870
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,688
When you meet why they didn't try there fast enough

871
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,088
So it's really a source of tension

872
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,928
Her dad actually come up with a kind of low-tech solution for the

873
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
The city's parking problem

874
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
Key devices system where he would put a piece of paper on his car window with a :-) if you

875
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,264
Who is leaving the next morning and drivers in his neighborhood began to look out for his car if they saw the :-)

876
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Air Force One Robins

877
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,200
I thought to myself there should be enough for this

878
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Robin actually

879
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,528
Did something she got a friend to help her do the

880
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Decoding and then she made an app

881
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
App that allows drivers to

882
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
Share information

883
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
About parking space

884
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
We have a find a spot option in a host

885
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,560
The spot option so if you are looking to find a spot you could

886
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
Click that button and it would search

887
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
Search for all the spots within your vicinity

888
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
And it would show you the XX closer

889
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,104
So you choose the spot you want to snag you get the make and model of the car that the leaving

890
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
And then you navigate to your face

891
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,224
And they are actually tracking you on GPS

892
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,088
Do you know if the person is on time you can chat with them and each person has to say if it would

893
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Successful or not

894
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
The course for the app to really work

895
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
Robin needed hundreds actually

896
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,536
Thousands of New York City drivers to download it and

897
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,816
Start sharing their spaces

898
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
Soap to get the word out

899
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
She made a music video

900
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544

Thousands of cars all over New York City

911
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:38,496
