Campaignmonitor.com

Exciting news with you we are taking

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
How I built this

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Live

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
To Chicago

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024

Go to NPR

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
And hope to see you in Chicago

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
And one more thing

20
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,688
It seems like you can walk into any store these days

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
And choose from

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Dozens of bottles of

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
Artisanal water or

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Juices

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
But before any of that

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
Seth Goldman was trying to come

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Convince the beverage industry that yes

28
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
People will buy a bottle drink

29
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
That is not loaded with sugar

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
And as you will hear it

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Took a lot of convincing

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
The story first ran last January

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
But it's worth

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Working again

35
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Hope you enjoy it

36
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
2003 we had a delivery of glass that was

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
Salty and so we ended up with some

38
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,856
Product in the marketplace that had broken glass inside the bottle on Factor two different Whole Food stores

39
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
And Whole Foods has a rule three-strikes-and-you're-out we

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
No we can't afford as a business to lose my largest customer so we voluntarily withdrew all product on the market

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Every store

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,472
How much did I cost you totally stopped

43
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
Our sales it was just painful

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Ramen PR

45
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
How I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movements

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
The story of how Seth Goldman and Barry nalebuff took honesty from a kitchen

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
Sync in Suburban Maryland to the shelves of virtually every grocery

48
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Comerica

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
So the year is 90

50
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
1897

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
Is living in Bethesda Maryland with his wife

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Three young

53
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Kids East

54
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
To he just graduated from the Yale School of

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Management

56
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Tempest great job at

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Investment firm

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,280
He's he's got an itch

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
He feels like he wants to start something

60
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Keeps nagging

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Daya

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
After day

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
After today

64
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
Thinking about different ideas maybe a web-based

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
System that would raise money for Publix

66
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
Schools by tab

67
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Tapping into alumni Networks

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
He came up with the idea to simplify diagnostic

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Urinary tract infections

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,576
They were a bunch of other ideas that would pop into his head but nothing really

71
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Got him excited

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Until 1 afternoon

73
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
When he finished a long run and walk

74
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Into a convenience store

75
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,120
Hot and sweaty and I went to a beverage cooler and I said there's nothing here

76
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Nothing seemed to be like

77
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
And it was all a hundred calories per 8 ounces and the difference was Visser no Fizz color

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
Different names different bottles they were almost

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Uniform

80
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
This profile which was you

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
647 teaspoons

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
4/8 Oz

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Or not

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Why is anyone making a tree

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
1 or 2 to 6

86
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
A little bit

87
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Just

88
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
That's sweet

89
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Did you go from that

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Attitude

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Thinking about starting a Tea Company

92
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
So when I

93
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
Felt that Thursday I reached out to my professor

94
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
And when I hit Ferry Nova when I've been a student

95
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
We had a case study of the beverage industry and we had agreed there was a

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
There was that space

97
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
A Sweet Escape

98
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
So I reached out to Barry I said I think I'm ready to do something about this I Iran no not at

99
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Probably not a beverage industry EX

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
No knowledge of that and that was where

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
Having zero knowledge of the beverage industry in the beginning was actually competitive

102
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
Because we went in without any the assumption

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm one of the things that happened

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,863
Literally

105
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
The same amount that I went for that run in in New York City

106
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Was that

107
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
An investment my dad had made it 1977

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
And So It Goes

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
18 years ago

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
At the time

111
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Came to fruition

112
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
I was presented with a check for $50,000

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
And

114
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
That was kind of the risk Capital enough for me to say okay well

115
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
I'm going to put this

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
This is

117
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,719
If we lose this we lose it but this is what I'll bet at the beginning I mean you were thinking

118
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
I'm Goin In

119
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
A job but

120
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,911
I mean you were still young enough where you could always like go back in the finance

121
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
That's right so you have a $50,000 check

122
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:05,151
And then and it was very able to put in a little bit of seed money. Barry had been on the board of a company that goes public

123
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
Because he kept his date

124
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,759
As a professor professor Yale

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
What was funny was that before I went to submit my resignation

126
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,719
The Cowbird I kind of called Barry for one last boost of confidence I said I'm going to go in there you know you just had a third son but I'm going to

127
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Step down

128
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
And this is long pause he says

129
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
I bet if you went

130
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
DeKalb

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
To go on a sabbatical I bet you they let you do that

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,007
I knew I had to

133
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,895
Take the plunge you couldn't get investors to invest or employees or buyers to commit without you knowing me big commit

134
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Do a quick I check temperature

135
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Ura

136
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Father of three kids with

137
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
What's a good job at Calvert Investments

138
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
And you tell your wife you're going to quit to start a

139
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Tea Company

140
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
Which is Nathan for you know nothing about

141
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
And nothing about that terrified you nothing about that terrified her yeah I think

142
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
It was

143
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
I believe in

144
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
Myself probably a little bit of hubris right like I think I can do this even though I don't know anything about it

145
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
But

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
I am ready to try

147
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
So you quit and then basically you and Barry what did you start to do like how did you start

148
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
Start to get what did you start to raise money was that your dad was saying he was so the first thing we did was I I did write up

149
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Business plan B Sales people really

150
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Put together PowerPoint

151
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
They don't write Business Without a 20-page business plan

152
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
Mostly show the thinking behind the business I think every every potential investor wants.

153
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
There's actually some thought here about

154
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Where this goes

155
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
I would become some

156
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
I managed to secure an appointment with Whole Foods

157
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
That early

158
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Even even before you had a Prado that was lucky because the the marketing director at Whole Foods or just at that time a cup Fresh Beat

159
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Whole Foods

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
The Mid-Atlantic

161
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
He was a graduate of Vehicle Management

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
So he helped me get an appointment with the buyer

163
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
X1 pause here

164
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Versailles because

165
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,287
Tomorrow I have read about you every time I look in the midst of all this happening at Whole Foods and and all that excitement

166
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Your son Ellie got

167
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Reset

168
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,247
Well it was the ultimate test in compartmentalizing because literally the day before the whole food

169
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Our first presentation

170
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
That's probably the most important day of the company's history

171
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Freeware word

172
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Identity

173
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
And Barry and I are in the kitchen and we've got

174
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
End

175
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,583
Bowls that we're bringing the tea and it was not an official-looking lab

176
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,423
The kitchen full of all these things my wife walks in with our our middle son

177
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
And she's got this Ashen look on her face and and I

178
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
I don't know she's so upset

179
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Maybe kitchen such a mess on a

180
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
We'll clean this up

181
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Angie's List

182
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,479
We just came back from the doctor and Ellie are middle son had a coarctation

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
I need major surgery within the month

184
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
And so

185
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Pretty heavy news to get

186
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
How old was he

187
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Intense

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
And

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Probably if that it happened a few weeks

190
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Early I probably went

191
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Because

192
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
Whether the health insurance benefits or just the risk

193
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Level

194
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Could do that but I

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Are you taking the plans I knew

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
You can you can bet that when I was at the Whole Foods meeting I was

197
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,759
Selling with great intensity of it needed to succeed

198
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
And then

199
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
While Elie was in the hospital

200
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Can I stay with him

201
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
That whole week

202
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
But I'll go down it so after midnight we had someone working on

203
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Formulas

204
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
Glenn said he would come in and meet me in the

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Lobby of children

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Hospital

207
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Still together

208
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Sleep by Ellie's bed

209
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
And I think

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
It's it's

211
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
Part of the experience is part of the journey and and I'm so

212
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Thankful and

213
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
To have Ellie still with us and in such a delight in such a

214
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Wonderful presents

215
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
You know and

216
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
For me and and Ferb

217
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Thinking about

218
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
You lie

219
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Pitching

220
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
This product

221
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Hino at Whole Foods in the midst of all this

222
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Do you like to do

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Bring them samples

224
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
It's like the Samsung made in your kitchen

225
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Put them in in in

226
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Like some random bottles or some

227
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
We we got an empty snap

228
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
What was really funny

229
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
Is that Barry had sent over some Services when they in the mail

230
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
And when I met with the buyer and I

231
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
We poured out

232
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Samples from the thermostat of my empty Snapple bottle

233
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,047
Honesty

234
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
I will look this sounds interesting will give it a try I will take 15000 bottles which of course was both terrifying and

235
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
How did you make that much

236
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,639
That was the other scary parts so we got this and then next thing we did is

237
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
Basically went up and down the East Coast

238
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Looking

239
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
At bottling plant

240
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,575
We went to beer plant soda plants apple juice plants

241
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
So we ended up at a plant in

242
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
I'm Buffalo New York that was making apple juice with a little down on his luck

243
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
And so

244
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
We brought in these mesh bag

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Large mesh bags

246
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
Better actually clean a pool like oh yeah yeah

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
And so that was what we use boiling water and every once in awhile the bag Woodbridge

248
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Types wood

249
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
It was it was not pretty

250
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
How did you know the tea was

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
I mean that's like

252
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Well that was that was so funny you know when I talked to Barry

253
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
He is very good at making things sound simple.

254
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
You take a teabag you knocked out of water if you multiply 2 * 15000

255
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
Theoretically that works what we found is that when you in a special the beginning to infusion

256
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah the bag breaks when you really got a problem so we just had to

257
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Keep iterating

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
It was a very

259
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Makeshift

260
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Operation

261
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
What's up once you had all the bottles had I mean headed

262
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
Like this do well right away

263
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
So what happened was in arms we went to the shop nobody knew what it was

264
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
And so

265
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
All that for some of this is 1998 now

266
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
All we did was

267
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
Like our marketing effort was me and two interns

268
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Giving out samples

269
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Whole Foods

270
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
And

271
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
We gave out more samples and resole

272
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
But by the end of that summer we were the best selling tea in the 17

273
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Fresh Fields Whole Foods

274
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
The Mid-Atlantic

275
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Wow and so what was

276
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,623
Then happening was that the consumers were starting to a

277
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Witcher 3

278
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,255
And it was so different and end so what was nice is we have most which

279
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Hilton brands

280
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,655
Making the cereal category of one's been out of Raisin brands on sale tomorrow go by post or whatever.

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Do you switch back and forth but with honesty

282
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
It's not there you don't go back and buy

283
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Snapple or Arizona because it

284
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
The taste of soda

285
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
Yeah and so when we got somebody and then

286
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
We were clearly not for everybody

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
They they were very loyal

288
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
What was like what was the thing that made

289
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Honesty different from

290
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Like everything else

291
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
That was in the market

292
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
So true things first I'll just much less sweet than ever

293
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
But the other thing in the reason the name Honesty made sense

294
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,631
Is because what we learned is most of the bottle T the us at the time and still today

295
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
Is not brewed with fruity it's

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
If a powder or concentrate it Bears a relationship to the TV like

297
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
Fish fillet relationship to the fish

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
But aren't t

299
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Bring in the TV

300
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
To the plant then we Brew them there

301
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
I'm in soup

302
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Once you were in

303
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Pretty quickly after you launch it mean

304
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Seems like

305
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
You are sadly the oppression of the average person

306
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
So it was just a sweet was a Stark

307
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
And so

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
But we proved the concept

309
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
Yeah and so then we're able to go back and say we proved the concept

310
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
Now it's time to expand so we got more investment

311
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
Money raised and then we went to the other buyers and buyers for the

312
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
For the west coast and we went to buy us from other stores you know

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,967
Mom's my Organic Market here in

314
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
Mid-Atlantic was one of our earliest accounts and they

315
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
It was working there and they started to it to bring it to their other stores

316
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,135
So you're a mean

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
You know it's

318
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Give me you're making a lots of

319
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
You're growing what were the challenges

320
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
Hello there so many cuz it was still

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
Will Frisco cash is always a challenge we weren't we were growing quickly but

322
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
We were spending money to do it we will head salespeople

323
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
We were doing marketing

324
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
And then just probably getting the

325
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
T2

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Stores right to the stores and any we were still getting rejected by all these.

327
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Distributor self Distributors are there The Gatekeepers they decide where your drinks go because this is unlike

328
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Uno Attack

329
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Company

330
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
No matter how good our product is

331
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
We can ship it through the mail

332
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Beverages are high turnover products

333
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
And so as soon as the Shelf empties of beverages

334
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Something

335
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Texas place

336
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
And so you need a distributor to be there

337
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
How to build

338
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Pinkie Pie shelf space

339
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
A protected and so

340
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
What happened was we were going to all the distributors

341
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Snapple in Arizona

342
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
And they were saying when they returned our calls they would just say it's not sweet enough

343
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
They were expensive wow that's not what were used to

344
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Which of course it wasn't

345
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
What they were where they were not

346
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Effective as they

347
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
They were tasting it for their own power

348
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
They weren't

349
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Thinking that's

350
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
There's a whole population out there

351
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
That's your has a

352
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
Did you amine went when you pitch it to investors who invested in

353
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
I mean

354
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,151
Were they saying oh this is awesome I can't wait to jump in or was it just said

355
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
We're just saying

356
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Did you get 11 knows we got a ton of nose

357
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,855
The main reason we got so many nose is this was run now inserted 1999-2000 this winter in the hold. Combo

358
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Yeah and we were very old economy

359
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
And so are you know people would much rather throw millions of dollars

360
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Something.com

361
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Then

362
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
Put a few maybe 10 or $20,000 into a

363
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
A beverage company

364
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
Acuity versus come in and say you know you should follow or bison

365
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,847
What am I supposed to do every everything in

366
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
Fancy message from Boston they said you know well you know you could

367
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
You should be an energy drink cuz that's really growing

368
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Ba.com

369
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,623
You know if you made the product cheaper you can make better margins on it

370
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,487
I don't sound like you're interested in the opportunity accept everything that we do

371
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,631
But we also need it to really succeed in the long-term we had to be different than all the other big companies

372
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
And if we

373
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
To create a sweet tea there are tons of companies already doing

374
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
But when you were in those early days

375
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,127
Taste grader

376
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Maybe they're right

377
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
Well there's no question that would have led to

378
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
But it would have

379
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Diluted but we were built

380
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
This was about building something

381
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
We could always believe in that we would

382
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,743
That would be meaningfully different of that to take people in a different direction you have to

383
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
Disrupt where they're going

384
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Seth Coleman

385
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
In the moment when we come back so that explains how honest he became an actual political issue in the 2008

386
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Presidential campaign

387
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,663
I'm guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this

388
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
We are

389
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
Support for this podcast on the following message come from The Economic Development Authority of Fairfax County Virginia

390
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
Located near DC

391
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,423
And home to 8900 technology companies and 144,000 technology jobs

392
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Details at Fairfax County Eda

393
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Support also comes from Delta

394
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,223
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world that's 300 cities were many people do the same thing

395
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
You do that's 300 cities where people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know of

396
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
About that one place

397
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,791
And 300 cities where people miss someone and one of Delta's other 299 cities

398
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,887
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together

399
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,471
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first place

400
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Delta

401
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Keep climbing

402
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,359
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

403
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
Capital One is reimagining banking

404
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,783
By offering accounts with no fees or minimums that can be opened from anywhere in 5 minutes

405
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Capital One

406
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
What's in your wallet

407
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Capital One na

408
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
It's how I built this from NPR

409
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Harrah's

410
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Early 2000s

411
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
Honesty and become one of the highest

412
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Selling beverages

413
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Whole Foods

414
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Things were going pretty well

415
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
It was a hit

416
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
At the time the company had its own bottling

417
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Are Pittsburgh

418
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
And something happen there

419
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
They could have

420
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
Completely destroyed the company 2003

421
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
We had a delivery of glass that was

422
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Salting

423
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
And on their lot of blisters in the

424
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Glass water leak

425
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
And so

426
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
We ran it

427
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
The production line

428
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
Entered with languages that if it ever sees a defect in the bottle it's supposed to

429
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Kick it out there

430
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Reject the bottle

431
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Madeline didn't do that

432
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
And so we ended up with some

433
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Product in the marketplace that

434
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Had broken glass

435
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
What's inside the bottle

436
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Contact with two different Whole Food stores

437
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
And Whole Foods has a rule three-strikes-and-you're-out

438
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,247
Fortunately no one got hurt or injured but

439
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
We did have

440
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Bottles with p

441
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
No we can't afford as a business

442
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Toulouse

443
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Biological

444
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
So we voluntarily withdrew all product

445
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Every store

446
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,399
How much did I well we were doing about

447
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
3 million for $90 in sales in

448
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
Totally stopped

449
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Our sale so we lost several months

450
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
$700,000

451
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
But huge

452
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
Is momentum stop or who you're trying to build you got your salespeople at trying to sell product instead now they're going to be calling all and

453
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
Nnn it was just painful

454
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Retractable until the 8th

455
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
You're so mean

456
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
When I'm spending sprees we were sharing hotel rooms and

457
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Cutting Corners everywhere we could not on the ingredients but you know

458
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
I'm just trying to

459
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
Kit to keep the lights on

460
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
So what were you like what were you paid us as

461
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
My first year salary was at 50,000 literally I took that $50,000 check and it was even

462
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,783
Who is tax-efficient cuz I'm done with the company that I paid myself

463
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
I don't think I got over a hundred thousand

464
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
For probably not

465
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
BAC stock

466
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Really gross

467
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
This time with their like lots of other companies are offering to it

468
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,007
Are you guys out by lots of companies along the way it was very

469
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Parsley cuz we're growing quickly

470
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,639
Antarctica's we are doing something others weren't doing

471
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
So really from

472
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
From the first year we every year so we get

473
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Search by image

474
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Buddha Beverage Company

475
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
That wanted to Tobias

476
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
An arid like one of those

477
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,391
Most companies will

478
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
Jet Li and ends ends has a kind of friend you write with

479
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,143
End

480
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,495
We were always that was another thing I could lose sleep about competition

481
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
You and Barry owned like what

482
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Like 90%

483
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Even though you had

484
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Invest right

485
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
How are you able to do that

486
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,807
Well this was one of the key strategic elements that Barry brought to the

487
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Professor of Game Theory and so

488
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
He said you know the problem with so many startups is the

489
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Entrepreneurs give himself all these penny stocks in the beginning

490
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
And as a result they start with a

491
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
Much more stock than everybody else

492
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,167
And then everybody else's kind of

493
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
She comes along for the ride is it but what if

494
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
Instead you started the founders at the same place as the other investors

495
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
And only when the company grows in Valley

496
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
Do the founders get more equity

497
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
That's

498
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
It was it was a reverse structure

499
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
And what that did

500
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Was it helped

501
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
As we grew and we raised more money we didn't get diluted

502
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
The other thing was we relied on Angel

503
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,464
A lot of entrepreneurs in the Venture Capital Motors

504
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
Basically

505
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
There instead of istick to own more of the company

506
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
Incentivize to exit quickly

507
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:29,216
And we didn't take that kind of money and I'm very glad we didn't let the I think that was a key piece that let us

508
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
Keep control

509
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,544
What when did you when did you start to realize that

510
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
You know like honesty was

511
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Is it becoming part of like the

512
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,712
Cultural Zeitgeist funny moments there was a moment in

513
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
2008

514
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
President Obama had becoming honest tea drinker

515
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
I guess if the campaign for 2008

516
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:52,000
And the McCain campaign ad that criticized him for being a node Out of Touch lyrics

517
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Drinking organic

518
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Stock of it in his life

519
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,200
A few years ago when you keep brought over his the body man there

520
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Wow

521
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
At what point were you able to

522
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Feel like

523
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Well

524
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
I would say so

525
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
When Coca-Cola became invest

526
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Stern 2008

527
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
That was a surreal experience

528
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Because

529
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
They approached

530
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
They approached us with a purchase in 2007 and they had just created

531
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Venturing and emerging brands

532
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,032
And their goal was to invest in and build the next billion-dollar brand

533
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
And so

534
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
You know going to the headquarters in Atlanta sitting down with

535
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
The chairman

536
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:48,320
And and soda party was like looking down like I'm really here we really having this kind

537
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
So that was the first moment this is actually going to work this is going to be around

538
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
Coke by about 30% to 40%.

539
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
And and they bought an option to buy a majority which event

540
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Holi in 2011

541
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,240
But like this was your accompaniment did you feel like you were

542
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
You're getting way control

543
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Well

544
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
You know the story

545
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
So often

546
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
When a brand is sold the entrepreneur

547
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,784
Really frustrated in and they butt heads and that you are transferring around last few months this friend of my friend of mine it was

548
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Vitamin Water

549
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
But he left shortly after

550
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Coca-Cola body

551
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Please ignore the first few

552
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
First few weeks they want to know your

553
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
And the next few weeks I want to know your phone number

554
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:35,680
I don't want to know you

555
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,032
Medicredit they understood this is a branded that is different than what they sell them

556
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
Connect with the OrganiCann

557
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Consumer or the Natural Foods Marketplace

558
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
And so they gave us a saint

559
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Incredible latitude in

560
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
And there were moments where

561
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,088
We ran up against them around regulatory language or

562
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,184
Or just marketing approaches and they respected what we did so

563
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
What's so

564
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Continue to surprise me

565
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
This brand of storm Iran

566
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
The biggest part with the distribution we were in 15000 stores

567
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
When Coke invested never-never a hundred.

568
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,496
So that's that's where the

569
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
I hope my numbers are right that early investor

570
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
People who put in $50,000

571
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
Beginning

572
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
Made return of one point

573
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
$5000000 10 years later

574
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
That's right. 26 x there

575
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,696
Hurley investment how many millionaires were created by honest

576
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
I don't know

577
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,560
To me what was so exciting and some of our employees were where

578
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Timmy was

579
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
You know that was all Sweat Equity

580
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
So that was a special

581
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Meaningful

582
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
The question I've asked everybody who's on the show

583
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
How much of what happened

584
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
With you in Burien honest

585
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
T was

586
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Because

587
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
You guys are just

588
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
Really good at what you do and how much

589
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
I really don't believe in luck

590
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
I believe that the reason we're still here is

591
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
The perseverance

592
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
And I took centers luck

593
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000
You know that it's the timing the way the consumer has evolved

594
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,864
But you know I've heard something so that you were in the right place at the right time

595
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
Took 10 years to get to that right place so this was not a

596
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
This present

597
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
You know something that you

598
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
Just happened overnight

599
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,152
A friend of mine liking it to water you know eventually water finds its way

600
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
2

601
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,248
Going downhill and it gets to where it needs to go and I think

602
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
We finally

603
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,344
That's a place where we could connect with consumers

604
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
And doing the way that we still meeting

605
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
So I'm curious as you

606
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
Metallic look back on all this

607
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,304
1 Train

609
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
You either developed

610
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Add

611
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Or have it

612
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
You think

613
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
All entrepreneurs need

614
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Well

615
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,104
You have to be resilient in this is this is something that's so important

616
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
To put this on the bigger picture.

617
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
4like RR

618
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,576
What are the best ways I develop resilience growing up was I wrestled in high school

619
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
I was the worst wrestler on the team

620
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,488
My first year I was one and 10 and I was only cuz somebody didn't show up and I got the forfeit

621
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
So I had

622
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
I'm learned how to fight off my back

623
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
You know Nann

624
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Experience Project

625
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
End

626
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
It's so important

627
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
2

628
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Be able to bounce

629
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Not just

630
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
All the time

631
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Am I tan

632
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,384
And especially when you believe in it

633
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Makes it that much easier

634
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,552
Add Chef Goldman founder of honesty

635
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,392
By the way the company has sold more than a billion bottles of

636
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Beverage

637
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,976
It's all completely owned by Coca-Cola with

638
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Annual sales of more than

639
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
170 million-dollar chess

640
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
It no longer formerly involved

641
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
And though it made him a rich man

642
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
His life hasn't

643
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
She changed all that much

644
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Steph still lives in the same house

645
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
Suburban Maryland

646
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
Where he made that first batch

647
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
Honesty

648
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,832
And please do stick around because in just a moment we're going to hear from you about

649
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
The things your building

650
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
But first

651
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
A quick thanks to one of our sponsors

652
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
American Express

653
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
No matter what you do in business

654
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
From building a

655
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
A better mousetrap to building a better app

656
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
It's easier when you

657
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
You don't do it alone

658
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Powerful backing of American Express

659
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
Don't do business

660
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Without it

661
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,128
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because

662
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
It's time now for how you

663
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
You built that

664
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
The story we ran

665
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
About a year ago

666
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,856
What's 1 * 1 Jaya Iyer was Raising her three-year-old daughter in Oakton

667
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,208
My daughter told me that she wants to grow up to be an astronaut

668
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
So that's when I started looking around for clothes with astronaut or space team and I realized that there was really no

669
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Turn on for girls

670
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,776
Ensure Jaya could have bought an astronaut shirt or pajamas in the boys department but

671
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Her daughters

672
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Favorite color

673
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
What is Pink

674
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,408
I actually looked every place

675
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,504
And there was nothing at all not a single pink astronaut

676
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
But as turned out Jaya was

677
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Just the right person to

678
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Tackle this

679
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Problem she actually has a

680
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,976
PhD in clothing merchandising

681
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,376
So I actually got in touch with some freelance designers and I created a few designs like I made a monster

682
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Drunk

683
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
It was on a t-shirt

684
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
Didn't say anything boy about it I made a pink T-shirt with a race car on it

685
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
Cool firefighter online course child also sketched out

686
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,968
That pink T-shirt with an astronaut on it

687
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:40,576
She put her drawings online she launched a Kickstarter campaign and she raised

688
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,720
30000 bucks and I was lucky that I had the support of my husband who is always

689
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,328
Let me know if you really believe in is going to do it so with the kickstarter money

690
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,656
Jaya found a factory in India willing to make the shirts

691
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
She then expanded her lines shirts

692
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,568
With computer code test tubes and a solar system that glows in the dark

693
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
All for kids

694
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,640
There was a problem

695
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,784
We actually had a lot of parents reaching out to us saying hey we don't have anything like this for the moms of these kids

696
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,856
Lots of moms who work in science were

697
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Asking about clothes for grown ups

698
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Tocaya started designing

699
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Dresses with things like the

700
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,816
Periodic table the double-helix the solar system

701
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Equations

702
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,936
Many school teachers College professors actually on our customers

703
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:34,336
It makes them feel great about teaching math and thing that hate America mattress because I love math

704
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
And if you feel like Miss Frizzle since we first spoke with Jaya last year revenue is

705
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,808
Toronto about 1 and 1/2 million dollars in

706
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
She sells items for men like

707
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Cufflinks

708
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Ties and socks

709
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
China culture company Spa Harwich

710
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
Is the name of her

711
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Her daughter who

712
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
By the way

713
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
Is now a 6 years old and no longer wants to be an astronaut

714
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
That may be a singer or robot designer
