1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey everyone it's got here so

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
2 years ago

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
Edible Aspen or her name is Macy

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,424
And may arrive

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
In the US

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,472
Basically not

7
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
Knowing a soul

8
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
20 years later

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,872
She wound up sitting next to President Barack Obama at the White House

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,200
Advising him on how to create jobs in America

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
Because creating jobs

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,296
Was exactly what nation was doing

13
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
With the

14
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Candle Company

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
She don't

16
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
From the ground up

17
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
This episode first aired in March of 2017 it's a

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
Super amazing story and

19
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Hope you enjoy it

20
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
We registered for the New York gift show which is the Holy Grail

21
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
I'll trade shows and we thought that this is going to be the ticket to Our Success

22
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,480
But you were wrong it was a complete disaster

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Ron NPR how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Stories behind the movements they built

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,520
Gyros in the story of how he left China for America

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
Use Campbell's Soup cans to make candles

27
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
Turn that into a multibillion-dollar company

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
So almost

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
Everything about the way Macy's life

30
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Turned out

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Is improbable

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
The fact that she started a business

33
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
That she makes candles that

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
She even lives in America

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
None of this was supposed to happen

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
And she describes it

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
Growing up in China in the 1970s

38
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
This was

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
I like living in a movie without

40
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Color

41
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,872
When we grow up there was absolutely nothing everyone wear the same thing everyone would

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Eating the same food everyone had

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
The same small apartment life was very happy in a sense that you don't have to be jealous of each

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,672
Each other you don't have to be wanting things you cannot have in the 1970s

45
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
China was still a black box

46
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Closed off too much of the world

47
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Actually the government realized

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
He needed better diplomats

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
People who spoke foreign languages well

50
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Sail around the time a turn

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
12

52
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
This is 1979

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
The government decided to open up some boarding schools

54
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
Praying that next generation of diplomats

55
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Animation

56
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
Was one of the lucky

57
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
If you who got it

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
So

59
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
We learned

60
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
Western culture American studies

61
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
Renaissance art all in English

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,304
And I knew more about Smithsonian and the locations of each art

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
The many Americans

64
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
And this was the thing about

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Learning a language a language is really living it

66
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,824
I remember it was very funny that I was watching Godfather at 14

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,408
Which has a lot of violence a lot of sacks in a lot of murders

68
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Enjoying it we we thought it was

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
You know something that

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,624
Everyone in the United States to honor every given day it was a pretty Charmed Life

71
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Especially compared to other Chinese kid

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
May was on the fast track to becoming a diplomat

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
That was one problem

74
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
In the spring of 1989

75
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
Chinese students started to organize demonstrations

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Going for more reforms

77
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
But we now know as the Tiananmen Square protests

78
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
After 6 weeks

79
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
The Chinese government

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Crackdown

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
Help me she wasn't an activist at the time but that didn't matter

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
The government decided that educated young people like her

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Wharf rat

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
So they were sent

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Out of Beijing

86
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
They assign me

87
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
R2a Northern City

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Very cold

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Not even the city a suburb

90
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
My job

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
For the whole year is going to

92
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm watching a warehouse

93
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Four minerals that are going to be for Oxbow

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
So I have a clipboard

95
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
I have 2 highlights of a day

96
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
When the truck comes to pick up one load I put a check

97
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
And then it came again in the afternoon I check

98
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
That'll be the day

99
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Follow you

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
You must have been miserable

101
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
I was beyond miserable

102
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
At that time I was already dating my

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
First husband

104
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
His name is David

105
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,607
So we were very close and being

106
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
Far away was obviously not a good

107
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
Arrangement on top of that

108
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
What I worried most

109
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Is that for 10 years

110
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
I was practicing

111
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
And speaking English

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
And language is very easily forgotten

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
And I barely speak

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Chinese animal in English

115
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Because my boss does not like to talk

116
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
He's a man with few words he smoke most

117
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
What time

118
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
And that's my life for

119
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Samain

120
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
She decided to quit

121
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
What to do

122
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
He was a trained geophysicist and

123
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
She spoke English

124
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
It decided to apply for temporary visas to come to the US

125
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
And after 2 years of waiting

126
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
They got them

127
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
So I flew to Washington DC

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
When we arrive at Dulles Airport I was very slow

129
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
Sleepy because up to jet lag and I saw to size

130
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
American

131
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Citizen and the other is aliens

132
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,975
It's just as you arrive at immigration

133
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Edward alien

134
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Was

135
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,655
Kind of confusing to me because I remember aliens from Star Wars solo from you know

136
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Go science

137
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
He said I was so excited I said wow

138
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
They actually have a

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Section 4 alien

140
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
And

141
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
So I got very excited I said let me see

142
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
I'm certainly not American citizen so I guess I'm

143
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Going to have to go to the ATM part and that's

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Great cuz I can see them

145
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
I never knew that the word idiom means the nun American on Green

146
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
I guess they realize that too they changed

147
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Do something a little bit more human

148
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
What was it like to adjust to the US and you had that serve embrace yourself in American culture urine

149
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Entire childhood

150
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
When you finally arrived here

151
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Did it surprise you to disappoint you was it

152
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Lonely

153
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Well I don't find it particularly difficult to adapt

154
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
What I find interesting is that in Washington DC

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
People

156
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Kind of avoid

157
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
That's something I stood

158
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
I think was my first impression of the city

159
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
I was riding the subway

160
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,887
And I found a very interesting that as quickly as I look at someone they merely change the eyes

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
And they try to focus on reading

162
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
And I said to myself I said wow this is a beauty

163
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Deep

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
City because everybody's always reading

165
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
David Icke volume

166
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Apus where you able to

167
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
To find a job

168
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
Yes so I found a job in New York

169
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
It was a job for

170
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
American

171
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,623
Medical device companies to export equipment

172
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
To Chinese Hospital

173
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,927
And was it

174
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,815
Interesting work if you enjoy it was boring I have to be honest with you it was a lot of paperwork pushing a lot of

175
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
Import export documentation working with

176
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
You know different factories about

177
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
A SKU numbers and

178
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Pushing a line of credit

179
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Through the banks

180
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
But what's interesting out of

181
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
The party's not so interesting thing is that

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
They put me in a hotel

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
Next

184
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Bloomingdale's

185
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Why was that answer

186
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
Well imagine a bird out of cage I

187
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
I've always been interested in fashion

188
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,071
Many people wonder you know if you grow up in a country without any fashion how can you really have an eye for it

189
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
When I was

190
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
You growing up in the foreign language Middle School

191
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
China at that time already started exporting

192
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
Fashion and they would have those rejected fashion

193
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
And they put them on sale

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Near the bus station

195
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
So we would be jumping from one

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Place to another looking for

197
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Cheap fashion you know

198
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
So that was always something I'm

199
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Very interesting

200
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
And when you're put next to a

201
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Bloomingdale

202
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
That was the best thing that can possibly happen

203
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
So what you would just go in

204
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Everyday I would go starting

205
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
I found the first floor which

206
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
You Don't Own Me

207
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
South ladies that they spray

208
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,615
Fragrances and everybody hate them not me I love him since spray on me

209
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
I like

210
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Being

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Sort of in the middle of

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,575
Something that launching and be able to tell what's in in the fragrance that I like and dislike

213
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
And then look at the packaging packages always fascinating to me because I grew up in the country with

214
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
No touching at all

215
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,839
But what interests me the most is a fashion floor and it's usually the second floor

216
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
And just

217
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Being amazed

218
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,287
And I love the women in New York the way they are so confidence and they dress

219
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
Centos colors in those shapes and they look

220
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
And then I would always end in the home Department

221
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
And it would always

222
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Give me a lot of question because

223
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
It look like it's in the 1920s

224
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
What's the weather look like

225
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
Furnitures will very ornate it has a lot of

226
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Dairy

227
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Gilded finish

228
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
And then the place I like

229
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Laura Ashley Princeton a very small Grandma's

230
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
Wallpaper

231
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Floral

232
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
And I'm just

233
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,127
Wandering the person who is so confident walking on the street will go home to

234
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Sheepish

235
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
It's so disconnected

236
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
So I keep saying that to

237
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
David

238
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
When we talk on the phone

239
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
He hear me with Loathing in in DC

240
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
Bmdc I was in New York and I would get up

241
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
At 5 on Monday and took the first train

242
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
And I'll get home at 9 on Friday so it's not really

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
A very good quality of life and I was

244
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Calling him about what I discovered was very exciting and then

245
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
I continually

246
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Bring up how disconnected

247
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The fashion and home

248
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Apartments

249
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,223
Finally he said may you seem to be really upset about this commute

250
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
He said

251
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Maybe we should start something

252
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Cu

253
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Seaquest and you

254
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
And then then what was the plan but what was the business you guys were going to do so we knew if it's going to be home because we know where is home

255
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,839
Home Goods because the fashion business is dominant

256
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
By Brent

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
And we feel

258
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
The home business is left without bread

259
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
And that's what we see.

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Opportunity

261
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
It's close the gap between home

262
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
So that's how I do it we don't know what product

263
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
We just quit

264
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
At the same time will you just like started brainstorming in your in your apartment or your house of the time I try to figure out what

265
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
What to do

266
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,415
Not only without each other but we reach out to her friends

267
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
So we brainstormed with our friends

268
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
And as a result of that

269
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
When we started the business

270
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
In the middle of

271
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
1994

272
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
I would quickly got a lot of feedback

273
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
People send me samples me

274
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Pictures

275
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
And we

276
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Zoning on

277
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
About four categories

278
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
The first UBC

279
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
Surprises silk flowers I don't know

280
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Fake flowers that never die

281
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
The second category is accessories for your car so

282
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,183
Seat cushions something to make you feel comfortable when you drive for a long distance

283
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Add a third category because I know this American Doll was so popular

284
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
Is a kind of doll that

285
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Can rotate with music

286
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
And the last

287
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Something that I did

288
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Even think it's interesting but I

289
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
I think it might have an opportunity

290
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Candle candles

291
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Every category mentioned

292
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
It's a huge business in this country there

293
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Getting some dollars

294
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,039
That are in each of those Cam Newton have access to massive

295
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
No Ben Because the Internet wasn't available

296
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
It wasn't and I don't really know

297
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
What difference we will make

298
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Other than

299
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,327
You know making it cuz I'm better but I didn't even know how hard it is

300
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
Is that actually good that you don't know everything

301
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
That you don't know how hard it is that you just have

302
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
I got that something can be

303
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Down to make it better

304
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
There's no amount of research

305
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
That can prove

306
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
And idea

307
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
But there's one thing you can always do which is to take your product to the market

308
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
So that's what we did

309
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
How did you get the products by the way

310
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
Date they sampled us

311
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Dave send by FedEx or DHL from China

312
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
We haven't imported them with

313
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
December 8th December

314
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
DHL FedEx

315
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Text whatever it is said that

316
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
What time is available silk flower seat cushion flowers I think David brought some of those back by up breaking his back also

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
The suitcase

318
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
And by that time it was September 1994

319
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,063
All the major wholesale trade shows take place twice a year

320
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
In January when people replenish their goods

321
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
After holiday

322
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Adding summer when they're buying more

323
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
For Christmas

324
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,559
But it was September so the only show we can possibly go to

325
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Is sing Charlotte North Carolina

326
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Why what happened

327
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
90% of a business

328
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Came from the candles

329
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
And and what

330
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Did the candles look like where they just

331
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Candles

332
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Fair

333
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
That you don't see them anymore they're called glow candles that round

334
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
And they look like stained glass

335
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
And when you burn them they are glowing

336
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
From within

337
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:17,695
So people came up your booth and they were not interested in anything else is up flowers of the car seats it was

338
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
It was at that stained glass

339
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,327
Looking cattle because holiday and it was gift-giving season

340
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
And it's a great gift

341
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
Pakistan after the show eating disorders

342
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,519
How did you do how did you deliver them how did you get them to customers

343
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,383
We rent a very inexpensive Warehouse with office in the front

344
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
I was kind of Ford many people four times we just have one part-time

345
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
To help us

346
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
End

347
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
We were able to use our savings and our family and friends

348
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Helped us

349
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
To the first container was a 20-foot container not even a 44

350
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
What container

351
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
And then we ship them

352
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,119
Very fast we got reorders

353
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Yes

354
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
So what was the candle

355
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Retailing for

356
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
$15 the most

357
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
We probably will take

358
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
50%

359
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Margin on them

360
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
So it was

361
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
Almost half a million dollars a business redid

362
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
In 4 months

363
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Insane

364
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
I mean where you David just like

365
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
Shocks by the candle thing we were taken surprised by the

366
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
That we would not

367
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
Expected to do so well for the first

368
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
4 months of our business

369
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,607
And we were shipping everyday I'm

370
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,655
I was a sales manager

371
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
I was assistant

372
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
I was accounting

373
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
I was

374
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Taking product out of the

375
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Icontainers I was everything

376
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,943
Okay so you shut this container from China and then you deliver all the stuff to your client

377
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
And then what did you guys do after like what was what was the next move for the company

378
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
The second year I decided since the trade show it's so important

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
We registered for the New York gift show which is the

380
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
The Holy Grail

381
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
I'll trade shows

382
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
So we went to the New York Gift Show

383
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,191
And we thought that this is going to be the ticket to R6S

384
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
But the show which is

385
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,359
10 times bigger with an international audience told us that we were wrong

386
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
It was a complete disaster

387
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
You

388
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,759
Are trying to sell kidney sink handles that you're importing

389
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
China and

390
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Fennel salad

391
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
End

392
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
I was devastated

393
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,231
Because it's a very expensive trade show I'm assuming at this point I mean

394
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
You must have

395
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Certified senior mind that maybe this candle business

396
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
It was a fluke maybe the fact that we did so well that first

397
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
4 months

398
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
Just had to do with Christmas

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Exactly

400
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
That was the thought

401
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
But I wasn't giving up

402
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,103
I was always more International minded

403
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
I was already scheduled to go to visit

404
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Frankfurt

405
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Germany

406
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
Because every year in February there's a big

407
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Home Products show caught on Beyonce

408
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
An Ender

409
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Imai very depressed

410
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Moments

411
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
I need it to go there to see what

412
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Potentially be the next thing

413
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Because what I envisioned

414
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
For home

415
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Is already there

416
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
The design is very streamlined

417
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Sandals

418
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
Everything from home furniture

419
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
2 lighting and table top

420
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
The colors are very bold

421
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
They have oranges

422
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Lavenders

423
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
And they have those

424
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Beautiful contrast with white

425
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
And

426
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
I was so happy that I went there because it's confirmed

427
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
That

428
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Home and fashion could be in sync

429
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,607
Soap soap doesn't change your trajectory Avenue still

430
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
Have a candle business where you bringing these like stained glass window candles

431
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
King from China

432
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
Yuan Frankfort you see these beautiful streamline designs

433
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
And you think

434
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
What

435
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
So I could use that

436
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Design elements in Kendo

437
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
That you would design your own candles that was always my thoughts even

438
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,463
Is a diplomat I think not many people end up doing what they're trained to do but that's training is very helpful

439
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Because I was exposed to a lot of

440
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
Art education when I was very young kid

441
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
So I started

442
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
From the very high level of Art

443
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
And that it trickles down to

444
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
The fashion

445
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
It finally goes to home

446
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Portrait Johanna change your approach to two

447
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
What you were doing

448
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
So I came back

449
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
Very refreshed from and invigorate

450
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,783
From what I see and really I was determined

451
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
That I'm going to really start to do something

452
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
And

453
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Another thing I discovered by

454
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
Starting to pay more attention now to candles

455
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
Is that my competitor in the US

456
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
Vapcell candles

457
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
In the Millions

458
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
And probably billions

459
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
And I ask myself

460
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
Why do they buy it all year round

461
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
It's not because they have

462
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Patton it's because

463
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
The power of fragrance has been written

464
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Men and women over the years

465
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Happy wearing fragrances for many reasons

466
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
But for home it takes on a very new meaning

467
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
So that was that you you basically decided to

468
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
That point to start making

469
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Scented candles

470
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Yes

471
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,303
At that time we were for the first time joined by a permanent

472
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
Employee which is

473
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
A friend of David

474
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
His name is Richard

475
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
And he and I went to visit

476
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,799
One of the fragrance vendors in New Jersey to learn how to make candy

477
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
So he and I went in his speed up

478
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Hunchback and

479
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
For 4 hours we learn everything

480
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
The one need to learn

481
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
About making face and candles

482
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,671
So many people think about candles and they say how hot can it be I can make it

483
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
With my eyes closed

484
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:43,839
Jose that you just pour some wax and then you put and then it's going to be a candle

485
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,447
But if you want to make it a business and you want to make sure it doesn't burn someone's house down

486
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
She actually have to study how to make it because

487
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
A candle is both

488
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
A piece of art

489
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
And a lot of science

490
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Five things that are interacting with each other

491
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Is the fragrance

492
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
It's the base which is the wax

493
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Is the color pigment

494
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Is the WIC

495
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
And finally

496
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Is the vassal

497
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Which is the glass or a container

498
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
And if you don't do all those five things perfectly would like what was the wrong

499
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,191
Well have you ever seen candles that has a lot of black soot

500
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
That's because the wick is too big

501
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Or you could have

502
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
A candle

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
That simply tunnel burn into the middle

504
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
And you don't smell anything

505
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
That's because

506
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
The formula

507
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
And the witch

508
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Optimize

509
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
So happy that you visit there and

510
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
What you drive back to Maryland you start

511
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,719
Experiment we were bursting out of excitement we sell wow we're going to start making freaking candles for

512
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
The first time and

513
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
We decided to

514
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Experiment what we learned

515
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
We didn't have the most when we went home

516
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
So instead

517
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
We will always

518
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
Eating a lot of Campbell Soup

519
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,615
Campbell Soup Campbell soup noodle soup

520
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
So we said these are great sizes

521
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Siletz used

522
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
For molds for mode so we started mixing in our kitchen

523
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
With our regular pods

524
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Oils with wax

525
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
With colors

526
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,303
One thing we forgot in our excitement is a chemical that blend the oil really well with a wax

527
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
So that when you

528
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
Take it out of the modes it looks very smooth

529
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
We forgot that camera

530
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
What happened is a random Hobby

531
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Because

532
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
When we took the candle out of the mode

533
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
The candle look fossil

534
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Fossil

535
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
Because of the oil not blending very well

536
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
So can I have this aged look around if it has a snowflake

537
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Endnote

538
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Candles I like

539
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
What is snowflake would be on different part of a candle

540
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
Everything looks

541
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Handmade

542
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
And on top of that

543
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
I blended fragrance different

544
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
I put vanilla with

545
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Lavender

546
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
I put

547
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Watermelon with mint

548
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
Where many people just have

549
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Best rate

550
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
Vanilla or straight watermelon

551
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
Is that the secret sauce of the the fragrance

552
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,687
Yes and many people say

553
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
The reason why they burn favors

554
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Is the finishing touch

555
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Cleaning at home

556
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
When they want

557
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
2

558
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Finish

559
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
And since that

560
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Home is ready for that

561
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
You know friends and family to come

562
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
For entertaining or

563
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
When their husband and children come back

564
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Tom

565
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
You want to put something

566
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Tomorrow

567
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
It's a clean house

568
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
So they put a candle

569
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
It smells like a cookie it smells like a

570
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Fresh cotton

571
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,920
And that's why people continually by the can

572
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Because they need to pray for

573
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
As You Are

574
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:47,136
Really kind of honing in on what what this product is is going to be is that when you came up with the name

575
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Yes

576
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
So think about those colors

577
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Beautiful cobalt blue

578
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,584
With a lavender with a honeydew bring not home to Greenwich everybody use

579
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
Sunflower yellow white

580
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Think about

581
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
What it means it means energy

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
It means fresh

583
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
And this is where we give the name

584
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Because we were living Annapolis

585
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Annapolis Maryland Annapolis Maryland

586
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
And many times

587
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
I would take my dog for a walk

588
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
I like how Annapolis

589
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Bitties

590
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,832
Still today is to very quiet

591
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Is not the Hampton store

592
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Any other

593
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
Yuno sushi place. Very down-to-earth

594
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
It's very real

595
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
Christina sent that to me

596
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Coming from China

597
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
It is very untouched

598
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
And

599
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
It stand for natural

600
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
And I want

601
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
Communicate that because our

602
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Candles are not touched by lava chemical

603

Natural finish on AR

604

Texture

605
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
So we just called it Chesapeake Bay candle

606
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
When we come back how many Cy.

607
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,536
Making an enemy out of the one person she needed to get her candles into Target

608
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936

Gyros

Macy

650
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Stumbled across a new kind of candle with

651
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,480
Bold colors mixed

652
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Fragrances

653
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
And now

654
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
She just needs

655
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
To convince someone

656
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Dubai

657
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
So I called blooming

658
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
And I was

659
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,488
Working with the secretaries

660
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Begging and pleading that

661
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
I have a great product

662
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
So finally she gave me the name of the buyer

663
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
The fire is really important they are the eyes and ears for any company and particularly for Bloomingdale's

664
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
You can imagine that

665
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
That the standards really high

666
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
When I describe two candles

667
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
What's the texture of the fragrances

668
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
And the colors she was very intrigued

669
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
So I got it

670
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
Appointment right away

671
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
And

672
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
You know when I went there

673
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Didn't even sit down

674
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
They started

675
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Taking a candles and show

676
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,048
Everybody around in the office

677
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
And you New York Gotham

678
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
So I take it Bloomingdale's maiden maiden order

679
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
They loved it

680
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
They just showed it to their

681
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Bosses and we got it

682
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
First order

683
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
To ship to

684
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
The store said I have been

685
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Going so many times

686
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
How did you

687
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
Produce enough candles to

688
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Kill that order

689
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
So here comes the best

690
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
I was frustrated

691
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
Because

692
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,720
At that time China did not have a home fragrance industry

693
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
To produce that kind of oil

694
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
You need a chemical compound

695
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Facility

696
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
And they were not used to that

697
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
They used to

698
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,960
Delta cinnamon send their Jasmine's overseas

699
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
The French and the US will then

700
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
Turn them into

701
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
Oils for fine fragrances

702
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
Call for Food flavors

703
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
But they don't have industry themselves

704
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Sister Chinese word

705
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,784
Making fragrances like this head like

706
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
How are you able to even start that

707
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,648
So I talked to a few factories in China

708
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
They look at me like a

709
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
You know

710
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
That's a problem because

711
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
They certainly wouldn't take on a project

712
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Like that

713
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,376
I was frustrated I told my sister about this

714
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
And she too

715
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Was very determined to help me

716
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
So she said I'm going to quit

717
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,056
And she said I'm going to start a factory

718
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
In 1995

719
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
So that was the year

720
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
When we started have our own Factory which changed

721
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Everything to me

722
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,320
Perfect look is it you can do that you can just

723
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
Build a factory is already 95 so you can put

724
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
Ceccoli in that part of China

725
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
Is very entrepreneurial

726
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:16,608
There are Villages that make nothing but buttons or Village that make nothing but candles

727
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
So

728
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Having a factory is possible

729
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,776
But we have borrowed very heavily from friends and family

730
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
To build that

731
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,408
From scratch your sister builds his Factory and starts manufacturing the candles and

732
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,736
Would you working like crazy where you always working

733
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
I'm always thinking

734
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Because I'm

735
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
I was always thinking about the next color

736
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
The next fragrance that can mix order next

737
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Packaging that we can put together

738
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
So

739
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
I was always doing a lot of things at the same time

740
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
What were the things at that time that

741
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Kept you up at night what were the

742
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
That certain guys you have

743
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,496
I was never have time to worry I'm a very optimistic

744
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,312
Sick person but I was always wondering who is our next

745
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Customer so we stole

746
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
To Nordstrom right after Bloomingdale they're very similar companies

747
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
But in 1995 and 96

748
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
My eye started

749
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Search for

750
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Who is this

751
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Company that's

752
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Trending

753
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Dave

754
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Represents some demographic change

755
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
Stop

756
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
Shopping list

757
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Yeah and I I started to focus

758
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Why Target

759
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
Base ten for style and Design

760
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
Versus Walmart which stands for value

761
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
And it really inspired me

762
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Because I really said

763
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Describe two design

764
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Fall

765
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,272
That philosophy because I came from a country with a

766
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
A lot of people

767
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Without a very poor

768
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
And

769
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
I know a lot of teachers of mine

770
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Who has

771
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Great taste

772
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Who would never be able to buy things

773
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Instead of so expensive

774
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Tibet Bloomington

775
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
So

776
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
How can I make it more fertile

777
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
How can we make it so we can sell it for

778
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
$20 purses

779
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
$80

780
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
So

781
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
I knew it's going to be the

782
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Growth for us if we can get in

783
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Because it's already 700

784
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
50 stores

785
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
National

786
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
And they have two dedicated Isles

787
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
With 48

788
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Feet of

789
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Candles

790
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
So who do you who do you call there

791
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
So it was pretty straightforward

792
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
You can find the name of the buyer there was a telephone

793
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Extension

794
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
End

795
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
You can leave message

796
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
And you

797
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Call Epperson

798
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,936
So this is the time when I always say you

799
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
You cannot give up even if you call for a whole year which I did a whole year every month at the same time

800
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
I called and left message

801
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
And you said what

802
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
I said hi

803
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:45,600
Same thing I did with Nordstrom and same thing I did with that I have a great candle

804
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
And now I can't even say it

805
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
It's sold at romanatwood

806
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Juicery

807
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Target buyers

808
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,072
Listen in and they say wow they already at those stores we want to be those two

809
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
Or so they would usually return your

810
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Your phone but not

811
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
The buyer

812
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
And nothing silent Asylum

813
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
So how did you

814
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
Had you finally break through with so I have to say this

815
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,432
Probably one of my biggest failure is that I started to get frustrated and I said

816
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,248
To the receptionist she's not returning my call

817
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
So she said I think you could

818
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
Call her boss

819
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
And makeup

820
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
Which I did I basically say well you're one of your buyers have not met

821
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Any return phone calls

822
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
2 minutes later to buy a call

823
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
And she said this is so and so

824
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,216
And just so you know this is not a way to start a relationship

825
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,288
And she hang out and she hung up on you

826
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
Wow so you were

827
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Finish the time.

828
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,992
Every time I call again if it's her voice I didn't even leave

829
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
My voice message kept calling even though I kept calling

830
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
I can't call that you were shut out at that point I basically

831
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,488
So I waited until the next year in April

832
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
And it was a very different voice

833
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
It was a very cheerful voice

834
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,888
It was a new buyer it was a new buyer

835
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,752
And I like my message and I got it back in 2 days

836
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Finally

837
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Come

838
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,384
Because as you can imagine every new buyer wants to make a difference

839
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
I want to make that

840
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Denmark

841
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
And she hurt me

842
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
So she said why don't you come

843
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
And I did

844
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
Where's our headquarters

845
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
Pepe's Minneapolis

846
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Right around

847
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
So I flew there

848
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,720
And she was very young she was probably in her

849
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
Late twenties and she coming

850
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,840
And she was sitting down listening to my pitch but

851
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Halfway through she has to get up

852
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
And smell the candles from the bottom

853
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Candle buyers

854
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,776
You should want to smell the candles from the bottom

855
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
That's when the oil settle into the bottom

856
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
And you smell the most

857
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
SpongeBob

858
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,456
And so what you saying chief

859
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Did she put an order in

860
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,552
Basically in a big store

861
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
It's a lot process

862
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Dubai

863
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Play Asia

864
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
Capability questions pricing questions

865
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
Cherry pick what they want

866
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
So I didn't expect

867
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Anything to happen

868
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Josh Smith

869
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,656
If I put it in my store how soon can you ship

870
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
That was the moment when I froze

871
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Because I said what do you mean

872
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824
Are you going to test because I heard they test a lot

873
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
That do testing 50 stores

874
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
100 stores

875
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
She said no me I wanted

876
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
Put it in 750 stores

877
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
And I said

878
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,112
Oh in that case and I started

879
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
To calculate in my head

880
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
How fast

881
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,232
My sister's company can produce

882
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
With 700

883
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Beast Wars

884
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
And I said

885
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
6 months

886
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,448
I just have perfect that would land Us in October and you can ship it so it arrives

887
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
In December

888
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,520
And that's when we set for spring

889
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
An end how big was ever

890
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
That order end up being

891
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Over $1000000

892
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
And the forecast for the year

893
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
End up being over 3 minutes

894
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,112
How did Jamie soap so basically it mean when you call your sister and you said

895
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:03,744
We have a sword from Target we have to make how many can't even remember how many candles you had to make it's probably

896
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
Half a million candles

897
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
How many candles

898
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
What was

899
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Factoryville

900
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Mapreduce

901
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
That was going to stretch them

902
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
They were going to have three ships

903
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Everyday of the week

904
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
Just like 24/7

905
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Yes

906
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
We'll have to hire people

907
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
To work 7 days a week

908
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
And the thing about the the target

909
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,016
Shipment is that is really daunting

910
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
When you think about people scamming that business

911
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
That's one of the things people

912
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Overstock

913
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,184
Think about is financed how to finance a big order

914
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
I mean it.

915
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
The second female ask is legit

916
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
Physically how do you turn over 20 containers

917
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
Oh candles

918
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
In two days

919
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
And we don't even have to

920
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
The physical space

921
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
Ways to turn 20 containers

922
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
In 2 days right

923
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
So we rented

924
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
A very big empty Warehouse in Laurel

925
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
In Laurel Maryland Maryland where are

926
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Other warehouses

927
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,784
But there's no electricity

928
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
So we parked up

929
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Two cars

930
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Used to headlight

931
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
To light up the warehouse in the evening

932
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
And we literally

933
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
Packed and unpacked

934
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,304
Using aqua love you you

935
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
David Richard

936
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
And two or three of our warehouse workers

937
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Five of us

938
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
All together

939
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,800
Witch Hunt over 20 container was five people in the US have the time

940
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
5 to 6

941
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Fulton paper

942
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,224
And we went into holiday season some somewhat absent-minded

943
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
Waiting to see when the product will show up on the shelves

944
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
I showing up right after Christmas

945
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
R Prada

946
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,488
That's what they're but it was radio silence there was nothing coming from the buyer from Target

947
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
Until when

948
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
Hunter 2 weeks after it was set

949
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
And I get panic order

950
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Call from the buyer

951
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Some a word

952
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Big trouble

953
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
Oh no they didn't get all the

954
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Products or

955
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
You're not moving at all

956
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
No

957
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
We are under forecast

958
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,736
We could have sold 8 million dollars off your candles this year

959
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
And you need to go back to China and build a bigger factory

960
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,392
And we need to catch up because I don't want to be empty shop

961
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
In April or March

962
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
So is that what you did

963
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Guess what we did

964
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
And we found a much bigger facility

965
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
And we all fit it

966
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
So that

967
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
By March

968
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
We started shipping out of the new facility how many factors do you have

969
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
So we have one in

970
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Hangzhou China

971
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
As the first factory

972
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Now we have whining High phone

973
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
In Vietnam

974
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
And now in Glen Burnie Maryland

975
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
Clouseau

976
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
It's a lot more expensive to

977
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,112
To manufacture candles in the US

978
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Why are you doing it

979
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
I came to this country

980
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
And I'm a citizen for many many years

981
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,840
Always want to find product that said meaning

982
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,144
USA when I go back to China

983
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
And I couldn't find them

984
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Everything is always made in China

985
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Made in Indonesia Made in India

986
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
I think mating USA stand for something

987
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
We may have not real

988
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
People believe that

989
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
There's integrity

990
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Andeavor cell

991
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Cool fact

992
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
With product says made in US

993
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
And we haven't

994
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Strada

995
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
Did you think you had a competitive advantage

996
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
In part because you are an immigrant and in part because

997
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
Everything in America was new to you and your kind of

998
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Knife

999
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
I think that's

1000
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,912
Precisely

1001
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
I think immigrants

1002
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
A self-selected

1003
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
They are self-selected group that is

1004
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Dairy Pig

1005
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Taking risks

1006
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
In some ways they have

1007
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
The same Trace

1008
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Panniers already

1009
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
Instead of taking what's easy

1010
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
What's already

1011
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Familiar

1012
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
They choose

1013
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Unfamiliar

1014
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Unchartered

1015
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Because they have more confidence

1016
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,696
And they have more curiosity

1017
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,768
So in selecting themselves as

1018
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Immigrants there already

1019
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Facing big risks

1020
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
From a company that you started

1021
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Is it is an afterthought with

1022
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
Silk flowers and car seat covers

1023
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
To accompany that

1024
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
I seen does

1025
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Reportedly

1026
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,224
Like 60 to 70 million dollars a year in Revenue

1027
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
It's a

1028
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Pretty amazing

1029
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,600
We could you have imagined that when you came to the US

1030
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
A temporary Visa that

1031
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
That you would be running a company that

1032
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
It's so big

1033
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
So remember the alien story

1034
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
Yeah remember I thought I was

1035
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
You know going to meet an alien and discovered that I was

1036
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Actually the alien

1037
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
How cool is it that an alien

1038
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
Next president of United State

1039
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
And talk about

1040
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
How to create job

1041
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
In America

1042
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
That was me

1043
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
In 2012

1044
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
I was creating jobs in the United States

1045
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
Cuz I'm a factory and

1046
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
The president's office

1047
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Took note

1048
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,768
And he invited 13 of the biggest manufacturers such a

1049
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Ford

1050
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Intel

1051
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,888
And I was invited because I was a small business

1052
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
And

1053
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
I was giving advice

1054
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,032
As to why it makes sense to revitalize

1055
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Manufacturing in this country

1056
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Hawaii

1057
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
That we have not done enough

1058
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
For those company

1059
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Sprint jobs

1060
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
So I feel very fortunate not only

1061
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
Was I accepted not

1062
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,904
Just as a florna you know I was able to giving a path

1063
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328

Hey thanks so much for

1097
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Sticking around because

1098
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
Time now for how you built that

1099
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
And today

1100
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
We're updating the story that we ran about a year ago and it has to do with beer which if

1101
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
Yourself you know it takes just four ingredients water

1102
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:28,672
But everyone knows about and you've got your yeast which is kind of where the magic happens but Wednesday

1103
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:35,072
Jean-Pierre in college important ingredient is actually Grand Masti malted barley and you take

1104
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:41,472
Can you mix it in with the grand kind of like making a batch of oatmeal and oatmeal is the key word here

1105
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
Because when Dan and his friends were making their own beer they noticed it all the leftover piles of wet barley

1106
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
Smells kind of like breakfast food smells like bread very fragrant but none

1107
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
That Brewing books told us

1108
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
What to do

1109
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
With this grin

1110
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
Deleted put it in a dumpster this is happening around 2009-2010 and a few years later

1111
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:09,120
Dan was in the Bay Area where craft breweries were Brewing

1112
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
We started to notice that a lot of those breweries

1113
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:18,848
Just like him we're turning out huge mounds of leftovers spent grain that smells like food

1114
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
It looks like food and so it was really pretty low-hanging fruit to think okay well maybe we can make food products out of this

1115
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Luckily for Dad

1116
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,344
Your friend named Jordan who would work in the food business

1117
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,952
Ginga and called a bunch of small breweries in the Bay Area

1118
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,792
And he starts to drive around with these big plastic tubs to

1119
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
Hiccup all of this used grain I threw out my back a few times

1120
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Yeah it's heavy

1121
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:50,848
So anyway they take those heavy tubs of barley to Jordan's parents house and

1122
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,479
Just experiment by took my mother-in-law's recipe for loose granola

1123
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,879
Oats and flax honey cinnamon

1124
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
And eventually they decided to turn the granola into snack bars low sugar high fiber

1125
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,679
With a great eating experiences not a much bar at can I eat like a rice crispy treat

1126
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:22,079
Did the snack bars on friends and at farmers markets in. So great

1127
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,151
Found the bars to be a bit dry

1128
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:31,551
And to be a bit Hokey Pokey

1129
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
Until we get bit stuck in people's teeth and one of the mouthfeel descriptors that we got pretty consistently was Poke

1130
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
So to eliminate the Pokedex Dan Jordan decided to grind the beer grain into

1131
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
Two more of a flower and then from there that really solve the texture issue that we did launch and I would have a great product that selling

1132
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:58,431
Really well we got another one on the way and the snack bars are now on sale in many parts of the

1133
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,271
The US and on Amazon since we last spoke with Dan

1134
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
Ian Jordan has managed to get there bars in the Whole Foods in eight different states and when we first met

1135
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
Friendly story both Dan and Jordan had just quit their day job to run the company now more than a year later

1136
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
They're finally able to pay themselves a salary and I'm not buying a house anytime soon unless it take

1137
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,871
Take it down payment and then nutrition bars

1138
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:34,271
Is called regrained and Beltway reclaims networks do not taste like beer but they do have

1139
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:39,647
Aerie names like chocolate coffee Stout in the honey cinnamon IPA

1140
