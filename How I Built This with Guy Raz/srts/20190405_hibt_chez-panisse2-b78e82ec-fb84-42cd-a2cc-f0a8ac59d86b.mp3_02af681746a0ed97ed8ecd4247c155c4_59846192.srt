And I hope to see you in San Francisco

34
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
I had never had a wild strawberry

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
Intensely flavored

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Picture of cream on the side and a bowl of sugar if you needed

37
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
And I couldn't have enough of them and I wondered where they came from

38
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
And they told me you have to go out in the woods and pick up

39
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
NPR how I built this

40
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
Show that animators entrepreneurs idealist and the stories behind the movement they built

41
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
I'm guy rosin on the show today at the farm

42
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,136
To table movement from her California restaurant and sparked a global revolution in the food industry

43
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,472
So if you open up the latest edition of the famous Michelin Guide to the San Francisco Bay Area

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
You will find 57 restaurant

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
In and around San Francisco

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
It happened granted 1 2 or 3 Stars by the notoriously fussy Michelin reviewers

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,320
Getting a Michelin star can turn a sleepy little Bistro

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
Find a restaurant that takes reservations 6 months out

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,256
The kind of place that is essentially impossible to get into

50
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
These are considered to be the most

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Innovative and inspiring

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Palaces of food

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
In the world

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
But one restaurant perhaps one of the most

55
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
Famous in America

56
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
It does not appear on michelins list

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
Is located in a converted old house

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Berkeley California

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Call Chez Panisse

60
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
And today

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
It's the kind of place well-to-do Berkeley parents might take their

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Children during a visit

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,672
What kind of restaurant food tourists will seek out

64
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
Mainly because of its contribution to modern cooking

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
He's a great restaurant

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
You're not going to find saved Frozen orbs of aged balsamic vinegar suspended in Yuzu July

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Your plate

68
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
What you will get

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Is extremely fresh

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Really local farm-to-table food

71
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Perfectly ripe Peach with a

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Scoop of creme fraiche or a roasted Quail with some blackberry jam made with just picked black

73
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
Berries grown a few miles away

74
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
The person behind that restaurant

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Alice Waters

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Notable for cooking

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
She's probably much better now

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
3 impact she's had on American Cuisine because Alice Waters was really one of the first American chef

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
Promote the idea that food should be local fresh and seasonal

80
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,896
Today almost every good restaurant in America pays homage

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Farm to Table cooking

82
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,016
They tell you the name of the farm where the chicken came from and to

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
Ethan the farmer who grew the crops

84
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
And Alice Waters

85
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Is largely the reason why

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
But when she opened Chez Panisse in 1971 in that old run-down Berkley house she wasn't necessarily true

87
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
Trying to start a movement

88
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
I really just wanted a nice cozy

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
Any place where she could invite friends to share a meal

90
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
Grow up intending to be a chef

91
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Is a kid in New Jersey

92
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,663
She ate a pretty typical American diet of that era

93
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
Her mom wasn't exactly the greatest

94
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
Cook and she focused instead

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Unfancy

96
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
She wanted something healthy for us but you didn't

97
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Know how to do that

98
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
She knew

99
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
You know

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
Meat potatoes vegetable

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Salad fruit cup

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Producer

103
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
The most

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Bus from a can

105
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Or Frozen

106
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
She

107
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Funny brown bread

108
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
Semi sandwiches

109
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
Very try and

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
Spread with peanut butter and bananas

111
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
I didn't

112
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
I like food very much.

113
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
Was a very picky eater

114
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,207
And this was a time of a food revolution in a sense of the way we think about it today but the food revolution of the

115
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Late forties and fifties was

116
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
And and Frozen and then eventually

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
Microwavable ready to eat

118
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Meals

119
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
I remember when that frozen meal

120
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Came

121
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
In

122
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Prepared

123
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
You just stuck it in the oven and

124
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
People saw that is as wonderful

125
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
Innovation nobody thought

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,087
This is processed food right beside it is amazing what we can actually

127
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
We actually more time now

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
Thought we were a country that

129
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Didn't have

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
Deep Roots

131
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
In agriculture

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Growing

133
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Food

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
Foretaste

135
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
We always screw it

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
For quantity and ship ability

137
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
But never

138
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Flavor

139
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
And we

140
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
We never had

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Strong

142
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Sense of the table

143
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
A place

144
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Of

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Conversation

146
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Pleasure it was

147
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
Much more of that sort of puritanical

148
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Just

149
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
We're here to eat

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
And she will up

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
I'm so when the fast food industry came in

152
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
It just

153
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Hold us up by the rest

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Sure gif

155
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Cul-de-sac

156
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Yeah and we went with it

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
Went with the ideas at

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
What's easier

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
To do this it was fast cheap and easy

160
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
And

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
Even my parents who had a

162
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
How to garden in the backyard

163
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Stop

164
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Applesauce

165
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Yeah

166
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
So you I guess

167
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
By the time you hit your teens you

168
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
The Family movie

169
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
I love that right you moved

170
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,799
To the Midwest and then to California was this for your dad's job yes

171
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Give us

172
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
He was transferred to Chicago

173
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,943
And then he was further transferred to Los Angeles

174
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
So you went to so you decided

175
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,831
When you graduate high school you went to the University of California

176
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
In Santa Barbara

177
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
And this isn't the early 60s

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
And what about

179
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
What was your impression of the place

180
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
Mount Davis party placement

181
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
Right by the water on the beach

182
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
And

183
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
I decided

184
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
To transfer to UC Berkeley

185
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
And the fall of 19th

186
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
64 to the fall 1964 you end up at UC Berkeley

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
A junior college or a sophomore in college

188
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
And that really imagine you're getting there at the time when this is like right as that the

189
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
The Berkeley

190
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Free Speech movement

191
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Is starting out

00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,519
Really and Wendy remember thinking there's something different about

258
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,615
Food in the connection to food here that I have never experienced

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
Before was it almost instantly after you arrived

260
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,503

We student line

262
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575

And then you got it

264
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
It was more

265
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Race back to work to the rooming house and if we had some apricot chair

266
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399

To see what was inside of these little restaurants

272
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
That we're all over

273
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Paris at that time

274
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
They were very small and had

275
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Paper claws

276
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Antique candle lighting

Unique poses

278
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Food sitting up

279
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
On the tables as you walked in

280
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Beast

281
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
I just really fell for it

282
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Did you start to

283
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431

284
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Food markets

285
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967

True one of those markets the really old Market Street

288
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
On my way to school

289
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Was it just like

290
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,303
Shockingly different to what you have seen in the US

291
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
They different

292
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Because it was kind of

293
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Bus was the supermarket

294
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Yeah and this

295
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751

296
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
You know life

I didn't call them farmers markets was just the part they was too smart

304
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
And all the food

305
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Was

306
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Really

307
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Had area in and around Paris

308
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,887
Would you would you watch the markets in Paris and see produce

309
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
That you had never seen before

310
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Oh indeed

311
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
You know I had never had

312
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
A wild strawberry

313
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Not talk about that

314
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
As being the moment

315
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
When I said

316
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
In what was defended to eat

317
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Paper tiny

318
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
So intensely flavor

319
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
And to who

320
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
Preserved hepatitis A

321
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
A little picture of cream on the side

322
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
And a bowl of sugar if you need to

323
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
And I couldn't

324
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Have enough of that

325
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
And I wondered where that came from

326
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,847
And they told me you have to go out in the woods and picks up

327
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
I didn't know

328
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,527
That I was being imprinted in that way in terms of

329
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Seasonality

330
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Because you

331
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,231
You went around with your French friends and things

332
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
Picky about

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
What restaurant

334
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,703
And you aren't used to that and I was hungry and they would not allow

335
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,103
Wants to go into the place until they had examined the various menus

336
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
To see who had the food that was the tastiest

337
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
They have those clamps where did they come from but it wasn't just about food

338
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
The discourse at the table we would sit there maybe two hours

339
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,935
Talking politics talkin talkin about life and

340
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
I was fascinated with that conversation. To table

341
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
So you so that year obviously

342
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
Was going to be a turning point in your life what you didn't yet

343
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,943

344
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783

00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831

348
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Think all right

349
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Did my year in France and I'm

350
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Chris Moore I did my hair

351
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
France and now I'm back

352
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
The time

353
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
I was cooking

354
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
I wanted to eat like

355
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
That pushed me

356
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
To explore the markets and try and find

357
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
The taste

358
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
I couldn't find

359
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
You know

360
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
I wanted to eat in French restaurant

361
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
In the city

362
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
I saved all my money so I could eat in the fancy French restaurant

363
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
But it didn't taste like

364
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
Csr2 finished up

365
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,823

Depends who is teaching Montessori School

369
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
And

370
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
She told me all about Montessori

371
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Plus

372
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
Of teaching

373
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743

374
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047

Is really sinking

376
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
About the world in the same way I am

377
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
The idea of opening your senses

378
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
Because those are the pathways

379
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,151
Into our minds that you're touching

380
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Hastings

381
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455

382
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
You're listening

383
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
You're seeing

384
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
And that's what

385
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Happened to me in France

386
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
I had Awakening of my senses

387
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
And I slept well

388
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Maybe

389
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
I could teach

390
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,375
I Montessori school and there happened to be one

391
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Right down the street

392
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
In Berkeley in Berkeley

393
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
So you say you

394
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
Got a job there is a is a preschool teacher or

395
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
End end

396
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
You can open did you must have

397
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
Enjoyed it at mine was that did you think

398
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
Lithium versus maybe what what I'll do

399
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,831
It was like that although I was very challenged

400
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Bye

401
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
326 year old children

402
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
I've never been around them

403
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
For did you ever at a certain point so you know I'm

404
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
I think I want to take

405
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
Cooking classes I want it I want to

406
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Surfboard learn how to do this

407
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
No

408
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Intimidated by that

409
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,823
I thought it was

410
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,455
You know complicated and that I would be exposed for my

411
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
Ignorance in the way that Julia Child felt

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
At the beginning of her cooking

413
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
But I wasn't

414
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
As determined as she was to

415
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Chop

416
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
A pile of Funyuns properly

417
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
So that I could excel at

418
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Claps

419
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Funny to experiment

420
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
At home

421
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
And just do

422
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
But I

423
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
Thought I could do well

424
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
So it's a late sixties you're teaching at a preschool

425
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
And enjoying cooking at home

426
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
How did you start to show

427
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Under this idea that maybe

428
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
You want to open a restaurant

429
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Well I was cooking

430
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
For a lot of my fence at

431
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Our house

432
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
I was living with a printer

433
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
And he was very political

434
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
And

435
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,847
Invite friends over for dinner and

436
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
A group was producing a magazine called the San Francisco

437
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Express-Times

438
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,623
And so they would gather at the table

439
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
And I started cooking for them all

440
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
In fact so much so that they said that they liked it and ice

441
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
Started doing a little cooking column

442
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:51,007
Colt Alice's Restaurant

443
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
And in total

444
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:59,455
Waited 30 of those but broke buying the in

445
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,063
Maybe

446
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
I could open a little place

447
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
And then my parents would pay

448
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
To come and eat there

449
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,535
And I had the encouragement

450
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:19,679
Other extraordinary friend gift with Tom Luddy

451
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
Running that Telegraph Repertory Cinema

452
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
And it parties for all of his filmmaker friend

453
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
John Licata and Francis Coppola and you were just cooking for them

454
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,791
They were dinner parties and they were crazy so I'm trying to

455
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Recreate this moment and oftentimes in the on the show we get to this moment you know there's a business plan

456
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
And there's a you know very methodical kind of process if it isn't it just like yellow

457
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Do this do this because Tom is pretty extraordinary person

458
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:11,391
And he saw that I had that inclination he took let's just go

459
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
I need to know that little French restaurants in restaurants in San Francisco so we could get an idea

460
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:24,191
Of what it is that you're looking for and we had gone

461
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
To a very special restaurant out in Bolinas that was in a house

462
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
I was very struck by that maybe it could be a restaurant in the house

463
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,623
Because then I could feel like I was cooking at home

464
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
And then I saw this place

465
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
In Northbrook

466
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,815
This is where Chez Panisse is today on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley

467
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
What what what was that

468
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
Play wasn't that a house for rent

469
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
It was a it was a plumbing shop

470
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
It was in the house

471
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
And all the pipes in over at

472
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Front

473
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Insert at the Courtyard in front

474
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
And it was so

475
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Very plain stucco house

476
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
2 floors

477
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,879
I love the location and it was commercially

478
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,024
You were broke

479
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Because you were spending all your money

480
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
Denny's dinner parties

481
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
Just a business question from I mean it

482
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Did you

483
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
How did you even have

484
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,848
The money to sign a lease or to make a commitment or

485
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
To refurbish the place did you have to go and ask

486
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
Friends to absolutely

487
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
And my parents

488
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Mortgage their house

489
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,928
Well they had please believe me they believed it all

490
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Their kids

491
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:57,376
I guess we should acknowledge that you also did borrow money from other sources

492
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:02,240
A story that you got some money from like

493
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Pot dealers in Berkeley

494
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
It's true

495
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Okay so see you get get this lease and remember how much money you had to raise from

496
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
Family and drug dealers over like

497
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,648
You have the confidence to like

498
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Sign this this lease agreement

499
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,768
I don't remember exactly

500
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,448
People who gave me some money is still on the board of directors Shay pennies

501
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
And he was a friend of Tom lettuce

502
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,664
He found the people that had

503
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
The confidence

504
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
That I didn't have any says I think you need to get connected with Paul erito

505
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:54,720
Because he has cooking skills and he's got all these copper pots

506
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,280
He knows how to make a risotto

507
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
I'm sure he could be a part for you were these people who were investing in

508
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
Yuan restaurant did they think that they were investing in that they were going to get a return on their investment or what

509
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
Was it just like hey this is a cool idea Alice like this is Ruby let's play some

510
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
This was the seventh

511
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
The early 70s

512
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
And

513
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
Ashamed

514
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,184
If I had been looking to make money

515
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Nobody

516
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
Who is involved with this project

517
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Expect

518
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Make money

519
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Hooked

520
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
But we didn't expect

521
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
It was celebra flops

522
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
And

523
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Weaver

524
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
Doing it

525
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
In this

526
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Fairy

527
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,736
Non-professional way if he will

528
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
I thought I had a little bit of a

529
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,368
Experience because I had waited on tables

530
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,208
In a couple of places to make money in high school

531
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,560
So when you when you really kind of start to ramp up to open up the restaurant

532
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Are you never run arrest

533
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,728
Is a really challenging business most restaurants

534
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Eventually fail

535
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
Where you at anyway intimidated or nervous about all of those people who are putting their faith in this thing

536
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Working

537
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Or not

538
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
I know

539
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Was really good

540
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
The people would come

541
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
I knew that

542
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
Absolutely I neuter

543
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
But I was too intimidated

544
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
How to cook at

545
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Beginning

546
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Victoria Cross was the first

547
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Cook at the restaurant

548
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
We practice at home

549
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
And me

550
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
Really deeply read about it

551
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
And so

552
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
We

553
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
But we could do

554
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
One menu a day

555
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
So this was not

556
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
Ambitious

557
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
We didn't

558
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
When were you able to actually open the rest

559
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,584
August 28th 1971 and this was a French

560
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
Traditional sort of traditional French

561
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Restaurant

562
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
And what what is the inside of the restaurant

563
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:20,384
Look like what did you have a an idea what how you wanted it to be

564
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
From my French friend

565
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Mighty

566
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,504
And she was an artist

567
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
She had lots of ideas

568
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
About

569
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
How we could find things

570
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
Flea market

571
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184

572
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488

Find silverware mismatched silverware

574
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,936
Flea market in Alameda

575
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
And we had

576
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Red and white checkered

577
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
The tablecloth

578
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
Flowers on the table

579
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
When did the Kindle

580
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
And Martin design

581
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
Very first poster

582
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,624
That we had for the restaurant to be put in a frame and put out

583
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Front

584
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
That night

585
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
I greeted people at the door

586
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,352
And what would you serve in that first meal

587
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
That first night

588
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
We served

589
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Pate en croute

590
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Cornichons on the side

591
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
And then we had duck

592
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
With olives

593
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
And I think that was Victoria

594
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
She felt really confident

595
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Putting the

596
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
Trays of ducks in the oven

597
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Stuck fat everywhere I remember

598
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
And with olives

599
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
And with some sort of

600
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Celery root

601
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Jurassic

602
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
And Lindsey the pastry chef made a thumbtack and how much was that

603
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
But Samuel I think it was 395

680
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
You haven't got a business school and you

681
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
As you say you didn't

682
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
You didn't go into this

683
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Thinking you wanted to make money in fact

684
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
That was anathema to you in some ways but

685
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,152
You still had to run a business cuz they were people whose livelihoods were depending on the sand part

686
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
Is that what was happening where you kind of

687
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
It's value

696
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448

715
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
He would bring them in

716
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
The restaurant

717
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
And he said

718
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Give me one day

719
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
I want you to come out

720
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
And see the dumpster

721
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
And I want to have me pulled it open

722
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,552
Didn't smell very good needs

723
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
I want you to get in the.

724
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
I want you to know

00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928

Not careful

729
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
About

730
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
The way you put garbage

731
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,400
In this container

732
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
And it was a big wake-up call for me

733
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
You were the center of this

734
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
Hub-and-spoke and still are

735
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,688
But at that time I mean it it's

736
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,832
It it strikes me that and I hope I'm not the sort of extrapolating but you

737
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,160
Wanted to do this because you loved

738
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
To do it and you wanted to be around people you liked and he wanted

739
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,608
People to be happy but a business and inevitably you're going to run into

740
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,704
Challenges with birth with person out with people who just are

741
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
Not working out did you

742
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Those early days

743
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,592
Do you know what if you want to fire people was it

744
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,688
Was it hard for you what if you had to discipline people did you just avoid that

745
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
I try to avoid that

746
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,064
I did but I eated it

747
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,624
Different way

748
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Try to hire friends

749
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,720
That

750
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
Really help me to self

751
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
When you're working in the business

752
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
And you're working

753
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
15 hours a day but I figured

754
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
To be with people I liked

755
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
And that I shared the value Swift

756
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
So I was willing

757
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,784
To take the risk of it not working out

758
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
Unfortunately

759
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,416
There were very few times

760
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,720
We're at that became an issue

761
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
What

762
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,280
What was it that was

763
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Riving you at that time that was really motivating me because you weren't making money and you weren't going to make any money for a long

764
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Long time

765
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
I'm in and it seems like

766
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Money wasn't

767
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Really

768
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
A source of tension

769
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Right I mean is that

770
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
Is that was at the secret at least at the beginning because

771
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
Everyone says don't hire your friends don't work with your friend

772
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
But if I get some money is not really

773
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
This thing that everyone is chasing that there's no

774
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
There's no condom

775
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
Because money is really the center of conflicts in business

776
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Yes it is

777
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
And I wanted

778
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
Chase and

779
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Chase

780
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
That I

781
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Wanted to be in

782
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
And that it was constantly

783
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
Growing and changing

784
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
And

785
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
That happened

786
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
When different people

787
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Brought ideas into

788
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
I think what

789
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Really

790
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Has

791
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,672
Created the smelling life

792
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
For the rest

793
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
Is the fact

794
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
That

795
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
We don't have

796
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
One person

797
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Who is

798
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
The main chef

799
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
The restaurant

800
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
We have two people

801
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
And they share their job

802
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
They work three days

803
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
And then they're paid for 5

804
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
And

805
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,176
It allows us to

806
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
Time to recover and have ideas

807
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:34,880
This business was your baby at that point I have to imagine that

808
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
You're working like

809
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Crazy

810
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,256
I was working all 7 days a week

811
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,120
Just about seven days a week. Closed on Sunday

812
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
I just

813
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
Threw myself into it What was

814
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
What was the thing that just kept

815
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,128
Kept was it that means some people describe the fear of failure some people describe

816
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,456
You know the the bottom line some people describe

817
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,040
This sort of intangible passion like what

818
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
But what's up

819
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:09,440
You showing up for 15 hours a day 7 days a week

820
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Only one menu

821
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
It's different every day

822
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
You have to find

823
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Those ingredients

824
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,192
You have to put them together differently

825
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
People have to

826
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Want to come

827
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
There

828
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
And taste that

829
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,920
Maybe I was pushed more

830
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Quickly

831
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
Into

832
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
Finding ingredients and I really believe that that

833
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Sort of

834
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Search

835
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
Let me to the doorsteps

836
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
The local organic

837
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Farmers Branch

838
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,096
But it was that the game

839
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
I kind of

840
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
And challenge

841
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
To the restaurant

842
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,336
I guess it was maybe 73 or 74

843
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,408
Ivy most famous food critic in the United States

844
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
The time James Beard

845
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
For Whom the

846
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Famous award is named after

847
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Key to the restaurant

848
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,624
And a couple days or weeks later says this is one of the

849
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
The four best restaurants

850
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
In the United States

851
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
What what happened after that came out

852
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
Cuz you were like this

853
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,608
Collective

854
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Communal

855
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
The all of a sudden this guy says one of the four best restaurants in

856
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Annapolis

857
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Socratic

858
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
In one way

859
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
But

860
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Play it made the restaurant

861
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Incredibly busy

862
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Assertive

863
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
Almost to overwhelmingly so

864
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
That we were

865
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
Prepared for that clientele this is probably ultra-wealthy people flying to the bear

866
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
Area for the weekend and eat at your restaurant right

867
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,240
I think probably some of them were coming

868
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
And that way

869
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,640
Ultimately it led to my conclusion that

870
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
My friends couldn't afford to eat there

871
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
And couldn't get in

872
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
Maybe

873
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Think about it

874
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
Really seriously

875
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
I think again at Tom's ID surgeon

876
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,256
Did I get back to my wrists

877
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
That I really loved

878
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
Simple food

879
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
And it was a trip

880
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Italy

881
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Actually when I

882
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,056
Saw a pizza oven in about 1978

883
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
That I said

884
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
We need to

885
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Kate

886
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Caffe Bistro

887
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
Upstairs

888
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
That is more affordable

889
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
That is more affordable

890
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
We

891
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
Don't worry about

892
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
Money so much

893
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Because

894
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
Pasta isn't too expensive to me again

895
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Baby Pizzas aren't 10

896
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
That would be a place

897
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
Four friends together

898
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:06,848
As as restaurant to get more attention especially after James Beard and more

899
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:13,248
Media attention you started to become a celebrity you started to become a famous

900
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
Person Acheson Berkeley but nationally-known was that strange for you or I mean did you even

901
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
Absorb assimilate that idea or were you just

902
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
What kind of doing your thing

903
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:29,376
I mean you can't help but be impressed friend

904
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
Newsweek magazine wants to put you out to cover and I never

905
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,896
Expected that kind of attention

906
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
2

907
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
What I thought was

908
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
A pretty simple local

909
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,368
Community restaurant in Berkeley California

910
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
I mean what was

911
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
Clear to me then

912
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,328
And is very very clear to me now

913
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
Is

914
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
That

915
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Weaver

916
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
Doing something

917
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,312
Against the fast-food culture of

918
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
This country

919
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
That we were created

920
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
Emil

921
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
That

922
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Was supporting

923
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Slow food movement

924
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
That was

925
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Actually

926
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Buying its food

927
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Directly from the people

928
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Who took care of the land

929
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
No Middleman

930
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
Giving them all the money

931
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
Then they brought their values

932
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Into the restaurant

933
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
And that

934
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
It changed us

935
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
And we became

936
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
Really political

937
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
We started writing their names

938
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
On the cafe clips

939
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
The disc came from Popcaan arts for

940
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
If this came from Del Porto's Ranch

941
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
That this

942
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
What's Mas masumoto speech

943
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Identifying the people

944
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
Growing and raising the food

945
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
We became in a way

946
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Co-producers

947
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
Did people come to you and say Alice

948
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
You know we got a

949
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,456
We don't make Chez Panisse cafes and Chez Panisse expresses and you know you got to

950
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,296
Branch on an open open them all over the country in the world in and we can

951
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,856
Get investors and Venture money and we can

952
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,696
Do a whole Alice Waters line at Target in and Kmart and

953
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,000
I mean that must have happened right

954
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Earth tattoo Tappan

955
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
And

956
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
A few times

957
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
August

958
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
Almost tempted by the money

959
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
What happened why didn't any of that happen

960
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
It didn't happen because I really

961
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
Feels like

962
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
It's important

963
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
That

964
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
You fine people

965
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
That share your values

966
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
When they do

967
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
There's a run

968
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Breathe life into it

969
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
And should make some money from it

970
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,192
I just couldn't imagine knowing have franchises work

971
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,008
If that there would ever be away

972
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
To do it to do in the way that

973
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
That align with your own values

974
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Yes

975
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
Feels like selling out

976
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
I had to use that term to put

977
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
It feels like

978
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
I'm doing it

979
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
Just to make the money

980
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
I just cannot

981
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Think about it

982
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
That way

983
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
But it's

984
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
More than that I

985
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
I can't ever imagine

986
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
Flying around the world to visit

987
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Thai restaurants

988
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
What I like

989
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
About being

990
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
I restaurant

991
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Trees

992
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
Know the people who works there

993
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,687
And it's the pleasure of my everyday life I

994
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
I'm friends with them

995
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
I know the customers who come in

996
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
I love

997
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,391
That aspect of it this was

998
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:09,791
Maybe we could if we stopped that the story here it would be impressive and Chez Panisse was this really cool restaurant but

999
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,399
That's really not me that's plays for the beginning of the story because

1000
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
What's interesting about

1001
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
About Chez Panisse is that

1002
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,775
There's a virtual consensus among

1003
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Shops in the United States that

1004
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,967
What we consider farm to table you know which every restaurant does now or talking describing

1005
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,527
The source of of produce like

1006
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,855
They all agree that started at Chez Panisse in the late seventies that

1007
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
This was the restaurant that really

1008
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Creative

1009
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
The farm-to-table movement

1010
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
How did that happen to me

1011
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
You were a French restaurant

1012
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
And

1013
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
You are serving great food but

1014
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:53,311
Was there was it just the kind of a Natural Evolution or did you reserve point where you thought

1015
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,663
Look one California this is like the breadbasket of North America

1016
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
You know we can actually

1017
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,527
Source all the stuff locally and until people are come from

1018
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,111
It happened sort of

1019
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
Naturally I'm not

1020
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,463
Not really consciously trying to do that

1021
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
It became

1022
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
California

1023
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Without us

1024
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Really

1025
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
Identifying that right away

1026
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
In California meant

1027
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,287
Local seafood in cooked in a toaster oven

1028
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,127
You know I'm fast way right for me

1029
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
For sure a very simple

1030
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Kind of cooking

1031
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,783
And we are really at the beginning it

1032
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
In this country

1033
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Discovering

1034
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
The ingredients that we have to

1035
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
And I

1036
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
Have always been

1037
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
On

1038
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
The organic

1039
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Spectre

1040
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
Really insistent

1041
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
And how the animals are

1042
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Cared for

1043
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
And what they are fed

1044
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Sleepzy I wanted

1045
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
To be about

1046
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Purity

1047
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
We need to be

1048
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Thinking

1049
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
About

1050
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
All these different aspects

1051
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,087
For the survival of the planet

1052
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,671
And for our nourishment

1053
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,231
When you start to focus on

1054
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,279
Local food

1055
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Farm to Table

1056
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,351
Which I guess you didn't really call it farm-to-table

1057
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
Did you

1058
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
Think that you were building

1059
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,775
A movement that you think that this was going to become

1060
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,335
Something really big or did you just

1061
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,151
Do it because you thought that was the right thing to do

1062
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
Well at the beginning

1063
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
I thought it was the right thing to do

1064
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
But I

1065
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Felts

1066
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,623
Potato and in the late 70s to early 80s

1067
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Especially

1068
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
When the caffe

1069
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,487
Became so successful

1070
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
That

1071
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
We had this audience

1072
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
And that we need to talk about

1073
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,655
Taking care of the land

1074
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
For the future

1075
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
And it really

1076
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,031
Became into my Consciousness when

1077
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
My daughter was born

1078
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
And I felt like Japanese

1079
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,455
Could not be an island unto itself

1080
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
That we were

1081
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,575
Upstream and around the world

1082
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:18,975
And I became very conscious of that and it's

1083
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Started

1084
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
To actively

1085
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
Talk about it

1086
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Every way I could

1087
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,935
Every article that was written about the restaurant

1088
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
From that point on

1089
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Was

1090
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Really

1091
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,335
Talking about how dependent and

1092
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
How easy it is to

1093
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
A relationship

1094
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
The farmer

1095
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:48,159
And how was talk to that person on the phone or to see

1096
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
Farm

1097
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,511
Aunt and talk about the planting and

1098
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,351
Grow your own

1099
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,655
Back to the land movement

1100
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,751
It's something that I hope happens again and soon

1101
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
Because

1102
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
Is that

1103
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Is what

1104
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,967
Is going to bring us a real economy

1105
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
When we can

1106
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,087
Find a way to bring culture to agriculture

1107
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,159
When we can bring security

1108
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
To the farmers who take care of the mat

1109
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,535
When we can buy directly from them

1110
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
They will

1111
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,911
Want to take care of nature

1112
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
And I know men

1113
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,007
Are doing that young people around

1114
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
The country and I'm thrilled by

1115
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
When you think about organic

1116
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
Today it's everywhere so it's actually

1117
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
A huge

1118
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:49,087
Value-add for businesses to use that term organic when they can

1119
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Cuz they can charge more money

1120
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
It's everywhere

1121
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,207
You can go to Costco and Walmart

1122
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
And Target and buy

1123
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,071
Organic gummy bears in organic salads

1124
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Inorganic

1125
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
Candy and organic

1126
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,959
Apple juice and whatever everything's organic

1127
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
Are you a part of that is connected to farm-to-table because that's been active option for people

1128
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Or or

1129
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:19,807
You know you go to any any fast food place and it will say farm fresh eggs will every egg comes

1130
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Ultimately from afar

1131
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
The question is what is that farm

1132
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
When you see like

1133
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
You know

1134
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
But when you see that everything is organic 2

1135
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Everything is

1136
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
Describe is farm-to-table or

1137
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
Is Parkview

1138
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Happy about that I'm proud of that

1139
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,423
I'm troubled

1140
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,727
But I'm very troubled about

1141
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
The labeling

1142
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Unpack

1143
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
What

1144
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
How people are

1145
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
Taking

1146
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
The values of our movement

1147
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
And

1148
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
Greenwashing

And we have to learn

1153
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
And the educated

1154
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
About what those words

1155
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
It's really me

1156
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255

1158
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
And who is certifying

1159
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
Where's it coming

1160
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Are the practices

1161
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Optispark

1162

Are they taking care of their farm work

1164
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Are they paying them

1165
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
A decent wage

1166
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
What about the packaging

1167
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
Is it all plastic

1168
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
What does

1169
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Fresh me

1170
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
For some places

1171
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
Could be 2 weeks old

1172
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Who do you trust

1173
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,463
Palace when you are

1174
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
A public figure

1175
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
You are associated with

1176
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
I really important

1177
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Movement

1178
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Inevitably you will be criticized

1179
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
There will be somebody who criticizes you

1180
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,823
And you receive your fair share of its Ms Posse don't you know this is

1181
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
What you talking about only apply

1182
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,199
Affluent people if people can afford to restaurants and

1183
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,247
People of the money for organic food

1184
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Do you

1185
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:01,439
Do you internalize that criticism do you think about it does it change how you think about what you do

1186
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Do you ignore it

1187
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
I don't believe

1188
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
In the Sun

1189
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
I don't believe in the Mist

1190
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
A fast food culture

1191
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
Food is precious

1192
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
Food is precious

1193
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
It can be affordable

1194
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,663
It can't be an expense

1195
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
If

1196
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
You know how to cook

1197
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
I mean I say

1198
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
That I can buy now

1199
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Organic chicken

1200
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,207
And I can make at least three meals out of it

1201
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,743
For a family of four

1202
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
Jose Andres says he can make six

1203
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
That's it for

1204
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
I know

1205
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
That we can make school lunch

1206
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:50,591
They can even fit into the minuscule budget of the USDA reimbursement

1207
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,919
If we know how to cook

1208
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
And we do not

1209
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Fast food

1210
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
If we buy

1211
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Food

1212
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
From

1213
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
People who are doing

1214
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
A bright

1215
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Enteric

1216
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
This

1217
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Ideas that I'm talking about

1218
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Delicious

1219
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,703
This is not hard to do

1220
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:22,079
This is about sitting with your friends and family

1221
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,175
Eating together and even cooking together

1222
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
Mississippi

1223
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,343
Human values that we forgot about this is

1224
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:37,439
Addressing the issue of loneliness

1225
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,815
This is addressing the issue of meaningless work

1226
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,607
We are

1227
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Cooking

1228
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
Something that makes other people happy

1229
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,567
We are falling in love with nature

1230
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,615
We are

1231
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,455
Seeing the trees turn color we are

1232
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,783
We're having an everyday pleasure of that

1233
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Where

1234
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:08,415
Engaging in the Beauty and the biodiversity

1235
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,511
Shane 10 colors of carrots

1236
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,143
It's kind of Sterling I cooked a purple and orange carrots last night

1237
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:23,007
Marvel Titan and that's

1238
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,567
That's what is

1239
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,407
Going to make the revolution

1240
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
If you will

1241
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,319
I call it a delicious Revolution but it's it's a pallet

1242
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Winning people over

1243
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
Stop by overthrowing

1244
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
Stop by separating we need the biodiversity of people

1245
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,655
Just like we need the biodiversity in nature

1246
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
To survive

1247
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:58,591
You you won the James Beard award think it was in 1990

1248
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,407
To your name the best chef in America

1249
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Which is

1250
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
Interesting because you are

1251
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:09,599
It in some ways you're not best known as a chef I mean obviously you're known as a chef what you're best known as

1252
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
The person behind a movement

1253
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
Do you

1254
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
Do you feel

1255
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:21,375
More proud of one than the other do you see yourself as a chef primarily or do you see yourself as a man

1256
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,423
My service is really good cook

1257
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,495
And I see myself as a great critic

1258
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
And taster

1259
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
I'm not

1260
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
Is chocolate a discectomy

1261
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
Stop saying that

1262
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
Because you are a chef

1263
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,831
Befriend a kitchen

1264
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,623
And if you find a kitchen

1265
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
You're a chef

1266
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
But for me chef

1267
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Goes into that

1268
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
You know it's raining

1269
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
Like Julia Child did

1270
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
You know when she

1271
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,751
Cook every single thing on her book and she brought such

1272
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
Wonderful instructions

1273
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
That's

1274
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
Not ever been

1275
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,199
Something that I've aspired to two

1276
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,063
When you when you think about the success of Chez Panisse

1277
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
You know weather

1278
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,159
And it's and it's interesting how we define success cuz it's not

1279
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
It's not a silly financials

1280
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Success of course people

1281
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,071
Done well in the band Live comfortable lives but

1282
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
It if it's not you know

1283
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
Billion dollar Corporation about the success of Japanese and then the the movement

1284
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,407
Which we didn't really talk a lot about that all of the shafts to kind of

1285
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Came out of that world

1286
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
2 and created their own

1287
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
World

1288
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
How much of your own personal success do you attribute to

1289
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,183
Just luck and Circumstance and how much do a tribute to

1290
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
Your skill and hard work and your determination

1291
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
Are you know

1292
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
I really consider

1293
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
Said it was good luck

1294
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
That I went to

1295
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
France

1296
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,983
When is Westphalia slow Food Nation

1297
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
That I had to help

1298
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,335
Tuesday at a young age

1299
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
2

1300
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,663
Understand

1301
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
That I had a passion

1302
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Events

1303
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
I didn't know

1304
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,135
How that would reveal itself I didn't reflect on it

1305
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
At the time

1306
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
But

1307
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
I just

1308
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
Absorbed

1309
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
What I

1310
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Cool

1311
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
Human values

1312
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
At that time

1313
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Pinotage

1314
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
Picture

1315
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
Eating together

1316
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,103
How people have done that since the beginning of time

1317
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,967
How's a four ways taking care of the laugh because that's where the food came

1318
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,271
I've always thought of food is precious

1319
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
So

1320
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
To you

1321
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
The biggest factors luck

1322
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
I guess there has been something termination

1323
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
People have asked me

1324
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,047
For one word that describes me

1325
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
I said determined

1326
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,399
Some people have said I'm compromised

1327
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm not quite that

1328
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
I'm very

1329
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
Determined

1330
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
To make something happen

1331
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
And usually

1332
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
One night

1333
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
Feel this way

1334
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,271
It happens

1335
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
Alice Waters

1336
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,855

1357
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,511
Hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's

1358
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,559
I know for how you built that

1359
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Intraday story starts in Dallas

1360
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:41,215
In 2003 when Pearson games was a teenager

1361
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:45,311
And wanted to make a change I played soccer throughout my life

1362
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
I always wore my hair and braids

1363
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:53,759
And then when I was going into Highschool I decided that I wanted to wear my hair straight take my braids out and wear my hair straight

1364
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
Not like many African American women

1365
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
Kirsten has highly textured hair

1366
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,439
But her hair is also very fine

1367
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,767
Straightened it would curl up as soon as I sweat

1368
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,119
Took a shower and never had it before

1369
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,959
So she went to a stylist and got the treatment and it first

1370
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Her hair looks

1371
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Great

1372
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:19,871
But then I was in geometry class and there was a guy behind me who said Pearson

1373
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
All of your hair is on my desk

1374
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,967
Yeah it was bad it was really bad

1375
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,319
Kirsten lost her hair all of it and it took a long time to grow back

1376
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
Now this happened again a few years later

1377
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,671
Which is why Pearson was

1378
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:39,071
Wary of new salon but in 2016 when she moved to Boston to go to Harvard Business School

1379
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
She really needed someone to do her hair

1380
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:47,519
One of my friends said that she was going to a girl at Drybar

1381
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,615
It is an Express Salon Service they only do blowouts

1382
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:55,455
You know I never seen anyone who would my type of hair walk out of there

1383
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:01,855
I was scared but I was like I don't really have an option right now but it turns out the stylist knew exactly what you were

1384
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:08,255
Who's doing the experience was just amazing I would honestly like an hour-and-a-half which had never happened to me in all the time

1385
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,887
Times have been going to the salon since I was a kid and her hair looked amazing so she was hooked

1386
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,471
Kirsten booked a weekly standing appointment but

1387
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
It didn't last

1388
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:25,151
She left is she like she moved out of state so Pearson got just one month of Salon Bliss

1389
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,479
That didn't seem fair but what it did seem like

1390
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:33,343
What's an opportunity for a demographic of women who spend so much time and money

1391
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,927
How much time you spend nine times more than any other group of people in our hair

1392
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
But the service is just

1393
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:43,327
Are subpar. What is there could be a chain of salon

1394
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:49,727
All over the country for people with highly textured hair weather was big or coarse or fine or

1395
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Haley curl

1396
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:57,151
Salon where they could get it styled into hours and they would leave looking great I really believe

1397
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:03,551
I didn't do this somebody else is going to do this it was just so obvious so glaringly obvious but

1398
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,927
Needed to be sure so Pearson pull together a few hundred dollars from her student loans

1399
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,071
Organized a one-day pop-up Salon in Boston she found three hairdressers to do the blowouts

1400
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:21,471
And to get the word out she emailed Black and Hispanic groups of local colleges the promo material that is not a zip file

1401
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
Finally a blow-dry experience for you and it had a picture of girl with light curly hair and Pierson also decided

1402
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
To serve green juice so her first client a little pampered I thought it was going to be pulling people's teeth

1403
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:40,671
To try this and it's sold out it's sold out now each blowout was just $10

1404
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
Colors and Pierson wondered if

1405
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
It was just a fluke

1406
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,815
To find out she needed to do more pop ups

1407
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Soap she went to Atlanta

1408
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:52,959
And she got into an incubator there one that was geared toward women of color

1409
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Ever next test she raised her price

1410
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
$50 a blowout

1411
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,151
And she said something other than green juice in Atlanta

1412
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:05,503
About the experience and the mimosas and those pop-ups were booked

1413
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Solid

1414
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,575
Not only did Kirsten make a profit

1415
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,951
Joseline clients asking what's the next one can I reserve a spot right now

1416
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,255
And at that moment pierce the new

1417
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,655
She was really onto something if we stay doing the number that we do not these pop-up will be making

1418
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:27,775
1.6 million in blow out the loan this year Pierceton is back in Dallas

1419
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:34,175
What she's hosting pop ups every other week and scouting locations for her first blowout salon

1420
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
And who does her hair now our Master stylist and educator she is my stylist name is India this

1421
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,695
Lucian whisper me a Creative Solutions that I went to a new city

1422
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:51,583
I could Google somebody and know someone do my hair this was literally for me

1423
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
